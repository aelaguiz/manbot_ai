Here are some writing samples from author John Doe:

"From 'Echoes of Tomorrow': The city was a labyrinth of stories, each street corner a gateway to another life. Anna walked through the crowded lanes, her thoughts a whirlwind of dreams and doubts. In the cacophony of the living city, she found a symphony of human resilience."

"From 'Whispers of Time': In the quiet hours of the twilight, Eleanor wandered through the corridors of her memories, each step echoing with the whispers of a luminous past. The walls, adorned with the shadows of her yesteryears, spoke in hushed tones of a life lived in the embrace of ephemeral joys and lingering sorrows."<|im_end|>

Tech Launch
We finally narrowed down the contractor for our tech launch. We also have a list of agencies and other contractors we're considering for future work. The initial tech launch is about minimal costs against the first alpha version of the game. I feel confident in our choice, as the contractor comes highly recommended from our gaming network.

New Hire
We made an opportunistic hire, Matt Schultz, an engineer with a robust background in gaming. He's worked for me at Zynga Poker then later at Cratejoy, he’s worked for Isao for 6 years at two different startups. This is a great pick up, nice work Isao. He starts October 1st.

Finance and Forecasting
Nathan has taken over finance. We're working on minimal forecasting to account for expenses like new hires and marketing. We're also looking ahead to future quarters. But I don't want us to pretend we have a level of predictability that we don’t. It’s more about understanding our constraints.

Sequencing and Planning
Tech launch in September, followed by a minimum viable playable product by November (not yet confirmed with the team). Then, it's soft launch focusing on retention, and finally, monetization. Each step influences the others.

Playable in mid september
Isao is heads down with his team, especially since Thomas is back from paternity leave. We’re aiming to get playable poker live by mid-September. 

Alignment
I'm pulling back on detailing every aspect of the product. I’m now focusing on high-level alignment. I’ve drafted a deck to help with this and will share it via video soon.

Poker Game Insight
I hosted a company poker game, and it’s clear that some key team members are shaky on core poker concepts. This is a double-edged sword. It's both an opportunity to educate and a challenge to our design process. The team is most successful when operating autonomously, and the current "guess and check" approach hinders that. Scott invented some cool games on the spot to test some of our ideas on how to teach poker in a fun way - they were in fact very fun. 

What’s on my mind

It feels like the plan for Tech launch is now coming together. Scott has been meeting with agencies and we’re getting a feel for what it’s going to look like.

Tuesday/Wednesday this week I realized that we’re not in a good place from a design standpoint. It felt very much like the team was “guessing and then checking” with Amir to see if it was right. That’s bad. They need to be operating autonomously towards an aligned vision we all share. I’ve had this in the past with them, and can feel its absence.

Towards that end I’ve taken a brief pause from the deep specification of all portions of the product and started building a high level “pitch deck”. I’ll probably be done today. I’ve already walked the team through some of it, and it’s been helpful. I’ll probably share this as a video to this audience next week.

Eric Seufert was a fantastic connection (thx Andrew). He helped us understand the phases of our launch a lot better. He also helped point us at specific tactics for driving users in the early phases that are helpful. I’m going to keep him in loop he may make a good advisor. 

Tech launch (9/15)
Can we attribute everything back
Does our funnel work are there any big dropoffs?

Soft launch
can we speak to an attractive audience?
can we get them to come back?
can we get them to pay and how does that effect everything?
Monetized launch
unit economics, etc
