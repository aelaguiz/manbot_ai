Eisenberg. You're goddamn right. Oh man, back in the saddle again. Live from Reno, Reno, the northern part of the United States, I'm your host, John McClendon. It is art, after all. Barbie is art. It's an art project. It's performance art. I bet you didn't know I have a degree in fine art. I have a bachelor's of fine art as well. Yes. Indeed I do. I'm going to get into the fine art that is the Barbie movie today, once we get past a few other things. I don't know why you guys are in for it today. So when you are twerking, when you're shimmying, you are literally releasing trauma, releasing stored emotions from your hips. When you're bending your knees, you're crouching on the floor, you're connecting to earth, you're connecting to the womb, you're restoring your energy. As I was doing this, I was healing myself through all of these generations of collective trauma. And I realized that twerking truly is a spiritual practice. I fell in love, I'm not going to say names, I fell in love with who I believe was the woman of my dreams at the time. I realize now it wasn't, but at the time, it was my first real love. We'd been together a couple of years and we'd booked a wedding. This was, I was about 23, 24, booked a wedding, all booked, all paid, all booked, all paid. A few days before my wedding, I caught me in bed with another man, and it just fucking broke me, shattered me. I had these bitches in both hands for six months, every day of the week. The truth is, I would've took her back, if you want me. My husband calls me every hour. Uh, yeah, I let the dogs out. That's good, baby. Yeah, Hadley peed and pooped. Well, that's good, baby. Talk to you in a little bit. Okay, love you. Okay, bye, baby. FaceTime's again. Hey, I'm ordering dinner. That's good, baby. Every time, I just keep amping him. That's good, baby. Leave me alone, baby. Body counts are more likely to cheat. Men with higher body counts are more likely to get divorced. Men with higher body counts are less likely to be satisfied in their marriages. That's the suite of results that we're seeing in these studies. It's also showing those things for women, but conveniently, red pill freaks are like, oh, women, women, women. It's not a mystery why. They don't like looking at evidence and coming to whatever decision the evidence shows. They have an idea preconceived, and then they cherry pick whatever facts they want to sometimes from the same study. It's also so boring. I'm like, who is watching this? You could watch a clip from three years ago, and it'll be the same conversation, and then tomorrow you'll watch a new episode, and it's the same thing. It's like they know one fact, and they just want to say it over and over and over again because they're not smart enough to hold multiple facts in their brain. My current husband, Tony, of eight years. This is my ex-husband that I divorced in 2003, and we all lived together. Now this is how it happened. Wait, wait, wait. What? What did you say? We all lived together. There have been studies where they've tracked who women are attracted to on and off birth control. It's completely different. And then when you get off birth control, you're not even attracted to the dude you're with because what you were looking for when you were on birth control. When you're on birth control, it adjusts your hormones so that you're looking for someone who's sweet and kind and who you take care of you with, like that, because your body thinks it's pregnant, so it's just looking for comfort. Then you get off birth control, and you're like, what kind of wimp-ass man am I married to? Because what you really wanted was an alpha male, but your hormones were so messed up, you didn't even know what you were trying, what you wanted to be with. A lot of women date emotionally unavailable men, that way they can point the finger, because they're not emotionally available either, and you don't have to do the labor of finding out what's going on with you when you date a man that's worse off than you. You know what I'm saying? That's it. It's like you're used to being the one that can't be called. You're used to being aloof. You're used to not being a\u2014so when you get with a man who got more red flags than you, it's easier to point at him and say, he's the problem, and you walk off and don't do no more work. And then you meet a nigga who actually is emotionally intelligent. You meet a dude that actually does communicate in real time when something is wrong. You meet a dude that actually does have boundaries, and now you look funny in the light. And I'm just saying, I don't know y'all personally, I'm only speaking from my experience. A lot of women be looking funny as fuck in the light, bruh. You guys have this kind of revenge fantasy, where it's like, oh, you won't date me now in your 20s, but in your 30s, just you wait. And it's like, okay, women in their 30s are doing fine. Women are much less likely, statistically, to be single in their 30s versus their 20s. The average age of marriage in terms of median is 29 for women. It's about 29. It depends on UK, Australia, Canada, US, but around 29, which means that half of women, median, so half of women are getting married at an age older than 29. No, we don't need y'all. We want y'all, but we don't need y'all. 20 years later, our black men, we want all y'all back. Because we love you, we see you kings, and most importantly, we need you. And most importantly, we need you. And most importantly, we need you. Like that? How are you guys? How are you? How is everyone today in the chat? Oh, yeah. That was Mac. What the fuck is his last name? I can't remember his name. Yeah, I got it. We're going to come back to that. Rollo called. He'd like his look back. I don't know this guy's name. I'll dig it up here for you in a second. But somebody made me aware of this dude. I guess he's a sort of a come up. But that's not what we're talking about today. We get to talk about some really important stuff, like the Barbie movie. How do you like that? By the way, that was one of many works of if you go and you check out my Twitter after today's show and you go and you look. When I made the announcement for the show, I also put in the sort of the cuts from this photo. It's like it's art, right? It's Barbie art. Isn't this artistic? So YouTube, please don't don't kick me off. Instagram, don't kick me off. I had nothing to do with this. This is work from I can't remember the chick's name. She's there. There's a feminist artist who's very famous for making photo minutes. And let's see, just set pieces like this. And I thought this was I actually have a few of these. I've used her stuff before on a couple of my old my old rational mail blog posts. And I was like, I got to go dig that back up. So I went back through. I went back through my posts from from gosh, as far back as like 2015, 2016. And I dug that up. And then I was like, I wonder if this chick has like a Pinterest or something like that. Oh boy, does she ever have a picture? So it's real interesting to me. Yeah. Yeah. How do you like that? So I hope my audio levels are good for you guys today. I have kind of tweaked a little bit the the the lovely dulcet sounds of my base. So I come across as a very more masculine, more testosterone filled gentleman. Oh, thank you for the cheese stacks cheese stacks. I'm going to dig in today into the new Barbie movie. And I apologize in advance because I didn't really want to do this. Of course, everybody's going to say that. Now, who am I bullshitting? Everybody wants to do this. This is this is the red meat for the red pill, right? That's what it is. Yeah, well, probably not just as nuts. Just saying. Lorena Bobbitt, go look her up. So that's the new hotness. Now, I wasn't even going to do this show about Barbie. I was trying to avoid this today. I was really, really trying to avoid the Barbie thing because I was going to let everybody else kind of like say their piece about it. And then my daughter, of all people, hits me up and text me. She's and I'll read you. I'm going to read you her text that she text me today. By the way, she's getting married in a couple weeks. She'll be married on August 3rd. So if I am out of commission or if you if I'm not as ever present online or whatever, it's because I'm doing daddy things, doing good husband, good daddy things. So like paying for a bloody expensive wedding. I will be. I will be kind of off and on. I'm going to try to do a midweek show because it seems like you guys really like the 30 minutes and less format. I also have new shorts coming up pretty soon. Dug out from all my archive of stuff. So many other people are using my material. Why don't I use it, too? Right. So yeah, I'm going to I'll be coming out with some shorts. I've got some some preplanned stuff. Did you guys like the studio? Did you guys like the the interview with interview debate interview? What a conversation. The conversation I had with with what is Sergio Solis from from Purple Pill podcast. People say, why do you waste your time with this stuff? Rollo, you need to be doing the big important stuff like the Barbie movie. How come you're not doing Barbie? You're really so Sergio instead because I issued a challenge back in November to anybody, any takers, anybody who wants to debate me, anybody debate me. There's no such thing as debate anymore. Let's just cut the shit. Anybody wants to sit across the table from me and tell me I'm full of shit or have some sort of conversation or if you want to have some back and forth, you know, the only people who have taken me up on it thus far. I guess you could say Richard Reeves has, although he didn't. I just got him on because I really wanted to have a conversation with Richard Reeves. More me kind of like pushing the issue. But we've had Gary, the numbers guy. He picked up the gauntlet. How come you guys won't pick up the gauntlet? It's not that hard. Everybody wants to come to Vegas, man. It's an awesome place. It's a tourist capital of the world for freak's sake. Sergio, Sergio Solis picked up the gauntlet. I am ashamed to say that other people who are higher profile schmucks have not picked up the gauntlet. I don't know if Zerkaa was actually a. We had Zerkaa on the on Access Vegas first and then we brought him in for, I guess, a debate between Mike and Mike and Mike and Zerkaa did the flat earth debate, which is now available. You can go pick it up on. You can get on Zerkaa's channel and you can get on Mike's channel. That's their thing. So I'm kind of trying to give them their props when they need it. But the Sergio versus me, that event, that conversation is on this channel. If you haven't seen it already, go check it out. And I've been doing some solo stuff as well. But we have a new studio where we can sort of get away with stuff like that. And I want to also right here right now, I want to thank my good friend Jibrizy, who is the one who owns that studio. He was on Access Vegas on Thursday and really added a lot, I think, to the conversation. I was pleasantly surprised because I was not expecting that from Jibrizy because when I met Jibrizy, he's much more soft spoken. He's much more sort of like he's a magician. He does like up close magic. He was doing like magic before the show and then after the show. And he does some really some shit that I have never seen before. And I thought it was really fantastic. But I just want to give big props to Jibrizy for helping us out. We have a studio where we can do small scale stuff there. And we're still doing the big scale stuff at Sticky Paws right now. For the time being, anyways, because I'm sure you guys are already aware that Miguel has made an announcement. Dollar Cost Crypto made the announcement that we are now going to be moving into a dedicated facility in Las Vegas. It took us a year to do it or thereabouts. And we have a large scale facility that we are going to be converting to studios so that we can do more stuff like so we can have more girls for Access Vegas because now it's sort of snowballed exponentially into something more than... I would tell you it's actually kind of come up faster than I thought it was. We're actually the number one podcast in Las Vegas right now. And I mean that not just in this niche, but like I mean in terms of like popularity and everything else, probably Jay Cutler, the bodybuilder, and maybe Bradley, they might give us a run for the money. But like right now inside of about a year, we've come up to be like one of the premier podcasts in Las Vegas right now. And I'm not ashamed to say so. So that's kind of an accomplishment for us. Hopefully we will end up becoming what I've always dreamed Las Vegas could be for us, which is the West Coast hub for this kind of stuff. If Myron and Fresh are the East Coast in Miami, then our intention was to be the West Coast hub for this stuff. So we have the Northern Command Center, which... which is here at Red One Studios in Reno, Nevada. And we will soon have Red One Studios in the Southern Command Center in Nevada, which will be in Las Vegas, as you know, but more as things develop, I'll make some more announcements, but we do have a property that we're looking at right now. And I think they've done the paperwork for it already. So that is in the works, at least to the point where Miguel's been comfortable to say, hey, this is what we're gonna be doing pretty soon. So more to come on that. I'm sure people are gonna hit me up and say, hey man, are you hiring? Not yet, don't jump the gun. We still have to like actually get things rolling here. I also want to thank Glenn Lawrence and his wife, Nicole, for being gracious hosts and helping me out. Glenn has been more or less my production guy. I've been a one-man show since forever. I'm still a one-man show when I'm here up in Reno, but that might change pretty soon. We're going to have a staff of some sorts down in Las Vegas. And we actually have a company car, we have Trigger. That's our Silver 300C, our Hemi C. And so I purchased a car when I was down in Vegas. Yes, I still have the Camaro, but I got the company car. It's really nice. And so we can sort of get around Vegas and take people around and sort of host people, such as Robert Kiyosaki, which by the way, that interview and that whole show is now available on my channel. I believe it's on Rich Dad Radio. And I think I'm pretty sure Mike has a copy of it. And there's also one on Access Vegas. You can see it pretty much everywhere. We're going to start separating, I think, Access Vegas from our other sort of our flagship shows pretty soon because I want it to be able to stand on its own. It's one thing for me to have like a quarter million subs, whereas Access Vegas is just coming up into like the four or 5,000 range. And I want to be able to do like exclusive stuff on Access Vegas, which we will be doing more and more of. I apologize for not getting sharp on the show. He canceled on us on the day of. He had something else going on. He kind of ferries himself back and forth between Los Angeles and Las Vegas. So that didn't work out, but we had Jibrizy fill in for him. And I thought it was a fair, I want to say that's probably one of my favorite shows that we did. The conversation was good. The girls were great. Jibrizy was fantastic. He added a lot more to it. He's kind of like, yeah, very outspoken and over the top in some cases, but maybe not to the Zerkaa level, but definitely a character. And I thought it was a really good show. So if you haven't checked that out, go check out the Access Vegas show. So let's see, that's the announcements. Thank you guys for paying attention to that. I have some other things I want to get into today, but before we do, I want to talk about our good, would you call Barbie Americana? I think she would be. Now, the reason why I was digging into this is first of all, my daughter texted me about the Barbie movie. And she had watched the movie in the theaters. I'm like, oh Christ, am I going to actually have to watch this? So I went and dug up a copy of it off of, well, I'm not going to say where I got it, but I skimmed through most of it. I mean, it's like very, let's just say the vomit inducing, but it just because it's simply bad filmmaking. And there's a lot to work with on this. So I figured, okay, I'll push off what I was going to talk about, which was the wall. But you know, it's funny. It almost dovetails into the Barbie thing too. So I want to dig into that. I also want to sort of pick up the idea of feminism in the 21st century versus where it's been since, let's say 1849 at Seneca Falls, which you probably heard me talk about on Access Vegas. I got into it with, I forget who the other girl was I was talking about. We were talking about feminism and they wanted to know what my opinion on feminism was. And I've done several shows here on this channel about feminism. And just to sort of give you a quick refresher for the pod class, there are no waves of feminism. And I really wish people would sort of wrap their heads around that because the reason why we cling to this idea that there are waves of feminism is because it works and it fits well with political ideologues or ideologies. So if you're a Republican, if you're the conservative, there's the good feminists, right? Those are the suffragettes. Those are the ones who got the right to vote in 1920, actually August 18th, 1920. And I have gone into great detail about how that happened. But if you look back to say the inception of what we now consider sort of modern feminism, it really started, and I want to say it's 1849 instead of the Seneca Falls Convention. Seneca Falls Convention, go look it up. It's 1849. Go do some history. Here's your history lesson class. So, and right around that time, it was sort of this article, there was this list of, you know, this is what we demand. This is what we want for women. And it really kind of sparked the Seneca Falls Convention started out here. There you go. Hello there, children. How's it going? Okay, so now we're classes in session. Right around that time, that's when what we can, I think, really consider. I mean, most gender studies like feminism, modern feminists would say that that's the inception of it. And then from about, let's just say 1850 until 1920, when women got the right to vote, you're looking at a 70 year span. That's like a lifetime for people, actually over a lifetime for the people who were at the convention to begin with. And during that time, you have to remember like voting rights and sort of, you know, gender relations. And there was no, you know, there wasn't, I don't even think there was, there wasn't latex prophylactics back then. There certainly wasn't any hormonal birth control back then. And so modern society was much different. So to say that, you know, that's the first wave, the suffragettes were the first wave, God only knows what the second wave was. And then the third wave was supposed to be, I don't know, the 1968 up to now. I don't even think most like feminist scholars can really point to what the waves of feminism were, but they're kind of a non-issue in the 21st century. Now, why am I giving you this buildup? Because the Barbie movie is pretty much feminist agitprop. And I'm going to explain to you what agitprop is, it's agitating propaganda. And that's pretty much what the entire gist of the Barbie movie is. And you say, well, this is a kid's movie. This is Mattel. This is from the 1950s and 90s. When is, I think I'm going to say it's like 1950s is when Barbie came out, 1960s. And we needed a, I don't know if you guys have seen this, but there's a really great, a really great documentary series. It's docutainment really, it's an entertaining document on Netflix and it's called The Toys That Made Us. And I love this shit. I'm sorry, I'm a dork this way, I guess. But like, they'll do like the Star Wars toys or they'll do like Transformers or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. And one of them was Barbie. They did G.I. Joe, by the way, and then they did Barbie. So there's G.I. Joe, which was fantastic. You know, it's the big G.I. Joes down to the little G.I. Joes in the 80s. And then they did Barbie. And Barbie was interesting because it was supposed to be like, you know, you had these dolls and then the dolls turned into something that was more fashionable. And then Barbie became sort of this cultural phenomenon really during the 60s, I want to say, if memory serves. And of course the original CEO and owner of the Barbie corporation was a woman, very much a feminist as well, or at least that's what they purported to be during the 60s, I want to say. And, you know, after a while, I think she got busted for like tax evasion or something like that. It goes through that in the documentary in the toys that made us. And so I thought it was kind of interesting to see and like remember like what I could of that part of the series, it's about an hour long, maybe 90 minutes. And then sort of weigh that against what I was, this hot garbage, you know, dumpster fire that is the Barbie movie. And when I saw, you guys probably have already seen this. I did a short by the way of why Margot Robey was chosen for the role of Barbie for this movie. And people got just up in arms. After having seen it and after seeing the reviews and yes, I saw the Ben Shapiro one. Yes, I saw the Brittany Venti one and Brittany Venti, you are quite wrong. Ben Shapiro, you're semi wrong, but not entirely. But I thought that after, you know, sort of weighing the toys that made us a documentary on Barbie and then versus what I was seeing in the criticism, oh, by the way, I should say that. Brittany Venti, all right. She's just like, it's apologetic, it's apologetics. Ben Shapiro, how can I twist this so it works for my ideological, you know, bet. The best review I have seen on the Barbie movie is critical drinker. Bravo, my friend. I don't have the applause loaded up here, but the Bravo. Well done, nine minutes of pure joy. Well done. If you want a really good review, like don't come here, go check out critical drinker and then come back here. Fan fricking tastic. And he goes into why it's nostalgia base. It's basically nostalgia bait is what it is. And I think that a lot of people who were seeing this for the first time, they wanted to see whether or not it was gonna be this cute movie. We're going to have a Barbie, right? Get Barbie, Ken Ryan Gosling for fuck's sake. He's Ken, right? Ryan got the Ryan Gosling who Eva Mendes said, I want to have his babies. Like why Ryan Gosling would be a play party to this is like beyond me, but I guess they needed a big name. And so they throw Ryan Gosling in there and the he's Ken. And then they've got Margot Robey, who is like when I see her on the screen and it's funny because when I see her and I see all the other actresses and by the way, it's pretty much like 90% like female in this. I mean, they're the men, like the Ken's in the movie sort of like, they're just sort of like fill in for the one main Ken that's there. You want to talk, if I could come up with one word for the Ken's, it will be superfluous, which by the way, Ben Shapiro actually uses. I'm surprised he actually used that word because apparently no one else but Rollo Tomassi uses the word superfluous for men. I wonder if perhaps Ben has seen a certain episode of a Dr. Phil. Yes, Margot Robey is mid very much so and looked very out of place in this, but I understand why she was cast for the role now. I'm going to dig into that here in just a bit, but before I do, I got to finish my thought about feminism and why feminism has been the same movement since 1849 all the way up to 2023 right now. It is not, there are no waves of feminism. There are no good parts of feminism. There are no really like bad parts of feminism either. It just is what it is. And it has always been about one thing. It's that thing is not equality because if it was about equality, it would be called equalism, not feminism, has nothing to do with equality. Feminism has only ever had anything to do with retribution and restitution. And I've got a quote for you here that I'm going to post here. In fact, I thought this was so important and I thought it was so clever. Yes, I wrote it, that I would throw it up here. Now, this is it. Feminism upholds two conflating propositions that womanhood is both a superpower and a disability. Knowing that it leaves their audience in perpetual confusion over their own worth. The end goal isn't liberation, it is submission. Now, what are women submitting to when it comes to feminism? We're going to get into that here, just toward the moment. That's the cherry on top for today. So, feminism is only about retribution and restitution. It has only ever been a hate movement or I shouldn't say that. It is a supremacism movement. It is a gender sex supremacism movement. It has only been about bringing women to power. That's all it has ever been about. It has never been about equality. It's never been about votes. And that is why I keep saying that it is, there are no waves of feminism. If you were to, there's a really great book. It's called the Feminist Bombers or something like that. I can go dig this up. There's actually several books on the early suffragettes of that time. And the suffragettes during, let's say, between the years of 1850 and 1920 were considered terrorists. They bombed police precincts. They bombed churches. They plotted political assassinations. They plotted the assassinations of their husbands. They were very racist back then. Well, certainly in the mid 1800s, they were. They wanted votes for white women. They didn't want votes for black men or black women during that time, at least. And then they progressively got up to 1920 and maybe they were like, all right. So, if you look at the history, if you go and you, and I realize it's hard to do because people don't have that interest. So, when we tell people like, we tell guys all the time, don't bother with college right now. Don't bother with that liberal arts degree or that history degree or whatever else. Just go forth and be an entrepreneur. You know what you sort of cut yourself out of? You cut yourself out of understanding or having the curiosity anyways to go back and look at the history of feminism, of the suffragettes, of modern militant feminism. I usually call the feminism of like, say the late 60s and early 70s. I kind of refer to that as the quote unquote, militant feminism, but feminism has only ever been about retribution and restitution. It has never been about equality. If it was, like I said, it would be called equalism. And by the way, it, you know, feminism upholds the idea, the radical idea that we can achieve equality by disadvantaging men and actively advantaging women. That's what it, that's what it really boils down to. It's not about equality because if it was, women would be marching on Washington, demanding the right to be drafted, to be mandatory conscription. We still have the selective service, you know, clause anyways for men today, 18 and above. Women do not have that. Women have more rights in the United States than men do. How? Because men have to put their dicks on the line. And I mean that literally. It doesn't matter if you consider yourself some other gender because you're a trans-am. It doesn't matter. As long as you are by a law, if you've got a penis, you have to sign up for selective services in the United States."}
