Who, like, come on, man, like, who gave Rollo Tomassi this, this God-tier status? Like, Rollo Tomassi don't get no hoes, man. Like, show me some hoes Rollo Tomassi pulled, you know what I'm saying? So, like, really, like, y'all acting like he really popping, pushing key, like, y'all acting like he came out the womb saying, pee! Hold on to your butts. I am live from Reno, Nevada. Yes, sorry, not Lake Tahoe. But I'll be getting up there tomorrow, hopefully. Yeah, today we're gonna be getting into some basics. Gotta go back to the beginning, back to the beginning again. Yeah, apparently you guys need a remedial lesson. All the haters, all the critics, anybody who wants to grift on the quote-unquote red pill, this show is for you today, friends. But first, I gotta get down to business. I think, broadly speaking, you've got, like, polyamorous relationships, and you've got, like, open relationships, where polyamorous is like, oh, I've got, like, three different girlfriends, and we all hang out, or sometimes even live together, or three boyfriends, whatever. And then you've got, like, open relationships, which is like, oh, you know, like, you can basically hook up with other people, and then you've got, like, your main relationship, and that's it. I think ours is probably somewhere in the middle of that, to where, like, we've got, like, long-term friends, some of them we hook up with, and that's kind of how we, yeah, it's a delicate dance that explodes every six months on itself. So it does explode, you guys fight over it? We fight over some things, yeah. I think it's mostly because a lot of people can't handle it, and they agree to something, and then they realize that we're way too cool, and then they get really obsessed, and they think that they can, like, get in there, and then it gets really dramatic. Have you figured it out? I feel like we figure out things more and more, like, when it comes to, like, what's a good person for us to hang out, and what's not a good person for us to hang out with, or, like, I probably have more opinions on, like, who he hangs out with, because he likes the fucking psychos. Yeah, so you like to surround... He likes the not, like, the crazy ones, like, the baby trap sort of women. That's the ones, and I don't like that, because that affects me. That affects your game, theoretically. Yeah, obviously, yeah. You like to surround yourself, like, in general, you've talked about, with crazy people. I say crazy, and I really shouldn't. It's a humorous way. They're very unstable. They can be unstable, but people that are very unique. Would you like to know more? Cheating is cheating. Linking up and hiding it from your partner is cheating. Entertaining, messaging, snapping, and texting someone behind your partner's back is cheating. Once you start hiding, deleting, or putting your phone on do not disturb, it's cheating. Stop watering down cheating, because the truth be told, it doesn't have to be physical. Disrespect and betrayal always start mentally before it turns physical. You're a cheater if you still want to watch porn and have variety digitally, but call yourself a loyal man. See, all you dudes in relationships are the biggest cowards, the biggest liars. You try to shame men who are at least honest that we want variety, and you call us not having self-control. But you sit up there, and you take a phone screen, and you touch yourself to it, and call yourself a man. Call yourself a loyal man. If you still need to watch women digitally, you're cheating. If you are a loyal man, and you claim you're loyal, you claim that you only want your girlfriend, why do you need to get off still watching other women? And if you're a woman, if your man watches porn, he wants variety. He's just lying. He just needs to get it off digitally, because he can't get it actually physically. If I said, okay, honey, I'm going to make you a promise. I know you want me to promise to be virtuous to you, and fidelitous. But I'm going to go further. I'm going to make a promise that I'm going to do everything in my power to train myself, my mind, my brain, to not look at other women. There's some people out there like, you can look at the menu. I'm like, you only look at the menu if you're hungry. And at some point, it's a gateway choice that's going to get you in trouble. And so, I just made a decision for myself. If you're looking, that's the first step. That's the antecedent to winding up in a spot that you don't want to find yourself. And so, I love this idea of the Nike opposite. Which is just like, have a little bit of common sense in a world that doesn't seem to have a lot to say, hey, let the choices lead. And if it can lead you where you don't want to be, maybe don't make the choice in the first place. Ain't nobody got time for that. If you're looking for a husband and you have any photographs of you by yourself in Dubai, take those mothers down immediately. Right now. We do not value your traveling experience. Women don't need to date to get better at dating. Women don't need to date lots of men to get better at relationships. But men do. Does that sound like a double standard? Yes, it's a double standard. Because we are weird and awkward and we're not approached by multiple women when we're growing up. But as a woman, by the time you go through puberty to the time you're 22, you are approached by more men than I will be approached by human beings for my entire life. Do you understand? Women are more calibrated than men. You don't need to date a bunch of dudes to get better at dating. We, as men, kind of do. We need experience with women. If we don't have experience with women, we end up like Steven Crowder, getting divorced by our wives who we lost our virginity to and not signing a prenup in the state of Texas because we're stupid. That's what ends up happening because you don't know what you're doing. Does that make sense? The most successful DJs are men. It doesn't make sense to me because in real life, the best DJs are clearly straight women. Because we're out here remixing men all the time. Right? Every time we break up with a man and send him off to his next relationship, we're like, Remix! It's Jason Moat with career ambition! Like, aw, here we go, it's Anthony, but he's a better communicator! Another one. This is how women support women. We just go around fixing each other's future husbands. Under the table, no commission. Just like, here's Brian, he's an active listener. Congrats on the engagement. I'm so happy for you two, you know? Men tripping and falling? Ick. Men being cold? Ick. This is Brian, and he's trying to decipher one question unknown to the male species. What is an ick? An ick is just like when a man does something cringey. For example, being happy. Like, men used to go to war and die. Why are you smiling? Despite being given countless examples, Brian cannot identify the common denominator that constitutes what makes an ick. As a result, he lives in constant fear of committing a heinous ick in front of the bitches. So what do you mean, ick list? It's a list of my icks. Like, one, men laughing. I feel like expressing joy is kind of girly. Two, him not having a good relationship with his mom. Three, him being too close with his mom. That's f***ing weird. No matter how hard he tries, Brian can't seem to make sense of it. But one thing he knows is that he's always at risk of committing an ick, no matter how dire the situation. Y'all run me all y'all s*** right now. Yeah, okay. I mean, hell nah. What you mean, hell nah? You ain't got no choice. Nobody's around to hear you scream for help. So? I don't do screaming. I'll leave that to the females. When we asked Emily why she broke up with Brian, even though he saved her from the mugger, she said, Brian jumping in front of a bullet for me was nice and all, but now he has a limp, and limping is a huge ick for me. It's a phenomenon that I feel like guys don't understand, but women do, and I think there's a good reason for it. But just the ick is this feeling of you're dating somebody, and then they do something, this obscure little thing, and then all of a sudden you lose all attraction to this person. Yeah, because you think about, can I see that every day for the rest of my life, or can I not? And the answer is no. And that thing is usually something, at the most, a minor faux pas. Like it's something like jumped over a puddle, and they look kind of funny. And it's different from a turnoff, because it's not like, oh yeah, they said a racial slur, that's an ick. It's like, no, that's not true. No, that's a red flag. Tell these bitches to go to hell. You're going to have more sex being in a relationship. This is something I've learned. Unless you're Dan Bilzerian, you're always going to have more sex being in a relationship than trying to go hunt for different women every week. Oh, in a man's standpoint, okay. Because I'm like, for women, I'm like, no, I have a lot more sex when I'm single. Right, that's sad. I do, obviously, I have sex when I'm in a relationship, and I f*** a lot. But it's still one of those, I just want to cuddle sometimes. So when I'm single, I go to your house with purpose. Possibilities are endless and I just feel really pretty. I'm holding out for someone who meets my standards, won't settle for anything less than perfect. I know what I want, and in two short years, I'm going to be 33. Who the hell will want me then? My ovaries are shrinking, I'm disgusting, and everyone feels bad for me. And I never get invited to dinner parties anymore. Things unfold when they're supposed to because everything happens for a reason. It'll happen for me when I'm not even looking. He'll just appear, and I'll just know, and he'll Oh, what? You think biological reality doesn't apply to you in your adorable cocoon of agelessness? What does? While you're just waiting around and focusing on you? Guess what? You're going to miss your f***ing window! Everything happens for a reason. You know I truly believe that. Yeah, you said that before. Oh my god, it does, though. Everything happens for a reason. What about the Haitian earthquake or cellulite on skinny women? Just say, hey universe, I'm ready. It'll happen when you least expect it. Well, I don't expect it at all now, so I guess it's right around the corner. Maybe you're putting out the wrong vibe. Maybe you're closed off to love. Let me tell you a secret. It's called the secret. Here's another secret. You're an asshole. Your negativity is a self-fulfilling prophecy. The reason things go well for me is cause of positivity. Well, and positive fertility always begins to atrophy when infantile fantasy eclipses true reality. It never once occurred to me that things won't work out perfectly. When God closes the door, you see, he opens a window. You realize that's a smaller opening, right? You used to be able to walk out the front door, now you have to climb out some slit, lay a jar window, somewhere possibly falling like five stories to your death. That is not an upgrade. And you know what else? There's nobody left! I'm all alone! I fucking hate you! You're such an arrogant cunt! You're so stupid! You can't let someone else take care of yourself. You can't let someone else take care of yourself. You can't let someone else take care of yourself. Cause life is good. I haven't used that in so long. That's Kate Micucci. Her real name is Micucci, by the way. And I forget the blonde girl's name. Forgive me. It's Garfunkel and Oates. That's their comedy schtick. By the way, that video, which I will most definitely probably have to take out in post. That has been around for a while. I used that as a I think it was an intro video for one of my posts. Which, by the way, I'm going to get to today. I've been sort of recovering from this last week. But I've been going over some of my older material because I think a lot of people really are wanting to get back to the I know, we should cover it, huh? We should actually cover this. Do a cover version of that. The thing is, if a guy does that or if women did that now, this would not be as funny. Remember, this was from, I want to say that I pulled this from, what, 2014? This is a long time ago, man. We're talking like almost six, almost nine years ago. Back then, yeah, she was on Big Bang Theory. You are correct. That's Kate Micucci. By the way, both of them have been, they're both actresses. They're both comedians. But they're like a comedy duo. I don't know if they're still together. I kind of hope they are. They've done a lot of other stuff, too. If you look them up, it's Garfunkel and Oates. But I remember using that video when I was trying to describe the epiphany phase. That's really part of what I wanted to get into today a little bit. I wanted to sort of recover and go back and do some remedial stuff here because I'm seeing a lot of people throwing out this bullshit about those red pill guys. Those red pill guys always say this. Those red pill guys always say that. And we're getting to the point where I have, let me pull this out of here, we've kind of crossed the Rubicon here. I think we are finally here in August. As I said, we're coming up, what is today? Today's the 13th. We're almost to the middle of August right now. And if you, I've been saying this for most of the year back on December 31st, as a matter of fact, of last year on the Rule Zero end of year show. I said you will not recognize the Manosphere by August of this year. And I was right. I would say that we are most definitely, it's not what it used to be and I think a lot of the people who wanted to be a part of it are now abandoning it because it's like a used toy that they don't want anymore or they don't want the stink of the red pill or the stink of the Manosphere touching them anymore. I mean, we can make the case for sort of the red pill women of the Manosphere. That's an easy observation. There's a lot of other people who have decided that they are going to take it upon themselves to turn a buck or become a grifter based on anti-red pill. How can we debunk this? Again, this is kind of par for the course. If my voice sounds a little off today, I'm a little bit under the weather. I know Glenn Lawrence actually had to go to the hospital on Friday, was it Friday? No, Saturday. Saturday, it was Friday night, Saturday morning. Yeah, and exactly. I mean, people can say, we can blame it on the Tates, we can blame it on whoever. The fundamental basis... the fundamental groundwork of what we call the red pill, what the Manusphere was and what it has become, let's say like within the last maybe two years. I think maybe August is actually a pretty significant month because I can remember when Myron and Fresh first had to go through their first sort of scandal, but like they had to go through their first difficulties, the first difficulties, let's just say as a show, being attacked unceremoniously, let's just say by ABBA and Preach back then. And of course they wanted to bring them down, they wanted to crush them, they wanted to destroy their show, they wanted to curse them personally. They couldn't do so by grabbing anything out of their past and so therefore they manufactured it. Same thing, I mean, baseless accusations that Myron had some sort of secret pregnancy and had to get the girl to like abort the child and all this other shit. And had to, but then Fresh, of course, I'll tell you what's funny is about the whole thing about that situation is nobody really remembers what the details were that you can go back and watch the whole thing that broke down. And when Allende came and like confronted them at the door, at the apartment door and all this stuff that was going on. And then I think it was Fresh who had like issued some sort of challenge to Preach saying he wanted to fight Preach. That's the only part of that whole clusterfuck that anybody ever remembers anymore was the fight. When are they gonna fight? It's been two years, when are we gonna set this up? When is that gonna finally happen? Anybody remember when Tate was supposed to fight Logan Paul, like before they got arrested? Well, I guess that flew out the window. That was sort of a fart in the wind, wasn't it? But people remember that stuff when it's something salacious as that, when they want something to go. Yeah, I'm sure. I mean, if you guys want me to get into that, I've already gone into the whole thing. If you want to see how we're spider. Yeah, the fight that never happened. Thank you for that, Sam Whiskey, much appreciated. I'll get into that a little bit more. I can get into a little bit more detail. The reason why I threw on the interview from Lex Friedman and Melina and I guess Destiny, Steve, I guess since we're all on a first name basis now, so I guess I can call you Steve, right? That was from about eight months ago, I wanna say. So that would have been like right around the beginning of the year, like January. So long before all this bullshit came down. And if you wanna know anything about the Britney eventy shit, the Lawrence Southern stuff, you can go and look. I did this back on, I think it was on Wednesday, did a full thing. And I also did a show, really good show, I think with Thor, Red Pill Thor, and Troy Francis and myself. And at the end, Tiffany Fox decided to pay us a visit too. So you can go and check that out if you'd like to. And I'll get into that a little bit. I think that that's kind of part and parcel of what's going on right now. Let's just say, it's a template. It's a methodology, I think. And I was digging into some old school stuff, but I was digging into some old school tactics kind of stuff. Like I've read, let's see, what was it? Robert Greene's 33, that's like the art of war, with 33 laws of war, 33 strategies for war. And then I was kind of flitting through that book and then there's a mention of Rules for Radicals by Saul Alinsky. And I've heard Hotep Jesus mentioned on a few, yeah, this Hotep Jesus, on a few occasions, Saul Alinsky. And I have heard, I think he was talking to Tim Pool about it. And he got into some of the details. And I read Rules for Radicals a long time ago, like long before I was even doing any of this stuff. And I think people kind of just sort of dismissed it because it was 1971 when it came out and it was meant to be for like sort of like late 60s, early 70s, Black Panthers, the militant movements of the late 60s for all during the civil rights movement, all that kind of stuff. And Saul Alinsky wrote this book. I wanna say it was published in 1971. He ended up dying from a heart attack in 1972. And I think people kind of blew it off because it wasn't really, it wasn't really, I wanna say relevant, or I think it was like not, it was before its time. But in the internet age, I think the Rules for Radicals list, which I'll go over here in a little bit is, I think it's pretty relevant today or it's become more relevant as a result of say our social media, because now we can disseminate propaganda and now we can crush people and involve ourselves in the politics of personal destruction to such, we've made it easy. We've made it too easy. Back in 1971, it was more difficult because you had to sort of like agitate your base and get them to do what you wanted them to. Now people will do it willingly because they're part of this sort of globalized internet culture. So I'm gonna dig into that just a little bit. I'm working on it. I'm working on it. I'm working on it. Trust me. I'm talking to Dr. Red Pill, Dr. O's from Turkey right now. So trust me, it is in the works. So just to let you know. Yeah, I mean, I can throw this out there if you wanna check it out. I've got rules for radicals, by the way, again, it's old material, but I think it's somewhat relevant. And maybe I'll just throw this up here real quickly because I have the rules right here. Okay, these are the rules for radicals. I pulled this from the wiki page. These are kind of like, this is the, let's say the condensed version of all this. These are all chapters and stuff. So you can go through it. If there is a, let's see, precedent. If there's a precedent, there's your vocabulary word today. There's a precedent for 12 rules for life. This may, maybe this should have been it, right? Okay, these are the rules. Now these are meant to affect like social change during the time of the 60s and the 70s, right? So, but I think they're still relevant today. And this is, you'll see this tactic employed by a lot of people, okay? And not just, you know, stupid internet, you know, forums and, you know, brigading and all that good shit. It's, you can put this in the terms of politics now, but you can see the progression here. So first one is that power is not what you have, but what the enemy thinks you have, okay? That's, I think that's pretty much a part of like straight out of, you know, art of war. Certainly 33 strategies of war. That's easy. I think that pretty much is self-explanatory too. Never go outside the expertise of your people. And the reason for that is because you can only expect so much for like, so much base knowledge, let's just say, from the people who are like part of your movement or part of your tribe or whatever else, okay? Number three, whenever possible, go outside of the expertise of the enemy, okay? Meaning if you can dig up something outside of what it is that they know, and by the way, the red pill is a very, like intersexual dynamics is so broad, as I've said in the past, it's so broad that, let's see if I can get there real quick. Oh, okay. It's such a broad topic that there's no real elevator pitch for it. So getting, you know, like if you're an expert in let's say anthropology, or you're an expert in like evolutionary biology, or something that's sort of like ancillary or it's like adjacent to quote unquote red pill awareness, it's not hard to go outside of that experience, particularly when your enemy doesn't know what they're talking about in the first place and has decided that they're going to use the red pill as their own personal brand. All right, number four, make the enemy live up to its own book of rules, okay? So if there's some sort of book of ethics, this is easy, you know, when it comes to conservative politics, when it comes to religion, if you make the enemy live by their own set of rules where you are ignoring those rules and pointing those things out, or trying to imagine the worst of your enemies, or trying to attack them under false pretenses, it's much easier to respond to them if you, if they have to live by a certain code of ethics or their grift or their, I should say their brand is dependent on a particular rule set. Now five, this is I think where we're at right here. Ridicule is man's most potent weapon. There's no defense, it is almost impossible to counterattack ridicule. Also, it infuriates the opposition who then react to your advantage. And I think this is probably where we're at right now, I think in the manusphere and the red pill in terms of where the attacks are coming from. And then six, a good tactic is one your people enjoy, which of course is ridicule. So if you can get into something where people really can feel good about attacking something that they think is like sort of this visible, easily identifiable enemy, anything that makes people feel something about belonging and participating in this is always gonna be, it's always gonna be a good fit, let's just say. Seven, a tactic that drags on too long becomes a drag. So knowing when to quit what you're doing, knowing when to stop, this is straight out of 48 Laws of Power, is always an advantage because what happens is if it looks as if you are pounding on somebody long enough, then it looks bad on you, you look obsessed. I get this quite a bit, I should say, because I think a lot of people think that I have, I have it in for Jordan Peterson or Michaela Peterson. So if I have, if there's a fault in my using them as examples for greater topics, for bigger scaled topics, the problem is, is that people think that if you go back to the same well all the time that you have, there must be something wrong with you, this must be your personal catharsis. Who hurt you? Tell us about your background. Have you ever fell in love? You know, that kind of stuff. And that's really, so harping on it too long makes it seem like you have sort of an obsession with that person. Let's see, keep the pressure, keep the pressure on, that kind of goes back to also the ridicule side of things. Nine, the threat is usually more terrifying than the thing itself. 10, the major premise for tactics is the development of operations that will maintain a constant pressure upon the opposition. C, tactic number eight. So that's really, it's built, everything that is built around sort of a scam, around a hoax, around a, you know, anything that's sort of a brigading, that kind of stuff. If you can mobilize your base, the premise for those attacks is always about maintaining that constant pressure. 11, if you push a negative hard and deep enough, it will break through into its counterside. This is based on the principle that every positive has its negative. Again, going back to the dragging it on too long. You don't want to drag it on so long that it looks bad on you. Next, the price of a successful attack is a constructive alternative. And I thought this was kind of insightful because remember this is being written at the time of like civil rights movements. This is, you know, how can we motivate our base? How can we radicalize, you know, our base? How can we lift them up? How can we attack the establishment? And I think what's interesting is like, I think a lot of people think that, I mean, there's a, I think it's a, it's a conservative talking point, I'm not really sure. But the idea is like, what do you do the day after the rebellion succeeds? Do you have a plan for that? Anarchy! Okay, what do you do once you have achieved that state? How do you reorganize society? And nine times out of 10, people get so wrapped up in the radicalization of what they've been doing and get so caught up in the thrill of the mob and the thrill of the hunt and the thrill of the keeping the pressure on that once that is over, they don't know what to do. They don't have a constructive alternative afterwards. So planning all the way through, I guess would be, you know, one of the 48 laws of power as well. And then pick the target, freeze it, personalize it and polarize it. And again, every single one of these articles or these rules for radicals, you can see exemplified and not just in online communities that come after me, but like go after other people as well, go after other content creators as well. And this forms a pattern. So right now, as I said before, I think we're probably in the ridicule stage right there. So ridicule is a man's most potent weapon. I think you guys can see that. And keeping the pressure on. And again, it's enjoyable. As I said, remember, it's the, you know, what is it? A good tactic is one that your people enjoy. So if it gives them a certain amount of joy to send you a death threat, or if it gives people a certain amount of joy to, you know, just shit post on Twitter or shit post in the chat, which I'm sure we're probably gonna get a bunch of, right, very soon, right? We get spammed. And you gotta remember, there's a type of personality that really gets off on that. And they don't have much control over their own life, but they really enjoy participating in what they think is activism, right? They think that, and right now, that's really what the push against the red pill is, because for so long, people have been having these, well, for so long, for the last like 18 months, two years, people have really made their personal brands based on something like, at least in my case, 20 years of having gone through all this, building from the old PUA days up through what we call the red pill now, what we call the manosphere right now. You gotta remember that the manosphere is not something like those communities came up with. It was something that feminists came up with. The name, the title, manosphere, was actually feminists trying to throw shade at the, really, what we would call the male self-improvement sphere. And that covered a lot. And so the manosphere got that name, not as a result of guys calling it that, but as a result of feminists calling that. You can trace that back all the way back to like 2012, I think, so. And I don't think very many people are going to be able to remember that, much less care to remember that, but especially when it's something that is, if you can throw shade at somebody, if you can throw hate at somebody, and it makes other people feel good about themselves for having sort of agreed and,"}
