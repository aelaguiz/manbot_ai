I only have one rule. Everyone fights, no one quits. You don't do your job, I'll shoot you. You get me? We get you, sir! Welcome to the Roughnecks. Bad Cats Roughnecks! Sorry I was busy smack-talking. Smack-talking Michael Sartain. There's two things we disagree about on a musical form. This is Cowboys. This is my Niners today. People are like, what do you mean, your Niners? Well, we're both kind of Vegas fans, so we kind of both have to get behind the Raiders, but we'll do the hotdogs. Alright, long live the red pill, right? Apparently it's all over for us. It's curtains for you guys! There's no more red pill! Some blue-pilled, blue-haired, squirrel-bait, douche-mazel. Very much so. I'd like to take off echo cancellation. Soda bourbon. Bourbon soda? That can be cut. Don't need to tell anybody I said soda bourbon, but I cannot do TikTok reaction videos dead sober, or my face is just going to be... Hey, bought me tickets to fly to Romania to go discuss business. She's a nice lady. She was in Germany. I said, hey, Romania's not so far away. Come visit. You kind of remind me of a human shark. I don't know if it's your eyes or something. That was it. Do you think you made any mistakes in that venture? I don't think so. There's a rumor online that we hooked up or we slept together or something. That didn't happen. That's a story. Translation, gentlemen. This idea on the internet of mansplaining. Let me mansplain for you about mansplaining really quick. If a man believes somebody else is worthy of his time, a man will sit and will explain the problem and the solution to them in detail. I'm not sure I'd take advice from this guy, but... We expect the other man to say, hey, I know that part. Skip ahead. Hey, I already know this part. Skip ahead for me. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Women will never do that. So they will sit through the entire lecture from start to finish and the man will say, well, I guess she didn't know any of that. But he will say, I invested all that time giving her this knowledge, giving her this information. I love the piano music in the back of these. You must love it. And women are sitting there saying, I would only have explained it that way to a child. You must think I am a child. But most men who explain in that depth are trying to give you love and connection. And most women are spitting back in their faces because they have no idea why he's spending the time doing this. It's because he likes you. Do you see a difference between the female brain and the male brain? Is there a bit? Massive. Really? I published a study on 46,000 scans looking at male brains versus female brains. And it's like we're not even the same species. Really? Their brains are so much busier than male brains. And generally, they're healthier because they have more estrogen and they don't do quite the toxic things that male brains do. Is that because they can develop a consequence? Things like that? They can understand consequence more than male brain, you know, the development of that thing is all part of it. So the prefrontal cortex, right? Their prefrontal cortex was way more active, right? Which actually why females make good leaders, their executive brain, their frontal lobes, much more active than male brains. So they're often better for thought, decision making, and collaboration and empathy. And guys struggle with that. And then if you hit a lot of soccer balls with your head, you really struggle with it. Not conscious. Are you meant to cry it openly? That's what palace is for science. Today is going to be a very, we're going to emphasize science. Because they feel like they're losers. They're supposed to be strong and take care of the family and be all of that. I would say this too. There's a lot of women that doesn't really know how to handle men that are crying. In a lot of relationships, especially in the States, it's a lot of the case that women always think that they're correct in arguments and that man is always wrong because women are more emotionally mature and we're always going to get away. It has been like a little bit like that. It's of course not like all the time that case. But whenever a man has a problem, a lot of women don't really take it too seriously because they're just supposed to solve it alone. The only thing they get told to is to just suppress. While a lot of women are getting raised in society, which is really good that we can do more things, we can take more space and stuff. But I think a lot of men has been pretty left behind. And I think the reason why Andrew Tate became so popular is because he made these men feel seen. He could say things like go to the gym and get your shit together, which is good advice. But then there was a lot of really toxic advice that he was saying as well, like how to handle relationships, how to see women, what's important, you know, those sort of things. And those are not good at all. But just because he's already made these men feel seen in a place where they just felt really alone, they got someone to look up to. But it is a really toxic person. There should be other manly role models that isn't this toxic. Yeah, just like a manly role model that like isn't red pilled. When I got married, I was telling these bitches to go to hell. As a perfectionist, like go to my side of the closet and everything's organized and color coded. I was a little more casual. Slop. Casual. Things on the ground. He had this like ingrained belief that I was disrespecting him by throwing my clothes on the ground. So you're not taking care of any of your crap. That's discourteous. But I liked them on the floor. We call it kind of a dumb fight though, because after many, many years, I finally realized that this was stupid. I was creating separateness. I was creating disconnect. Why should I even care? I just remembered one day snapping my fingers and saying, I love how my wife chooses to organize her stuff in piles. Do you like that flex at the end? High performance people on the planet are not alpha males. Explain that. Okay. They're a beta males. Okay. Elon Musk, Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, Zuckerberg all have one thing in common. There's going to be a quiz at the end of this intro video. You have to tell me what the theme is, children. They're introverts. They're not alpha males. If you had to sacrifice one of the two lives, would it be you or your partner? Him. My partner's life. Partner. Obviously my partner. Your sacrifice. Yeah. I think I'd sacrifice my partner. My life. Of course, I was sacrificing myself. I'd sacrifice my... I think I would sacrifice my... Yourself? Yeah. It would be mine. I'll kill myself over it. It's okay. It's fine. You or your partner? Me. Me. Basically as a man, it's always us. Selling emotional talent. I mean, when you go on and you're in your car and you say, well, I had sex with three men. That was back in 2018, by the way. Go ahead. All right, let me hear it. No man, no woman can outrun their past. Hey, y'all. All it does is makes you tired when it catches up with you. So what you did in 2018, people still know about it in 2023. So this notion that you said, well, it happened five years ago. It happened 10 years ago. People have what they call the internet. People have what they call memory. Bauer has finally been exonerated. The accusations, they came from a woman named Lindsay Hill. She accused Bauer of choking and punching her. Then he was cut by the Dodgers. And now he plays in the Japanese league. Now, while we get into Bauer here, I'm going to get into this a little bit later. But recall, if you will, the best decision making and healthier brains part of this intro. Proven innocent now. These are texts from the woman. Net worth is 51 mil. Bitch, you better secure the bag. Need daddy to choke me out. Being an absolute whore to try to get in on is 51 million. How do I steal his money? I will fake abuse. No one will fact check me on that. And then women say there aren't any high value men out there for me. Well, why do you think so? This kind of smear campaign character assassination is the reason that young men are not seeking out young women. And it's the reason that young women say there are no men worth talking to or marrying out there. There is a breakdown, not just of marriage, but of relationships. And that stems from a lot of the false me too. False accusations have gone out. And so men are saying it's not worth the risk. And then women are saying, where am I going to find a man with a seven figure income who's six foot two? Well, you know, he doesn't want to be false. Are more likely to be married? My name. Men with higher status are more likely to have more offspring. Men with higher status are generally partnered with more desirable mates. And women typically say they desire a high status mate around the world. If you ask people what they want in a partner, women usually say they want someone who's educated, has money, and has the usual signs that they are high status. Science. I'm reading this year's Oxford Handbook of Human Mating and Schmidt's review of the role of status in male attractiveness is astounding. The effects of status on men's mating success appear all over the world, seemingly regardless of where the men got their status. Like gangs, prisons, and let's see, federal penitentiaries. It doesn't have to be wealth. It could be popularity, political power, various skills, sports, musical ability, education. It doesn't seem to matter why you're up. It just matters that you're up. I'm often asked for content that's more directed at helping. Bro, you're not often asked for anything. Men, here's practical advice. If you're struggling with women, start building yourself into a man that other people can look up to. Easier said than done, but pick a ladder and climb. Get educated, get stronger, get richer, get popular, get good at anything, and maybe stop whinging about what women want on the internet. Ah, I see. Stop whinging. Everybody, you're all whinging just so you guys knew that. Whinging. Would that be like whining? Would that be like bitching? Would that be like moaning? You know what's funny is a good gentleman by the name of Trevor Bauer did exactly that thing. He made himself into a high-value guy. You know what? He's playing in the Japanese Baseball League right now. Macklemore. I'm going to pop some tags. Yeah. Okay. We will return to Macklemore later on in today's show. Hello there, children. How's it going? Hey, welcome to the pod class today. I don't know if you guys knew this or not, but the red pill is officially dead. We just actually just, you know, put the shovel, the last bits of dirt on it apparently because destiny said so. And I think it's kind of funny. It was like this is how my life works. I go to Las Vegas. I go to Mike's. I did Topgolf. Thank you very much. And my swing is fucking great. Thank you very much. From years of practice. And so we go and do that. We go to where we were at MGM. We went to Hakkasan. It was a fantastic birthday party. The food was fantastic. The company was fantastic. It was myself, a lot of his staff from MOA, from Men of Action. And Kylie, his girlfriend, was there. And lots of the whole cast of characters. You got to remember that Mike has like women who will fly in from out of town just to simply be a part of his birthday because it's an event. They always make it an event. Last year it was about, it was supposed to be about, let's see, cheerleading. This year it was supposed to be about Barbie and Ken, and we failed miserably at that. Actually, I'm kind of glad we did because I just didn't want to dress up as Ken. I got this whole nice outfit, like the whole furry coat and everything, but I'm going to tell you guys this. Here, I'm going to shit all over Etsy right now. No, don't buy anything from Etsy. Never buy anything from Etsy. It's supposed to be this handcrafted bullshit. It's not. It's really not. It's just cheap Chinese drop shipping that you will never get. If you want something from Etsy, don't have a time frame. If you want it in a month, maybe you'll get it. If you want it in three months, you'll probably get it, more or less. And if you're hot on Etsy and all that other crap, hey, more power to you. I hope you guys can do it. I have had some good experiences on Etsy, but more often than not, I'm just... Or what's funny is I'll order something off of Etsy, and I'll forget about it. And then literally four months later, it shows up in the shipping, and I'm like, oh, yeah. It's like Christmas. Suddenly you get this gift in the mail that you actually ordered for yourself, and it's been so long that you forgot about it. Yeah, don't order from Etsy. Sorry to say. Even eBay is a little... It just depends on what you're getting. But so anyways, we did this. And so I swear to you, this is the way this went down. Somebody sent me that recent video from... I think it was Destiny talking shit about the red pill. It's like, oh, the red pill's done. It's only just going to be Myron and Fresh, and that's it. It begins and ends with Myron and Fresh. And hey, I do endorse them, still do. But dude, literally, I think, what, two hours? Not even that, maybe an hour and a half after I watched this, and I'm just like, I'm writing notes thinking, you know, what am I going to do for the Sunday show? And I get a call from my good friend, Andrew Kibbe. Andrew Kibbe. Andrew Kibbe is sort of the Kenyan version of me. He, I believe, I hope I'm saying this right. I think he has dual citizenship. I'm fairly certain. He's also, he's an American citizen, and he's a Kenyan citizen. And he and I have had sort of an off and on, you know, back and forth. I did his show almost, what, 2022, I think it was. He lives in Texas, but he goes back and forth to Kenya quite a bit. And during the interview that we had, and this, like I said, this almost is coming up like maybe a year, year and a half ago, he asked me if I wanted to go to Kenya because I have a very large following of people in Kenya. My brothers, my brothers, they call me MZ, M-Z-E-E, it's a term of respect. I don't know if it's like ustedes for Spanish, but it's, it's, it's a term of endearment for older, wiser men. Thank you very much. I'll take the wiser part. But so I have a lot of how, how this happened. I don't know. But I have an army of a Kenyan army that has been waiting for their general to their admiral, their, their, their colonel to show up. And I had, this is literally an hour and a half, maybe two hours after I'm watching the destiny, like the red pills dead video. And Andrew Key bases, my brother, we're going to Kenya. And I was like, what? And so he starts to tell me he's got this whole trip planned and he really wants me to go. And it's the second, well, it's right around Thanksgiving week. So I'm going to, I'm going to have to have an early or a late Thanksgiving with my family because I will be on a plane to Dubai. I want to say it's the 23rd of the November. Well, again, don't quote me on the logistics just yet, but right around that time, I think a second to the second to the last week of November, I'll be on a plane to Dubai. We are going to spend two days in Dubai. I'm going to be speaking at a particular event of some sorts. I'm not really sure. I, I don't want to get too deep in the details right now because there's a lot of people who don't want to see this happen. So I can't really like elaborate too much, but as we get closer to it, I'll make sure that, trust me, I will, I will, I will definitely put this on blast. And then, so I've got that. And then two days in Dubai from there, we go to Kenya, we go to Nairobi and, and I've got, he's, he has a whole sort of list. I'm on tour basically, courtesy of, of Andrew Kibbe. And I've got to say, man, and my brother, I'm very, very thankful to you for this. I've been meaning to do this for quite some time. Thank you. Thank you very much. So it's still standard caveats apply today. I'm happy to read these as much as I can. But I'm going to stay, I think I'm going to stick to doing a $20 and above, but here in the beginning, let's just go get, get things out of the protocol, protocol, right? Any chance of coming to the UK? I don't know. Depends. I would like to, but it just sort of depends on who wants me there. If it's for Pearl, trust me, that ain't happening. But if there's something, if there's other shows over that, I'm not sure where I would go in the UK. I would like to maybe do a, maybe a convention or maybe just do a talk. I'm happy to do that. Also I have to also inform you guys that, so I, anyways, let me just finish up my, my, my Kenyan adventure here. I have, I will be doing a series of talks, I believe while I'm in Kenya, I'm going to be doing a tour. I'll be in Kenya for 10 days. And then if I can work this out, I don't know, this is just me spitballing here, but I would very much like to go to Turkey, Istanbul on the way back, because I have a lot of, a lot of, I have a, I have a Turkish army that's waiting for me there as well, who've been really wanting me to show up in Istanbul and just do a talk. So if I can work it out with Dr. Oz, who you guys probably know, I've interviewed him before. He's kind of the Turkish version of Andrew Kibbe, so it's like, it seems like there's like these, these guys who are like the, the, the, I don't know, the Turkish and the Kenyan and there's probably some others that they're like, they're the Red Pill ambassadors, let's just say for their particular country. And most definitely Dr. Oz, also known as Dr. Red Pill, he's a, he's the cosmetic surgeon that I did the interview with, with Myron Fresh in Miami about a year ago, May of the of last year. So he's going to be coming out to Philadelphia. I think he's coming to the States in November. So I'm going to see if I can work something out with him. If it does, if it works, it does. If not, I am planning. Yes, I know, Doug. OK, Istanbul is Constantinople. OK, we got that out of the way. Thank you. That's an earworm. Stop it. I assume every time I say Istanbul, like, you know, they might be giants, comes into my head. Sorry. Yes, I am a nerd just like you. Where's the Mountain Dew? Yeah, there you go. Where are the Cheetos? You know where those sound drops come from. You must know the song Istanbul, not Constantinople. All right. Anyways, yeah. Oh, yes, that's that's what I'm talking about. Dr. Oz, we call him Dr. Oz. He might even be in the in the chat today, too. I know he watches this as well. So if I can make that happen on the way back, I will. If not, this is sort of motivated me to to go on tour for twenty twenty four, assuming the entire world isn't set on fire because, you know, Hamas has decided to go bomb Israel. And Lord knows what will happen during the twenty twenty four election cycle. So everybody hunker down and put on your big boy britches and hold on to your butts because it's it's a coming. But you won't have to worry about that one more. James, this is not James Sexton. James Sexton, you do not spam my my put you in timeout. I know damn well James Sexton would not spam my chat. So go fuck yourself. Whoever you are saying the same spam, do random spam, dude, anonymous spam or the unknown spammer you should put on, you know, you should do you should get it for it for your next icon, unknown spammer. What you should do is get like the unknown comment who used to put like a paper bag over his head. That should be you, the unknown spammer. Although I think we kind of know. Anyway, so Kenya, yeah, and I get the confirmation for this and we do all the logistics literally an hour and a half after I'm told that the red pill is dead. So I figured there's my theme for today's show, because apparently it's it's it's all over. But the singing and the shouting right now for the red pill, it's it's doomsday. Let me explain something to you, dude, if that's what you are. The red pill is not dead and it's not going anywhere because you can't kill the idea, you can't kill an idea, you can't you can't stop the as I would you like me to repeat this for you again? You can take role of Tomasi away. You can take Myron Gaines. You can take everybody who you think is, quote unquote, red pill, which you don't even know who the fuck you're talking about. But let's just say for sake of argument, you can remove everybody from the from the manosphere and the red pill. And you know what? It's still here because it's an idea that whose time has come, my friend, like it or not, you can take your emotionalism and shove it up your ass. And you know who's going to shove it up your ass? Empiricism, because that's where we're headed right now. And we talk about science. You want to know why I'm going to really lay into the science, this this concerted effort to muddy the waters when it comes to the statistics and it comes to the research and it comes to the the stats and the numbers and everything else. And boy, have I got a real meal for you guys today. And it ain't red meat. It's like a real nuts and bolts today. So there's been this concerted effort on the part of people like Destiny on this part of of people like Macklemore here on the part of Alex from date psych on the part for of who is it? It's not yet. So, yeah, Will Costello, I always get mixed up between Alex and Will. Sorry, Alex. Will Costello, let's see, a Ph.D. candidate for Dr. David Buss. And even Dr. David Buss right now, dude, you really need to check yourself and you need to check your students here because a lot of the integrity and a lot of the reputation you built yourself upon is being systematically dismantled. And by the time you want to leave, I like David Buss. Don't get me wrong. But David, if you're ever going to watch if you're ever watching this and I don't know why you would be, but I'll tell you this right now, if you're if you are watching this, your legacy is being systematically killed by a thousand paper cuts and it's being killed by influencers who don't have your best interests in mind. Yeah, there you go. And you get to go be banned as well. There you go. Trust me, I've got Sammy in there. Sammy, are you in? Yes, Sammy's in today, too. People are asking me why I've got the Niners hat on today. Well, I'll explain to you why Niners are playing against Dallas Cowboys today, I think. I think. Yes, it is true, I bet I bet I bet Mike Sartain 20 bucks that my Niners are going to beat his Cowboys today because he's the Texas guy. So I'm going with it. It's my that's my that's my story and I'm sticking to it. So there you go. Yeah. OK, well, I, I think going to see here's the thing is I don't think a lot of these these hacks really realize that the red pill is an idea whose time has come. The red pill, the man is fear, whatever, whatever the hell you want to call it. I wish we could have better men who weren't red pill. I wish we could have betas with a side of Alpha. You know that when I'm looking at Destiny's cuckold dress wife, whatever you want to call her, talking about how she really hopes that guys could just sort of really become more emotionally secure, emotional, emotional, emotional damage. Right. God, OK, you want to make me emotional damage. Yeah, I'm going to dig into that today, too. And it's not just going to be the happiness, you know, speech all over again, either, because I think it's time we really sort of settle the score when it comes to like emotionalism versus empiricism, because really that's what we're kind of dealing with, I think, in the man is fear right now. It's not that a lot of these hacks have anything to say about the researchers. That's they really can't. So the only way an emotionalist can confront red pill empiricism is by muddying the waters, by coming up and creating their own bullshit so that it and then standardizing and canonizing it and making it something that everybody's going to repeat over and over and over again. It's just like Goebbels, right? Repeat a lie often enough and it becomes truth. And that's really the hope here. And yes, am I calling them that say Germans from the late 1930s? Yes, absolutely. I am. Absolutely. I am because they're just it's just the digital 21st century version of it. Really, let's how how can we distort this? How can we change this? We're so emotionally invested in this. We're so our egos are so emotionally invested in these belief sets that are confronted, confounded, contradicted. Convert, controverted, whatever, by red pill empiricism that we've got to make up our own bullshit to cover the fact that we have no counter argument for anything, so we can't find any data, we can't find any research, we can't find any stats, we can't find any evolutionary psychology, biology. We can't we can't we can't refute the anthropology, the sociology, the endocrinology, the the you know, the the microbiology that the red pill points at, we just simply point fingers. That's all we do. You can connect the dots if you're you know, we hold the mirror up and you have to look in the mirror. And just because you don't want to look in the mirror does not mean that it's not there. You can stick your head in the sand for as long as you'd like. But instead of sticking your head in the sand, you're going to make up your own bullshit and then standardize and say, well, they were wrong about this and this is why it's right. And we're just going to go and pull some new data out of our ass and do a Twitter poll and tell everybody that this is like the settled science. Get the fuck out of here. You want to know why we have a crisis of replication in not just psychology, but the hard sciences as well. STEM fields as well. It's not just one particular field of study. It's if I have like I don't necessarily agree with this statement that people shouldn't go to college. I think a well-rounded, well-educated person should be able to speak on a great many different topics. I think education is its own reward. But just like marriage, I don't like the way we do it now. It's good to be intelligent. It's good to be a renaissance man. It's good to be able to to be an artist and a writer and a poet and a mathematician and a coder and all of that at once. Right. Was it Asimov? It was either Asimov or who said this, but specialization is for ants that Asimov, maybe it was Asimov. I know it sure as hell wasn't Heinlein. He wouldn't say shit like that. Isaac Asimov, right? I'm pretty sure that was right about that, but it's the it's the specialization thing. So when I'm talking about, OK, I get that dumb ass. Yeah, I got it. You know what, though, if you have intelligence, if you have a good biological genetic predisposition for intelligence, it doesn't make a goddamn bit of difference if you're not educated, if you haven't learned history, mathematics, if you don't know any of this, it doesn't just magically appear in your fucking brain, dude. You actually have to go and educate yourself on subjects and maximize the potential, the genetic potential in your mind. I know the difference. So don't go, go fuck off with that shit, I get it, I me of all people, hell, would you like me to explain something to you here, I have used the four laws of genetic or behavioral genetics so many times on this show, you should know better than that, you get an F for today, go to the back of the class. Anyways, getting back to the point, yeah, I understand that, and I think that in the past. Yes, a polymath, thank you, that's actually that was there's your vocabulary word for the day, gentlemen, where did it go? There you go. Thank you. You go, Dr. D head, go to the front of the class, you get an A plus today. Yeah, I know, I get that. I understand there's a difference, but there's also you can take the most smartest guy in the world, and if he doesn't know, if you don't have a particular base of knowledge, if you haven't been educated, you can be you can have an IQ of one hundred and sixty and you're not going to magically know astrophysics, you're not going to know calculus, you're not going to know trigonometry unless you take those fucking classes. Got it. Yeah, I get it. But you're never going to go to those classes if everybody keeps telling you, why would you go to college? You could just go and be an entrepreneur today. You just you know that intelligence isn't actually a."}
