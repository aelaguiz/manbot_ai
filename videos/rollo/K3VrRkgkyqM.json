I don't want to Talk over each other No, no I actually would like That very much We do shows All over Las Vegas And we go to LA And we do shows there And it's just really fun We moved here actually During Corona Because everything Was closed in LA And we got an offer At Area 15 So that's where Pontos moved to Vegas We've been here for two years So I still feel like I'm kind of new Ish We were gonna have you guys Sit next to me and Rolo And confuse the audience Can we do that next time?

Okay, hold on Can we go back really quick? Or share one What? What kind of twins? You come from single zygote Monozygotic You're identical We're identical Yeah It's a fancier way to say it We're I think I'm attracted to A certain kind of energy That Ava's attracted to But I've never been Attracted to the same person As Ava Never The qualities The qualities are very similar But physically completely different Really? If I find someone Interesting There's difference between Finding them interesting Versus finding them good looking And attractive Or yeah If I'm attracted to you I want to date you I want to be with you If you're good looking Then yeah, okay, moving on Yeah But if I'm attracted to you I want to get to know you more Does that make sense? Do you want someone To bring your animal out? Right Yeah I like primal attraction You guys have all Obviously swapped on a date, right? I'm sorry No, we can't Why not? Because it would just It would just feel so weird Like I don't know What about like a first date? I mean, what would I talk To someone Ava's on a date with? Like what would I talk to them about? I'd be like I don't care to get to know you Like And then they would think That I'm a bitch They would feel it right away Because your energy's different If someone's talking to Ava And they want to talk to Ava They want to talk to Ava They don't want to talk to me And vice versa Like I feel like If Loretta's dating someone And I'm there It'd be like, alright Ava's being a bitch But do you guys go for Like the same kind of guy? Like physically? Mentally? No Looks wise They're completely different I mean energy is energy But like what kind of guy I know it sounds so kooky But like energy Yes, energy Very similar Extremely kooky More kooky Like Same type of music or movies? Yeah, there you go Yeah, same type of everything Pretty much Same type of everything? Yeah Yeah, generally speaking Do you guys have the same relationships With your parents? The both of you? Yes, we love our parents Our parents have been married forever Have they ever Do they ever mix you guys up? Never Never, okay No No point? They really birthed us I mean, no They know how to tell the difference When I We're identical twins And when Mimi I can tell her energy's different than yours So yeah, I can see it now Oh, really? See, now you're kooky Now you're kooky I'm absolutely making that up None of that is real Making that up No, no, no We're identical twins When Mimi twins We get a little overwhelmed So I feel like Michael, if you met us separately If you spent like 30 minutes with me And then the next day 30 minutes with Loretta You'd be like, oh, I know Instantly, right away Got it, okay You guys are totally different Meeting twins together is overwhelming So you're not alone on that I'm overwhelmed I can't write We're the same exact thing Now, dudes ever coming on to both of you? Yeah, but we kind of like just look at them And laugh and walk away So it's never been It's never been an issue You guys have never competed for the same dude Or anything like that No, what am I gonna compete for? Yeah, that sounds good At least he has two chances with you guys You're funny But it doesn't work out with one You're also on different sides of the room Mic, mic, mic Eat the mic, eat the mic Okay, Laura, what Netflix documentaries Are you directing now? I wish Are you in anything coming up?

Complicated Legally separated Legally separated Okay, she lost a microphone I thought she had one, I guess not All right, go ahead What's your relationship status? I don't like to talk about my relationship status Okay, sounds good I know what that means And go ahead, Avery Twice divorced, currently complicated, but happy Complicated, that means there is a penis involved Let's go ahead with Miguel Single Single, go ahead I'm single Does your girlfriend know you're single? Not yet No, okay, cool Legally separated Corey, single? But looking, ladies Okay, let me ask you something Have your relationships ever, do they coincide? Yes, occasionally they have It's easier for us when they do Because if I'm dating someone and Loretta is not Or vice versa, it's annoying You get lonely So Loretta breaks up with someone and you're like I gotta break up with you, sorry Do you guys ever force the other one to break up with the boyfriend? No, that's ridiculous You guys ever force the other one to leave their boyfriend because you don't like him? No, no, no, no, no I want her to be happy If she's happy, I'm happy You know he's not good for you, girl It's not Seeing that's ridiculous, it's like, no Loretta wants to do what she wants to do, that's fine My sisters are bitches There we go Well, I mean, it depends on the day Do you guys live together? Yes, right now We didn't always live together We're actually from New York We live in Vegas now We know you're from New York, we can tell They're from Long Island I'm just messing with you Oh my God, you're funny We can tell you're from New York Oh, I can tell I'm from New York, they're from Long Island, like I'm from Long Island Yes, and by the way, your strip club should not be called Capone's Alibi It should be called Capone's Conviction Because it's a speakeasy Everybody, let's go ahead Oh, single You're single? Yeah Okay, what's it like dating in Los Angeles? You live in Los Angeles now Yes, I'm not even dating anybody I'm like so single, protecting my peace, it's so boring Yeah, no, don't do it Stay toxic, it's boring I did it for three years, that's when you make the most moves in your life Yeah, I'm at peace But you're like all over the place though, you do a lot of shoots and you're like, you're very mobile At least from what I see on your Instagram Yeah, so I'm always busy, I'm never bored Nice, I like that Busy but never bored Okay, your relationship status is married, you two are both married, right? Well, I mean, I'm married to a man but... I'm still accepting applications for a girlfriend, but definitely take it in the man department. Oh nice, that's good. It started off bad, but then it ended really well. We're going to have to put our boots together and see who's bigger. My question is, if Jodi was ambidextrous, would she be? I love blondes, so why not? Just kidding. But you already said you made that announcement as soon as I walked in. Do you see me sitting with my back to her? Yes, it's hard. Okay, I'm trying not to look at her. She's got a heart on and she's trying to hide it from you, Jodi. I see that. And you're married? You've been married? Happily married, yes. Okay, now here's the thing. You met your husband on a dating app, correct? Yes, I did. Can you talk about that real quick? Yeah. Because most people on dating apps, the women that I see, they're either trying to get people on their OnlyFans, or they're just fucking weird as shit. But you seem to be a normal one that found you a man. I am. What app? Bumble. Bumble? Really? That's right. You had to write him first. Yes, I believe. Yeah, that's how it works. So I actually had been single for about four or five years, kind of dating. And then actually one of my good girlfriends, she had been on Bumble for a minute and met her guy. And I saw her that day and she was like, you need to go on Bumble, there's some great guys on there. So that night I went on there and I actually found my husband. And I set up dates with like four other guys. And Neil, my husband, is the one that actually picked up the phone and called me. And I was like, okay, guys nowadays don't do that. They're like texting. That's so annoying. Set a date. Yeah, it's so annoying. So he picked up the phone, called me, and then the next night we went out and then we've been together ever since. What a great testimony for like buffers, right? I mean, you're right. It sounds like ChristianMingle.com. Exactly. I hear this all the time. It's like women will say, well, I see all these guys we meet on like Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, whatever it is. But it would be so refreshing if I had a guy that actually called me up or actually I met live in person. And that would put them in a different frame of mind, I think. It does. I think it's knowing that if they're going to make the effort to pick up the phone and call you, they're going to make an effort for you in their life. It's almost like he's old school. He is old school. But that's what I needed in my life. I wasn't attracted to... How long did you until you knew that you were going to give this guy a shot? I mean, as soon as I saw him, I knew I was like, okay, he's probably the one. Really? Oh, wow. Like I said, I... Because you'd already talked to him on the phone? Correct. Okay. And you knew he was an attorney. Well, I knew somebody was coming into my life. And he had to match like my vibration with everything I had going on. And at the time I had a business. I had a protein bar business. So I was working a lot and I knew he worked a lot. So I was like, okay, I need somebody that's going to be on that same page. Because I've dated a lot of... What should I say? I don't want to say losers. You can say losers. In my earlier years, I attracted to a lot of bodybuilder guys. Let me just tell you about bodybuilders. They want to sell steroids and cocaine and manager-only fans while at the same time being a music producer and selling crypto and an NFT course. Do you know my ex-husband? And peptides. I'm sorry. I'm sorry about all the hate. I'm sorry, guys. I'm getting hate on here. I apologize. He's called Sugar Mama. And I was that Sugar Mama for many years. And I was like, I'm not going to do this shit anymore. You know what I mean? So now it's nice because we meet in the middle. I'm doing a lot of different things. And obviously he's successful on his own. So together I think that's how we... No more Jim Bro. Well, somebody... You have a different story on how you met your husband. Let her use this one. You have a different story on how you met your husband. How did you meet your husband? Okay. So I met him in the strip club. Normally it's not the traditional Tinder. You were managing a strip club. I was doing a feature there. And I met him. He's like, I want to meet her. I want to meet her. So he told the host, here's five grand if she comes and talks to me. So I came and sat down next to him. And I told him before I took the five grand. He's like, are you a gold digger? I'm like, I'm not. But are you a babe digger? So a babe digger is someone that pays for, you know. So I told him, are you a babe digger? He's like, no. I'm like, okay. So I took the five grand. I'm like, no strings attached, right? He's like, no strings attached. We just sit down and talk. So I thought he was cute. He was my type. He was nerdy. I like nerdy guys. That's like my type. So basically I gave him my number. Okay. So then, like, I wait a couple days. I don't call him. Don't text him. He's like, why didn't you call me or text you? And I was like, you said no strings attached. I'm like, now who's the gold digger now? I'm like, you look like a babe digger. I'm like, you look like you want something else with this. He's like, let me fly you out to Austin, Texas. This and that. So he flies me out to Austin, Texas. We hang out. We chill and stuff like that. And a week later, he proposes. A week. Oh, shit. So this guy likes to wait. Now, the next obvious question is, had you slept with him by the time he proposed? Yes. You okay? I mean, come on. Okay. No, no, no. That's why I propose. We don't have this fucking show lined up. We have girls, especially sometimes on Fresh and Fit, girls like, oh, yeah, he bought me a car. And then, like, a couple months later, I slept with him. I'm like, God dang. Wow. All right, go ahead. So he had only been with, like, seven women before. Yeah. So let's just say, like. Like a Nina Agdal. Only been with, like, five. Okay. So let's just say I, like, slept with him. Like, he, like, he was kind of, like, amazed. It took him two minutes, everything. Two minutes. Yeah, two minutes. That's a long time. Two minutes. That's a short time. Yeah, a short time. It was a short time. Yeah, my girlfriend says that's a great time. Yeah. Yes. So he proposed to me. Oh, now he admits he has one. Yeah, he's like, I'm your house. You know, now I'm his little housewife and stuff. In Austin? In Austin, right. Okay. Love Austin. So then he tells me things get serious, and he tells me, he's like, I need you to stop, like, going to the strip club. And I was like, okay, I'll only go to the strip club, like, four times a week. That leaves you Friday, Saturday, Sunday. Me and you hang out. He's like, no, I need you to stop going more. I'm like, I need you to stop going more, because he said he wasn't a strip club guy, but he went like five times a week, so. In Austin? In Austin. So I used to manage a strip club in Austin. Oh, you did? Yeah. Did you go to the Red Roses? No. So the Red Rose. There's a Yellow Rose. I didn't work at the Yellow Rose, but I was at Sugar's Cabaret, P.T.'s, Palazzo, and Expose, which is now called Red Rose. Oh, yeah, Palazzo's was the one. Yeah. So basically, like, me and him, we were, like, going to strip clubs, having the time of our life, having fun. So it's time for me to meet his family. His family doesn't know we're married. They don't know anything. His mom's a strict Christian lady. Like, Bible-thumper Christian. She meets me. The first thing she says is, she's seducing my son with her body. She's not a Christian! That's the first thing she says? Yeah, she says, you're seducing my son with your body. Okay. Keep going. This is the best story I've ever heard. So she's, like, freaking out and stuff like that. She's like, she's not the one for you. You know, she's just, I don't like her. I don't like that she's on OnlyFans. In front of you? She's not my boy. Can I ask you real quick, on your OnlyFans, what have you done on your OnlyFans? At this point? At this point, by then, me and her son were making our own videos on OnlyFans. Had you done videos with anyone else before this? No, before this. This is the first time you did guy-girl on there? Because you got married? Yeah, because I got married. Totally normal, right? We were cool with that. Guy-girl, married. That's a new way to make money. Alright, go ahead. Rollo's starting his O.F. here pretty soon. Go ahead. Keep going. I mean, for a nerd, her son, for a nerd that grew up in a Christian household, her son was pretty creative with the ideas he came up with for OnlyFans. Okay, and then where was the demise in this relationship? The demise in this relationship was basically, like, he couldn't take the industry anymore. I'm like, but you met me in this industry. He's like, I can't take it. I can't take guys staring at you. He would look through my phone. Just real quick, you weren't sleeping with anyone else? I wasn't sleeping with anyone else. Do girls count? No, girls absolutely don't count. In fact, just to let you guys know, if you sleep with a woman, that actually drops your body count by one. You know that? You know that, Jessie? If you sleep with a girl, your body count goes down. I'm in the negatives. Yes, that's what I'm saying. That's a rule here on this show. Keep going. Okay, so if girls don't count, then no. I wasn't sleeping with anyone else. Okay. So he can take it where he got, like, all upset. Did you sleep with girls with him? Yeah. What? And he couldn't take it? He didn't like seeing me with other girls, even. What? Wow. Okay, keep going. You've got to find yourself a man who does love that. I hope I'll wake up this relationship. Oh, there you go. And then what happened? So right now you guys have separated? Yeah, we have separated. Okay, all right. Legally. Legally. Legally separated. So everybody's got a shot. So everyone's got a shot right now. Okay, beautiful. Do you need a divorce attorney? I know a really great one. Who? James Sexton. All right, cool. You guys can share that one, too, if you want to. All right, beautiful. Anything else? All right, cool. Oh, I've got a super check. I've got a super check. Okay, go ahead. All right. Let me go back here. Let's see. Okay, so this is from Mal MC. Thanks for your $10 super check. Are the women comfortable with any slightly above average guy or not? What are you doing to get the guy you honestly want? For example, I want to have his baby type of guy. I want a nerd. You want a nerd? What was the question? I don't understand. Can we try this again? One more time, guys. Put it in grammarly so we can understand the question. Number one. Number two, can the two of you get close to that thing? Okay, beautiful. And this is new OnlyFans content right here. Monica, you don't have an O-F. Do you? You have an O-F? Okay, cool. Well, she can teach you.

Will you ever be a ride-or-die girl for a guy? And if so, what is he like? Like, what's your ideal guy? My name's not Avery Rider for nothing. Oh, damn. Okay, all right. I understand. I've been a ride-or-die for every guy I've ever been with. They've just never been a ride-or-die for me. Got it. Got it. I've been a ride-or-die for every guy I've ever been with, except for the one that I'm currently with. He is the first time I've ever actually felt taken care of emotionally. Oh, nice. That's awesome. Nice. And, Lindsey, your favorite type of guy is seven of them. Or more. In a box. In a box. In a box. No, I'm in the box. Oh, my God. All right. This is too easy. Dig in a box. What's that Marilyn Monroe quote? Find a man that can cook, make you laugh, get in bed, and make sure the three don't meet each other. That's exactly how it works. I've got a super chat here. Ms. Sartang, great job. That's how we have threesomes. There you go. Great job on playing with fire tonight. It looks like you and Destiny are cool with each other. Thumbs up. All right, cool. That was interesting. We didn't get into the thing you and I thought we were going to talk about. Nobody got into that. Yeah, because all they do is filibuster. There was a lot. There was some filibustering. And just screw around and split hairs until the end of the show. There was some filibustering going on. That's for sure. All right, cool. So let's do this. And we're going to do a couple things. I do want to do the delusional calculator again because it went so well. But we're not going to do that yet. I'll call it out. The first thing I want to do here, first of all, for you guys, because so many of you are new to this, is I want to know, because I saw a TikTok. I'm just going to be honest. I'm stealing some content here. I saw a TikTok where a guy was asking girls what behavior that was toxic that they really enjoyed. And none of the girls had any problems answering this question. That they enjoyed. They thought was that they secretly \u2013 toxic behavior that they secretly liked. So it could be toxic behavior, first off, from your male partner or female partner, and then toxic behavior maybe that you do. Definitely, I've been with girls before who obviously started arguments completely just to start, just to see if I would react. That would be considered toxic behavior. Do the twins, do you guys have any toxic behavior that you like for men? Anything? Narcissism. You like it? Yeah. Honestly, it sounds ridiculous. But I don't know. There's just that level of confidence and talent and power and energy that comes along with that. You kind of just have to find a balance. But there's a difference between walking in the room and being confident, and walking in the room and just being an asshole. Yeah. Like, if you could stand tall and be confident or stand tall and just think you're better than everybody and just be like, you're a bitch, you suck. That's interesting. That's kind of hot sometimes, honestly. No, it's super hot when a guy just knows who he is and can own his shit. Like, that can approach both of us and talk and not say something stupid. Yeah. Like that. I feel like that's the kind of guy that we would be with. Like someone that can speak \u2013 They're not intimidated by you. Yeah. Well, I mean, all of us. You guys are gorgeous. All of you. Two of you at once is intimidating. A guy that understands his own value to women. Exactly. Yeah. I don't know if that necessarily makes him a narcissist, but have you dated an actual narcissist? Absolutely. That doesn't care about your feelings? No, but also exacerbates his \u2013 Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Narcissistic personality maybe towards, like, everybody else. Not trades towards us. No, like what you were saying, like ride or die, being, like, emotionally safe or whatever. Like, I would never choose to sleep in the same bed with someone that I did not feel safe with. That would never happen. Fair enough. Ever. Oh, I've been like, do you want to call an Uber or should I? Oh, wow. Because I don't do sleepovers, but thanks. No, but no, no, no. Because Michael, you guys were talking about a ride or die, but I would never be with somebody that I didn't feel that way about and vice versa. Well, you're best friends. Yeah, they got to be my best \u2013 like, we're partners. Like, we got to \u2013 What you were saying about your husband, like that. Is there any other toxic behavior that men have done that you like? Right when I meet someone and they tell me all the things that they want to do. I think \u2013 To you? Yeah. Like life plans. Either or. If they oversell themselves. Either or. Either or. Either or. Just like when \u2013 again, it goes with the confidence. When someone knows what they want, they know who they are and they're not afraid to own it. I want to say that's really toxic. What are like the toxic things? For example, one of them was like, I like it when my man yells at me. No. Then you go yell at somebody else. No, no, no. I'm not saying that's you. What were the toxic things? You're like, I like it when a guy's confident and has goals. Very toxic. Those are the toxic qualities I like. I like it when my man communicates with me properly and tells me his feelings. So toxic. What a funny asshole. He's completely honest with me and expresses his feelings in an honest and healthy way. Piece of shit. Piece of shit. Laura, what's something toxic that men do? Honestly, I'll probably end up marrying like my stalker. Like I like \u2013 I like to know that a man's like \u2013 He really loves me. Yeah. You hear that, gentlemen? That he's not like so on my ass like where I know every day that he's looking at my shit and watching me, but eventually throughout the relationship I catch on to like, oh shit, you've been watching me, where I should be creeped out. I kind of like it. Yeah. I like that. I like that show with you. You want that type of guy. A little bit. A little bit. So funny thing is if you guys ever read Why Women Have Sex by David Buston and Sidney Messon, one of the things they talk about is one of the chapters is actually on stalking. And the reason why men \u2013"}
