I only have one rule. Everyone fights, no one quits. You don't do your job, I'll shoot you. Do you get me? We get you, sir! Welcome to the Roughnecks. Roughnecks, Roughnecks. Yes, I found dog tags. Thank you very much for all of the suggestions. You know, I should probably use the, should probably use the room of control. Because that's what I'm going to do today. Just a little bit. Getting back into it. I'm back in the command chair. Deep in the nuclear fallout bunker. Somewhere in Reno, Nevada. I am proud to say, back in Reno one more time. Red One Studios, the Northern Command Center. See if I can get my Pat Campbell voice going today. Yup, yup, yup, yup. Alright, hang on. I'm just going to switch. Because I know damn well that the stream is going to crash today at some point. Women are the ones that find monogamy boring, not men. If you say to men, you could have the same sex, pretty much do the same thing every single time, three times a week for the rest of your life with this person. Most men would go, alright, sounds right to me. If you said that to a woman, she would go, you are kidding me. But this is what's happening. Women get bored way quicker than men. And they do so because our orgasm is far more complicated than yours. I mean, intercourse is usually the main event for most couples' sex. Intercourse is like the big bit that everyone aims for, right? And that's great for men because intercourse very successfully stimulates, you know, wants to rub in and out of something. The vagina does a great job. Fabulous. For women, the clitoris is outside, but some of it is inside. Because the clitoris isn't that little tip, by the way. It looks like a wishbone. Imagine a wishbone. And the tip of the clitoris is at the top and then it goes down the sides of the legs, right? That's the clitoris. Amazing. 10 centimeters long. So because the clitoris is on the outside of the vagina, intercourse doesn't cut it for most women. Only 20% of women can climax through penetrated sex. 20%, right? That means 80% of women are not having their orgasms through intercourse. Misogyny. Every man on the planet, and you said, hey, listen, I got this red button. Nobody's looking. Nobody's going to judge you. Truly, nobody's here. They said you can be a great husband, a wonderful father. You can go home, tuck your kids at night, possibly sleep with other women and then go home and hold your wife and tuck in your babies and provide and be a good husband and father. Every man on the planet would look left, they'd look right and they'd hit the button. I only want one girl at a time. I prefer one. However, what he's saying there, nobody's looking and nobody's judging and it's completely okay to do. Yeah, but I think every woman, if they could, I think they might freaking prefer multiple dudes to service them as well. So I think that's a male and female thing. I don't even know if I like this. I'm going to get a whole ration of my wife saying, you want other women? Look, I don't want other women. I'm happy with one. I'm a one-horse cowboy. I prefer one. But again, if someone said, hey, you want the option? Well, the option's nice, I got to admit. The option's nice. In my mid-twenties, when I was traveling through America, I had a broke backpack. The moral of the story isn't, yay, well done. The moral of the story is that was a shitty thing to do. Me and my buddy, we were like, he was wingman and me, and we picked up the two chicks, and the girl I was going after, like she told me she was being proposed, and she was getting married the next week, and I seduced her. My buddy had like a one-bedroom apartment, so I f***ed her on a chair in his study. Super uncomfortable. She got married like a week later and messaged me, and I was like, shit, that's so mean. All right, all right, all right. Gone fresh and fit, whatever, all the other things. Right after you finish jerking off on Pornhub, you go to YouTube. You got to clear the mind. You got to get strong again. What do you watch? Whatever. Fresh and fit. Who are they roasting? The porn stars you were jerking off to. Exactly. So do you get it? It's one big female degradation system. It is. And they fuel male power through pushing, putting women down. What's that? Not through interacting with each other. Men are the most powerful thing in the cosmos. You don't need to put down women. And if that's the way that you feel masculine, then we have a problem with masculinity now. Absolutely. It's because men rate women as below average in attractiveness, whereas men rate 50% of women as below average in attractiveness. And so what that means is that the attention of women in an open mating market is focused on a very small percentage of men. And what's happening in colleges and universities where women dominate in terms of proportion of population is that all the women are chasing a very small number of men. So most of the men have no partners at all, and some of the men have more partners than they know what to do with. And so those men research short-term mating strategies, which is not so good for the women because they just as soon have an actual relationship. But then you might ask, well, what does it do to the men? And that's easy, is that it trains them to... What is your major? And that's really bad practice, because if you practice exploiting people for your momentary gratification, then you'll become an expert at that. Build dating apps that really know the math too much. Yeah, the math's bad. Math's bad. Math's bad. Except for the ones we build. I'm just kidding. Math's bad, period. The math is more about gender roles and stuff like that. That's what the problem is. Men swipe 50% of the time. Women swipe 5% of the time. It's a false reality for women. Guys are just like, whatever. It's totally two different worlds they're living in. And so the app's made on both sides for the same person. But it doesn't work. Men obviously spend much less time on a profile than women. Oh yeah, yeah. Picture, picture. We choose differently. We go, she looks good. I think I can stand her. She goes, he's amazing. I really enjoy him. He looks alright. So totally two different worlds. Only 10% of men are attractive on pictures to a woman. At all. Period. At all. Six feet tall. You gotta be six feet tall. That's 15% of all people. So the numbers are just massively messed up. You get the data and I just go crazy on it. I'm like, this does not work, people! I was loving a black woman for the rest of my life. It was the first thing I ever wanted. Before money, before fame, before influence. And it's looking like it's the last thing I'm gonna get. And for me that's sad, but in the middle of my sadness I gotta realize that man, I was 100% sold on love and it was the only thing I ever cared about. And for me that was a mistake. And as I'm getting older I'm realizing that I spent so much time looking for love that I cheated myself out of years loving myself. And what also I did is I didn't need help anymore. And now I need company. Which is the most beautiful thing I could ever think I could give to a woman. I thought I was a kid at first, I thought I was million. The only thing I need for this woman to do is to show up and be herself. And I think if more people, if I reduce myself to just needing company I feel like that's the best advice I could give somebody that's looking for love. When you start trying to add things up and oh I need love to save me from this or to heal me from that do the best you can on yourself, realize that it's okay. A lot of the things that have happened to us were absolutely not our fault. People need to go see that accountability police. But for most of us we were just blindsided by a tornado called another human. Who's also not perfect. And if they didn't say sorry, I'm sorry. Right? But we're gonna heal that. We're gonna love each other. We're gonna love ourselves. And we're not lonely, we're marinating. Two things a man needs most and we women so often don't get it because we have such different needs. On top of our list is love. We want buckets of love. We want to feel safe and held all the time. But surprise surprise, men don't have love as a priority on their list. You know what every man wants? He wants to be left alone but he doesn't want to be alone. And that means that he wants to feel at any moment in time that he's a free man. That's why so many men find it a very hard decision to get married. He chose porn. Because for a man marriage equals losing your freedom. But here's what we women also don't get. Freedom for a man is more a psychological thing than it's a reality. He needs to feel that the things he does for you keeping up with this are his decision. That he's in charge and not you because you never even though you really are If you can create a situation in which you make him feel free in which you accept him doing things for himself going out with his friends etc he will be forever yours. And the second thing every man needs most is to feel that he is respected. That's why most men cannot deal with being cheated on because it shows complete disrespect. To respect him means that you are loyal to him that you show him that you trust him that you have the ability to let him lead the relationship instead of trying to mold him into a man he does not want to be. Let's see if Nuno can bring it home for us. Absolutely not. Do not do this for the money. Don't do it for the money. I promise you. You will not make a dime if you do this for the money. Money will come. Fame is kind of an embarrassing thing to say but your success will come if you just let it go. Let it go. Don't do it. Don't do it for the fame. Don't do it for the money. Don't do it because your friends think it's cool. You got to sacrifice. You don't have to sacrifice sleeping in a rehearsal space but you got to sacrifice your emotional everything you have in you has to go towards it or nobody's going to believe it. That's really the essence of all of it. An audience wants to go with you. You take your audience with you when you perform, when you play. You're not performing for them. You're not impressing them. You're actually saying you want to come with me and then they'll keep coming back to go on that journey with you. That's what it's all about. Thank you. And that, my children, is the positivity message from Nuno Betancourt, one of my favorite. Man, my glasses look like I played for the Knicks or something. I have these new Near Vision ones. I think I'm actually going to have to swap them out now. I got new glasses but they're computer glasses but I think I prefer these right now for this. I'm so close to the monitor. I realize when I'm here, I'm literally not even three feet from my monitor. That's why I always try to do the dark mode for StreamYard, which still doesn't have a dark mode since what? When did they come out? 2018? Yes, that was Nuno Betancourt. Did you like that? I figured, you know what? I like that, so what the hell? I thought that was interesting. The reason I left you guys with that one because I think that there's a lot to that. It's funny, it's a dumb rock star. Not at all, man. Nuno Betancourt is a very intelligent individual but I thought it was interesting because people ask me all the time, like, Rollo, why do you play in a band still? You don't make any money off of it. I'm like, yeah, you're married. You're not getting laid off of it, which was actually my original motivation if I'm 100% honest. I'm just like, but I want to make music. And that's just what I do. I'm a professional musician, although I'm a non-money-making, a non-revenue-generating musician. But I think it's interesting what Nuno's take was on the end of that. And you can apply that to pretty much anything. And I thought it was interesting because it's more or less, I hate to say it's like non-attachment, but it's like you're not doing your art, whatever that may be, or you're not doing the things that you're passionate about. You're not doing your, like, you know, how was it Rich Cooper always says, chase excellence, my friend, whatever your excellence happens to be. It has to be intrinsically rewarding. And I've talked about how happiness does not exist, at least not in the way that we're sold happiness is. I mean, happiness does exist, obviously, but it's not pussy at the end of the rainbow. It's not a destination, right? It's part of the process. And I thought that was interesting because in a sense, if you can adopt that and say, you know what, I enjoy doing what I'm doing. There's a, I actually got this from Greyhound Racing, from all of my Greyhound Rescue groups. There's an old saying that says, winners don't know that they're in a race. They just love to run. And that was referring to dogs. Like the really, like their fastest, most champion-ish dogs were the ones that were just like, they love to run. That's all they want to do. And I think it might be interesting to like ask yourself, I know this sounds a little bit weird for the very beginning of my show here, but I think it might be interesting for the rest of this show to ask yourself, like, what is it that actually makes you, well, what is intrinsically rewarding? I hate to say how it makes you happy, but like money and drugs, sex, drugs, and rock and roll. But like, what is intrinsically rewarding? Because I keep looking at all these, these shows and these, like Alex Marmozzi or, or Huberman or whoever else, anybody who's like one of these guys This is, you know, watch out for dopamine. Dopamine is the devil. I'm like, no, it's not. I mean, it's, it is what it is. It is. If you don't like, you know, have some sort of self-control, we have to actually have exercise control over that. And, and I'll tell you that dopamine is not the devil. It's just how it's achieved, I guess. Right. Like, so it's serotonin and was it serotonin? Yeah. Serotonin and dopamine. It's like, okay, well, great. Now we've reduced it down to a chemical process. Awesome. But the thing is, is like, I'm sick to death of hearing people tell me like, oh, if you're married, you're going to be happy. Like what married men are happier than non-married men. It's like bullshit. No, they're not. They're happy in the, in the doing, in the things, in the things that they're doing. Oh, you'll be happy if you have kids. Like, yeah. When you're in the process of being a parent, sure. Maybe there's some very, there's some, as a parent for 25 plus years now, I can tell you, there's been some pretty shitty parts of being a parent, but there's actually the, some very intrinsically rewarding parts of doing the parenting. Being a parent doesn't make you happy. Parenting can make you happy because it's part of the process. Happiness is a proximate outcome, not an ultimate outcome. And I think the major problem that we have right now is we have sold generation after generation on the idea that we can have this permanent static state of, you know, bliss and particularly in a gynocentric social order where women are, that are emotion-based, gynocentrism is essentially based on emotionalism. And that emotionalism is a, an extension of really how women's exist, how women's the female experience, right? So to, if I can sell you on the idea of some sort of permanent happiness, some kind of like end state goal and goal for happiness, then I can increase, I don't know, SSRIs and antidepressants. And, you know, we can, we can look at the spike in women taking antidepressants. I think it's funny because I keep seeing all these people who are coming off or coming at the red pill right now. And they're only taking little, little snippets of it. They're only taking like what they heard on Myron at first. That's why I put that one video in there. I'll come back to that. That's Jamie Lynn, by the way, I'm thinking about going on her show. She's out of Vegas and she does do her show. I think she still does her show out of the pink pill podcast. I'm like, bring it, let's go. I know Jamie was actually one of the first guests we ever had on access Vegas. I think she was on the original, the very first show, the pilot episode. Of Access Vegas. And she's not come back on. I really want to get her on and maybe Jamie Villamore, too. I'd really like to get some of the older, older gals back on. But Jamie Lynn is an interesting character because she's I think she sort of has seen the writing on the wall, the zeitgeist, I guess. You know, there's it's it's it's profitable now to throw shit at the red pill. But I was talking to Mike about this. And if you guys caught the last access Vegas that we did on Thursday, which I thought was very, very good. We had no guests. It was just me and Mike and the girls. And sometimes that's good. Sometimes I like that, especially if we have really good substantive conversation. And it was interesting to me because that was the first access Vegas we did after that whirlwind tour of going on Fresh and Fit. God knows how many times went on the Danza project, which was awesome. Well, I hate to say because I love Fresh and Fit, but I got to say, man, Miguel at Danza Project has a tight show and it was very memorable. We got a lot of good, a lot of good talk out of that. And I think the reason why that was sort of the highlight to me anyways, is because we had really good substantive discussion and conversation. I think that that is sorely lacking in the red pill space or the manosphere or whatever we want to call it. Like people say, roll, are you going to leave the manuscript? No, I'm rolling Tomasi. Oh, I'm I'm a red pill. How believable would that be? I'm red pill. No, you're not. Come on. So there's no I'm not walking. There's no way I could possibly walk away. And I think it's funny when people try to do it, too. But. Hey, you would have you would you would you really have respect for me if I if I did that? Yeah. You would respect me again. I thought it was, you know, let me just finish this first out here really quickly, though. But as coming back to the substantive conversation that we were having on Danza and then we went on sauce cast, that was good. It was fun. But those are more like they're kind of like entertainment shows. And minor fresh, I mean, the after our show is most definitely an entertaining show, don't get me wrong. But the after hours, I think it could be more substantial. I think it could be more substantive. If if that if the direction was more like focused that way. But I understand, like, see what the problem is, is like it's what's hate to call it lifestyle creep, but it's almost like show creep or like content creep. Maybe that's it in that you have to keep escalating the red meat because that's the only way you either appear or disappear in this. That's one of the reasons I like doing my own show. And I'm like in charge of I'm the one man show. Nobody tells me jack shit to do. I just do do whatever. Right. Everything on the show, this guy. But I like to have substantive pod classes with you guys. And I really enjoy that. That's intrinsically rewarding. I am made happier and better a person. You're making me a better person right now. We're making each other better, better people. So so, yeah, but I'm kind of wishing for a more like like a better conversation, I think. But the problem is, is the way we do things now in the sphere I mean, the sphere is being burned down. And I think that's probably pretty apparent to anybody who's been a part of this community, the space for a long time. And it's just what I was expecting to, by the way. I knew that, like, you know, like I said, I made the prediction last year that that, you know, by August, you wouldn't recognize the Manister. Well, here we are. Now, what does the minister look like now that we can't recognize it from what it looked like in like twenty twenty two? So no, don't worry. I got you. I got you. I got your super chats. I'm going to read if they're if they're really spicy. I might go lower than ten. But like, I'm going to go, let's see, ten and up today. How's that? Just so I'm not doing a six hour podcast like some of these other great shows are doing. So I was at I was at Access Vegas on Thursday. We went to should I tell you what I can tell you what it was, but like F1 was in Vegas on well, actually this whole week, which I really wanted to see some of it. And it didn't like go off like for all the traffic control and the roadwork and everything else they did for it. I was like, damn, it's kind of anticlimactic. And because it was raining and had like delays and had problems and everything, I guess I just weren't ready to rock and roll and they should have been. But I think it has promise. But anyway, they end up gumming up the whole system as far as like I was concerned, like getting down to Red One Studios next when possible. But in that we got to I think we had a better show as a result of that. But anyways, after the show, we we went to go see Joel from he's the guy that runs the Black Tape Project. If you don't know what Black Tape Project is, don't do this at work, children. Please don't do this at work. It's a little bit for work, but you can go up, look up the Black Tape Project. And so we hung out and it was like I tell you where it was. You probably could probably guess where it was. But but I met Joel really, really interesting guy. And it was it was an interesting time, kind of like almost like surreal for me to be, you know, doing doing all this stuff. I really for the last year, it's been kind of surreal to do all this. But I'm looking at this, I'm thinking, you know, we have something really special, I think, in Las Vegas right now because of the show. And it was funny to me is like I can go to Black Tape Project. I can go to what? What Republic as a bikini contest. I can go to like a strip. We went to a strip club for what was it? A crazy horse. Crazy. No, I forget what it was. It was when we were shooting for the Paramount series. Like I was just like me and me and actually Trey Little were extras in the in the Paramount series on strippers right now. But just going into those places and being recognized as Royal Tomasi and then like right there, people ask me, hey, I got a question for you. Do you know where we are right now? And it was it's just it's really surreal to like be able to like just walk through an airport and have people want to have substantive conversations with. And now usually it's like help me solve my girl problem, Rolo. But that's more constructive, I think, than a lot of the shit that I see going on right now, because I don't think anybody is doing doing very much constructively. And I hate to say it, maybe that's even the wrong word for it. But like, you know, we talk about red meat, like sizzle and steak. Nobody's really doing the steak right now. Everybody's doing sizzle. And so when me and Mike are doing Access Vegas and we're quoting things or coming up where we're discussing studies and everything like that, I'm really noticing a need for us to actually do a show just us together like, you know, girls, just us having conversations and maybe us having, you know, conversations with with other individuals, kind of like, you know, we did with Richard Reeves and something, you know, something that's a little bit more down to earth. And so we're trying to look at maybe doing something with personalities who have like a problem with the red pill. And one of the things that we really come down to when we're when we're looking at the people who are critics of the red pill right now, because it's like profitable to do that. Most of them rely on straw man arguments because they don't know the red pill. They don't know the the just sort of how the equation works out. I think I explained I've explained this on this show several times, so I won't like belabor this too much. But when I talk about how the red pill is kind of it's kind of like a math equation, it's kind of like doing calculus or trigonometry or algebra to like higher algebra. And it's not enough for you to just come up with the correct answer. At the end of the problem, you have to show your work. Right. Anybody who's taken a math class or any higher math understands what I'm talking about. So if you're in calculus or something like that, it's not enough to say, hey, look, I got the right answer. It's like, yeah, but how'd you get from point A to point B? So you have to show your work and how you how you got there. That's really kind of what the red pill is right now. But the problem is, is that the critics only see the answer at the end of the equation. They don't see how the work was done. They don't see cosines and coefficients and, you know, and integers. And they don't see all that stuff. Right. They don't see how the sausages made. They don't see the the how the like what the inner workings of that math equation. They only see that one answer. And they're only taking that one answer in isolation from other things, too. So that was really the the impetus, I should say, the inspiration for the next book that I'm working on right now, which is called Maxim's. And I'm going to discuss a couple of those maximum three or four of them today. I'm considering doing a series of them and then collecting them and putting them into a book. But I'm going to do a series of them, maybe on substack, and it will be red pill maxims. Like, why do these guys think this? Why do they say that? Why does Rolo say, you know, if a woman makes you wait for sex, then then the sex is never worth the wait. Oh, he must want us to fuck random hoes. No, that's not what that was about. But I can't explain that to you in a forty five second tick tock video and have you like wrap your heads around it. So I'm going to try to make the book as like digestible as possible for people who are unfamiliar with like why why we say what we say. So like Mike and I are looking at maybe having like Mac and Murphy on Macklemore. I I'm I was a little reluctant to do this because really the guy's just looking for clout at this point, as far as I can tell, because I've seen his I just recently watched his or it was a Mike turned me on to the the interview or the discussion. The debate was like two, three hour debate was more than that between a whole math and Mac, Macklemore, Mac and Murphy. I'm going to pop some tags. And I thought it was funny in that. But here's the thing is like I noticed in in watching their sort of back and forth, it's like the blind leading the blind or I should say is the blind argue against arguing against the other blind guy. And that's not to take anything away from home. And I think his stuff is very funny, very digestible. I love what he's doing. I think it's it's entertaining. We use like several three different videos of his on The Last Access Vegas, which people really enjoy. People like that. And I'm happy to give him the give him the clout. Right. I'm happy to give him the juice for for that kind of stuff. But I still have to like make sure that I that I clarify certain things, because when I watch stuff like when you oversimplify the red pill, then people will take that one little bit of it and they'll say this is what those dudes are all about. This is the ideology. This is the philosophy. This is the religion. This is the cult. This is the the movement. Right. It's like, no, dumb ass. But that one little bit that they pull out. Here's why I'm against the red pill. They say that all these three or fours are bitches and hoes. Right. That that that fat kid on on fresh and fed. He always does tell these bitches to go to hell. Can you get behind that? I can't rubble rubble rubble rubble, right? It's like. How do you educate somebody like that? Well, they're not you can only teach people who are willing to learn. So if you're not willing to learn, I mean, maybe that's not someone that we really want to we really want to talk to. But if all you ever hear is, you know. You know, if all you ever hear is this every time a man's being nice to you, all he's doing is offering. And you think that that is the beginning and the end of the red pill? I've got a I've got five books to sell you. And I will get you up. They will get you up to speed. But I don't think people who are really critics of the red pill at this point or what red pill principles like I think most people will like that one guy. We're going to look we're going to dig into Sidney Watson's thing today. I also have Dr. Tara Oran Terriban on tap for us."}
