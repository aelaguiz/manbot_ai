Are you not entertained? Is this not why you are here? Alright, alright, alright Alright, alright I do this once a week I feel like I work on every show I handcraft every show Handcraft every show before Weeks, weeks on end I tell you I wish it worked that way actually It doesn't work that way Oh boy, seen any good podcasts lately Are we entertained? Do we have any outrage bait for today? I want to personally thank Jesse Lee Peterson For inspiring today's thumbnail It was just too good to pass up See this is the curse of like A lot of people don't realize I have a Bachelor of Fine Arts as well as a Bachelor in Behavioral Psychology I do imagine Thank you very much Oh yeah, here we go You are one of the nicest people I think I've ever met in a short period of time It's about time No like seriously And I do think you are extremely attractive I, I You're really hot And you're nice And you're nice What the fuck am I thinking? He's nice He's kind He's grateful You're nice and sweet In here, say five, six, three Dude, if that's a problem for you That's totally gay You know what? Totally gay, no for real For seven years married for two I slept around in college And since we met and dated in college I thought it was best to be open with him And I told him my body count We would go months without it being brought up Then he randomly gets anxiety What are your thoughts? Is this normal behavior slash Common thinking from men? Because he sure thinks it is Some things you die with Like your body count He cannot hold that against you This guy is not comfortable with himself It's affecting you emotionally Because you're like I didn't do anything wrong And you didn't Bring it up once, cool Bring it up again For fucking, for what? Okay, so it's your fault If you have a problem with it Just throwing that out there End game here Do you want me to apologize for something That I did before even knowing you? Because right now You're just bothering the fuck out of me You made it a month on only Not that much I would say like 400 Okay, not that much Not as much as comparison to like Other girls that I know That's like my highest month But I know girls that Will make way more than that a month Well I'm trying to claim She makes like 200 million I think that's true She just probably 200? She just got rid of all her stuff No way She just shut down her own Like me because One day I said If your wife's out spending you You need to make more money You also said Why are you making your wife pay for it? You're the man You should be taking care of her 100% Oh yeah we were like We love him But that's the truth Any guy that doesn't agree with that Dude he's I don't even know what you call that You guys were built to be providers Like you were built to be protectors Like instinctually That's how you were Women were That's how you should be And women were built to be Like the ones we take care of That's why women are Attracted to men that are Very confident And very Right? Because we want to be taken care of A woman gives up financial independence To a mate It's over You have to be prepared Because if you're not prepared Then you're stuck And more women Have to accept lifestyles That are unpleasant Because they are financially stuck So if you're smart You Teach your daughters Teach your granddaughters Everybody has to have something That they're good at Where they can earn a living Oh shoot Thanks for the $100,000 dude I gave away my whole life savings to you Because I love you so much mommy Thank you for everything I can't wait to be your king And run off with you forever That's crazy bro I mean Enjoy poverty Babe we got $100,000 Enjoy poverty Sexual response starts with emotional intimacy That's where it begins Not with desire And emotional intimacy The way I think of this is My partner is You I know I am one of the biggest lies and one of the grandest scams we have perpetrated on the human race since like probably the mid 60s is this idea that happiness is some some attainable nirvanic goal state that we can all just have. And it's heaven like we're basically selling heaven right. It's pure contentment no matter what. And so every time somebody says well that's not what's going to make you really happy. No that you're selling a lie and you're selling a dream right there because happiness is an emotion and it's an emotive state. And I mean it's really different. But everything every time we hear met we hear it mentioned you're not going to be happy you're going to be alone the old man and there nobody's going to be at your bedside when you pass peacefully into the next life. You're not going to be happy happy happy happy right. Whenever I hear that all I've got to go do is I have to look all I have to do to disprove that is look at the antidepressants prescriptions for women over the last like 20 some odd years. And again this is big pharma that's doing this but they're playing on the idea that happiness is some sort of maintainable sustainable goal state that you can always be in this state of bliss and happiness all the time. And so what happens is it culturally it gets into the fabric of like just what what our ideals are. So we tend to take that fantasy of what happiness actually is and we apply it to whatever our pet ideology is. Of course. So then why is it open because we like to around. So he doesn't they have an open relationship. You're 100 percent. You can try to put on your insecurities out there. That's fine. Are your women not enough for you. You have a one sided open relationship right. Because you said that you left him for him. Yeah. And that's it. Yeah. But if you did I go somewhere else. Well why do you think other women. No because I want to but you because I want to. No you said earlier does that mean that you don't know if it was does that mean that you don't love your partner because you go and other people for you. Yeah. No for you. I'm asking you for you. Yeah. I'm the same. And I'm confused. Do you understand that. I definitely do. Yeah. Do you. Women always have a double standard. I don't know. How is it the double standard when I have an open relationship. He also has an open relationship. We're just pointing like the Spiderman. Do you not love your partners. No. You don't love your partners. Your girlfriends. You have several girlfriends right. No. You have one. Yeah. Do you love him. Do you love your girlfriends. I can hear them right now crying out there. OK. Alina and I have an announcement to make. Do you want to tell them. No. You can do it. Our six year relationship is coming to an end. We are breaking up. And the reason for our breakup is sad. It's only 40 percent of our life. 2016. I was just starting Nas Daily. And I had just gotten out of a divorce and was traveling the world. The second we met online I knew she was special. And I knew he was special too. For me it was love at first message. Hey I saw your video. It would be fun to hang out and talk and explore. I loved everything about her. Her way of talking. Hi my name is Aline. Her sense of humor. Yeah I know. The way she capitalized words. Her kindness. Her personality. Her looks. Her culture. Everything. And I still love all that about you. And I still love so many things about you. you you We fostered 50 cats. And we even got fit married. In India and in Papua New Guinea. But sometimes even the best of things come to an end. It's 10 29. Don't be an asshole to me. I told you three minutes and I'm going down. No you can't randomly say three minutes. You're angry. I'm literally not angry. You are angry. I'm literally not angry. At some point I stopped taking her on dates. I focused all my energy into the videos and my company. Assuming the relationship was fine. But it wasn't fine. No it wasn't fine. You know I thought a lot about this. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. I don't have it in me. I cannot give you what you need from a relationship. And you couldn't give me what I needed in a relationship. From my perspective you know I was bidding for attention right. In relationships like the number one indicator of them falling apart is if someone asks for attention and they don't get it. And I was not having my bids for attention responded to. I feel like you were going into your own world right. And I was getting pushed out of the world. And I feel like it's actually piano and violin music. And I feel like I've been trying so hard to fit into your world. But I finally reached a point where I was like no like I want to have my own world too. Like I'm not going to be on the periphery of someone else's world. Yeah. And I. Translation. You have no frame and no world I want to be a part of. Realized I was thinking so much about you and you were not thinking so much about me. And you were thinking so much about your company. So it's like. I wasn't thinking about myself. Yeah. That's the thing. I wasn't thinking about myself. I wasn't thinking about you. I was thinking about life and death survival of this thing that I'm building. Yeah. That ended up destroying everything. Yeah. From my side I. I know myself. I invest a lot. I'm obsessive about things that I feel like can work out and become big in the future. And I don't invest anything in things that I don't see a future for. And I think at some point after four or five years subconsciously I felt that there is no future in our relationship because we couldn't agree on where to live in what the setting of family versus no family right. We couldn't agree on some of the most basic things in relationships. Like her being hot for you. And then I was like oh wait a minute. Why invest in something that's going to break apart in two three four years. So it became a self-fulfilling prophecy. Are you sad. No not enough. I was already sad during the relationship. I was grieving the relationship while I was in the relationship. Part of me feels like I remember how the red those red pill guys always say that the girls already left the relationship before you actually have the talk about breaking up. There you go. This is a cycle. Right now it's a cycle of me investing in the company and going all in like crazy. No, it's a cycle of you being blue pill and not being woke up. But I'm going to come out of it at some point. No, you won't. I mean, I know I will. Best one. You said that with the daily videos and then there was supposed to be a certain amount of time and then you made it a thousand days. So I waited with you. I dated you for almost three years. I waited and then the thousand videos ended and I did not become the priority. Then you decided to make a company and then, you know, you didn't do the app and then the app wasn't the priority. Then this company was the priority. I will never be the priority. I already waited six years, almost seven years. Waste of my sexual agency and the best years of my life when I could have been fucking a guy much harder than you, much richer than you, and certainly more well-built than you. And that's too long and I'm not going to live forever. I have one life. And I want to be the priority even if I'm only the priority to myself because you were my priority. We say to give a woman vote is like to let a monkey fly a plane. Very dangerous. I think you should. I'm nothing. That's enough of that. I'm sorry. I apologize for subjecting you to that. That mad. It's actually more to that. I just it's just it's too unbearable. You get the idea. Hello children. How are we doing today? How's it going? Hello there children. How's it going to be a sound drop day? I apologize in advance. Well, actually in in retrospect now, I should not have submitted you to all of that. It was just too much more than a man can take. Okay, how are we doing today? Ladies and gentlemen live from Reno, Nevada. Also the state that is soon to be the Stanley Cup championship teams States of well, I mean, not Nevada, Nevada, not Nevada. Thank you. I got I have to correct Mike Sartain. Like how long have you been living in Nevada and you don't know how to like people haven't corrected you on this people get like really I remember when I first moved here. People gave me like all kinds of grief for calling it. No boy. Oh boy. How'd you like that? That was Nas daily. I don't even know who they were but somebody like threw that in my Instagram and I'm like, this is so cringe-worthy. I have to play it was like getting to the point where it was. I got it like two weeks ago and I meant to do it two weeks ago, but I'm like, I don't know enough about these two to really get into it that much and then I'm like, who cares? So I had to throw that out there. Oh man. Okay. Today's episode two days pod class is going to be based on really emotionalism and emotion. Okay, we're going to get I'm going to give you full disclaimer right here since we're only was 18 minutes. I'm sorry about that. We're 18 minutes into the video right now into the episode, but I'm going to pick apart some of the latest video from from well, I guess it was Adam Sosnick show was a it was fresh and fit. We're on Adams show and had a gigantic panel of ladies on there all over the room. In fact, and I have been in that room several times and I know how large the room is and filling that room was was quite the task. Bravo Bravo gentlemen, but in particular, I kind of wanted to and I'm as bad as this is going to sound. I kind of wanted to jump up a Molina's ass. That's Molina Goranson or whatever. Who is Destiny's wife? No last name surname duly noted. Just saying and I wanted to also riff a little bit on what Destiny's take on this stuff was because it was pertinent to what I wanted to actually give from heaven here. I wanted to get into emotionalism because I don't really don't think I define that quite so much. So I've we talked about this all the time. And so when I go on any show and if I or if I'm animated or if I'm emphasizing something like I am right now, I'm justiculating and I'm not just like, okay, here's the facts. Here's what we're going to do. Okay, women take antidepressants at an alarming rate. If I'm like if it's like like text-to-voice kind of thing and there's it's devoid of emotion. The thing is, is like even the fact that I could read it to you still imply some sense of emotion. So can human beings in general male or female be completely devoid of emotion? No, because that would make that would like sort of eliminate part, you know, eliminate our humanity. Really? I will get to Super Chats here in just a second. Thank you. PP. I saw you in there for the for that. That big job that guilty guilty. That's not the one. Thank you. PP for the $200. Now I can get to it. Thank you very much for that. My friend. There it is right there. Always always in. Thank you. I hope I don't wax to academic today or to analytical today, but I think this is one of those topics that you kind of have to because if you don't bullshit like what happened on fresh and fit. I didn't say fresh and fit on Adam Sosnick show between the exchange between Myron Gaines and a lean or Molina. Um, and of course I Florida locals. Everybody. There's a Florida local just saying you you're going to perpetuate all these this mythology about emotion. Now. I don't I played the clip that I was when I was on with them, but Jedi Bila and Mike Sartain and I wanted to start with the happiness thing because I think that that's probably the the underlying debate that's going to happen in the very near future. You'll see I'm going to sort of give you the ending before I give you the beginning here and ending is really this is I see the the conflict between this left versus right this this traditional values versus this these moral degenerates and stuff. It's really not even a battle or a war between those two. It's really this wanting to understand that contentment simply doesn't exist and how I came to that today was by the way was a long discourse and it was a long road, but I have to kind of get into the nuts and bolts of it says today's going to be a little bit of a nuts and bolts. If you're looking for the year if you're looking for an informational show today's going to be the day but I'm going to get it as as detailed as I possibly can today. So everything I'm going to talk about today. I'm going to back up with stats facts stats everything else because everyone says a roller doesn't cite a source. Well, guess what today? We're going to cite a lot of friggin sources, but I wanted to start with those videos in particular because each one of those has something to do with what we're what the topic is today and also little subsections I guess of the videos that I'm going to riff on so but before I do get into that I got got to do a little bit of bookkeeping here. If you haven't picked up any of my books, please do they're all available on Amazon. I don't plug my books often enough. I just realized that I almost never plug my books on this show. And so unless I've got the the overlay or something like that going on, but please do if you are if you're purchasing if you're at all predisposed to purchasing a book now, I want to also point something else out that the reason why I'm plugging that plugging my book. I clearly if you're watching this show you probably to have my books, but if you don't please go to Amazon and and at least get the first one. So you at least you're caught up with the rest of the pod class. But the reason I'm saying that is because right around the middle of or beginning or middle of May. I received a an email from Amazon and all authors received this not just me. It wasn't just personalized to me, but all authors were told that that they the print books were changing hands. The production was going to change hands are moving to a different facility. They're moving to updating. I guess the software or whatever the app is that's used to track sales and all this other good stuff and the price of the of the books. So the physical books was going to go up and I and to their credit of Jeff Bezos. Thank you to their credit. They have not raised prices on the overhead of the production costs for books since I started started publishing books back in 2013. So it's been a while and it's been a long time coming. So I guess I can sort of understand back in 2020 when we had the C-19 pandemic thing going on. There was a lot of production stoppages and delays and stuff like that and that sort of made me aware of like just how sensitive the print industry is wherever they use them. And I know that that's not just like in like India. It's actually in Germany and some other places as well, depending on where you're buying your books from but that price increase is going up. I've I've kicked up my as a result of that contingently. I have kicked up my all of my print books by $1 just one and that's still not going to cover it. But the reason why I'm saying this right now is the email I received in May pointed out that the expanded distribution for for books for print books all print books, not just mine was being put on hold until June 20th. So if you've been trying to find my books in your country, if you're in a different country or you're in a different market or you're trying to find them from maybe you're not buying them from Amazon, you're buying them from another outlet and Amazon is the distributor because I go exclusively through Amazon and you can't find them or you can't purchase them. That's why so on June 20th, that's when the update will take place. So if you've been looking to buy one of my print books and you can't find it wherever that you happen to be wait until June 20th because that's when all of the systems get updated once again. So just want to throw that out there. Make sure everybody was aware of that. I rarely plug my books on this because it's like to me that's kind of I presume you're already have read my books. Anyway, so okay. So that said how do we go? Did you all these people all these people from around the world are going to go? Hey, man, you're right. I couldn't find it. Thank you from South Africa crits. So I want to get into emotion today and we have this conversation in the red pill quite a bit in the Manusphere red pill quite a bit and it's almost like this sign of like defeat or some sort of vulnerability or ha got you if you get in any way animated or if you get angry or if you lose your shit or if you have an emotional response and for the most part, it's true. Most guys ought to be a little bit more in control of their emotions and how men express emotions and how we emote is far different than it is from women. That's the main point of contention of today's show. So when I go and I go into a very ill thought of quick hit interview or debate such as it was with with destiny and sneko and then a week later I go back and do the same thing one more time with Mike Sartain then now the the nature of the interview or the nature of the exchange or the conversation is much different and it's much easier to provoke people. Well, they are on the opposite side of the screen. You will say things you will talk shit like you would never talk to somebody's face that way and I don't mean that in a sense that like, well, you know, I'm going to let's put a but let's put enough people together that really hate each other and hopefully we'll have that Maury Povich moment where we're like bash a chair over somebody's head or something which basically is really the next step in the you know, the next escalation. I think in the sort of YouTube blood sports that's going on right now, but if you're going to lose a debate, it's because you got emotional and you rage quit, right? So to defeat is always to walk away from it and it's it's never really about that because it's not really about a debate anyways, it's really about who can get the most 30-second buzz clips and as I've said before like people quote this show, but hell, what are we at right now? We're almost at 30 minutes in I guarantee you somebody probably has picked up the first like 10 minutes and made a clip of this somewhere before I'm even done with a four-hour podcast five. Let me stop lying five-hour podcast. So no, I was not hiding behind restaurant, you know, that's I'm glad you brought that up there. Life is great. So if you've ever been on a show with Mike Sartain or if you ever seen me on a show go watch the one with Adam Adam Sostek hell go watch the one with Jedi Abila. If you've ever watched any access Vegas shows, you know, Mike Sartain could talk. He could talk away. He can even talk. He can help talk me one of the reasons why we're like such a good match. I think together is because we both have that we're both operating from the same database, but we're always jockeying and vying for screen time. And we've gotten to a point right now where when we're doing access Vegas if I've got a point and I step on him to make that point he backs off because we both know that if somebody doesn't interrupt him and you know, I mean allow him to finish his point fine, but we're both talkers. I do a five-hour podcast where I'm the cacata cacata cacata all the time. Mike's just like that too. I've seen Mike do this live. I've seen Mike do this in his private groups and mo and men of action, which by the way, if you want to join you can that's the second link down but he's a talker. So if he's going to go head-to-head with destiny and he's making the same points. I was going to make anyways, but okay, who's who who makes the point is kind of irrelevant at that point. The point is that I'm making here is that if he was not there I would be making the same fucking the same points that he was making as it is. So I will tell you this sneaker walking off was sort of put him at a disadvantage and I knew that when I was on with sneaker who by the way, I like very much we've kind of like sort of men fences a little bit since then but but it was kind of a shame. I was kind of hoping that that sneaker would be able to stick around for the entirety of the show and you know first he bailed out then he then people gave him grief for bailing out and he came back. He was only there for 30 minutes and he bailed out again. So when I went in I knew that I only have maybe 30 40 minutes to really kind of like make my points with sneaker before he was gone. I think he did Aiden Ross's show that night and we're playing to like 30."}
