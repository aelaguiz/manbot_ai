Yeah. They ask, was Jonah Hill wrong for setting boundaries with his ex-girlfriend? And was she wrong for releasing the text? What are your thoughts? They're both wrong. And I saw, it's funny, are you sure this wasn't Mike Sartain? Because Mike had, he put some Twitter hot take out where he was talking about how he thought that Jonah Hill was 100% right. And what's her name? Hunter something or other? What's her name? What's the surfer girl's name? Her name is Sarah Bradley. Sarah Brady. Sarah Brady? Marsha, Marsha, Marsha. Marsha, Marsha, Marsha. No. So, he had said something about how his girlfriend was 100% wrong and that Jonah Hill was 100% right. And he's like, and I will debate anybody about that. Maybe I might bring that up on Access Vegas tonight, but you know what? I think I will. Let's put that in the notes for tonight's show. Okay. So, here's my take on Jonah Hill's, because I know I won't get an award in Edgewise later. Jonah Hill is overweight. Okay. That's number one. He looks like the dude from the Big Lebowski. And that's, we have to sort of clarify these things like, well, is he a high value male? No, he's not a high value male. He, what? He got- Whoa, whoa. Look at this. What? He lost weight, bro. Oh, he has for sure. But- I mean, he looks like a- He's always been heavy, dude. He looks like a bum. Yeah. He looks like the dude from the Big Lebowski. Who was it? Who was the actor that played that in the Big Lebowski? I can't remember. Oh, I can't remember. Anyway, he looks like the dude. The dude abideth. Like, Jonah Hill abideth. So, let's go through this. Like- Mm-hmm. What is he wrong for setting boundaries? Okay. It's not about setting boundaries, though. That's the whole thing. Like, he, I think he wasn't trying to set boundaries. He, like, in the aftermath, in like, after the fact, yeah, that's what the way it comes off. I think he was just simply like doing what most beta male guys do, which is, hey, I really feel bad about this. Hey, I really think you should do this. Hey, I really, and it's, it's this constant badgering of, like, if you look at the text, I've seen the text. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I also understand that all of the texts that she released are like a year late or a year old. Right. I mean, it's like 18 months, something like that. And I know that he's with another chick right now and he's got a baby mama and the, a surfer girl, what's her name? Bradford. Is that what her name? Brady? Brad Brady. Brady. Sarah Brady. Sarah Brady. And he releases these things like a year afterwards or two years or a year and a half afterwards. And now like, it's like, it's current news, like something, something that happened like immediately just in the recent news. And so the thing is, once again, you've got like the mainstream of the fem stream media, like wanting you to believe that this just happened like yesterday. And it's like, no, these are texts from a long ass time ago. So both of them. Okay. So my, my, from what I've been able to sort of learn from all these is in my estimate right now, Jonah Hill is kind of like, he's got fat guy syndrome. And I know that a lot of guys get that too. It's, and it doesn't matter. Like people keep saying, oh, well, he's a, he's an actor. He has lots of money. He can, you know, he's rubbing elbows with, uh, you know, Leonardo DiCaprio. He was in Wolf of Wall Street, just like Margot Robbie. Right. What is it about Wolf of Wall Street that is causing all of this? I'm waiting for, uh, for, um, Leo to have some sort of scandal now. He's going to start dating 55 year old. Are they like working for, is there a Wolf of Wall Street too? That's we don't know about. So I got the text messages up for you. Okay. Read them out for me because I can't read that on the screen. All right, here we go. Full screen. It says plain and simple. If you need surfing with men, boundary lists, inappropriate friendship with men to model, to post pictures of yourself in a bathing suit, to post sexual pictures, friendships with women who are in unstable places and from your wild recent past beyond getting a lunch or coffee or something respectful, I am not the right partner for you. If these things bring you to a place of happiness, I support it. And there I will have no hard feelings. These are my boundaries in a romantic partnership. My boundaries with you based on the ways these actions have hurt our trust. Oh my goodness. I thought we were in the trust nest or can we talk about things in the trust? Wait a minute. Is this, is this like, is this, um, like relationship counselor talk? It is. It's therapy speak is what it is. And the very fact that the, like, here's the thing. You can tell when a guy has been like properly trained by like, I know the feminine imperative, his mom, his sisters, or like the women that he's listened to. This is a guy who, when he wanted to figure out what women want, he went to women to ask them what they wanted. And so this is how you get this kind of talk. I supported your needs, I trusted you. And then when you say something about, you know, considering your recent wild past, right? So clearly her past makes a difference to Jonah Hill. Does that mean like a woman's past matters? Well, it does, but it matters more to guys who don't fuck. It matters more to guys who don't get pussy or who aren't used to getting pussy. Okay. So when Jonah Hill starts talking about, oh, you're considering your recent wild past, what's what he's saying is I can't trust you with these dudes. That's what he's saying. You're advertising yourself sexually when you're supposed to be in a relationship with me. Okay. I've talked about this several times on my, on my show, I'll ask access Vegas. I was just talking about mentioning this on, I mentioned this on no jumper sooner or later, that video will come out. But it's supposed to be closed on his end and closed on her end, right? That's a traditional relationship. The problem is, is that's not how it works today, especially when it comes to somebody who is like one, one partner is on that page, thinks that that's what the mutual agreement is while the other partner is advertising her sexuality on Instagram on, and maybe that's part of her job. Maybe that's part of the deal. She says that later on in some of these other texts, you knew what I did before we started, you know, started going out and started, you know, that's the question though, right? So if he knew that this is her lifestyle beforehand, is it wrong for him to try to insert these boundaries? Yes. In that, in that case, I would say yes, but only because, um, maybe like, I don't know, I can't read the dude's mind, but this is classic beta male behavior. I can fix her. If I go, I'm Jonah fucking Hill, I can fix this woman. I can, if I come into her life, she's going to stop like, you know, hoeing around what, and for lack of a better term, I don't think she was hoeing around, but like, um, the, the problem that he's running into is it's supposed to be closed on his end and closed on her end. And yet it seems like she's still advertising her sexual availability, not only on Instagram, but she does it professionally because she's also a swimsuit model or a surfer swimsuit. Well, I mean, we looked at her Instagram. There was like no like risk. Yeah. There's no, there's, there's her on her board. Look, we've, I've seen more risk. Hell I every day. I mean, shit. Access Vegas has more risk. Right? Right. Well, so, but he's, but here's the thing is he's in that relationship with her. And when you're a fat guy and you're batting above your, your average, when you're like batting out of your league, you get real possessive and you get real insecure. So here you have your girlfriend who is a professional surfing instructor. She also does bikini modeling. Who knows where, what used to be on her Instagram? I don't know. I remember these are from a year ago, even half ago. At some point along the way, he felt like, okay, it seems to me like she's really into these guys or she's like, you know, advertising her ass on, and I'm Jonah fucking Hill. I can take care of you. You don't even have to do this anymore. I've got more money than you will ever make as a surfing instructor, wherever the hell you are. But that's not the point. She's not going to get it. This is a woman who's not going to give up her career. She's not going to give up her Instagram. She's not going to give up. She had all the fans. She doesn't, but like if she did, I'm not going to give up my only fans. And it doesn't matter how high of how high value guy Jonah Hill is nominated, nominated for best supporting actor for Wall Street as, and then what a super bad has, you know, has money. Let's just say, you know, he's, I wouldn't say he's an a-lister, but he's an a minus lister, right? He's still up there. He's up there with like Seth Rogen or something, you know? And so you put him into that category and you all, you have a woman who anyone would say, you'd be crazy not to get with him. You'd be crazy. Such a nice, he probably is a very nice guy. In fact, he's probably too nice, but you've got a woman who teaches surfing to guys that look like Matthew McConaughey or whatever from point break, right? Yeah. That looked like the swimmer's body. Yeah. So she's hanging out. That's her, that's her clientele. So she's hanging out with people and teaching them to surf. I've seen some of these other pictures where she's like on these long boards and it looks like, I mean, I know that they're trying to present her in the best light as possible on like, but the telegraph or whatever it is, the BBC or no, the British one. I can't remember the name of it, but yeah, it's not the guardian. I think it's telegraph or something like that, but it looks like she's, it looks like a scene from Clambake and Elvis should be over here, you know, doing a hula or something. And so they're trying to, of course, you know, defend her as like, oh, well he's, he's a tyrant. He's a misogynist. He's controlling. He's trying to tell her what to do with her life. So you've got that narrative. And in that respect, I can see why people would like, not like Jonah Hill or would think he's in the wrong. Well, then here comes the question. Is there a difference between control and controlling and how would you break that down in this scenario? There is, there is, you should never be controlling. You should never have to be that way in the first place. And that's why when you've got a fat Jonah Hill and granted he looks better now, he has lost some weight. He's grown his hair out, trying to look like the dude, right? Looks like he's a little more hip, but you're trying to upgrade his style a little bit. Got it. Good for you. Bravo. But it doesn't change the mindset. So to Jonah Hill, he's still fat Jonah Hill from super bad, right? He's not ever going to be able to compete until he gets his ass. Here's the best thing Jonah Hill can do. Get in shape. Yeah. But what's causing all of this is the fact that he's still insecure about his weight. That's why. So that's how you get the chick speak. That's how you get the therapy speak. I thought we were on in the trust nest. I thought we were, you know, I thought we were our partnership, this and everything else. And it's like, dude, if you're having, by the way, just in general, if you're having those conversations via text or even just live and face to face, you're done. Just eject. Just get the fuck out in that case. We want to know why I always say therapy never works or marriage counseling is like last stop before toll. This is why, because your headspace is in, you're thinking like a chick, you're talking like a chick, you're using the same vernacular and the same language of emotionalism, and you're using this therapy speak, right? Alpha males don't use therapy speak. You know why? Because they just leave bitches like that. And they find the next one. They go on to the next one. They never learn it because they never have to learn it. All right. So this, I would say Jonah Hill is a good example of trying to insert controlling tactics here, listing this list, right? That's his where he's in the wrong. Now, where would he be if, if he had control, he wouldn't even had to make the list, right? So it, again, everything comes back to genuine desire. She had no desire to let, to stop being a surfing instructor. Okay. Even that, even that. Okay. That's what you're about. So we asked the girls on Instagram or asking me on access Vegas and on fresh and fed. And I think probably even on a brand on whatever podcast has asked us before, it's like, would you give up your Instagram for the right guy, right? If you, if you have found the perfect dude, looks good, makes money, he meets all your criteria on the list. And he says, you know what? I'm kind of uncomfortable with you being on Instagram or you being on only fans. I make enough money for you not to be an only fans because I'm the perfect guy. Will you please give, give me your passwords, right? Give me the passwords to your social media. Please go delete your Instagram, delete your only fans. Every woman at that question bristles because it is giving up a it's, it's giving total control over to a man. They're like, well, what if he starts flocking other girls? What if he dies? What if he starts screwing his hot secretary at some point, there's always this fear that they've got to keep. And that's usually what women that's the rationale women use when they say, I don't want to give up my only fans because granted, they're probably making a lot of money off of it. They're on Instagram. That's their fail safe. If shit, if shit goes sideways, they want to have an Instagram that's already ready to go. They don't even want to show the boyfriend on the, on the Instagram. Imagine here, maybe this is a better question. If I'm going to be your boyfriend, you have to put me on your Instagram. I wonder how many women would bristle it. I'm going to ask that tonight. I'm going to ask that because I think that's a better question, but here's the thing. When we get down to genuine desire, that's the wrong question to ask. The right question to ask is, is because the first thing women will say is like, well, he wouldn't be the right guy. If he was asking me to do that, I wouldn't have anything to do with him. I wouldn't have a long-term relationship with the guy who would want me to do that. Okay. If I said, if you met the right guy, here's the right question. If you met the right guy and he was every checked off everything, he's like, he's the man that other men want to be. And other women want to bang. And he is like, he answers the question. Is he the best I can do? Would you take it upon yourself to initiate it on your own, to delete your only fans, delete your Instagram, delete your what you like, change your essentially change your life. Right. Because you are so into this guy that you don't want there to be any shadow of a doubt in his mind that you guys are closed on his end and closed on your end. And you don't want him to give him the impression because God forbid he might leave you for doing that. Right. That you're being sexually available for other men will be only fans, Instagram, whatever, you know, whatever the social media choices, would you do that and take it upon yourself? That's the question. And even still women like at least 60% of the time will say, no, I wouldn't do that because they want those reassurances. Now there's the question about red pill rage in this though. Of course, there always is going to be, because everybody thinks that he's an incel. They think Jonah Hill is a controlling, misogynistic bastard. She even says it in the text. You said this before, like, it's better to like, you know, if you get red-pilled in a relationship, it's harder to change the relationship once you already have it established. So do you think that's where he was struggling? The frame that you go into the relationship with will be what sort of sets the tone of the theme for that. So like, okay, he obviously went into this relationship with a different frame, and then he tries to change it mid-frame. Is that where he made the mistake, like not setting that boundary in the beginning, but two, having this change? He should never have gotten to the point where he's having to set boundaries and to sort of have that conversation the first way. Demonstrate, do not explicate. When it comes to boundaries, there has to be a consequence. There has to be something. And usually it's better if the pain is felt early on in the relationship than later on after a constant like, you know, I don't want you to do this. I don't want you to do this. I don't want you to do this. I don't want you to do this. Then you sound like you want to talk about insecure, that's insecure, right? So the guys who go into a relationship in the frame of you are always qualifying to her, then that's going to last throughout the relationship. So the things, when you're setting boundaries in that particular, in that sense, like when I, it becomes that much more difficult in the future. When I was talking to Jedidiah Bela about like how she's in this partnership with her husband, or when I talk to people who talk about, well, you know, a marriage should be an equal partnership. No, when your equal partnership looks like Jonah Hill and this surfer girl. I look up to a man that is their equal. They cannot look up to a man who is on the same level of that. Even when that guy like Jonah Hill, I mean, like socioeconomically, he's way up here compared to surfer girl down here. But Jonah thinks it's the other way around because in his head, she's out of his league because he's still fat. She's hanging out with point break guy and they're having a good time together. So when that's your mentality, it doesn't matter. Like you can have a good time. When that's your mentality, it doesn't matter. Like you can be multimillionaire. You can be an Oscar winning actor, you know, nominated actor and it won't make any difference because your headspace is still thinking that she is out of your league. That's why I always say that's another iron rule of Tomasi. It's like, there are no leagues, you know, there are no, they're like, oh, she's out of my league. I guess, no, there's no such thing as being out of your league. The leagues exist right here. Now you, you have said before, like, um, when it comes to genuine desire, the fact, it's not the fact that the girl wants to go on the girls trip or she's not the fact that she's asking you, it's why she wants to go in the first. So it's like for him having to make this list, the problem really is the, her desire to not have taken this stuff down or not have done this stuff or stop doing it in the first place. Her, all that shit is more important to her than a relationship with him. Yeah. And again, it comes back to another one of my chapters in the book, the medium is the message. Her behavior is the message. She's not into you. Her interest is not high enough for her to want to think about you constantly. So when I talk about genuine desire and I'm going to quote fresh here, genuine burning desire, own her soul kind of stuff. It's not, it's not like this sort of, you know, vaudevillian, you know, melodramatic stuff. It's just like you want a desire from that woman where she is thinking about you. She is compassionate about you. She is interested in your pleasure. She is interested in supporting you and in nurturing you and being, you know, being on bushes, the ride or die girl. She's going to break you out of prison. She's going to change her religion and leave her tribe to join your tribe across the ocean somewhere. That's the kind of desire that you're looking for in a, in a woman who is going to be the ride or die girl, surfer girl, most definitely is not ride or die girl. And that is something that Jonah should have been able to pick out way before any of this shit happened. So when we're looking at boundaries, I'm not saying it's not important to put out boundaries, but it is more important to enforce boundaries. So a boundary that is set and you're talking about, and you're going to go to therapy and you're going to negotiate, you know, okay, here's my boundaries. And if you obey those things, and if you, if you respect, you're going to say, okay, we respect those things. Then I'll want to fuck you. And you'll want to fuck me. Okay, good. And it's like, it's an occasion. It's a hostage negotiation is what it is. And the hostage is genuine desire, right? So that conversation should have never taken place in the first place because it's not about, oh, I want to go to girls night out. Oh, I'm not going to take down my Instagram. It's the desire not to do it in the first place. That's what Jonah Hill doesn't understand. Do you think he had a desire? She doesn't care about him. She doesn't desire him well enough to even bother with that. Do you think she had a covert con? He had a covert contract with her with this? Like, look, I did all these things for you over contract. Is she fucking him or not? That's the covert contract. Yeah. But like, you know, Hey, I'm doing all these things for you. You know, I'm giving you this great life. Oh, what he, what he thinks that is implicit. Is it implied in his thing? Yeah, probably. Because that's like the beta male way of thinking because it's transactional. I do these things. I get sex. What is it? Chris Rock, every time a man is off is doing something nice for you. All he's doing is offering dick. Now take that dynamic and put it into a relationship. So now it's, it's always qualification. We're working on a relationship. No, you're not. You're doing, you're trying to qualify for what you think is going to get her to want to fuck you to get to that genuine desire instead of that obligated compliance. So when we hear about like duty sex and these trad films talking about how, you know, well, it's your duty to have sex with your man because it says so in the Bible. Blah, blah, blah, blah. It's like, yeah, but you can't make her want to do that. Want is like, that's where everything is. I want you a cheap trick, right? I want you to want me, right? That's, that's really where it comes down to. You don't have conversations about boundaries. If she wants to be part of it, she will know what those boundaries are by living with you, by dealing with you, by being so into you that there's that conversation is, is, is pointless to have because she already knows, you know what? He's the best I can do. And fuck, I am not. I don't want anybody to think any different. So I'm going to take my Instagram down. I'm going to stop doing these things. I've had my fun. I whatever, but I want, this is, this is my ride or die. Like, what was it? Eva Mendez and Ryan Gosling. I think it was like Eva Mendez didn't want to have kids for the longest time until she met Ryan Gosling. And now she wants to have his babies, not baby babies. I got it. It's time to have babies. No, I want to have this motherfuckers babies. That's who I want. And so now suddenly she wants to be a mother because she met the right guy who's inspired her to want to like carry his seed into the next generation. That's desire. Well, that's not right. Oh, it's time to do what I got to do. Cause I'm obligated at this time in my life. Well, it's huge because then you're like, I want this guy's baby to tear up my body. Yes. You know, it will be worth it to have Ryan Gosling's sprogs tear up my uterus. That's like, I want his baby. Is she thinking that? No, but I'm like the, the, the proximate goal, the proximate, uh, you know, goal, I guess cause is she really was hot for him. All right. The ultimate goal is pregnancy and having his babies. So you have to like sort of put it into those perspectives. Nobody wants, sorry, Jonah, nobody wants her babies. You know, maybe this other girl did, but I would be, I wonder what his relationship is with the baby mama. Yeah. That'd be interesting. You want that? I said, simple. Hey, I got this guy. Right. Is he, was he baby trapped? Who knows? So where is the girl wrong? Yeah. So let me, uh, let me explain. Like a lot of people are saying, well, Jonah was just trying to lay down the law and he was red pill and everything. That's all you, all you red pill guys who don't want to be red pill while suddenly you want to be with Jonah. Um, yeah, he was, he was trying to lay down the law and everything, but he's doing it the wrong way. He was trying to make boundaries and by, by delivering ultimatums and those ultimatums were couched in, Oh, therapy speak like, Oh, you know, your needs, my needs, issues, you know, synergy, whatever the fuck, who cares. Right. It's this new age bullshit. Like you don't have those conversations. If there is already that tacit, you know, compliance, there's that it's not obligation. It's desire. Jonah Hill has probably never known any woman who he hasn't had to have sort of transactional nature with that, that clearly we can see from the texts right there. It's a different, there's a qualifiable difference between a transactional sex and validational sex or transactional relationship. And then a validational race relationship and the validation. I mean, like, like Eva Mendez and Ryan Gosling, that's a validational relationship. The transactional nature is what can I get from this guy? Women marry lifestyles. They don't marry men unless they're having a validational relationship with that man. And it doesn't matter. He's ride or die. I'm going to break him out of prison because I'm so hot for him. So I remember three years ago, you said this about Harry and Megan Merkle. What were you on there? Now, would you say, cause this kind of relates to Jonah Hill and the whole genuine desire thing. Megan Merkle didn't have genuine desire. Megan Markle, whatever. She, obviously this whole thing was a transaction, right? And now we see where Harry is. Mm-hmm. Where is the correlation between the two Jonah Hill and Megan Markle and Markle and, and Harry? Uh, Harry is codependent. That's where he's at. Harry had like, remember Harry, Prince Harry used to be a helicopter pilot and he used to like be at wild ass frat parties and shit like that until he met a, what's she like four years older than he is three, five years old, something like that. And she's a divorcee and like, she fit the bill for his like ideal. And it sucks when you meet someone like Megan, who is clearly, I could, I can make a diagnosis of BPD. I'm not a doctor, like she's borderline personality disorder, but I'm more inclined to say she's got NPD, which is narcissistic personality disorder, which is still equally as bad, like, you know, cluster B kind of shit. Um, but when you mix that with a guy who was very like terminally blue pill, like, like Prince Harry, that's when you get what you got. I, I made this prediction back in 2018, I think with, uh, Pat Campbell, God rest his soul. Um, I said that, you know, I followed the Prince Harry thing since like there before they got married, like back in like 2015, something like that. And I told, I told, um, I told Pat then I said, uh, Prince Harry will probably off himself will delete himself as a result of this. If it, yeah, I mean, we'll get to that point. And here we are getting to that point right now. Now there's a, the difference between Jonah Hill is like Jonah Hill is at least an actor and he has some sort of like, he has probably has more sense of self-worth than Prince Harry does because Jonah is that, you know, is he, he has, let's just say this Prince Harry doesn't have anything approaching the social proof and the preselection that a Jonah Hill would have, even as in his, his present condition. It's not like fat guys can't get laid, but it's, um, it's the mindset. It's the blue pill mindset that Jonah has. That's his limitation. His primary, I wish he would read my book. Quite honestly, Jonah police rational mail available on Amazon. Um, but, uh, then you look at somebody like a Prince Harry and he is just, he is, I hate to say it. Like sometimes I think he's a lost cause because now think about this. When Jonah Hills breaks up with, with surfer girl or whatever, he can hit the ground running on his feet because he's got friends and he's got a, you know, it's Hollywood. There are chicks that still want to fuck him. When Prince Harry splits with Meghan Markle, is there any girl that wants to fuck Prince Harry? Who's no longer a Prince because they sort of like, you know, decrowned him or dethroned him, whatever it is. Probably not. He's going to be in a world of fucking hurt. I hope his boys, I hope his brother, I'd hope everybody else sort of come back to him after all of this. Cause it's looking like it's going to go that way. And my main concern is that they put him on like, like self deletion watch, you know, because that's what I will be mostly concerned with. Because guys who get zeroed out like that, who their whole world is their wife or their girlfriend or whatever. And that girlfriend is BPD or MPD and they're very blue pill as a, as a bad combination when you get zeroed out. So but as far as Jonah is concerned, where did he do? What did he do right? And what did he do wrong? Well, he's right in his, he's like, I don't want you going out with these chicks. I'm laying down the law here. And if that's the, I don't know what the official reason was, why they broke up in the first place, but if it had to do with that, then the way he went about doing it or wait, I don't know who broke up with who, but the way he was talking to her, trying to establish boundaries, he's explicating rather than demonstrating. He should have been demonstrating your Jonah fucking Hill. Leave ejected. There's, there's probably lots of women in Hollywood who would want to fucking from here to Tuesday and have that relationship and won't give you the, the therapy speed, the therapist speech. Right. So just, just get out. Just like say, you know what I'm like, why are you wasting time? It's just pragmatism. I'm going to go full Alan Roger Curry here. You're she's a, she's a, a time waster. What was it? A I'd say a malicious time was or something like that. Yeah. But she's, she, she, she's a waste of your time. It was a more pragmatic move. He, his only fault is he should have done it a lot sooner. But is he a misogynist for doing that? No, but that's the way it's going to be interpreted. So if he goes and he puts these things out, what happens is when guys like that get into the situation where they're trying to make their case, plead their case all the time, what they're really doing on a, on a visceral level, on a, on a limbic, like hindbrain lizard brain level for women, what that guy's doing is saying, this is why you should fuck me and not fuck those guys here. Look, I do this. I meet your needs. We're in the trust nest. We go to therapy. I want you. I love you. I've asked you before, blah, blah, blah. And it seems like controlling or to judge mentalism and everything. And the reason like, those are the, those are the, those are the feelings of creepiness. Like if it wasn't Jonah Hill, he'd be a creep for asking those things. But it's Jonah Hill. So we kind of have to get cut him a little bit of slack because he has social proof. But the, the idea that when, when guys make lists of like why women won't sleep with me or why, uh, why my wife rejected me or whatever, those guys who are like the Excel spreadsheet makers, those list makers, the reason why women want to punch them in the face is because the underlying message is, look, I have all these rational reasons. Like every single time you've denied me and I'm actually the guy you should be fucking and not guys that you're teaching, you know, surfing too, because I'm way, I'm way higher quality than there. It's not going to matter. You will never win an emotional argument with a woman with."}
