Hello there, Junior. How's it going? Hello there, children. Class is in session. Welcome to the number one podcast of the Red Pill, because I said so. Because I am an authority. You will respect my body. Somebody get me that sound drop. Yeah, yeah, thank you. I know. My thumbnail kung fu is superior. Yes, yes, yes. Thank you very much. Through all these hoops. Oh, this is a good one. It's too good just not to share. Hey, is there a problem? No. What's going on? Then why were you staring at me? I'm sorry? It's all on video, sir. Ma'am, I was working out, minding my own business. Now you're filming me? Oh, is it because of what I'm wearing? Is it because of what you're wearing? News flash! I didn't wear this for you. Ma'am, I wasn't looking at you while you were... My followers are gonna have... What is that? A field day. Cool, film your video. I didn't do anything. What, are you gonna show me some tips on how to perfect my form, but you have to do it hands-on? Nobody was gonna give you tips. I'm sure you have great technique. Yeah, I bet you know. You've been studying me long enough. Is there a problem? There's no problem. Then why were you just staring at me? What are you talking about? Nobody was looking either of you. Oh, so you weren't just eye-banging me while I was doing my glute workout? I have literally never seen you before in my life. She has a boyfriend. A month and a half strong. Be better, sir. Congrats, you have a boyfriend. Happy anniversary. I have your harassment in high-def 4K. Were you staring at me? Who the f*** are you guys? All right here, bro. Why are there so many ring lights? Cover up. You know, we shouldn't have to do this, but here we are doing it. Very cool. Yeah, cry us now. The whole thing. Good luck. It's on tape. You're gonna put this on YouTube? Yeah, guy does nothing at the gym and gets harassed? I saw you looking at me. Who the f*** is this? You're on camera. He was staring at me too. We got five ring lights up in here. Is this the guy who's been staring at you, Kaitlyn? Yeah, this is the creep. Been watching your live stream. Let's see the instant replay. I'd love to check it out. Get out of my gym. Easily a couple thousand followers. The live stream bandits are a group of thieves who have been robbing gym. It was all just to rob me. Women are not naturally crazy. I think that men bring out the crazy in women. Because they have this double standard. They believe that they can do whatever the f*** they want. And act however the f*** they want. I can counter that right now. I mean, maybe not you. I can counter that and it has nothing to do with me. It has to do with lesbians. Lesbians have the highest incidence of domestic violence. And they have the highest incidence of domestic violence. Yeah, because I can f***ing punch a b***h. They bring out the crazy in each other. What is going on with 18 to 25 year old young men? I have talked to more moms this week about their sons who are either smoking pot. Poop earrings, duly noted. And or don't have a job. Failed out of school. Have no purpose or direction in life. And the parents are absolutely beside themselves. Not only that, but on the group call Tuesday night with the Empowered Moms group. There were five moms on the call. I'm pretty sure she's got an OnlyFans. This same set of circumstances. Are you experiencing this as a parent? We have got to find a way to move these young men forward. And the only thing we control is what we're doing as parents. Very red pill. That they act like little kids. Or that they're too sensitive. Or that, say, if you reject them, they get mad. You know, typical red pill. Oh, you're talking about guys in the red pill community. Yes. Those that are being 20 right now. And absolute whores in the club. Whatever not. In 10 years, they're going to be 30. Trying to settle down. They're going to complain that they were ran through their whole life. But while they were partying for the past 10 years. All the good girls got cuffed by the good guys. And so now when they look at all the men that are options. They're going to be competing with the now 20 year old good girls. And be stuck. Why? Because all the good guys are gone. You missed your chance being a fucking whore, bitch. I get from a woman that he couldn't get from a cook, a cleaner and a hooker. Fuck who? No, no, no. You're right. Probably if it's just a woman with relationship. Definitely it would be loyalty and the stability of that woman. Your cook couldn't leave. She might say, oh, she needs all of those people. There's no. It would be the stability and the loyalty. Definitely. I'm not saying that's not wrong. Right. But that goes back to why it's better to date girls with lower body counts. Because they're more loyal. Yeah, but that's. I don't know about all of that. My girl's a virgin on her wedding night. She has an 80 percent chance of a happy marriage. If she sleeps with more than five people, it drops down to 30 percent. It's 25, 27, 30, 31 years old. And she's doing very good at work and she's earning a good income and she's not married. But she's successful. She's a good woman. She takes care of her parents. She has good manners. Good. Good. Every time she comes to the masjid or the mambarga or the religious gathering or even at some auntie's home. The first thing they ask her is what? Why aren't you married? And the last thing before she leaves, why aren't you married? And it's such a silly question because if there was someone suitable, she would have been married. Nobody wants to live alone. We human beings are created to love and to be loved. And we want and yearn for companionship. Nobody wants to be alone. So many of those young women, they have now, you know, they're earning well, so they have their own homes. They have, you know, successful jobs. They're very independent. And when you live alone and you're working and you need, you yearn that companionship, right? I know who my God is. Hallelujah. In the last 20 years of research in neuroimaging, behavior genetics, developmental psychology, neuropsychology can be boiled down to this phrase. Your child is born with more than 400 psychological traits that will emerge as they mature. And they have nothing to do with you. So the idea that you are going to engineer personalities and IQ and academic achievement skills and all these other things just isn't true. Your child is not a blank slate on which you get to write. The better view is that your child is a genetic mosaic of your extended family. Which means this is a unique combination of the traits that run in your family line. I like the shepherd view. You are a shepherd. You don't design the sheep. The engineering view makes you responsible for everything. Everything that goes right and everything that goes wrong. This is why parents come to us with such guilt, more guilt than we've ever seen in prior generations. Because parents today believe that it's all about them and what they do. And if they don't get it right or if their child has a disability, they've done something wrong. When in fact the opposite is true. This has nothing to do with your particular brand of parenting. So I would rather that you stop thinking of yourself as an engineer and step back and say, I am a shepherd to a unique individual. Shepherds are powerful people. They pick the pastures in which the sheep will graze and develop and grow. They determine whether they're appropriately nourished. They determine whether they're protected from harm. The environment is important, but it doesn't design the sheep. No shepherd is going to turn a sheep into a dog. Ain't going to happen. I like that dude. That guy is Russell Barkley, Dr. Russell Barkley. Probably one of the few actual legitimate clinical psychologists out there who's actually doing anything. We're going to return back to that one. I'm actually saving that one in the queue here because that was so good. Ah, right. Yeah, you won't be turning sheep into dogs or anything like that. I like that because a lot of blank slate crap is sort of finding its way back into the manuscript right now. And I think if we're going to keep things 100, if we're going to keep things empirically sound, we kind of need to root out the emotionalism. And so that's what I plan on doing today. How are you guys doing? Oh, man. All right. God damn right. Okay. So here's this is camera one. Camera two is now in effect, so I got that right there. It's on auto focus, though. Maybe I need to fix that out. How are we doing today, guys? How are we doing? Let me just a few things. I am back in the saddle one more time here. Let's see. Can you show me? Thank you very much. Yes. Yeah. The FBI is actually looking for me. No lie. No lie. Glenn, they're looking for all of us. You know, we must hang together or we'll surely hang separately. Oh, man. Matt Walsh got got axed. I don't know if he's off the daily wire, but I do know that he is off of YouTube right now. And they did. They banned him. And, of course, that's the topic du jour in the Tempula sphere and whatever. Trad Conosphere. I don't know. So I have been. I've been very busy. I did. I did a show with Miguel right here, right here on this channel. And we talked about economics, not in the sense in the Red Pill sense. As you know, I don't do economics. I don't do politics. I don't do religion. I don't do race. I don't do any of that crap unless it crosses over into the Red Pill. And then I will be more than happy to talk to you about that. So there are people who do politics way better than me. There are people that do martial arts way better than me. There's people who do fitness way better than me. There's people who do religion and all this other stuff I've mentioned already way better than me. Go look at them. Go watch them. That's what you're looking for, really. I am not the dude who's going to sort of feed you, spoon feed you, whatever your pet ideology happens to be. Thanks, man. Today is the Feast of St. George in the Orthodox Church. Oh, my goodness. Hello. Oh, man. Speaking of hallelujah. Thank you very much, feed freak. Was that a superstition? No. It's funny. I've got the well, the net cam is actually in effect, guys. I just wanted to let you know. I'm trying to set up the GoPro so I can actually come into all this. So I've got that going on. I've got the new camera set up in here. I'm starting to get to, I've just about got the new studio where I want it to be. I'm still monkeying around with the lighting in here. I'm not really happy with everything, but that's just me. I don't know. I started working on the actual classes for Player's Handbook. If you have my fifth book, which I actually published almost a year ago. It's coming up on a year. I did. I'm starting to do the Player's Workshop series of classes, and it will be the very first time I've ever done any kind of class. I know lots of people who have. Aaron Clary's got a new one out. Cultivate Crypto has their, I think it's quarter two. It's coming out. They're already in Miami. I believe it's already open. I don't have an affiliate link just yet, Miguel. I'm trying to get in early this time. Help me help you. Hey, Rolo, love your books. Thank you very much. And love your WordPod classes. Just want to show some love. Despite my dislike for your Access Vegas show. You know what? Say my name. It's going to be an acquired taste, my friend. I'm glad you brought that up, though, because I wanted to. That's actually kind of pertinent. Thumbnails aside, today is actually not going to be exclusively about fat chicks. But if you go and you put no fat chicks in like a Twitter post. I mean, if you could just go, you know, women, we need to lose weight. Put that in a Twitter post and you happen to be in the manager. Trust me. You want engagement. There's nothing more engaging than no fat chicks or some variation of that. No, actually, the reason I wanted to. Actually, I'm the double entendre of the thumbnail today. Is I kind of want to go over what's wrong with the Manosphere. And I was put on this topic because of the show that I did with Miguel on Thursday. And so I did that show. And then I did I did recording principal videography, I should say, for the upcoming players workshop classes that I'm working on. That are that sync with the fifth book. So if you've read the fifth book and you read the introduction right at the end of the introduction, I make mention that there are going to be a series of classes. Well, they're coming up. So and we are officially in production right now. So just to, you know, if you have a question about that, there you go. Yeah, well, so, you know, I got I got kind of people give me mixed messages or not mixed messages. Actually, they're actually pretty certain about it. But I think people are a little bit confused. Like when I do something like Access Vegas, a lot of people think that like when I do a show and I go and I have Richard Reeves on. Right. I was on that was an Access Vegas show, technically. So people like they love that show. They love them or hate them, but they love that show. When we had Myron and Fresh on, they love that show, of course, because we kicked off Toy Hardy or Myron kicked off Toy Hardy. There is a story behind that. And ask me about it sometime. I'm not at liberty to sort of broadcast it here. I will tell you privately if you ever ask me. But there is, it's a mixed bag right now. And I'm wondering, have we reached sort of peak manosphere? I was asked by Myron and Fresh, as you guys know, I've used this, I won't play the clip, I'm sorry. But I was asked in March of 2021 if I thought that the manosphere was going mainstream. And what was my answer? I hope it isn't. I really hope it isn't. And here we are. This is why I hoped we weren't. Because the manosphere is mostly mainstream right now. When you have, let's see, Tucker Carlson, when you have, who else? Who else can we name? What the hell is it? Piers. Piers Morgan. When you have people who are in the quote, I mean, I guess for lack of a better term, the mainstream. And it's really hard to define mainstream right now. I was trying to think about that too, because that's a sort of a category that, again, notes today. One of the categories I have that I want to dig into is the different varieties or what sort of, I think there's new branches, I think, of the manosphere. We think, when I think of the manosphere, I think of the classics, right? I think of the red pill, which I would include myself in. I think of the old school PUAs or the game enthusiasts, the game advocates, like maybe the Troy Francis's and the, used to be MLD, but also James Tusk. I would throw those guys into the game category. And then you've got the sort of the, I guess, the MGTOWs. It's really weird, because there was a time where the MGTOWs sort of peaked, and then they kind of fell off. I mean, I realize they're still around. But then they were kind of displaced by sort of Black Pill, Doom Pill, Sperg Pill, whatever pill. And then there's variations of that. The white pill, the green pill, the orange pill, whatever, your mom pill, I don't know. Am I juicing? I am not juicing, thank you very much. Do you have any? Because if you have some, I will be happy to do it. I don't know anybody who has juice or gear, trend. No, I do not shoot. I'm, dude, look at me. I'm not that jacked. And no, it's not the TRT. I'll move, if you'd like me to explain that, I will be happy to explain it to you for $2, for a few dollars more. All right, yeah, so there's, I can remember when, thank you, yes, I am 100%, I agree with you. Okay, small fonts aside. So there's MGTOW, there was the, well, like I said, trad cons were certainly part of that. Now they're a bigger thing than they used to be, primarily because they've found sort of safe entry, I think, into Manosphere topics now. And so we'll, thank you, all right. Say my name. Just want the drop. Is that what you want? Just want the drop? $5 for a sound drop. Here you go, come on. So we used to have MGTOW, we used to have Doompill, well, I guess we now have Blackpill. I guess still there. Then there was the Luxemaxers. They were all kind of variations, little offshoots from what used to be the True Force Loneliness guys. There used to be, I guess, would it be True Force Loneliness? I think so. Or the Forever Alones, that's what it was, from 4chan. And yes, I'm aware of 4chan, I'm not that old. What do you got there? Truth is out there, yes, he has rolled all, okay. Somebody needs to, if you give me that, I'll be happy to play it. I don't have one. Damn right. I am, so when I look at this, I always see them sort of as like branches from the main root of the tree, which is actually Red Pill. And so when I hear people, especially like guys who should know fucking better, like Corey Wayne should know better. Or when I look at guys who are like sort of the prodigal sons, it follows a script. And I'm gonna talk about the script a little bit today too. But when I see guys who used to be, who made quite a bit of money off of the Red Pill, quite a bit of money off of the same audience that they despise now. So I gotta pull out the stops a little bit. Because when I, I've talked about the Purple Pill, and I don't mean the Purple Pill podcast, but I mean like the Purple Pill in the sense that it's half red, half blue. And that's where that really, that phrase comes from, or that terminology I should say comes from. And it's, I love you too, man. It's a designator. I think a lot of people think that when I say somebody is Blue Pill, or if I say somebody is Purple Pill, people seem to think that that's like some sort of insult, or it's like an invective. It's not, it's just a designation. I've written several essays, articles, whatever, on how we shouldn't hate guys who are beta. We shouldn't hate guys who are Blue Pill. If we're not here to help and educate and equip, then what the hell are we doing here? Well, apparently it's entertaining. And apparently it's anything that's gonna get eyes on screen, or click-through rate, or impressions, or whatever. I'm gonna explain to you guys how YouTube actually works these days today too, because I think that's important. Now, how does that relate to the Red Pill? It relates to it in your consumption of this material. So when I hear people go, oh, those guys just sound like they're whiny babies. Nah! These guys think that they're entitled to sex, and oh man, I can't believe these incels and these Red Pill guys. That's not Red Pill. That's something else, and you can point fingers at whatever the hell you want to, and it's easy, I think it's almost easier to make a caricature out of incels, and it's almost easier to make a caricature out of sort of modern-day guys who just don't wanna get up and do anything. No, there's no, maybe you're right, but there's also no incentive for them to do anything, and I had this conversation again with Miguel on Thursday, and we got into some interesting topics, and I was taking notes actually as I was sitting there, and so they've transferred into today's show because there's some more things I wanted to go into in a little bit more detail, but the number one thing that was sort of like, you know, chaps my hat, chaps my hat, is the fact that, oh, RP Grifters who pivot and OnlyFanGirls share a similar trait, they hate their followers, yes, and you kind of have to a little bit, but what gets me is like, there's this progression, I think, of guys who are never really about it, and now suddenly they can't repeat the success that they used to. They had a really great offer, or they had a great hit, or they had some great product, or they had some video, or they had something that went viral, or they had something that really sort of put them on the map, and they started believing their own bullshit, and they can't get back to that again. It's like, you wanna, in the process, I should say, of believing your own bullshit, you just kind of develop this ego. You develop this sort of personality that you think is you, but it's not really you, but it's originated when you first had your first hit. It's like having a hit song, right? Suddenly it's like, oh, I've got a top 40, I got, I'm gonna give you band analogy, sorry, but when you have a hit song and it's on the Billboard top 40 or whatever, and you're like at number one, you're like, I must be a fucking musical genius. No, you had the right place, right time, right niche, right genre, whatever, and can you repeat it? That was the true test of a real, like a super group, or a real, like a real musician will be able to repeat that. You'll have more than one hit song, they're all one hit wonders, right? And I would argue that a lot of the guys that I see in the manuscript today are one hit wonders. You're gonna get all kinds of band music analogies today, sorry, but that's just where I'm at. And we've got a lot of one hit wonders, we've got a lot of like, maybe they were earworms at one time, maybe it was like, oh, remember that, remember that song, remember that phrase, remember that, who's producing, who's consistently producing good content? Who's consistently coming out there and educating? Who's consistently doing these things? Who's stuck with it no matter what? I gave you guys this one analogy a long time ago, maybe it's a bad analogy, but like, I love Slayer, okay? Slayer has never changed, they have never deviated from like their back, their core audience and the core music at Thrash was it, all the way up until what, 2019, I think is when they called it quits. And really still, other than Dave or Tom Uriah, like the rest of the guys, I think they still wanna play. But they never stopped, they never sold out, they never did a disco album, right? They never tried to do some sort of top 40 thing, they never like changed their look and shaved their heads, I mean, except for Kerry King, but they never really deviated from their core sound because that's what they were good at and still are good at, ancient, but still good, right? And I think of like how many guys in the sphere are like the Slayers of the sphere, right? How many guys have been doing it for a long time and never went purple pill, never said, you know what, I was wrong all along, right? I remember when Julian Blanc from RSD decided that he was gonna just sort of turn tail and run. I remember when he was saying, oh yeah, sorry, he got caught. I got caught, so I've had an epiphany and now I wanna talk about the power of positivity and let's read some tea leaves and feel good about ourselves. That's like Slayer doing the disco album. That's like guys saying, well, here's what's big, let's get into that right now. So who are the cover bands and who are the, well, that's probably another story, but who are the one hit wonders? Who are the people who tried to change their sound because the music was different and now they wanna appeal to a broader audience? Who did that? Call themselves, oh, we've matured. We've matured as a band. I've matured as a red pill content creator. It doesn't change the core truth. It doesn't change the fundamentals. That's where it comes. Oh, we'll get into that. By the way, I have a really great announcement, but I'm gonna hold off until probably about the hour mark before I give it to you, so you gotta stick around. Stick around, stick around. That's a sound drop I need from Predator. Only me, so I'm the Slayer of the Manosphere. Mike Cernovich, you think? I don't think Mike Cernovich is. Mike Cernovich is the PT Barnum of the internet age. And I'm really kind of hesitant to even throw that one out there because he hasn't done anything in a very long time. I mean, significantly. I can remember when he wanted, I remember when Mike Cernovich put $10,000 down on the red pill movie with Cassie J's The Red Pill, which was not really The Red Pill. It was really, I'm a feminist and this is my story of like giving up feminism, which I called, by the way, back in 2015. And the only reason she had any kind of distribution for that documentary was because Mike Cernovich got behind it and says, hey, I'm gonna put $10,000 down on this. And if everybody matches it, I'll come up with 10 grand and we'll produce this film. And Milo Yiannopoulos jumped in. I don't know if you remember this. I do, I was there. 3000 years ago, Gandalf, I was there. And people are like, what's this Red Pill? Most people probably in this chat have no idea what I'm talking about. The Cassie J movie, it was actually produced, or I should say it was shot with the guys from My Voice for Men. And was it Paul Elam and Dean Esme, and you know, it was like, it was just tearful, kind of like, oh man, nobody knows our problems. And I think what's interesting, almost ironic, is like the same shit that they were talking about in that film back in 2015, 2016, they're still rehashing on, you know, Michael Knowles. It's like, now it's just like, it's almost like, you know how Star Wars sucks now? Because Disney got ahold of it. You know how like your old franchises really kind of suck? I love the Lord of the Rings. I like Star Wars up until the last, those stupid last three movies. And they've kind of like destroyed those things because they want to push, you know, a woke narrative in them and everything. I've had those conversations before, even Marvel movies. I'm a nerd, I'm a closet nerd. You guys probably already know that. I play Warhammer, right? Even my favorite nerd, they want to find some way to make it more wokesy. And so what I see as a result and really what is that, how does that translate to an old franchise that you really loved, right? If you really, I love Dune. The first, the new movie that they put out with Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya or whatever her name is, I hope they don't ruin it with the second one. I'm pretty sure they will. Rings of Power for the Lord of the Rings, ruin. I liked the movie. I actually didn't hate it, but I saw what the, it's like, the reason why I didn't hate it is because I'm so used to having, being sold on a narrative. And I think that a lot in the manosphere right now is like Disney ruining Star Wars. It's like Amazon ruining Lord of the Rings. It's like, I don't know who ever did the Dune, right? Hopefully it doesn't go woke. I know it will. It's like seeing your favorite movie franchise going, oh, we need the all-female Ghostbusters. Ghostbusters is great. Why would you ruin the movie? Think of something new. No, we can't think of anything new. That's what I'm seeing happen to the manosphere right now. And maybe that's a good thing. Maybe that helps us sort of like bust ourselves down and get back to basics again. Because all I'm seeing is nothing but like purple. Really what I would define and have defined in the past is purple pill. That's what I'm seeing sort of develop right now. What do you got here for me? I've been following the manosphere for three years. It was pretty easy for me to determine who's useful information and who is providing repetitive entertainment. Thank you, Thomas. However, you are probably an outlier. Because when I listened to just like basic bitches on, name the freaking TikTok, name the Instagram video, name whatever. The mom in the video I was just mentioning right now is people want to jump in on these topics. Now, suddenly a guy like Richard Reeves, who I do have some respect for."}
