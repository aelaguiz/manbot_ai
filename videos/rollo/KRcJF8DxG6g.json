I only have one rule. Everyone fights, no one quits. If you don't do your job, I'll shoot you. You get me? We get you, sir! Welcome to the Roughnecks. Rock Cats Roughnecks! Hoot! Not the intro I was gonna use, but I think it's appropriate. Backlasses in session, that's for damn sure. We're in the real school now. We're all in the real school now. Still haven't got my voice entirely back yet. But, I am live from Reno, Nevada. This is the end of Fresh and Fit. I'm gonna tell you why I don't think so. Coming up next. Woohoo! Woohoo! Woohoo! Before I've even met that girl, I'm like, she's cheating on you. Why? Because she likes you for your lifestyle and she knows plenty of men with your lifestyle. For better. For worse. For work. For richer. For richer. For poorer. For poorer. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We hit that snag about 20 times in counseling. Brill made it very clear to Jonathan, you cannot be broke. In sickness. In sickness. And in health. And in health. To love. To love. Cherish. Cherish. And to obey. We didn't talk about that one in counseling. We did talk about that in counseling. Yes we did. So you want me to repeat that again or you wanna just keep going? I think we can keep going. Alright. It's not easy for the woman when she hits a certain age. We're talking about women who've kind of had this high life and then they've stopped getting offers because maybe now she's hit like 38, 40. And then it's almost like they've kind of gone into this dark hole now. It's so toxic. It's like horrible. Well here's the thing. Most men don't feel sorry for those women and I'll tell you why. The reason men don't feel sorry for them is because the experience that she begins to go through when she's older is the experience 90% of men go through every single day. The guy who works at the post office. The guy who helped you pack your bag. The guy who delivered your Amazon parcel. The guy in your class. The guy that you worked with. Most guys are invisible. It is only the high value guys that catches women's attention. The guy who's tall, attractive, in shape, successful. So when women who have had that taste of a high life, have been that desirable, gotten all the attention and everything, they then get to a point where now they're being treated how most guys are treated, guys don't feel sorry for them. A lot of guys feel that if you wanted to have a partner, have a family, settle down, you get to that point in life and you haven't done that, it's because you fucked up because you definitely had an abundance of opportunity to do that. So it's very difficult for a lot of guys to have sympathy because for a lot of guys it's like, this is how it's been for us since day one and most of us don't even get to a point where we can attract a girl like you. You've been there. You've had the chance to get those guys but because you decided to play around, maybe you didn't want it serious and that's fine. There's nothing wrong with it but you have to accept what comes with the path that you choose. I said, do you love your wife? He said, yes. I said, do you want to save your marriage? He said, yes. I said, can you place your wife's happiness above your own? So what do you mean? I said, I mean, are you willing to place her dreams, her wishes, her desires above your own? He said, I don't think I can do that. I said, you probably won't stay married then. God tells us that the greatest among us shall be the least among us. Great doesn't always mean being first. That's why God has us open doors and pull out chairs, because these actions require somebody to decrease. She's not a Christian. And if you understand that decreasing actually propels you in the relationship. Amen. Booty. Go ahead, brother. If I got to chase my wife, then I'm going to have to keep chasing her to keep up. That's right. That's right. You men that chase women, the moment you start chasing that woman, you're going to have to keep chasing up. Keep it up. Keep it. You have to keep it up. That's right. And once she see you chasing up, she going to literally do things that make you run it down. That's right. I will never chase a woman long as I'm black. No. And far as I know, God ain't changing my color. Married for 30 years to just the most amazing man. We have eight incredible kids. And five years ago, we took the kids up to the mountains about three hours away from home, went mountain biking. And he was in he crashed his bike very, very severely suffered a traumatic brain injury that almost killed him. We spent two. I am considering getting a divorce so that I can move on with my life. Nothing with my relationship with my husband would change. That's a great example of how. Right. So women meet across and up. Success hierarchies. Eddie Curry. You know who he is, right? And he went to this really interesting story about how he had a baby with his high school sweetheart. Then he joined the NBA. They got divorced right away. She took him to court for child support, whatever. They work something out right before the child turned 18. She took him to court and said that he has been paying anything. He hasn't said, no, your honor, I've paid over a million dollars. Here's all the receipts. Here's this. This check here, cashier's check here, whatever wire transfer. Here's all my receipts. The judge said, well, this wasn't paid to the state. This was paid directly to her. So therefore, it's a gift. So now you owe over a million dollars in back. And I had been giving her money the whole time. I would just give her cash. I would send it to her account. And my judge is dropped. You've heard of this before. No, I know that's that's how it happens. They're going to count it as a gift. Unless you're writing. This is child support. You have to have your own personal records that saying, hey, this is you have to have receipts of saying this is child support email. This is child support. In your, in your, your wires, when they wire it, child support. Too old to date an 18 year old. No, no. Yes. Come on. When I was 19, I was dating a 30 year old. Oh, heavens to Betsy. You old man. You have a daughter. Probably also because I just have some semblance of a 18 is a child. 19. I was all around the block at 18. Well, I'm a whore. Men try to change or control men. One reason is that women have this idea that men are doing it wrong because they don't do it the way a woman would. We attempt to control things that we don't understand. First of all, control is rooted in fear. And when we lack understanding, many times it will generate fear. And to manage the fear, we attempt to gain control, whether it's control over a situation or another person. This is why it's so important to understand the difference between the sexes. Understanding breeds compassion for one another. We're going to, yeah, we're going to do this. A lot of guys keep asking me, do you think that? And I think we talked about this last time I was here. Do you think that the red pill is going to go mainstream? And I'm like, well, it depends on what you think is mainstream. First off, is it like, are we going to see it on CNN or MSNBC? Are people going to hear about it around the water? What's this new red pill thing? That's I don't think so. I answered that yesterday. I hope not because the red pill is something that is, I mean, one of the reasons why we use the red pill as an analogy. And a lot of people, when they hear it or they hear certain things like the red pill or unplugging, like I'll say unplugging from the matrix or your blue pill or your purple pill or whatever, that kind of stuff. And I think when an immature mind kind of doesn't get the metaphor, that's one thing I try not to use online is metaphor and allegory. And because everyone will take it literally. You know, the blue pill is not really the right allegory for that. Let me tell you exactly what I think. And so you have this literalist kind of mindset that kind of tears all that stuff apart. I hope not because what I was a little bit more concerned about with the red pill going mainstream, I've been talking about this for a long time. If you go back to like, say, 2012, 2013, Roosh even said, hey, this is the year. It was 2013. This is the year that the red pill is going to go mainstream. I'm like, still waiting for my red pill mainstream check. It's not in the mail. It hasn't shown up in the mail yet. And then in 2018, I did a State of the Manisphere address, which I'm actually, it's on the 21 convention site, but it's something I'm proud of. I don't, you know, you go look at it. I think it's, I think it still holds up very well today. And I talked about it. See how Roald doesn't hate, you know what I'm saying? Well, I mean, I don't hate the stuff that I did. I did some pretty good stuff. I thought that was a very good, and if you go back and I was actually reviewing that for that, for yesterday's show. And I was like, man, a lot of this stuff that I was talking about just two and a half years ago is coming to pass right now. And I did in that show or in that talk, I did a SWOT analysis. Do you know what a SWOT analysis is? Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, I think. Like when they're trying to brainstorm, like where are we going to take this company in the next like three years or five years or something? So strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. And so I was kind of breaking down like what's the, like the Manisphere? What are the strengths? What are the weaknesses? And as if it was, you know, we're all in this together, so let's talk about this. And one of the things I was, one of the threats I think is either weaknesses or the threat. I think it was the threats. I said, you know, there's the Red Pill at some point is going to have sort of a PR crisis. I don't know what it's called. Maybe it's not. Crisis isn't really the word, but like we're going to get to a point where it goes mainstream. And then the people who are taking it mainstream, my main concern was that the people who are supposed to be an authority on the Red Pill aren't necessarily the authority that ought to be out there telling the story of the Manisphere. Or the Red Pill, or what is this about? Because people use the Red Pill in so many different ways and in so many different contexts right now that it gets very confusing. So when you throw something out that sounds like, oh, it sounds like a buzzword. It sounds like a catchphrase. It sounds like something that is easy to hate on, right? It's easy to, it's a convenient villain is what I called it. And so when you give somebody, it's like the alt-right, or it was the Red Pill, or it was just something that sounds sinister and it's easy for kind of simple minds to sort of understand. Well, you can turn it into anything you want to at that point. So the Red Pill can be about politics. It could be about religion. It could be about anything. And to me, it's always been about intersexual dynamics. And like I keep saying, I wish there was some better term, some better abstraction we could use. But it's still the analogy from the Matrix movie still fits to this day. And I don't think it's going mainstream in the way that I think a lot of people would like to see it go mainstream. But my concern is that even if it did go mainstream, I would be a little bit concerned about the message that is being made. This is official. This is really what the Red Pill is all about because I think we're still kind of sorting that out. Because we did that because for the people that are wondering, when we did our Tim Pool analysis \u2026 What I'm about to share with you is fiction, and thank heavens for that. Or it would limit the thoughts of men through the use of a method so subtle that even Orwell didn't imagine it. I wouldn't wish it on any enemy unless my objective was power instead of truth. Dogma instead of logic. In this fictional world, information is freely accessible through a computer network that never sleeps and never forgets. The network is born without ideology or bias, sharing the wisdom and knowledge of humanity with an audience that is eager to receive it. Information is instantly transmitted across the world to connect man in ways that are hard to imagine for those born without ideology. before the network existed. For some odd reason, it favors images of cats. In this fictional world, employment is provided by companies. Humans formed these companies, but are independent of them. They don't laugh like humans laugh. They don't bleed like humans bleed. The supreme law of the time treats them as people. They function in small and large forms to provide products and services to mankind, employing individuals and giving regular payments in exchange for their labor. In this fictional world, companies need to be seen as positive in the eyes of the public. They must be seen as benevolent, charitable and moral according to the current trend and style of the time as determined by those with cultural power. In a group with a particular interest that a behavior or action of a company is impure, their sustained yells and screams will be heard across the globe for as long as they can produce breath in their lungs. It doesn't matter if the group is unfamiliar with the company or doesn't even buy its products. It will wage what it sees as a just crusade against any company that is the source of thought or action it accepts. In this fictional world, companies become fearful of not the most influential groups, but all groups. It becomes scared of criticisms that wouldn't dent its sales. It becomes worried about the lone petitioner with zero power. The nature of bureaucracy, the desire for ever growing profits and the urge for humans to control what they cannot control. What they cannot control are the best explanations for why a company tries to prevent one negative word from being said of it. Unsurprisingly, these companies eventually hire teams of people that attempt to establish relations with the public to appease the groups and mute the complaints before they are noticed. Yes, I know the screen is black. Yes, I know the screen is black. Go with it. In this fictional world, the companies decide not only to screen a worker for his ability or skill, but also his past behaviors and thoughts. They grab a giant straw and suck in all of the information available about the applicant, going so far as to hire other companies that solely exist to provide this personal data. They used to sit behind an applicant and make him log into private accounts, whereas thoughts and images are stored, but this became cumbersome. So it incentivized its future applicants to voluntarily reveal as much about themselves as possible, rewarding them with small perks and free products for their desired behaviors. The companies want to know all of the behaviors and thoughts, especially the thoughts of the applicant to predict whether he will cause a problem for the company in the future, a problem which exists only in the assembled minds of the groups which demand pure thought and pure action. The companies hired women of average intelligence who studied the easiest university subjects to assist with the screening process. They were trained to see humans as resources that must serve the company before serving themselves. The wise computer network is reprogrammed to work as a spy in this fictional world. The computer, not only a source of illumination and information, but a tool of denouncement. The virtual guillotine marks those men who had impure thoughts and dared to share them or acted impure and dared to display a photo or a video that captured the act. The network which never sleeps and never forgets becomes a research tool for companies to exclude those men who might offend of a thousand groups of 320 million people. It will dutifully record a pure thought today that will one day become impure and the guillotine will be wheeled out from the barracks and assembled in the public square. Its blade will be sharpened and lifted 15 feet high to be released onto the trapped neck of the sad man below. Sliding down the rail, picking up speed faster and faster until it meets the man's flesh and forever severs his thoughts from his body. But no, that would be too messy and too bloody. The modern guillotine is merciful. It merely takes away the man's bread. In this fictional world, a man with a wrong thought recorded by the network will be denied employment by all companies. His thought lost a trial in which the man who created it was not allowed to attend. He is forced underground to work in manual labor jobs as a bartender or as a bartender. No government figures involved and no law enforcement is called. He is not imprisoned and does not receive torture, but his bread is withheld from him as long as the network exists, which is of course longer than his lifespan. The young man bursting with ideas who dared to go against the elite mob will be denounced before he knows what the word denounced means. When he is denied future opportunities to make his bread, he will wonder, did they look for my name on the network? Yes, young man, they did. And it's no matter that you never committed a crime or laid hands upon another soul. But the company never saw his resume or credentials because the computer had already filtered them out of any company's consideration. If he lived in another era before the network existed, he could play with words to get reactions. He could pose scenarios that rushed to his mind and share with anyone that was listening. Those ideas were stored upon papers, hidden in cellars, or lifted from the public square where he mouthed them and floated up into the ether, never to be heard by those who weren't present. The network, however, records the ether. And an idea he shared five years ago appears on the screen alive with color, emotion, and power as if it were just uttered. And for that reason, the young man must forever pay the price of his bread for those impure thoughts. He must certainly pay the price when thoughts that are pure today become impure tomorrow. In this fictional world, the most brilliant men open their mouths, ready to fire off ideas that weigh heavier than stones. These ideas will improve society for both men and women, but he thinks of the guillotine and how his bread will be taken away if he dares to express his ideas. His mouth opens, his larynx prepares to vibrate to make the sound of his ideas, but then he remembers the network and he remembers his need for bread. So he shuts his mouth so fast that those around him can only hear his teeth snapping back into place. Sometimes a couple of words escape from his throat, but thankfully not enough to arouse the suspicions of those with their hands on the rope that controls the blade waiting to be released onto the necks of men whose self-control is not as strong. Gradually and surely, after many years of censoring himself, the thoughts stop coming in. Ideas that once burned so hotly in his head, ready to escape onto the public forum to be discussed and analyzed, to survive on their own accord, become covered in a blanket of thick snow, smoldering the fire that was fueled by his mind. His thoughts are now controlled. His mind is now tamed as he accepts the jail to which his mind has been sentenced. In this fictional world, when a man with fresh bread looks in the mirror, he knows his thoughts are approved as he puts the piece into his mouth. The saliva breaks it down, his tongue moves the matter back and forth in his throat. He feels pressure around his neck, like a chain wrapped around it. Every day the chain gets tighter and every day it becomes harder to swallow. He looks around at other men who have better bread than he, and he watches them chew and chew and swallow with such discomfort on their faces that they look like toddlers eating mush greens for the first time. The bread begins to feel, it seems, more impure in their mouths than the thoughts that they were once so willing to share. I'm afraid that my imagination has gotten the best of me. We don't live in a fictional world where man's bread is rationed on the purity of his thoughts, but a world where an idea is valued on its merits, where a man's personal life is his personal life and he does not fear sharing ideas, mere ideas, without worrying if he will lose his bread and where he can swallow that bread without feeling the presence of someone else in the room, listening to him eat and watching him live, ever ready to snatch the bread away. Let's be thankful that we all don't live in such a fictional world. Thanks for your patience on that one. That was a, let's say an essay from a very long time ago and updated for today's times. So I figured out, I think I might probably put that out on Substack at some point. Okay. Yeah, well, no, I knew that the screen was black. Thank you very much. Go with the dramatic effect, please, people. It's okay. Go with it. It's a theme. It's a theme for today. Yes, we're gonna talk about Fresh and Fit. In fact, we're gonna jump into that right now, I think. I don't know if anybody is aware of this already. Maybe you guys are, but Fresh and Fit got demonetized as of, I wanna say Friday of last week. And of course, that's been the topic du jour. I also wanted to point out that now is the time, before we even get into this discussion today, I want to just make it as clear as I possibly can in this sense, is that I'm getting the same kind of vibes, such as it is, that I got when Kevin Samuels passed over a year ago now. And watch around and watch what people say and watch what people do. And you will see who the real supporters are and who the real friends are and what the real opinions were. You're also gonna find the culprits involved in this as well. And I do believe that there are some culprits. Now, I'm not gonna give Myron and Fresh a free ride here because they effed up as well. And I'll explain to you why I believe that is. And yeah, I mean, I can go in and we can talk about their estranged bedfellows. Don't worry, we're gonna get to Logan Paul too. That's what the whole intro was for, right? That was actually what I had prepped for for this show. And now I gotta do something different. And you guys, where do you want me to start, really? We're gonna get into some of the ins and outs of marriage. And I thought maybe it would be a better intro or a better way to sort of start this episode with those particular clips, which I sort of hand curated. But before we do, I wanted to point out that Myron and Fresh are officially demonetized and not just their channel, but all of their affiliate channels too. I don't know what the reason is. Myron is kind of holding off from like really sort of telling anything to anybody about it. As far as I know, it came as a big surprise to them. And to the point where I know that they had Dr. Orion Terriban, which I was actually hoping I was gonna be able to sort of jump in on that show. But they had to cancel that show just so they could do an emergency podcast. And just to inform everyone that they had just become demonetized. And I'm sure it's a shock to the system. Now, I'm gonna do a little bit of, we're gonna go back in time a little bit here because I, of Rollo Tomas, of all people, I'm the one who's probably been part of the show or been affiliated with the show the longest. And I do, I understand that the show actually started in 2020, but I can remember the first time I went to Miami was actually the first time I had ever spent any length of time in Miami. I used to work in Orlando in my previous life when I was working in Wine and Spirits. We would go down there and do a, occasionally we do liquor promos, but that was about the length of it. But I started spending a lot of time in Miami as of January, 2021. And as you see, I've shown this video before, but I thought it was pertinent today too. March, 2021, those were sort of my four warnings, was that I hope that the red pill doesn't go mainstream. I didn't say it wouldn't, I just said, I hope that it wouldn't. Simply because I have gone through this before. I've gone through dealing with being zeroed out or people trying to zero me out, which is what's really kind of going on today in a mass respect. They're coming for everybody. And I'm not gonna tell you who they are just yet. And no, it's not who you think it is. But I also can't ignore, I can't look the other way when I say that, let's just say Martin and Fresh have decided, a while back, I guess, they decided to sort of jump into bed with some people who were probably not in their best, didn't have their best interests in mind. You gotta remember that we have sort of moved on from really the hustle economy to the cloud economy. It's like cloud economics right now. And so once you get to a point where your show is successful and it's built."}
