This is rumor control. Here are the facts. Alright, let's go. There you go. Alright. Alright. Alright, here we go. Ready for the cringe fest? Are you ready for the cringe? I should start. Yeah. Right, right, right, right, right. There will be boobs. Yeah, there should be boobs. No, there won't be boobs here. Not today. We're in Jibrizy Studio. Don't look at us. Hold on. Hold on a second. I'm reloading this. Man, we are like... There we go. Okay, now I got it. Oh, kill that off. Kill that off again. You don't need to replay it. You don't need to replay it. I'm still working it out. Alright. That don't loop it. Alright, there we go. Jeez, I didn't even know you could do that. I'll show you later. I must be a boomer. I don't know something technological. Jesus Christ. Alright, how's it going, guys? I'm sitting here with my good friend, Thor. Redpill Thor. Markinson, yes. And Thor happens to be here in Vegas. We're going to do a show, like a more dedicated show tomorrow. I'm intended on doing this show today because I was going to sort of say my side of this whole bullshit story that Brittany Venti and the rest of these fuckwits have decided that they're going to try to control the narrative here. So rather than that, I figured I'd do a rumor control show. And Thor happened to show up. And the reason why I'm glad you're here is because you know nothing about this. So maybe with fresh eyes, you can sort of get a better idea of what's been going on here. So I have to say a few things before we get started here. One is this is not in any way what I had intended to do with any of this bullshit that's been going on. So there's really three stories that are going on here. And the first one is it started back in December of 2022. So 2022. And I was approached by Lauren Southern's ex-husband. His name is, I'm not going to say his last name. His first name is Aaron. So people will know who we're talking about here. He hit me up and he asked me if I could put him in touch with some divorce attorneys or somebody who could help him with child custody laws, things like that. And I asked him, well, why is that? He said, well, because he was in Australia and Lauren Southern was in Canada at the time. And he was a fan of my show. He's read my books. We had a correspondence, let's say, since early December of 2022, I want to say. So I was trying to help him out with finding legal channels or legal outlets because it's kind of out of my wheelhouse. I don't know, but I know people who do. So I wanted to help him because he was going through what was essentially a child alienation case where she had their son in Canada. He's in, I believe he's a U.S. citizen or he has dual citizenship. I'm not really entirely sure, but I know that he works for the U.S. government. I know he has a U.S. contract. So everybody wants to say he's a fed. And even Lauren Southern played that up in her recent video where she was sort of coming clean about the fact that she'd been divorced for the last 18 months, maybe 18 months, then maybe two years now. And she's still wearing her wedding ring. She's still playing it like some good trad wife. And the fact of the matter is, is that I'm listening and I'm talking and having these really kind of intense conversations with Aaron. And at the meantime, she's trying to present herself as being something that she's really not on Tim Pool, on Destiny's channel, on all these other channels as well. And I got a kind of a background on Lauren at that time, probably more than I really bargained for now. So I'm talking to Aaron, all this is going on, right up until about, I think it was April of this year. And so I'm going to read to you some of the, some of the exchanges that I've had. Now, since then, Aaron has given me clearance to talk about this stuff. And I did a response video to Lauren Southern's video in, I believe it was the, in the beginning of June. And she was, that was when she was in the middle of the woods and trying to have this sort of like tearful, heartfelt bullshit, you know, struggle session in the middle of like, I don't know, the Canadian Outback somewhere. And explaining to her audience that she actually has been divorced for the last 18 months. She actually has been in some sort of child custody suit with her ex and essentially painted Aaron in this really bad light. Now, Aaron has to be very private about this stuff because he works for the government. One of the reasons, or one of the elements, I should say that contributed to sort of like the separation fact of, you know, with Lauren was the fact that he had to have, he had to maintain that level of privacy. And he doesn't have a platform. He doesn't have, he's not a podcaster. He doesn't have a social media to speak of. And yet he's sort of being like pilloried and just misrepresented by Lauren this whole time. So he said, go ahead and take it public. In fact, I'll read the, I've already read this once before but I'll read it again when he said it was okay to take all this stuff. Yeah, I don't know the history, but it's because they have a child together and they're having a divorce. And they're having, it's a, it's a nasty, it's a nasty breakup and everything. She is clinically has ADHD. She's got, I would argue, this is me just spitballing here. Probably BPD, certainly NPD. And so the- Do you want to share the screen? Or do you want to- No, I'll just read it here. It's easier because I'm just going to read it anyway. So, but a lot of this stuff has to do with email exchanges and everything else because I think people need to know the buildup and how we got, how I got to where we're at right now and what has happened sort of in the aftermath of all of this before you get this, this salacious, oh, Rolo did this or Rolo did that. And it's like, you guys don't understand the backstory here and why these people are doing this in the first place. Now I'm going to focus primarily on Brittany Venti today but you can't get to Brittany Venti until I give you the backstory about what happened with, with Lauren Southern. So right around the beginning of June I did a response video trying to sort of make the case or be the voice, I guess, for Erin, her ex-husband so that he wasn't being sort of like run up the flagpole. Why would I do that? Now I remember like, it was, I think it was like not so erudite or someone else was saying, well, why would Rolo have all this stuff? Why would he have any of this information at all? And I'm like, because I've had a conversation with him and I had this ongoing correspondence with him for over, well, almost over a year, almost a year now. And I was like, he's doesn't have any representation, doesn't have any voice. And he's going through a custody, an international custody battle that involves parental alienation on the part of a very damaged, very psychotic, clinically depressed, clinically ADHD mother that he is trying to find some way so that he can even get dissertation rights to his son. He wants to do the right thing. He wants to be able to see his kid. He's never going to do that if she has basically broken the protection act that he sent me here because she went public with this. So that's why he wanted me to go public with the information about, you know, to sort of tell his side of the story because he doesn't have a platform. He doesn't have any, he doesn't have a podcast. He's not like an internet, you know, he has no audience or anything like that. So that's why I did that reaction video when I did it. Trying to do the right thing. I know the path to hell is paved with good fucking intentions. And here we are in fucking hell. So that's why I did that. Now here's the backstory for all of this. Right around, I'm going to, I'm going to dig this up. This is from, I think it was April. I had this correspondence with Aaron here. This was April 8th, 2023. All right. Now I have not read this before, but this was a correspondence between myself and Aaron McCready. Hello, Rolo. Firstly, I hope your Easter's off to a great start. Thank you for your internet or for your interest and inquiry. It's much appreciated and it all helps as I do. I will attempt to keep this very succinct. About this time last year, which would have been April of 2022, there was strong suspicion and some evidence that Lauren was pregnant with a girl. This is not me throwing spaghetti against the fucking wall. This is from Lauren Southern's ex-husband. Got it. Was pregnant with a girl. That was Destiny's. This is what was, what he said was suspicion, some evidence. I asked her very politely and respectfully in which case she emotionally exploded, not actually confirming or denying my question in the end. We have not spoken since. It was actually the last time I spoke to her. Consequently, I have taken it as this did occur as it didn't, as it didn't, well, warrant a simple no response would have, would have sufficed. A very sad state of affairs, really noting, I don't know what happened to that child. That's where all of this bullshit first starts. This is April 8th, 2023. Okay. So if Destiny doesn't know this, if Jeremy from the fucking quartering doesn't know this, if even Lauren Southern herself doesn't know this, this is where this is coming from. I'm not pulling this out of my ass. I have verified the source here. Okay. I've got the phone number. I know this is Aaron and I know is, I will, it's last name starts with an M and ends with a Y. How's about that? I don't want to give him completely away here. So we have not spoken since I was actually the last time I spoke to her. Okay. I got that part. I am now of the understanding that she is currently seeing Tim Pool, which is not a surprise as I think she needs him to commercially survive at the moment. It does mean, it does mean she is in the US a fair bit and my son with her parents. I'm actually glad my son is with her parents for now because they are decent people. Rolo. Lauren is a damaged wreck of a person that is obsessed with trying to be famous at all costs. This was why I left her as I don't need to put up with a woman like that. I am within the context of what I do successfully enough to be quite financially secure and with a great adventurous international life from both from course, both of course from hard work. I would love one day to share this great life with my son and provide him with a life example that is much needed. In any case, I do not need to put up with such behavior from a partner. Hence, I left her. She does, however, absolutely hate me for leaving her as it wounded her pride significantly as well as disrupted her Christian conservative brand. Okay. As I stated, I will need you to refrain from revealing me as there is this sensitive legal matters around my contract with her colleagues industry which could affect contact with my son. I hope you understand and are on guard for this. Now, I'm revealing this. I'm reading this right now here in August after all this shit has played out and if you don't know what I'm talking about, I was sent from an anonymous source a document that very much looked like an admission document for a fetal monitoring ultrasound and this was back in June. Now, this all came right after I did my breakdown video of Lauren's come to Jesus moment when she was talking about she's finally coming clean about her divorce and why she was wearing her ring and why she did what she did. So, having with this back now, remember this is April and Lauren decided that she was going to do her sort of come to Jesus video in the beginning of June. So, I'm sitting on this. I'm respecting their privacy. I don't want to fuck anything up for his case with the Canadian government or however he was trying to proceed with his parental alienation case. I'm just in the middle of this. Listen to this going on. Now, why did we have this conversation in the first place? Because at that time in April, there was a, I believe it was a video from Chud Logic or someone like that was talking about how there had been an ongoing affair between Destiny and Lauren Southern. And it was sort of an open secret in his forum and his community and his Reddit feeds or whatever the fuck it was. I got no idea. I don't follow that shit. So, people sending me, hey, did you know that Lauren and Destiny were a thing? Well, here I have Erin, her ex-husband confirming this. That's where this comes from. This isn't me just pulling it out of my ass. This isn't me just like trying to do spitballing or anything like that. me doing the right thing and giving a voice to a guy who wanted to get his fucking son back. That's why I did this. So anybody thinking that Rollo Tomasi is this diva or this fucking drama queen, I'm trying to do the fucking right thing and I'm getting burned for it. That's why. Now, I'm not going to get too much more into the Lawrence Southern part of this because it turns out that I was delivered, as an anonymous source, these documents from BC Women's Health Care Clinic in Vancouver that looked very, very much like they were admission slips or admission paperwork for Lawrence Southern going in to have a fetal monitoring ultrasound and had the dates, had the due date, had her, it will even have a timestamp on it, had her medical numbers on there. It was sent to me and I'll read you what the actual, the actual correspondence was here in just one moment. But it turns out that all along it is Lawrence Southern who is sock puppeting Lawrence Southern in the attempt to get me to believe that she had gone into this to get a fetal monitoring ultrasound. That's a mouthful, sorry. So I'm sitting on top of this and I mentioned this on one of my streams. Of course, Destiny now picks up on this and says, hey, I will bet you $10,000 that the kid is not mine, that you can't prove that the kid is mine, knowing that this was a fake in the first place. And I'll tell you how we come to that conclusion here in a minute, but they're literally like two weeks after I'd said something, I don't even know that, but probably like maybe like six or seven days after that, there's a tweet from Destiny challenging me to say, hey, prove it, which is ludicrous on the surface of it because unless I have a DNA test, unless I can actually, if the baby was aborted, there's no way I could, I could do that anyways. I thought it was kind of a stupid, I just blew it off. I didn't think, think twice about it. Right. And so I didn't really bother with that. But then I realized the reason that he wanted me to prove it and to go public with this was because he wanted me to post medical records on YouTube and on Twitter or wherever else to get me banned off of this channel that we're on right now and to get me banned off of Twitter. And I realized that that was the design to begin with. So, but at that, at that point, I didn't know, it just seemed like some bullshit that was coming out of his mouth. Right. And so I'm sitting on top of this and I'm barely confident that these, these look like real medical records. Right. And that's because they were real medical records, which they had pulled off from, I want to say the, the BC women's clinic, it would have had to have been, but they pulled up a PDF, filled it out. Lauren is now saying that she had to even get some like a Photoshop expert guy to come in and sort of like the rejigger, like the, the, the writing and everything. So it looked legit. Now for people who say, well, you should have done your due diligence, Rolo. Oh, you're an old boomer. You don't know this shit. You would, you would have, you would have figured this out. Any fool would have figured this out. No, no, you wouldn't have. And I'll tell you why, because I did do my due diligence. So what I did was I took this to my wife who I also explained in that the prior videos. Anyways, my wife, who was a medical imaging professional, I'm not gonna tell you exactly what she did, but she worked with people who do CT techs and MRIs as well as, as ultrasounds. She looked at it. She said, this looks legit. This looks like an admission form for a, for a, a, an imagery scan. And the reason why she says a legit, because it actually was a fucking form for that particular healthcare clinic. They just, they just forged it. They made a counterfeit, whatever the fuck it was a forgery essentially is what it was. And so I did that. I took it to another person that I know who was a NICU nurse. She looked at it. She says, this looks legit. I'm like, okay, great. I have gone to people who work in the field who would know this shit. I would say, no, it looks legit to me. Okay, great. So I did that. I'm still kind of sketchy about this anonymous tip kind of thing. But again, it's people who are telling me that they hate Lauren. Well, as it turns out, as of like yesterday or two days ago, Lauren comes out, she's, she comes clean and goes, Oh, you're a sucker. Rollo. We actually pulled this very elaborate hoax on you. And that was the, the Lauren Southern side of things. I'll come back to that in a more dedicated show later on. But what I want to talk about right now is the Brittany Venti stuff, because somewhere along the line, Brittany Venti was led in on this hoax and she believed she could also put one past me as well. She comes in and she sends me an email saying, I am a friend of Brittany Venti's ex-boyfriend. And I'm going to read this, this email here just in shortly. And she sends me all these old school pictures and says, you know, why don't you burn this bitch, blah, blah, blah. I've got, I even have nudes of her from back in the day when we used to hang out. So I'm going to go ahead and read that one really quick. I don't know who she is though. Brittany Venti is, how would you, what would you, how would you describe Brittany Venti? I mean, she's like, she's certainly an old Twitch streamer. She's an old gamer streamer. Brittany Venti is functionally autistic. Yes. And she's like, all right. So you know that like psycho X that you banged like maybe one or two times and then you ghosted her. And then she like, has this vendetta out for you? Cause you ghosted her. That's Brittany Venti in a nutshell. She is, she is the presence on the internet. Um, she, she has her own podcast. Yeah. She has her own like, yeah. I heard her thing is basically, no, no. She's a reactor. She's a takedowner. She's a takedowner. She's a takedowner. Like, like she hates the red pill so much that she will like, like she came after Roosh. She came after Roosh on Andrew Andy, Andy, Andy Warsky's show back in the day. No, she's a fake trad con. She's a fake trad con. Yeah. And again, these are children. These are, this is the Gen Z that has decided that they want to involve themselves on this side of it. Cause I guess whatever they were doing on Twitch wasn't paying off as well as it used to. So now they decided they all want to come over to YouTube and they don't want to fuck with, with, with the red pill. So anyways, I'm going to read this so you guys can get an idea of Brittany Venti's, uh, uh, her initial scam, by the way, this is dated June 26th, 2023. I saw your video on Lauren Southern's husband and you mentioned Brittany Venti being a feminist. So I thought I would email you my experience with her and her ex boyfriend in person. Remember, this is Brittany Venti pretending to be an anonymous source talking about Brittany Venti. Okay. I've known Brittany for many years. Now we met when she was, when she first started dating her now ex Mason, I went and I looked that up. Yes. She has an ex called Mason. Okay. Her exposed, uh, he exposed her for the first time a few years ago, back about her being a feminist who let her cat pee in her bed in their bed. Why that's relevant. I don't know, but we'll continue. We, uh, we hung out a lot back then, sometimes in groups during, uh, the, he will not divide us Shia LaBeouf era. We used to hang out in groups, but sometimes Mason would have long conversations with me about their relationship. I got to see a lot of their interactions in person for about a year and a half. She drove him insane and made it look like he was the bad one. Remember, this is Brittany Venti talking shit about Brittany Venti. Meanwhile, she would provoke him and say things like he was too weak or how he wasn't fit enough. She wouldn't even fight with him or she would even fight with him in group hangouts in front of everyone and humiliate him. I got the impression that the reason she stayed with him, despite starting all these fights with them was because his mom was the CFO of a really big company and she wanted his inheritance. He showed me a text from his mother with a picture of a bank statement showing that Brittany spent over $9,000 on his credit card that his mom gave him from his college expense or forest college expenses. They lived together at the time. She wasn't pulling her weight. He told me she threw her, all of her stuff out on the floor and wasn't nice to come home to. I've slept over with another friend before at their place, so I saw a lot of this happening for myself, along with how she would try to manipulate him and place guilt trips on him. I did eventually tell him that it would be best to separate from her because she was just sucking the life out of him more and more every time I saw them. This seems very elaborate to start out with a, hey, I know some shit on Brittany by Brittany Venti, but we'll continue. Funny enough, I recall Lauren Southern and her ex going on double dates with Brittany and Mason doing a couple of times, doing it a couple times in New York. I guess the apple doesn't fall very far from the tree. Mason left her just like Lauren's husband did with her. The last straw for him was when he caught Brittany talking to other dudes. Okay. I feel bad for both of these guys though, but especially Brittany's ex because he never got his vindication because he had to move and he's not an online personality. After they broke up, he had to fly back home where his mom lives and start over because she basically ruined his life. She lied about him a lot. She was the one calling him too skinny, degrading him, manipulating him, like getting him to drop out and pay for her. And she wasn't even held accountable for any of this because he had to go back home after she made him drop out of university for her. Now, she goes on and on and on and on and on more here. I'll read the whole thing just for, so we're all complete here. Men really need to protect themselves from chicks like this. So thank you, man, for speaking up. I feel bad for the guy because he doesn't have an online presence to defend himself. So that's why I'm emailing you about him. This right here is sort of like making me believe that this is legit because what was I doing with Lauren Southern's ex at the time? I was trying to give him a voice as well. That's why. So I continue a little bit more. Brittany Venti, not her real name, by the way, and other women like her need to be held responsible for what they do to these men who actually have potential futures, especially like her ex who was in, who is in college and had a lot, had a lot going for him. This is, again, this is very, this is paragraph after paragraph right here where Brittany is talking shit about herself in the third person and revealing all this stuff, pretending to be a friend of Mason's, I would presume. Okay. I know I'm probably not, I'm probably just a guy on the internet, but to you, I've attached some, but for you, I've attached some photos I saved from the hangouts we had. She, I actually posted these on, on Twitter. If you want to go look at them, I put these out. I took the photos. So I don't have an issue if you need to share them. So here's, this is the baiting me to share these. I didn't share these until a day ago after she revealed that this was a hoax, also a hoax. It wasn't enough for Lauren Southern and I presume Destiny to collectively collude together to create a very elaborate months-long hoax. Brittany Venti felt left out. And so therefore she had to do a hoax as well. So I'll continue here some more. I saved them from a hangout we had. I took these photos. So I don't have an issue if you need to share them. I'm the guy in the reflection, taking the picture in the hotel room. We are there for a documentary for the Shia LaBeouf, he will not divide us thing, which is how we all met. She managed to break up the entire friend group. So Mason lost a lot of his support. I still talk to him here and there on Snapchat and see his stories there. And he seems to be doing better and happier with his new girlfriend. Brittany is now with her boyfriend, a YouTuber named think before you sleep. I got a message for that guy right now. This is the level of crazy that the bitch you're with right now is capable of. This is what you're sleeping next to bro. So just try to process this process, this part right here for the past year. And I know this is true because I saw this dude on whatever podcast with Brett B Venti just like what, two weeks ago, three weeks ago, something like that. So I know, I know this part actually is true. He used to be MGTOW, but since they started dating not too long ago, he doesn't talk about it much anymore. It's shocking. She would go with him because he has a lot of subs. It was shocking because he has a lot of subs on YouTube. I have seen them and interacted with them in person on a couple of occasions. And I doubt it's going to work because she hasn't changed. I can tell that he is stressed like Mason was. Okay. Even though I'm not really friends with the guy, I just hate to see it happen over to another dude who had something good going on in his life. So I'm emailing you, hoping that some light will be shed on this. Okay. So this, again, this is Brittany sock puppeting Brittany. Thanks again for speaking up. You inspired me to do the same and send this email. You're speaking the truth. And I know women like Lauren and Brittany hate to see it, but it's really important for men out there who don't have much guidance, by the way, you're right about Brittany's Christian trad grift. This is the end part, because I know for a fact that Brittany has full on nude pictures that directly played into them breaking up because Mason sent me the proof when it happened. He was a pretty upset, but I'm happy for the guy because he saw her for who she really is and got away and got away and got away from her. Okay. So that's the first instance where she's mentioning Brittany Venti pretending to be a friend of Mason's is telling me that he had nudes that's or that they had nudes or she had nudes. Okay. And then she goes on, I've got, I've already put these pictures up online. So if you want to check out the ones that she sent to me in this email, I'll be happy to put them up again later on. So then so then as the timeline per."}
