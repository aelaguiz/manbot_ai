Because I think a lot of people that market themselves as center are legitimately spineless cowards and deserve to be called out. Like, I've never killed a man, but today might be my first. Oh no. Um, but I don't even, I don't ever identify as center anything because it's got such a bad reputation. Fuck that. I stand center with a spine. Here's a really good quote my mom said to me when I was really young. She said, Stevie, don't ever let your mind be so open that your brain falls out. And that's what I find that a lot of center people do. That's not what she told me last night. Why are you like this? I'm sorry. Okay. I'm glad I can, glad I can bring that. I'm glad you feel like this is a safe space. Like I said, people are not judgmental. If you want to talk about fucking my mom, you know what? You're totally within your rights. I didn't say that. You said that. I didn't say that. I support that. She's a beautiful woman. Uh, her husband probably wouldn't be too happy about it, but you know. My mother was a pure woman from a noble family, and I at least know who my father is, you big eating son of a whore. All right, all right, all right. I don't know. Goodbye from Reno, Nevada. This is rational mail back in the command center once again for your pod class. Class is in session. We've got a lot of housekeeping to do today. We've got a house cleaning. Hello there. How's it going? Lots and lots of house cleaning to do today. Can't leave you guys alone for one week without everything going to hell. And me forgetting the audio. Why is it that all you ladies who dislike arrogance and like humbleness want a life that is so extra and lavish? You want six figure man. You want a high value man doing all this stuff. Why is it that everyone pretends like they hate arrogance, but then their standards are like if we're being very honest, there's about what 10 of you here. Maybe two or three of you at best will get with a guy who makes six figures or more because it's such a small percentage. By the numbers, it's probably impossible for all of you to get that. So there is a bit of like an arrogance to that where it's like if you love humbleness so much, why don't you live a humble life? What's wrong with getting with a regular dude who's got a 401k? He makes 40k a year. Maybe he's home at the end of the day. He takes care of the bills. You guys got a nice little house in the suburbs. Why is that not enough? I don't understand why there's all this talk about like would I let my high value man cheat on me? Most of y'all not going to get one. And that's not me trying to be mean. It's like there's such a small percentage. You think I'm going to get a nine out of 10? So edgy back in the day, wasn't he? Long before all this nonsense happened. I love those old clips. Good times, man. Good times. Reward in being a traditional good woman anymore. If you are a traditional woman who's got no pictures on Instagram, who isn't going out all day every day, who isn't sleeping around and isn't getting lots of surgery and not putting on loads and loads of makeup, and you're simple, just a traditional woman, there's no reward in that. You will never find a date. You'll never find a man that says, here, let me take you out. Here, let me do this. Whereas if you are the most promiscuous, provocative, dangerous woman, your DMs are endless. And you are booked every single day of the week. And you get to choose which country you want to fly out to. So humans are going to look at where's the most reward. Can't believe that this would be shocking to anyone. Take a look at this headline. The Daily Mail writes, Is only fans ruining your love life? Half of adult content creators admit they struggle with dating or end up splitting from their partner because of their job. I like job, job, dude. Let's just be real, ladies and gentlemen. Everyone knows, even if they want to lie about it, there is a big distinction between having a job and making porn on the Internet. And there was this big push on the left where they were like, sex work is work. No, it isn't. It's just not. It's sex work. It's a different thing. It is a category that overlaps with the idea of work, meaning you do something in exchange for money. But let's be real. It is specific to a category. Don't date crazy. The number one influencing factor to a man's success or failure in life is who they choose as a spouse. And if you're one of those guys like I'm a captain, save a hope. Don't be a motherfucking captain, save a hope. Because when you get married to this chick and when you try and start a life with her, she's going to constantly be this tornado of problems. Each time you're trying to do something big and you're going to realize I can't start that company. I can't make those millions. I can't transform people's lives. I can't serve humanity because each time I try, she is taking a massive shit on my life. Find someone that will back you up. Find someone that will say they believe in you. They will advocate for you. And when you do, be so fucking awesome to her that all she wants to do is support you and be your one woman pit crew. And if you can do that, I'm telling you, man, you will force multiply the impact and income that you will make in life. Who here would be down to get with like a really high quality AI sex robot? Like in 10 years or some shit. Like anybody down to like a sex robot? I'll raise my hand. No, come on. I'm down. I mean, more for you? Or are you just shitting with us? I'm dead serious. Bring on the sex robots. Okay. I'm for it. Show of hands, who here has ever used a sex toy? It's probably worse actually if a dude is masturbating as compared to using a black pussy. Nobody bats an eye if a girl has a vibrator or dildo, like she's in touch with her sexuality, whatever. But if a dude has a pocket pussy, all of a sudden, he's less than hot. I don't agree with either. Speaking of, we have something in studio here. Shania, you were talking about, you know, putting it on the table. So what I'm going to have you reveal this and then just put it on the table, please. Me? Yeah, that one over there. So I have here a, what's called an auto blow. I don't want to see this. It's freaky. And it's actually, so this is a auto blow AI. You should not be promoting this. Hold on. So you turn it on, turn the switch. That's horrifying. That's like so disturbing. What if you're like really girthy? It's the Ferrari of fellatio. It's the Jaguar of jacking off. Oh, it's a mouth. It's the Bugatti of blowjobs. And it's got 10 different speed settings. Use code whatever, 10% off. Link in the description. Oh, this is a sponsor? Wanting to be a role model for your kids, is that part of it? A thousand percent. A father should show up in every way for his children. I think I'll be better than most fathers, regardless of how many children I have. I might have a hundred. But you think part of being a role model, it's okay for your kids not to know even your relationship status with their own mom? They will know the relationship status with me and their mother. But you have other relationships with other women too. What does that have to do with anything? I haven't even said that. I'm just saying, like if I want to, I will. But you don't think that's a problem for your daughter to know that about their dad? No. But do you want your daughter to have a guy like that long term? If he takes care of her in every way, and she has a much better life because of it, yeah. I'm cool with that. Do you want to have a hundred kids? I'm going to have a bunch of kids. I believe in having kids, man. Hallelujah! Oh, the Lord in heaven. How we doing? You guys like this new mic? How's the new mic? I know who my God is! Hallelujah! I got the other camera. The other side's working now too. Yes, I'm all yoked as hell today because actually I had to go to the gym before. Sorry, I was a little bit late today. I had to hit the gym early because they're closed on Memorial Day. I figured I better get my ass in there as quick as I could. All right. Yeah, that was Jay Waller. Pastor Swallow. Yeah, I saw you, brother. Thank you. Anita, thank you very much. Tell these bitches to go to hell. All right. Thank you. I hate to do this. I really do. I got to do some bookkeeping here first if you haven't already subscribed to our new channel which is Axis Vegas. Look at the third link down in the description down below right now and go subscribe to that. God damn it, please. I need to get that up over 1,000 so I can get some things started actually for that thing. I'd like to have merch ready to go, but I can't do it until I can monetize the channel. We're going to be directly actually we already are directly streaming to that. If you would be so kind as to hit that. Also, if you're interested in joining MOA, Men of Action, that is the only organization that I endorse. It is a bottom-up, not a top-down organization. We're not trying to save the world. We're trying to just help one man at a time. Go ahead and have a look at the MOA link which is right down below. Then also, of course, please buy my books because that's all I do. Just chill books all day long. He doesn't do anything like go to, I don't know, the white party yet. What? Babes in Toyland in Miami? Yes, I saw you there. Thank you. I love you all. I love you too. Lila Rose. Oh boy. Every time you mention Lila Rose in a super chat, you will get one of these. Or else one of these. She's not a Christian! You get one for free. Free today. One sound drop with every Lila Rose mentioned. Married during the epiphany phase. Yes, I know. Oh boy. Are we going to get into it today? How? We're going to... Today's not going to be just about... We're actually going to get into the pod class today. God. Hey, is this just going to be Rolo talking about all these guys again? No, no, no. See, that's the thing. That's the thing about my show. My show, if I am making an example of someone, there is always a bigger message to that example. So if I am calling out oh, I don't know, Lila Rose. What's her face? Kalen? I don't even know what the hell her name is. Kala? Something like that? Notsoerudite? I don't even know who this bitch was until just about two weeks ago. Lila Rose. Let's see. Who else is on the hit parade? Oh, Abba and Preach. We'll probably talk about them a little bit today, too. Well, actually, we kind of already have because, boy, weren't they really into the Manosphere? Not even that long ago. What was it? April? May of 2021? About two years ago, I guess. They really wanted to jump on board back in the day, but now... We never knew ye red pill. What do we got here? I'm currently lifting in the gym already. Good. Good for you. Yeah, you know why? Because the gym's closed tomorrow. It's Memorial Day in the United States. Yes. Thank you, Dad, for... Wait, here we go. Thank you for your service. My dad was a Navy guy. I'll tell you the story about that. Maybe I'll tell you the story about my dad and his Naval experience. I actually wrote a song about it at the end of the show. Chelsea Handler. No, you know, here's what you get for Chelsea Handler. You get one of... Which one should I give you for Chelsea? Oh, here's Chelsea. That's nasty. It is nasty, right? Isn't it nasty? That was just on with Jed, too. That was great. Oh, man. Have I been on tour or what? Yeah, here we go. Yeah. I love that. Do you want me to talk about Dr. Phil? I can give you my unbiased opinion of that. I can talk about particulars of the show, but I can't tell you everything until the show is offline. I had someone ask me about that. I think it was we were on... I was on Access Vegas on Thursday, and somebody asked me a question about whether or not I was going to opine about the latest episode of Dr. Phil, where they tried to make me look like a complete asshat, but a douche. But failed miserably unfortunately. You know, I'll tell you what's funny is I didn't even really know it was going to be up until two days before, and then I was right when the show was supposed to go live. I was on Jedidiah Bela's show at the same time, so I didn't even get to see it when it was live broadcast, and so I've only caught clips of it. I have yet to watch the entire thing, but the clips that I did see and that people are making buzz clips about are pretty good. The Superfluous thing came up as well, so I'm glad that got out there. Yeah, Dr. Phil's been blue pill since 1975. Somewhere around there. Oh, and then last but not least, I got to do bookkeeping. Where'd it go? Where'd, where, what? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm going to put this up here for a little while. Let's put that one in the, in the piece there. Oh, you know what? Actually, let's leave that there, and then let's put, let's just put this real quickly. Ah, there you go. Devil Mountain Coffee. Go pick, go to devilmountaincoffee.com and use the code RMS and you will get 20% off of your order. I don't make any money off of this. I just like their coffee and they give me free coffee. That's our exchange. So there's no not a lot. Thank you. There you go. So if you are interested, please do please go and if you like a coffee and I do I am a coffee connoisseur. My my people say Rola. What's your what's your workout routine, bro? My my my nutritional program is caffeine and stress and then on my cheat days. I eat hate hate for my for my haters. That's my that's my cheat day treat. What do we got it? Man? You guys like this new I got this is brand new just so your your your super chats in in in your super chat money is being put to good use. I just got this new mic. I have retired temporarily. Anyways, the my old podcast on my road podcaster pro is a podcaster broadcaster. I think is what it called. I liked it well enough, but this just came out. I pre-ordered it. It's now on the road RODE site. If you want to if you are a influencer, by the way, this is USB as well. So you can actually plug this into your laptop. You can plug this into like directly into how you can even put it into your phone. It comes with a cord for your phone. So but if you are a an on-the-go kind of guy like me, it works pretty well. So and I'm I'm liking it so far you guys let me know if the sound is is any different. I know every once in a while people like the audio files will go roll. Oh, you need to get a pop filter. You need to do this. You're down. So I just said screw it. I'm going to get anyone really enjoyed your conversation with Cuxtony. We're going to talk about that too. He almost agreed with most of the points like a little girl, but there was some arrogance and dismissiveness. I'll dig into that here in just a bit if you'd like we have to endure. You don't have to endure endure. Oh and I get it. I get it. I get it. Yeah. So yeah, I know what the indoor he if you're going to use the word like just say John just say MLD. You don't have to you don't have to beat around the bush on my my channel. I'm going to talk about that. I'll talk about that too. I'll be happy to like I said today is going to be the day that we're going to clear the air today. Oh boy. Finally got to catch you live. Oh cool. I have no idea why I'm awake at 23. Wow. Very good in Finland. Oh, what's the capital of Finland? Somebody tell me what? Yeah, I am actually Danish. So I only know Copenhagen and Denmark. So let's see Cuxley Cuxley, you know, can we yeah, okay, maybe he deserves Cuxley like when you're talking about like Jack Murphy is Jack Murphy's a good like and thanks a lot guys. I have like I have endured quite a bit this this last month now, I guess we're up to a month. And there's no explaining anything. You just just sort of like riding with stuff and sometimes you just have to lean into shit and that's kind of been my attitude up to this point with with the infamous what Vesta I'm a vasectomologist right now and all of you are vasectomites just saying so if you're watching me and you're a fan, you know, if you if you're a member like Elena Barre from Elena Barre Fitness, congratulations. You're now a vasectomite whatever that means, you know, you're a sodomite or you're a vasectomite, but you're I guess if you follow me then suddenly your vasectomite because it's just like the telephone game and I don't know if you guys are familiar with the telephone game, but the telephone game is when when little kids kind of get together and they like tell a secret and then they tell that secret to the next kid to the next game. They all get in a circle and they tell the secrets to from one to the next and the next and next until it gets to the last kid and the secret that was the original secret is completely different from the from the original effect to the point that where it's so entertaining. They make a they make a game out of it, right? So we the Manosphere right now is fine. We're the Latin the red pill like me and I guess the rest of the guys in rule zero. We're the last kid in the line or the last kid in the circle for the telephone game right now. And if you're an influencer in this space, let me just reiterate what I have been saying since New Year's Eve of last year is you will not recognize the Manosphere by August. In fact, if anything I'm wrong about the time frame. I think probably right now we're already it's unrecognizable, but certainly by August it will be because all of the people who were all about the red pill and all about the Manosphere and all the jig is up man. The jig is up. If you were all brand if this was just your kind of hustle if this was just your grift your your grift is showing you need to tuck your grift back in your jeans your your your flies open and your grift is showing because right now we're leaning back to the culture warden or leaning into what will end up becoming the culture war narrative and in the build-up to that election cycle in the United States anyways, and by the way, you know, the United States gets a cold or sneezes and the rest of the world gets cold in a social sense. What we're seeing right now is what I call tilling of the fields and the tilling of the fields is goes something like this. You have to till the fields and get the grab here. If you know anything about farming, you've got to till the fields and put the topsoil in and do all you know road a till so that you can plant and you can harvest and they're tilling the fields right now in a social narrative sense. And the Deadwood or the things that are going to be politically inconvenient for people going forward. I would say spread around August because in the United States the election cycle begins right around about 18 months out and remember we vote the first Tuesday of November. So the election cycle really starts. I mean in earnest the second Tuesday of November in 2023. So that we can sort of build a year out and the real the shit doesn't really hit the fan until probably about May about this time next year. You'll probably see you'll probably see the shit hit the fan will be in another, you know, C-19 thing or who knows what it will be but I will tell you this is that the moralists are coming out of the woodwork and I want to use another word, but I can't use that word on YouTube right now. And some people know what I'm talking about. Because they're the same element that was coming out of the woodwork in 2015 2016 and the same element that came out of the woodwork in probably not as well as they probably would have liked but came out of the woodwork in 2019 and 2020 and now we're leaning back into sort of this moral majority moral crisis social degeneracy narrative because that is what's going to till the fields for the culture war narrative and the grifters whose grift was hey, let's get into the Manosphere because that's where all the kids all the cool kids are playing right now and let's go over there because if you go and you just start talking about bitches and hoes and you know, and and how that's all you got to say and I got that as a dedicated sound drop now. Thank you. Now the people who are really into this and that's why I used Abba in the in the beginning here for the for the video intro the people who were all about this who wanted to be all part of this who were like on board and we're like, yeah, man, it's red pill stuff is great blah blah blah and now it's like we never knew ye. It's like Judas right? Give me give give Rolo the kiss of death. Goodbye Rolo. See you later, right? You're going down, right? That's exactly why I use this this drop today because this was our good friend our good friend not so erudite right on her surprise surprise surprise on her video with Alex from playing with fire, which I'm going to dig into today. I'm going to dig her out today in more ways than one. But yeah, I would love to see Rolos career over that would be great. That would be good for the world. I think he does immeasurable harm to young men by lying to them all the time about men women and men because you know 20 years of my stuff right because you're that familiar with it. You've read all five books. It's just dangerous. Isn't it? You know everything about it, right? So you're a fucking expert on Rolo Tomasi. Good for you because we're going to like I said, we're going to dig you out today. It's coming up definitely coming up today. So let me get grab this real quick what you got here. Could it be that mate switching hypothesis of dr. David bus is the alpha reinterest phase from your time? Yeah, most definitely good good observation. You know what? We're going to have to star that bad boy. Most definitely I just sort of give you a preface of things here as well. I am going to be going back to Las Vegas this week. I have to go to the Las Vegas DMV one more time because I can't seem to get the Camaro that I bought back in February put in my name. The title is still not in my name because it's a salvage title and it's just a pain in the ass. Do not buy a salvage title ever that there's some worldly wisdom from Rolo Tomasi unless it's of course in your state because this one was from out of state. So now I am like jumping through hoops and every time you get every time you get a appointment at the DMV in Las Vegas. It is you're waiting six weeks in between each one and this is my third trip. So that's actually the reason I'm going down to do this, but I'm also going down there because I'm still in the midst of recording the video for my classes, which are all code. They are the players workshop that they are part of the fifth book and first module should be coming up very soon. Also, I have sort of set aside some time or Mike Sartain and I are going to set aside some time to do a show together just us and how do we really want to call it an interview because it's just a discussion amongst friends, but we that's going to be probably the main topic at least as far as hopefully that's going to be the main topic. Dr. David bus and mates mate switching hypothesis shifting switching hypothesis versus ovulatory shift or the dualistic mating strategy, which by the way really needs some some definition and I'm going to make it a good stab at that. So I'm going to give you a preview of all that stuff today. Yes, you are all vasectomists today. Thank you very much. My vasectomites. Oh man. There you go. That's not too bad. Let's where finish your book recently roll of perfection that the next four are on the way. Do you have any other book recommendations other than Myron's in this space or any online forums? I know yours are more are more than enough, but I'm just or I'm just very interested in space. Okay, cool. So here's what you do. First of all, it kind of depends on what your interest in this space is number one is if you're just if you're just in it for you want the data and you want some education and stuff just watching the show first of all book. I really need to do a dedicated book show. I think I might do that for a midweek where I'm just going to run down my top 10 show you 10 10 top 10 books, maybe top 12 top 12 books. If you are going if you're asking Mike Sartain, he's going to tell you go read evolution of desire or why women have sex or what I like it and name the library from dr. David bus. Got it. Okay. Thanks. There are actually other evolutionary psychologists in the world to so just saying I would also recommend dr. Hector Garcia's alpha God the ape who understood the universe by Steve Stewart Williams God saw both of his books of the consuming mind and the parasitic mind. Those are both very good. Those are if that's your interest to go for those if you're interested in male self-improvement. My first suggestion would be mastery by Robert Green. Very good. I recommend mastery to Gen Z years. Like if you're if you're in like your late teens early 20s mastery will help you get a good start especially if you haven't had any masculine roles in your life. It's a really good book really good. I'm not going to say it's good. Oh, it's not going to save your life, but it's a really good reading and probably give you a lot of things to think about if you are in fact a reader and even if you aren't a reader at the very least go and get the audiobook version of it and listen to it in the gym. Listen to it on the road. I if you want to talk about inspirational stuff, I would definitely say mastery would be a really good and it's by the way, it's it's nuts and bolts. It's actionable stuff, but mastery is really good for you know, sort of a self-improvement kind of thing. Although it's not really a self-improvement book. It just teaches you how to self-improve if that makes sense. 48 laws of power, of course. 33 strategies of war is very good art of seduction. It's okay. Those are the ones I mean, then there's the Red Queen and then there's you know, selfish gene. There's the standard stuff as well. But those would be my suggestions. There's your $50 super chat my friend next time you talk to Christians ask them if the Apostle Paul was high value when he promoted celibacy. That's a good that's good enough for that sound drop. Yes, you know, it's funny as I I have a I don't have it loaded but I have a nice little infographic about biblical marriage. And if you go and you look at the Old Testament, I mean, there's so many different versions of biblical marriage. It's like you like Ruslan tell me which version we're talking about which one is the right one, you know, because culture shifted and cultures change back then Jewish culture changed back then Christian culture actually changed back then, you know, well when Christ was crucified then it was one man one woman. Well, that's real convenient considering that that's about the time when agriculture was a thing and then people started, you know living in nation states and we monogamy socially enforced monogamy made better sense surprise. I can't believe it. Let's see. Richard done Richard Cooper's done with the red pill. Well, he's not the only one because we're going to talk about and you know, what left what the hell let's just get into that right now. Who else is done with the Manusphere? Well, I've been preach are apparently because they were about the Manusphere before they weren't and then they were again and now they're not so just throwing that one out there. The roommates were all about the Manusphere and all about the red pill until they weren't and they're leaving the red pill space. No. No, you're fucking not you're"}
