I think so. Yep. I've got to pop myself up. I was on Crucible not too long ago and I get in hot. Merry Christmas. God joy. Welcome to the very first time I've ever done a Christmas music show. See, isn't this a much better sound than that? I just... The rules are circling, my friends. Here we go, here we go, here we go. Yeah, sorry, I didn't hit echo cancellation. That's what I get for being late. Y'all ready for this? Of course you are. Oh my goodness. What's your body count? I don't have an exact number, I have an idea. Range is fine. Probably somewhere between 50 to 60. Oh my God, bro. Oh, hell no, man, what the fuck? You know what it is? My number one thing. Somebody asked, do you guys know why you're single? And I'll speak for myself, I know exactly why I'm single. Because I've never dated a guy that God would have approved for me. Not to say, let me clarify and say that I've actually only dated real men. I have a great picker. I've only dated really wonderful guys. Good people to their core. Obviously not perfect and clearly not for me because we would be together if that was the case. But like, good, good people. But never somebody who's further along in their faith than I am. Yeah. And I know without a shadow of a doubt that the person God has for me is like so far along in their faith than I am. And I have such a desire, like a true yearning to be led spiritually. I just want to sit and look up at a man talking to me about theology. And I'll be so happy, you know what I mean? And so there's always been, unfortunately, not in like an insulting way, but there's a level of respect that I'll have for the person that I'm with when that's the case. And I've never experienced that. Be yourself, not because it will make you more likable. It won't. But because it's only by being yourself that you'll find people who like you for who you really are, rather than someone you're pretending to be. That's from Gwynda Bogle. And this was one of the biggest realizations of my 20s. The advantage of doing this thing where you sort of push off who you really are is that no criticism will ever fully land because you're one degree removed from the person who's being criticized. The disadvantage is that you're also removed from the person who's being complimented. And if you're only playing a role, you never fully feel connected to the successes that you have in your life. Any accolades or warmth that you receive won't resonate properly in your heart because it's not you who's receiving it. It's the character that you're pretending to be. I did my first Snapchat and within the first week of creating it, I made like 10k off of just my titties. Insane. Yeah, and I had no idea that this is the kind of thing I could make. At this time, I've never had a job that made me that much money. I got really excited. A lot of the world doesn't have a job that makes them 10,000 in a week. Yeah, just like this. Instant. Yeah, instant. Like here, just deposit, deposit, deposit. It was insane. Well, I'm a whore. Sophisticated women, they've had a lot of good relationships with men, brothers and fathers in particular. Sophisticated women signal to men who are getting a little pushy, in no uncertain terms, very early in the pushing game, that no is the answer. But unsophisticated women, they can't do that at all. They don't know how. And then what happens is they run into an unsophisticated guy. He's too dumb to pick up any clues. And then by the time she really wants to say no, she's already on the bed. We're never gonna score. We're never gonna score. The thing in your life you still can't believe happened. The airplane crash. Say more. You were in a crash? No. I fell in love with a man and couldn't have him because I was married. Three years later, I got a telephone call. This is Cabin Leylines. Your husband just died in a crash. And so I was able to marry my beloved three months later. Oh my goodness. She's not a Christian! I don't have to make him a list. I have an equal partner. I don't have to ask him to help with things around the house. I have an equal partner. He knows how to shop at the grocery store without pictures. I have an equal partner. He doesn't expect me to handle everything alone. I have an equal partner. He plans date nights without me having to beg for it. I have an equal partner. He does his own laundry. I have an equal partner. He makes his own appointments. I have an equal partner. My stocking has never been empty. I have an equal partner. He makes the kids lunches in the morning. I have an equal partner. He makes and takes our son to his therapy appointments. I have an equal partner. He doesn't believe that just because he goes to work, he shouldn't have to do anything when he gets home. I have an equal partner. He takes genuine interest in me and my interests. He knows how to fold towels. I have an equal partner. He takes our kids to bed and knows their teacher's names. I have an equal partner. He doesn't make me feel bad if I'm not in the mood. I have an equal partner. He loves me and appreciates what I do and tells me that often. I have an equal partner. He does basic adult tasks without being asked. Guilty! Guilty! Guilty! Guilty! The worst thing that you can do is waste your time or waste somebody else's time in a relationship, especially a woman whose biological clock is ticking. And you shouldn't be wasting your time or energy on a person who can't make up their mind about you. Somebody has to make a decision and move on. And when somebody tells you who they are and shows you who they are, you should believe them, especially when it comes to dating and marriage. And yes, sometimes people can change. That does happen. But you should not go into a relationship or stay in one based on the assumption that you believe that they will change or that you can change them. There is no reason to waste your precious time on somebody who wants things that are fundamentally different than you or has fundamentally different values than you. He chose poorly. Cheating more than men? Far more. Come on. Far, far more. Come on. Why do you say women cheat more than men? Because they're in denial about the infidelity. When they cheat, they don't even label it as that. If a woman starts cheating... What do they label it as? They label it as my husband's no longer satisfying me. They won't even say I'm cheating. They'll say my husband isn't satisfied. They find a way to redirect and shift the terminology so that they are void of guilt. Really? Absolutely. How do we know women are cheating more than men? What is it like? Is it public knowledge? Is it surveys? Or are you just hearing this from the people you're coaching? The people I'm coaching. Because firstly, you'll know. It's simple science that you'll know. Firstly, when the guy... I always say infidelity is a result of men not being masculine and women not being feminine. And what I mean by this is if a woman is cheating, it's because she has a man that accepts unacceptable because he is unwilling to walk away when his boundaries are broken. So what will happen is when women meet that man, a good woman with good morals, and she doesn't want that man. She's like, I don't want a weak man. She'll leave. She'll leave. She'll replace him with somebody who has boundaries that suit her morals. But she won't cheat because she'll have the values of like, this isn't working, it's sad. No, I don't want somebody this weak. But I'm not going to cheat while I'm with you. No desire to cheat. She's not a sexual being. She's looking for somebody who can lead a household. But the woman who's planning to come home late all the time and planning to go on a bunch of holidays and planning to keep in touch with her ex and planning to post a bunch of provocative pictures online. He's perfect. Well, I'm a whore. Felt the feminism leaving my body. I live on the east side of L.A. And if you don't know what that means, it's sort of like the artsy-er part of L.A. You know, it's people say it's like Brooklyn and New York. So I go on dates with a lot of men and women who, you know, live over here. There's always a negotiation about who pays. And that's great. I like to pay for people, all that. But what I will say is that I sort of fell into going on a date with the most guy's guy I've ever been on a date with. And he's from west-west, you know, Santa Monica. He's a bro, right? A guy's guy is usually not my type. Like, I cannot remember the last time that I went on a date with, like, a straight bro's bro. You know what I'm saying? But it befell me. It befell me in an organic fashion. So I'm on this date with this guy. And the thing about a guy's guy is he's putting his card down. He's paying for everything. And I really just sort of activated something feral in me. I'm not going to lie. We went to, like, another bar. And he was going to go to the bathroom. So I was getting prepared to pay for our drinks because he's been paying all night. Of course I'm going to pay for the next round. But as he's going to leave for the bathroom, he turns to me and he hands me his credit card. And he goes, here's my card. Get us whatever. It might be time for me to get away from all these, you know, liberal snowflakes on the east side. Wait, there you go. Welcome, welcome, welcome. Sorry I was a little bit late. I was informed that my Devil Mountain Coffee gay cups had arrived. So I had to go get some because this show runs on. You ever want to know what my nutrition program is? It's caffeine and stress. That's how I keep my slender svelte figure. Oh, boy. We have a lot to do today, guys. Look, I even hang up the Christmas cards, I guess, kind of. I've never done a Christmas Eve show. This is Christmas Eve. I hope you guys are. Thank you guys for watching. Thanks for showing up. I didn't know if anybody was going to show up, but you actually got a pretty good crowd today. Good, good, good, good. I'm glad. Ned report. Would you like the Ned report? I'll give you the Ned report. Ned's doing fine. We took him to, well, he has to go get two bandage changes per week. Now we're down to one. So we're not going in until I think Wednesday or Thursday of next week. So we're good. We usually go Mondays and Thursdays. But, of course, tomorrow's Christmas, but we're good. The wound is the only thing that the next major hurdle anyways is just healing up the wound because he still has an open wound. And you can see you can see tendons and well, one little bit of attendance, like a very small patch. I would show you a picture, but that's what you would say. But he's still doing well. It is still clean. The wound is still clean, so it's not necrotic or anything like that. And we've only had to have it debrided once. So we're good to go. He's doing well. In fact, I had family over yesterday because we can't really do it tomorrow because we have the dogs here. But the long and the short of it is he's feeling much better. In fact, this is the dangerous part. This is the very dangerous part because he feels like he can do more than he wants to or more than he can. So we have to stay on top of him and like he was like, oh, don't run, you know, because he really wants to. And especially when my other dog, Anna, my female, I don't talk enough about Anna, but she runs. She's a very fast dog. She she ran two hundred and twenty three races. So and one of these days I'll post her her record and you guys will be suitably impressed. But what that means is she races around Ned in the backyard and like, OK, just don't don't run. That's all we're asking. So he's doing better. Very good. Thank you. Oh, and then thank you for the support and thank you for the donations and thank you for the goodwill. And thank you for helping out. Much, much appreciated. I am probably about at this point about 16 grand into medical bills for for Ned. And people go, hey, you Americans are like crazy about your dogs. And Ned's my best friend, first of all. And then second of all, that's just more money I'm laying on for damages when I sue this bitch that whose dog actually attacked Ned. So we already have a personal injury attorney that's on the case. They're going after their homeowners insurance. So I'm like, you know, whenever we see a whenever I see like a vet bill, I'm like, do you want to add more on? There's anything else we can add to this? He wants he deserves the best treatment. So because I'm just going to add it to the damages. Yeah. Well, that is special. He's probably going to you know, I've I've been sort of mulling this around and I think probably Ned and Anna will be the last greyhounds that I have for a while. I think I need to my my lifestyle right now is like I wish I could be home a little bit more home all the time now. Right. But yeah, 16 grand, $16,000 in US dollars. That's a lot. That's a lot of money. You are correct, sir. Yeah, it's it's it's insanity. But that's how it is. And I was I was surprised, too, because like you think like they always say like like the average American is like one like major accident or one major disease or one major sickness away from like bankruptcy. Yeah, I can if this is any taste of that, I can totally understand that. But yeah, that's that's the Ned report. Thank you guys for asking. But he will be fine. I should say, Anna, we haven't had Anna even a year. So this is like babies. Christmas. So she's just like wondering what the hell all this crap is around the house. So anyways, thank you guys very much for that. I want to get into a few things today today, you know, I had a I was once again, I have just a plethora of topics I could talk about and you know, I'll tell you what's funny is like I've had people in the past say roll. Do you think you're ever going to run out of material you've written so much right or they'll there's always a rational male blog post for damn near any occurrence like people when people think that oh, this is here. So I found out something that the red pill has not just yet has is undiscovered. No, dude. I probably talked about that back in 2011 2012 and so I can go back through my backlog and stuff and people think I'm a snob or whatever. Oh, you're just trying to get traffic for your blog. I mean, it's my blog. I'm roll Tomasi. I don't need your traffic. I'm just saying like here you read this. Tell me what you think about it. But I probably have talked about it in the past and one of the things I have talked about and matter of fact, I think I talked about it with a with a Pat Campbell in the Pat Campbell days was chivalry chivalry chivalrousness and I'm going to dig a little bit into that today with that's on the that's on tap. Obviously, we're going to be talking about Matt Walsh's red pill conversion. His red pill conversion. Yeah, he's really got the red pill today. No, what I think is funny is I was watching I I have done. Okay, I have to readjust myself here. I have in the past. Just ridden on Myron and fresh to cover certain topics or cover certain individuals that are red pill adjacent red pill peripheral, whatever you want to call it. Matt Walsh is one of those guys. Tim pool was another one way back in the day. I can remember when when when I first started doing fresh and fit on the regular and I think it was Jack Murphy before he had his flame out. It was like during like think the first year like it was 2021 and Jack Murphy suddenly like every like since since fresh and fit were a come up back then because they weren't like as popular as they are now. Um, that's when like people start taking notice of they start seeing fresh and fit in the rearview mirror and Tim and Jack Murphy were talking about like the red pill stuff like now suddenly they wanted to talk about it and I think Jack Murphy had brought my name up because I knew Jack from back in like the 21 convention days, unfortunately, and I've always been like, hey, you know, if you want me to come on the show, I'll be happy to help you to have this as respectful as I can possibly make it. I'll be happy to come on your show. I mean the same the same invitation of the same, you know, open invitation anyways for like say something like Chris Williamson. Joe Rogan, whoever else. I mean, I have been on some big-name shows. Hello, you know, but if you want me to come on your show, I'll be happy to come on your show, right? Well never get I never get the call, you know, I'm always a bridesmaid never bride. So but I thought it was interesting and then now Matt Walsh was one of those and then so I thought this did you guys like today's thumbnail? I thought it was pretty clever. Where you go. There you go. Isn't that great? AI will take us into the future embrace your artificial intelligent overlords, but I thought that was pretty good. And I lifted that I forget where I lifted this from but then I sort of extended it and embellished it a bit myself. So as you know, I'm a graphic designer art director by trade so well within my talent set and I thought that was interesting but I've talked shit about Matt Walsh for quite some time that I would love to come talk to you too, but I doubt I'm going to get that invitations and it's just simply not forthcoming. But of course now Myron and fresh decide that they want to talk about Matt Walsh and I have brought his name up several times with Myron and fresh and now I guess it's it's important enough to to address for a full dedicated show, which by the way, it thought was very good. I usually when I watch Myron fresh. I'm it's on certain days. Like I'll watch the Friday show. Sometimes I watch the Wednesday shows. I do just because like especially if there's something interesting or something I you know, someone I know like Mr. Organic. I'll watch that stuff but I and I know they're trying to do the the what's the personal counseling the marriage counseling stuff because I was actually I think I was the first one that did that with them too. But so they're talking about Matt Walsh and I'm like, oh finally and it was hot on the heels of Myron calling out Andrew Schultz and Akash. I don't know. I can't pronounce his last name from flagrant to. Okay, the time to do that was like two years ago all year and a half 18 months ago 18 months ago would have been great guys. That's when you needed to call them out because I did a full dedicated show just ripping them a new one. They came at me. Abba preach came at me after that and I had so many people telling you don't know what you're talking about. They're more successful than you. You're just professionally jealous. That's why you're talking about this. You will do anything to cover for for Myron and fresh. Yeah. Well that or I'm just doing a critique of what I see going on right here and learning lessons along the way. That's basically how I operate. But the time to have brought that up was like, I don't know like 18 months ago because I went back in my my archives because I did a full dedicated show. It was sort of a breakdown show. I hate to even call it a reaction show because but it was like a it was basically a reaction show and yeah flag. Thank you for thank you for bringing that up. Yes. They are essentially clowns and they know they are clowns as well. That's the thing is like when it's one thing if you don't know that you're going to get goofed on it's one thing to know if you're like a lol cow. It's another thing. If you don't know you're a lol cow or you think you're like dead serious that people people agree with me in your chat, maybe but I thought it was funny because I they they brought them on that show. Now. Do you guys remember this because I sure remember this. Do you remember when the whole reason it was like a big deal for them to be on that show in the first place? It's because they said that they don't date black girls. They don't date black women. They don't dabble in the dark this one throwaway joke snowballs into this huge issue. That's why they had him on there. They wanted to school them on, you know dating outside your race, but that's what was funny is like then later on Myron of all people picks out Akash out of his stand-up comedian routine or something about that how he does like he doesn't date outside of his own race either. So I'm like pot calling the kettle black. I got it. But who cares at this point and that's the whole point is like who cares that why are we Myron? I love you, man. And I know you want to get in the ring with somebody but you you will kill Akash please Myron don't hurt him. He was going after ABBA as well from ABBA and preach and every now and then and they just rear their ugly heads and talk shit and then it's like drive-by. It's like ABBA and preacher like a drive-by gang. It's like, oh the red pill. Drive away. Get in the ring with Pearl. You want me to get in the ring? No, she's got how much body weight do you think she has on me? I don't have a but I need one of those somebody give me that sounder up Akash is five foot one. Nah, he's taller than that. He's like five four at least black pill calling the kettle black. Yep. Thank you very much. All right, you know, I'm going to pay a 10. I'm paying a special. I have my I've got I should really turn the camera around so you can see the studio today. I've got a my my chat. I have a dedicated monitor just for the chat. So if I'm looking up like this, it means I'm looking at I'm looking at you. So I'm going to talk a little bit about I want to dig into Matt Walsh's sort of new red pill epiphany and it kind of goes it kind of tracks a little bit with with Zuby recently. I don't know if you guys know who Zuby is. He's like he's a he's a black guy who is does kind of like positivity rap kind of stuff and he's he's a positivity guy. I've been on the show with him. I've been on his show on several occasions. We were supposed to do an interview on Access Vegas last summer, but we just couldn't work out the logistics for it. I'll see if I can do it again in 2024. He's a good guy. I like him. The last time I was on fresh and fit with him was I think was me and Tori like Torshaw was on there with me and he's just a good he doesn't swear like he like makes a conscious effort never to swear, which I guess is kind of admirable, but I can't fuck that. I can't do that. So just a good guy, but like recently Zuby was I think now this is this is me speculating here. He was watching James Sexton's divorce videos on what you call it. He was watching it on on I think it was either Lex Friedman or it was Sam. There's no sorry. I got to call Sammy back up. But oh, okay. Got it. And so I'm I'm I got to pull some distracted by this people stop. Why do you guys text me when I'm in the middle of the show? So so Zuby is talking about prenuptial agreements and I'm like, where the hell where's this coming from? So he must have seen Lex Friedman's show with with James Sexton and I of course I asked him about that every I wasn't the only one there's a lot of other people are asking him about it and James was on Lex Friedman. He was on soft white underbelly. He's been he's been making the rounds. I think he might be going on Rogan in January. So and we tried a damnedest to get him on fresh and fit last time. We were out in Miami in November, but he caught C-19. So we couldn't really make that work out. So we're going to get him in Vegas and and talk to him. But what was interesting was like, I think that really pushed a lot of guys like like the way that James delivers his information and his data. I mean, he's he's a credible witness, right? I mean, he does this stuff for a living. He is a divorce attorney in New York and has seen all this stuff is very much red pill has read all of my books is I count him amongst my friends for sure. I was just on I did Andrew Wilson's Christmas telethon is his charity fundraiser thing and he was just having people come on and I happen to be on at the same time that James was and we had a really good discussion, but I think that he kind of rattled the cages of a lot of people who are more like sort of this conservative bent and going on Lex Friedman. I think legitimize them a little bit more with like people like say Matt Walsh or or Zuby, for example, and so what happens is that these guys get this and they go, you know, what this guy's right now. They see James and they don't see me. They don't see the red pill. They don't see the influence of the Manosphere. They don't see like the fact that like I've known him for a while. They don't see any of that that backstory. So this is a new guy delivering this information that is basically red pill information. He's just putting it in a much more palatable much more, you know, a good tone people can understand that they can digest the information very well and they take that foolishly take that over to Twitter or over to Instagram or whatever their social media of choices and in Zuby's case, it happened to be Twitter and they start talking about what you know, you know, the definition of love is a prenuptial arrangement or prenuptial agreement and evangelical Christians lose their fucking minds and people just like if they're a trad con of any, you know, moderate stripe, they they lose it on one of their own on Zuby who I would arguably say is most definitely I don't see trad con but certainly on the he's a he's a sweetheart of the conservative side of the aisle. Let's just say and I watched just the vitriol and just the I mean because in some cases like there was some people trying to you know, make their case because it went against their convictions their ideological convictions or religious convictions whatever spiritual conviction, but the empirical fact is that you need a prenup and if that's something that is a difficult conversation to have as James Sexton was saying if you can't have a you know, an honest conversation about a prenup. What else can you not have an honest conversation about and so then of course that leads into a lot of the other points that I have made in the past James has made in the past other people in the Manusphere for that matter Rich Cooper has made in the past about marriage and the modern state of marriage. So when people throw rocks at Rolla Tomasi, and they say Rollo's anti-marriage and then they find out I've been married for 27 and a half or almost a half year. If they discover that my daughter's 25 and she just got married in August and so then it's like well, he can't talk about the red pill because look he's married. What does he know? He's been out of the game for a long time like anything that could find a disqualified but when they want to disqualify me they go. Well, you know anyone who doesn't have kids and is single at 30 some on Jordan Peterson, for example, you have your 40 and you're single. There's something very wrong with you. You're the old guy in the club. If you're 46 years old and your girlfriend happens to be 22 Mike 13, you're a bad bad man. And that's that plays very well to that base. Oh, thank you very much for that. I appreciate you. I want to just go throw it. You know, if you thank you if you're going to give me Christmas cheer, I'm going to give you cheer to cheer right back at you. Thank you very much. I are there you go. They're here. Thank you. Send your do your worst. Thank you again. Everybody. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Should I take pictures of Ned in like the antlers because we have those antlers that go because I can't I mean the Greyhounds I kind of do look like deer. Here's Morgan is having a slight red pill epiphany slight. I don't know how I feel about that. Let's continue. He's getting heat from feminists because he questioned why Mary Earp one BBC sports personality of the year is Mary Earp a trune. Don't know."}
