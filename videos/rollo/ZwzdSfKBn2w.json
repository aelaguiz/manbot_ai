You don't want to give it away, can't give it away too soon! I apologize for being slightly late. I am not on fresh and true time, I promise you. Okay, in the studio, new carpet. The acoustics are fantastic in here. Oh yeah, you guys are gonna love today's show. Live from Reno, Nevada, this is The Rational Male. Welcome to the great Southern Trend Kill. You need men, they only want men. And when you want something, you're not gonna fight as hard to keep it as if you need it, right? You need to breathe, you need oxygen to live. You're gonna do everything in your power, including pushing other people down to go ahead and get that oxygen. But when you only want it, well, I don't feel like it today, whatever. And I don't think guys understand that for your girl to totally submit to you, etc., she has to need you. But at the same time, you need to be in that position where you give her what she needs. That's typically how relationships have worked, that's how they've lasted, and that's what it is. But when women only want men, they're not gonna do everything required to keep the man. But they're not able to retain a man because they only want to. Marriage, you're above all that, are you? It's just a piece of paper, that's your argument. I'm going to tell you the truth. You might say, well, I want to be free to pursue what I want to pursue. Satisfying your lust, you're satisfying your gluttony, you're satisfying your envy. What makes you think that those aren't gods that are ruling you? It's not just a metaphor that marriage is the bedrock of society, it's actually the bedrock of society. I was a therapist for a long time, and I talked to a lot of people about their marriages. I've been married 33 years as of two days ago, and it's gone pretty damn well. You see what it would be like to care for someone. You see what it would be like to have someone care for you and value you. The news a lot lately, we're below replacement rate as a population. What's your take on why this is happening? One of the root causes of it, Lila, is actually our loss of self-confidence. In order to bring children into the world, you have to be confident in yourself and in the world and in the country that you're bringing them into. And I think that lack of self-confidence is part of what accounts for the unwillingness or even lack of openness to bringing a greater number of children into the world. I think the replacement rate issue is probably the greatest underappreciated issue of our time. This is a 60-second decision. Should we have children? Yes. My vote is that we should have children because having children is a great thing for us and for the world. My vote is that no, we should not have children because they are a huge responsibility that neither of us is emotionally, physically, or mentally ready to take. You're right, but we are very lucky to have support from our family, from the village, from the community. We have financial means to be able to have a child. We're not broke. I don't think that having money is what makes you mentally and emotionally prepared to have children, and my point has not been proven yet. Well, I will be mentally ready in five years to have a child. Are you going to be? Let's find out in five years. Let us know thoughts, pros, cons, children. Are you having children? Tell us in the comments. All right, we'll be waiting for that five years. You now make a point of, that's an investment criteria for you. Well, behaviors are going to have to change, and this is one thing we're asking companies. You have to force behaviors, and at BlackRock we are forcing behaviors. What are you going to do when you're 60, by yourself, in your isolated hedonism, and what sort of sex object are you going to be then for your hedonistic promiscuity? That's no plan. If you're still an adolescent by the time you're 40, you're a creep. You're the sort of person that you don't even want to be around. You don't want to be the oldest person at the frat party. That is not pretty. There's something rotten about that, and I mean in that contemptible sense. It's something that's overstayed its welcome, man. And, you know, people are willing to forgive your immaturity when you're 22 or 23 or 28, maybe, or even 30. But, man, if you're still playing that game when you're 40, you are not a happy person, and you're going to be motivated to go out there and make everyone miserable. And so grow the hell up. Mmm, I'm pretty happy. Well, we already know who Kill is. Ethan? Is it Ethan? Or is it... I don't know. Of course! Of course! Um, oh my gosh. Do I have to? You go first again. I'm not doing this. No! I went first last round. I don't want to do either of them! I don't either. I feel like in long-term doses, I feel like Destiny would be more tolerable, so I'll go with Mary, and then I don't even want to say it. Right. You feel bad for Destiny? What about her husband? You feel bad for Destiny? What about her husband? I mean... I've got to be honest with you. I thought that this particular person was, like, well-to-do, married, all that shit. So it is a bit of a shocker. But anyway. It's Lauren Southern. Let's just... look. At this point, everyone fucking knows, okay? Let's not stop fucking beating around the bush, okay? I'd like to know more. Fuck me. Because everyone's saying it, everyone knows what it is. What's the fucking point in, like, being all discreet about it? Pee-pee? Pee-pee! Come on. Give it to me. Bring it home. Land the plane. Land the plane, Chad. Come on. It ended. Sorry. My bad, my bad. How we doing, guys? How we doing? Okay. Full disclaimer for this show. I have to be very discreet, and I have to be very bulletproof on this, because I am going to bring up some topics here that I have had kind of on simmer since about December. Yeah. We're gonna get into that. I don't know if you guys have seen the Lauren Southern confessional video that she did earlier this week. Now, again, I'm going to be discreet in this simply because for the sake of the parties involved. Not for Lauren's sake, but the other people that are involved in all of this. But we're going to get into it today. We're going to learn a lot of different lessons today, gentlemen and ladies, too. Thank you guys for watching. Put on my vest. There you go. Put on my vest. Put some clothes on, man. Oh, yeah. Nice. Thank you very much for that. I appreciate you. I'll give you one of these. Thanks, Agent 47, because this stream will probably get demonetized. In fact, I can pretty much guarantee you it's already demonetized. Thank you for your last stream that I couldn't watch live. You could have saved so many lives by telling them they are not stupid, reasoned by your facts and stats. Yes, thank you. Men do not process emotions the same way as women do, but a lot of them won't listen. Yes, of course they won't, because it's not in their interests to listen. And speaking of emotions, we're going to get into feels before reels. Actually, we're going to get into feels before feels before no reels today. Sorry, but that's the way it's going to work. I am in the new, improved studio now, if you can sort of get an idea of where I'm at. There you go. See, I've got two things. This will be my reading ledger from now on, which is nice. And then, of course, go back to the classic angle, which is still a little weird. Hang on a sec. There you go. I have the studio recarpeted, so the acoustics in here are a little bit different. So if there's a little bit of a reverb or there's some sort of \u2013 it sounds a little flat, it's because I've got new Berber carpet in here with lots of padding, too. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Yeah, thank you very much. What if I have the \u2013 if I've got the blood letter out in the back there, then it means it's going to be a good show. Yeah, you're probably right about that. I was just \u2013 I actually have been rearranging things in the studio and around here since I basically had to move everything out of the studio and then move it all the way back in again because I had to get it recarpeted. So, yes, thank you. Looks like lightning. Yeah, thank you. Oh, with this lighting. Yeah, that's the other thing. Another reason I was a little bit late today is because I am beginning to sort of just figure out how the lighting is going to work in this. I've actually moved my entire desk studio, my setup, like forward just a little bit so I have a little bit more depth of field so I can get shots like this. So there you go. Okay. You're going to have a lot of questions today, and I've got to do some legal disclaimers here in the first place. I am not doing this to actually smash anybody in the face. I just think it needs to be done for a lot of reasons, not the least of which to sort of settle the score between Lauren Southern and her ex-husband, who, by the way, I have been in contact with since about December. So that's my first confession. That's my one and only confession for this entire show today. I had her ex-husband contact me, reach out to me right around like December, I think early December, and he wanted my advice on legal situations with child custody. And I was like, well, why is that? And I hadn't done anything. I hadn't really had any contact with Lauren Southern for a while besides the ill-fated discord show that I did. And I think a lot of people think that I was trying to duck her or hide from that or anything like that. It wasn't actually. She interviewed me or we had this back and forth. I think it was like in November of 2021. And so everybody, oh, well, this is the interview that Rollo didn't want you to see. I don't care if you saw it. The reason you didn't see it is because it wasn't on YouTube. It was on Discord. That's why, on her Discord. And she was in complete control of the thing the whole time. So I'm just looking at you as I am right now. As expected, it's all carved up and it's custom made to order for shorts and everything else. So fine, whatever. Yeah, it is what it is. I hate using that term, but that's true in the sense. I don't understand how valuable your information is. Important guys like us. I close family friend. A close family friend deleted himself. Well, thank you very much. I'm sorry about your friend, brother. Trying to reach out to people before they do such things. So I'm going to respond to her video today. We're going to riff on that just a little bit because there's a lot of lessons involved in this. And she is one of many casualties. And I can't really say she's a casualty because of marriage or any of this other stuff that's going on right now. Simply because she's been divorced or she's been like on the verge of divorce or for all intents and purposes, divorced since August of 2021. And it started, I guess I should probably start from the beginning. So let's start from the beginning. I posted this back at the beginning of where the other I posted this back in. I think it was the beginning of May. I think it was May 5th or 6th or something like that. Maybe May 9th. I'm not really sure. This was after her most recent, well, at that time, it was her most recent appearance on Tim Pool. Keep that in mind. Bookmark that, people, because I wanted to, we'll definitely be coming back to Mr. Tim Pool today. But I was saying, you know, why is Lauren Southern wearing her wedding ring? That's important to remember because she's going to expressly point that out in her video here. And I believe half the reason she did her video is because she knows that I know. She knows that I know that she knows that I know that she ain't married and she's been trying to keep up appearances for a long time. And this is, you want to talk about red pill women or women who have been in the sort of space. I wouldn't really call her red pill. I can't really go that far. But you want to talk about people who, you want to talk about women with borderline personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder. I know she's got ADHD. I'm fairly certain she's probably somewhere on the spectrum as well. But again, I'm not a doctor and I do not play one on the Internet. But that's what kind of kicked this whole thing off. And so I had a lot of people going, where are you? How do you know this? Where do you get your information? I'm like, well, I can't really say because I'm having confidential private talks with her ex. And I was actually trying to help him get custody of their child. And I have done as best I could to put him in touch with legal experts. The problem is that he is presently in, I believe, in Australia, but he travels abroad quite a bit. And I think he's an Australian resident and has been fighting an uphill battle getting custody of his young son. And of course, she is in Canada. So I don't know anything about the laws in Canada, much less the laws in the United States. So I'm just trying to sort of help him out and sort of like, you know, listen to him and talk to him. All right. Let's see. But this morning, I think. I got an email from him this morning, and of course, he's seen the latest video by Lauren. He said, you know what, all that stuff about confidentiality, he cleared me to talk about it today. So, that's why I'm going to dig into this a little bit today because there's a lot of lessons to do to get into this. This is not just, you know, internet beef. This is not just red meat, although I know I used the red meat intro today. It's not just about that. There's a lot of lessons that are going on in here because we just had Stephen Crowder, of course, most infamously, on his way to divorce. But of course, that divorce started when? Over a year ago. And the video we saw for the Ring videos and all that good stuff, all that was collected and held onto for almost two years now. So when, say, somebody like Rich Cooper says, you know, when women are ready to divorce you, when you're finally having that talk or you're getting papers filed to you, that's just a formality at that point, that woman has already checked out of the marriage long before that. She's already been making plans. And that's how women tend to work when it comes to sort of their romantic interests. It becomes a hobby for them. It's funny. I'll tell you, as distracted or as like sort of like, you know, I think people would call it fickle. I wouldn't call it fickle. But I think women are far more calculating than most men want to give them credit for, especially if it's something that has to do with their long-term security and hypergamy. And as I've said before, and I said in the last, beans shall definitely be spilled today. We're already spilling beans right now. So sorry, not sorry. But definitely plans were made with Steven Crowder's wife. Certainly Lauren Southern has been trying to keep this a secret for quite some time while keeping up appearances. I mean, this is what people do to keep up appearances, specifically when their brand is premised on a narrative. And when I did the Steven Crowder show and I did the breakdown of all that, and just again speculating here, I'm not saying I have some sort of inside information about Steven Crowder or anything like that, but I will say that there are patterns that I notice between divorce, divorce, divorce, couples, couples, couples. And when your brand and your revenue and your livelihood is dependent on keeping up appearances, then you might wear a wedding ring on Tim Poole's show, even though you're dating Tim Poole. Yeah, I know that too. That deserves one of these. There we go. Yeah, confirmed. I think that might have had something to do with it as well. If you look at if you look at Lauren Southern's history now, this is an abject lesson, by the way, gentlemen, in red flags, you want to talk about red flags. This chick's got every single one of them. And if you're not seeing these red flags, Tim Poole, if you're not seeing these flags, destiny, if you're not seeing these flags, I can't point them out because I don't know for sure. But Hunter Avalon, if you're not seeing these red flags when you're interacting with these women, then you that's on you, bro. There's enough there's enough information and there's enough people trying to help you out with best of intents. You don't want to listen. Hear me now. Believe me later. And now it's later. Oh, boy. God damn. This is going to be a good one. Sorry. Strap your strap. You hold on to your butts, gentlemen. It's going to get going to be a bumpy ride today. So yeah, already dropped one bomb. Isn't that great? Yeah. What do you do? What do you what do I preach? Well, that's the whole reason I brought this thing. There's a whole reason this is in the whole reason this is in the house today. So yeah. Oh, God, I'm not even going to be able to keep up with the stream deck like sound drops. This is going to be this is going to be pretty intense today. So so strap in. I am I am going to get into other topics other than Lauren today, because there's a lot of sort of related topics that go along with this. Clearly, the first one is like people keeping up appearances. And when I when I threw this one out, where did when I threw this one out with the ring right there, I couldn't help myself. I'm sorry. You know, there's sometimes where I can't help myself. Did anybody see the the what was it to you, Dr. Phil? The second part, part two of Dr. Phil? It's out right now. I didn't even know I had come out on the day that it did. But I was I was in with Jedidiah Bila and Mike Sartain when we were in Miami, and that's when it aired. And my wife, I get back to the hotel, my wife was your show is on right now, like holy shit. And I already missed it because I was on the East Coast and she was on the West Coast. So she was watching it. I've seen it since then. Some people have done some clips. I didn't think it was good as a first one. But like people really like the part where I called out Dr. Phil. And I was talking about how men were superfluous. And that whole line of thinking or that whole I've got several essays on that. Usually when I bring those, bring up the superfluousness of men, it's usually on Father's Day. Happy Father's Day, everybody. Yeah. So we're going to get into a little bit of Father's Day festivities as well, because I'm a dad. I'm a dad of all of you. I am the father of one daughter and a thousand sons. There are 40K reference for you. So so, yeah, we're going to get into the superfluousness of men. And Myron in the very first clip for the the intro video that I did was sort of alluding to that. And we're really going to be getting into that today as well, because it kind of dovetails in very nicely with the victim mentality. We're going to get into the dark triad traits today. I got a really great I was turned on to a really great interview. It was a really great article, I think. I think it's Rob Henderson, actually, about the dark triad traits, personality traits and how it those kind of map onto a mentality, a victim mentality. Now, I don't I think maybe I halfway agree with it, but I got to say that when I look at dark triad traits and then I look at what's going on with, say, the victim mentality of Lawrence Southern, I kind of have to go, yeah, you might have a point there, Rob. So so we'll be getting into dark triad traits a little bit. I'm also going to teach you why you ain't never going to be happy, too. We talked a little bit about that on the last on the last show. But I'm seeing more and more of this, this narrative of happiness, this and happiness that. And you saw probably saw the interview that I did with with Janet Abeel where I talk exactly about this. Now, that clip only had a good like about 45 second portion of that conversation of a much larger one that I thought deserved a little more time. So I'll jump into that, too. Now, if you have not seen if you do not know who Lawrence Southern is, Lawrence Southern has been part she's been the sweetheart, the little blonde, you know, I think Laura I think. Who is it? Tommy Lahren would call her a Tatiana Tatiana, although she's sort of on the conservative side on the more, I would say, extreme conservative side. She's been around. I remember seeing her. I think the first time I saw her was on Steven Crowder show, as a matter of fact, and I think it was back in twenty fifteen or twenty sixteen must been early twenty sixteen. And she she was, I think, 20 years old, 22, somewhere around there. She had her kid at twenty three, not unlike Michaela Peterson, who she is also very good friends with. In fact, Lawrence Southern is very good friends with a lot of people on sort of the destiny side of the of the sphere, whatever that whatever that qualifies as. I think she has been trying to ingratiate herself with people like Ben Shapiro and get on to Daily Wire for a while. That never materialized for her, probably wisely on your part, probably because Ben Shapiro said, yeah, no, thanks, we'll try the next one. But I've got some history I wanted to get into. She's sort of is the typical victim mentality when it comes to her divorce. And I think what's interesting is this video that she did out in the middle of the forest somewhere, I guess, in the Canadian outback somewhere. It it smacks of sort of this retconning what really happened, and I can no longer bite my tongue. So sorry, but I'm going to have to like dig into that a little bit. At least I'm going to present her ex-husband side now. That said, people are going to say, well, why don't you just have her on your show? Rollo, why don't you have a debate with her? OK, I will. Come on. Hell, I'll do it. Remote. I would do this one remote. If I can do it, I will do it remotely. If I could get them both in the studio in Vegas, I would love love nothing more than to put Lauren Southern and her ex-husband together on the same panel show. Oh, Lord, please, God, let this happen. I would love this for for this to happen. I don't think it's going to. But before I jump into all of this, I want to put out the extended invitation to Mrs. Southern. Excuse me. Actually, that's not her. She kept her last name. So that ought to tell you one thing right there, surname retained, duly noted. So I want to say right now that if if she wants to come on this show and I will bring I will gladly bring her ex on, which I have already cleared with him, too. So if they want to come and hash it out and have me as the moderator, I would be glad to do it for you. You want to clear the air. You want to you want to make sure everybody knows what they're talking about, because she's really kind of tar and feather in this guy right now. And he's not he's not in a position to actually say much of anything right now because he has a government job. He works. He actually has a real frickin job. And I'm going to dig into some other stuff as well. Now, again, this is not me trying to be salacious. This is not me trying to, you know, just trying to square things out there because I know that he can't talk for himself. And he asked me to actually not to do this show specifically, but to to sort of represent his side. At least what we've talked about. And he's cleared me to actually read some of the stuff that we've we've our exchanges right now. So a lot of this is going to fly in the face, I mean, directly contradict what she said in her video. And I'm happy to do it. No problem. May justice be served. So I would I do such a thing, sir? How dare you? I'm a gentleman. So we'll dig into that here. Just a second. I wanted to point out, though, that, as I was saying before, Rich, according to Rich Cooper, she's got every red flag in the book and definitely somewhere on the on the spectrum. Thanks for that, Pat. Pat Steadman's Polish passport, he won't be using any passports anytime soon. Yeah, that's another thing. His arraignment and his sentencing will be September 8th, and he could get anywhere between 41 and 51 months in jail. Just saying. Tim Pool is dating a single mom. This after all the times he's dipped his toes in the Manosphere topics and FNF on twice. Well, remember, I wish I would have. I didn't pull this this picture, but there's the New York Post, man. You guys have been on fire lately. How come? Where's the love, man? New York Post. Where's the love for us? We talked about this on Access Vegas. I think it was New York Post was saying something about how these new dating shows are just doing all they can to just cherry pick all these girls or bring them in and make them look stupid. Well, we talked about that on Access Vegas on Thursday, and at least our show, we don't deliberately try to do anything remotely like that. And of course, we get run up the flagpole for that because everybody thinks that we're too soft on them and we don't contradict them. We don't punch them in the face like Miron would have gone and you would have gone and tasseled these dumb you dumb bitch. OK, well, I'm happy to say that that's not our mission statement on Access Vegas. However, doesn't mean we don't get heated and we have got heated before. So, you know, we don't have we don't have like a point to like castle any of the girls off the show. So if that's what you're waiting for, the Maury Povich moment, we're going to bash people over the head with like a folding chair. That's not going to happen on Access Vegas. So but it's not to say that women won't like walk off by themselves, which we have had happen before. So just something to keep in mind. Thank you. Yeah. Brett Cooper. Yeah. I saw that and blasted on. Yeah, I saw that, too. And by the way, Brett Cooper, if you watch this show, I would love to take you fishing, dear. I will take you real fishing. I will take you out and we will catch like big game because that's all I go after. Baby is big. All I go after a big game. I tweeted. What was it? No, I wasn't. I was on Instagram. I threw a reel at her. I mentioned her in a reel and or a story. And it was me. It was me, Tom, who does my my short my clips channel. And we were on the we were on Captain Nelson's boat. And it was when I was gaffing the fish on there. I'm like, if you want, I said, hey, you know, like, Brad, if you want to come real fishing sometimes, just hit me up. I'll take you out on the boat. We'll go. I'm dead serious. Like if you want, Brad, if you want to go, I will be happy to take you. We'll have a really good conversation on the trip and we'll get some really good content. But you will actually catch some fish. Sorry, Matt Walters. Nobody's doing. All right. All right. No. Yes. Let's see. Whatever. Yes, I'm all I'm also aware of the sort of the controversy that's been going on, my controversy, the shit that's been going down between Farah and Destiny recently. I also know that the the let's see, what was it? The video, the video with with MLG on Sauce cast was most definitely a setup. Now we've already got confirmation of that. He shouldn't have stepped on his dick, according to Rhinestone. But the he was walking into a trap. And today, you especially if you associate with me or if you're part of Rule Zero or if you're part of this side of the sphere or whatever, understand that they're trying to. They're coming for you right now. And that's a coordinated effort. And the coordination happened between Angela Knight. It happened between Farah and it also happened between Natalia of Sauce cast. So Natalia is now on that is now on that side of the roster. And that has been 100 percent confirmed. So just bear that in mind, gentlemen, if you are in this, if you have any, I know, aspirations to do this kind of stuff, beware, especially this time of year, because we're getting into the election cycle. There you go. Yeah. Yeah. "}
