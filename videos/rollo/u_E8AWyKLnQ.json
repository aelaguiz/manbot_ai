Who, like, come on, man, like, who gave Rolo Tomasi this, this God-tier status, like, Rolo Tomasi don't get no hoes, man. Like, show me some hoes Rolo Tomasi pulled, you know what I'm saying? So, like, really, like, y'all acting like he really popping, pushing P, like, y'all acting like he came out the womb saying P. I have never, ever done this in my life. Welcome to the very first All Birthday Red Pill Roast of yours truly, because today I'm old as F. I got lots of guests coming in today, but more importantly, let's hear what this man has to say. Live from Reno, Nevada, this is The Rational Male. Welcome, haters and lovers alike. Hope I have more lovers. You know what, my friends, my lovers can be more, have more vitriol. You can't be Red Pill, you're married. You can't be married, you're Red Pill. Don't wish it was easier, wish you were better, okay? Oh, wait, shit, it's recording. Hello, welcome. What's up, homies? How's it going? God. I don't know, it blows me out. Customer Appreciation Day! Yay! No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die. At today's day and age, you shouldn't be getting married until you're at least 35. That was my next question for you. As a man, what age should you consider getting married? What about women? So, I have, this is a question for you. What age should you consider getting married? At today's day and age, you shouldn't be getting married until you're at least 35. That was my next question for you. As a man, what age should you consider getting married? So, I have, this is my thing that I tell guys. I think 35 years old, had slept with at least 50 women, 100K per year, you're in shape, and you got six months to one year of savings. All right, done, I gotta get married, I'm done all that. That's easy. Here's the Republic right there. So, that is a recipe for a terrible marriage, by the way, guys. Waiting until you're 35 and have slept with 50 women, that is a terrible recipe for marriage by every available data point. It turns out that you are much better in terms of getting married if you get married younger, if you do not have a wide variety of sexual partners. All the stuff about being in shape and having money and all the rest, you should try to do that, generally speaking. But this notion that you wait until you're 35, you've already made a bevy of mistakes that have shaped your character and made you much more rigid as a person. And that you should have had a basis of comparison in terms of sex of dozens and dozens and dozens of women. No, the data do not support this, and it's stupid. Actual statistical studies where they took thousands of people, put them on dates. It was in the UK where they do this study. They put them on these blind dates, and then they match the blind dates on the succession to whether or not they get a second or third date, and they correlate that by astrological science. I love that. And do you know what the answer is? Because I'm sure you do. What is the correlation? Zero. Zero. I don't know. Mother. Zero. Zero point zero zero. He's a hater. Astrological science mean nothing. They mean absolutely nothing. You do. I'm hairy. You're right. It does have an effect. I'm feeling fire right now. Are you a fire sign? How about Libra? Oh my gosh, you said Libra. It's such a Libra thing to say. I'm not about to let Don Lemon or anyone tell me I'm not in my prime. I'm in my prime because I don't need Google to tell me. I think I'm in my prime because I've never felt better. I'm a mother. I'm a wife. I'm a mom. And I'm a member of the U.S. House of Representatives. I'm the first woman to represent my district in Congress. I'm a domestic violence survivor. I'm a mother. I'm a grandmother. This is actually my second career. There's nothing liberals fear more than strong conservative women. We have incredible women from all over the country who represent every walk of life and every background you can imagine. To say that we are not in our prime is just stupid. This is the time for us to shine. Republican women of all ages, we're just getting started. Our prime time is now. FBI, open up! Okay, you asked for it. Against my better judgment, here it is. Thank you. Thank you. Yes, there we go. That's a win! That is a win! That was the triplets. You guys are the best. You got the best. I'm the hottest man in the world. The triplets, I give you the triplets. I give you the best. You're the best. You're the best. You're the best. You're the best. That was the triplets. You guys are the best. You got the best. I'm the hottest man in the world. The triplets, I give you the triplets. Yes. Yeah, very funny. Oh man, the roasting hasn't even started yet and it's already started. Right? Oh my Lord. Thank you very much. Roll as a boomer. No, I'm not a boomer, dickhead. I'm a Gen Xer. That was from 1993. There's actually more to that tape. I had to dig that up. I had to go back into my VHS tapes. I had to find a VHS player. I had to get RCA jacks. I had to get an HDMI jack to go into the RCA jacks and then go into the computer and then see. I give and I give and I give. Oh my God. Yeah. Yeah. Boy, we are going to have a real spicy show today. I've got people coming in. Thank you very much. Yes. Even the tape was struggling to cope. Oh, I have some other spicy videos for you today too from my illustrious career. I got some really interesting photos and things for you today too. I don't like doing these shows. I really don't. But I'm 55 today. That makes me an Xer, not a boomer. An Xer. X-E-R. Not B-O-M-M-E-R. Got it? Okay. Good, good, good. Thank you very much. I was born in 1968, not 1958. Oh, geez. Oh, man. I had Big Mo was in there. Let's see. I had Sterling in there. Who else did I have? Oh, of course I had my good friend Mike Sartain. Oh, by the way, I wanted to point out a couple things. Natalie, I got your attention here. Would you like me to tell you? Today is going to be a day where I'm going to give you some really great old stories. I don't think I have ever done, I've never done a show where I like, I mean, all my shows since the Pat Campbell days have been like really like pretty much the video extension of my blog and my books. And so when I go on shows like Fresh and Fit, when I go on, hell, even when I'm on, when I'm on Access Vegas, I very rarely get asked like, hey, what do you like, what do you like to do besides play? Oh, by the way, the guitar, I did this on purpose. That's the guitar that's in the 1993 show. There's more than just the one, but that one was probably like, that was the beginning of the end for me, by the way. I was 23, 23. I believe I was 23 in that. How old was I? I would have been, let's see. So 20 would have been 88, 89. So probably about, actually, yeah, about 23, almost 24. I was almost 24 in that, in that episode or in that show. I got lots of, I could tell you all kinds of road stories, but I don't know if anybody would be interested in hearing the road story. People like stories though, right? I mean, story time with Rolo. Happy birthday. Thank you very much. I think everybody should get one of these today. All right. At least that. Long live Gen X. Yes, thank you very much. Yeah, please, please. Remember how we're all talking about accuracy? This is the accuracy I need. Thank you, Matt, for your generous donation. Yeah, I, geez, I know they're going to come in heavy. We're going to have a lot of guests today. I told everybody to hold off for about an hour so I can get into some of, like, we're actually going to talk about some stuff today too. But I figured I would give you guys some, what do you think about MLD saying? What do you think about MLD saying he's the Godfather of Manosphere? Be my guest. Please do. You can have it. Why not? Kevin Samuels was for a while. Who else? Izzy? I don't know. But please, yeah, go right ahead. You can have it. I'm done. Hey, this Godfather necklace here, you can have the Godfather necklace. I'm all right with that. Really, I'm fine. I don't need a title for people to understand what my reputation is. Good or bad. Thank you very much, my friend. Let's see. Thank you, Sweet55. Oh, from Amsterdam. Well, a country that I've actually been to several times. The Netherlands. Holland. I've been to, thank you. Thank you for the oddly $110 Canadian dollars. Thank you for that. Thank you for the birthday wishes. By the way, I'm probably going to take most of these today, my Super Chats today, and I'll put them into Ned's college fund. Would you like to know why? Would you like to know more? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Would you like to know why I'm going to do that? Would you like to know more? Yes, because I am going to be going and picking up a wonderful new pet very soon. Who owes picture I had available? Where did it go? Here it is. So I wanted to show you guys, because we had a family tragedy back in December, and we lost our girl. We lost Bambi. And at a very young age, too, she had only just turned eight, and that's kind of prime time for most greyhounds. But she, of course, fell to the big O, which is osteosarcoma. And so I want to \u2013 let's see if I can find this. Where did I put it? I have her in here somewhere. Where did it go? Who do I have? Oh, I got Mike. All right, what the hell. We'll just put Mike in here. As soon as he decides to show up. There he is. What's up, man? How are you? Hey, what's going on, man? I better get you in first because I know you're driving. I just want to let you know that nobody believes you're 55. They think you're 75. Yeah, they think I'm 75? Yeah, I bet they do at this stage. Hey, listen, let me tell you something else. I don't care what happens. It's your birthday today. You're going to have to have sex with me. Oh, yeah, well, that was already taken care of last night. Oh, yeah, listen, you ain't got to lie just because we're all young. I just hit it again tonight. How's that? Is that what I'm doing? Yeah, you know Mike said. Anyway, Kylie wants to break Terms of Service now. Kylie, please don't flash your boobs. Happy birthday. Kylie, she's saying don't flash your boobs. Don't break Terms of Service. Don't do it. Kylie, don't do it. Don't break Terms of Service. Don't get kicked out of the team. I'll just put a quick super chat above him. Mike, you guys are driving back to San Diego, correct? Yeah, I'm having a funny ball last night. Oh, yeah. I did a funny ball last night. Can you hear me okay? Yeah, yeah, I got you. I got you now. All right, so since I know you do your show for six hours on Sunday, when I get home, I'll just call you back. Yeah, I was going to say, as soon as you get into Vegas, just hit me up on the landline. When you hard line in. All right, man, I'll see you. I'll call you. I'll call you on the landline. Your landline, yeah. Hard line in. Oh, wait a minute. I got Sammy over. Sam, you can \u2013 oh, that's okay. Sam, thank you for \u2013 I got Sam Botta in the chat here, too. I just made you an admin, Sam, so just stick to the chats right now. I won't have anybody coming in for at least another hour anyway. But I had to get Mike in because I know he was driving back from San Diego. He went to the bunny ball, which was another fundraiser. One thing about Mike is he does a lot of fundraising stuff. What do you got here? You should call your next book series 1965. You know what? That's not a bad thing. One of the essays, an essay series that I'm thinking about turning into a book, is called 1971 right now. But we have a newcomer. Oh, wait. I got to read this. Thank you. I'm going to read every Super Chat today. I don't care. Hey, Rollo, happy birthday. I also have a birthday. I discovered you three years ago. It changed my outlook forever. I'm looking or I'm making 34 today. Thank you. Oh, very good. Anybody else birthday today? Sometimes. I'm sorry, I'll run into people like that. Let's see what else we got. Thank you, Mario, for your 4.99. Was that a super stick? Oh, no, it was a sticker. By the way, just so you guys know, I have a new monitor, I've got a side monitor. So if I'm looking up this way, it means I'm looking at the monitor that's right above the camera right now. And I put the chat in this kind of like a vertical monitor. So I've got a better control over the chat now. So behave yourselves. Would you like to know more? Would you like to know more? I can, oh shit, do I have it still up? I guess I do. Jesus Christ, okay, I can't believe I'm gonna do this because this was so long ago. These girls are probably in their 50s right now. I don't wanna like sell them out. Happy birthday. In one book, you said you slept with over 40 women in your life. Yeah, 42 and never caught a disease, no. Or got someone pregnant, no. How did you pull this off the safe way? I pulled it off the safe way. I think what's interesting is maybe it was, yeah, I think the, as far as like venereal, by the way, today's Q&A, you ask me whatever you want to as well. And I do have some actual things I wanna talk about. In particular, I've got a Jordan Peterson video I wanna sort of dig into just briefly. The Tates are out of jail, yes. I am aware of what's going on with Pearl. I'm gonna talk about both of those things today too. But I don't wanna get too lost in the weeds with those guys. How did I pull this off the safe way? I was careful, like you probably should be. You know, I think one of the things that when people read, when they read my plate theory series of chapters in the first book, the people who disagree with me sort of on ideological terms or in that context, they tend to take that to the most outrageous binary extreme, which is, well, Rola just says, fuck anything on two legs. No, no, I'm not. And if you actually, actually, actually read that, that there's six chapters on plate theory. Plate theory is just the cutesy way of saying dating non-exclusively. Spin plates, my friend, date a lot of women, whether that's having sex with them or it's having multiple opportunities and prospects going at the same time, I don't care. I even wrote into that chapter, if you, by, you know, religious or ideological or whatever, it'd be just personal convictions. You are not the kind of guy who wants to go and, sorry, Sammy, I'm gonna put this over here. You don't, you're not into either premarital sex or you're just, you're like, I'm a one woman kind of guy. I'm a, if that's you, I also write into that chapter about that. So that's what gets me is like, I can tell when people haven't read the actual book. And then also during or throughout those chapters, I say the same thing, like, be careful who you're putting your dick in. Like, I don't see why that's like outrageous. Rola wouldn't even think of such a thing. Yeah, you can be careful. You can also put your dick in the wrong girl and catch, I don't know, HPV or something like that as well. You can be with a girl of your dreams who you think is the ride or die girl. You met her in Bible study and she's just a great gal and she's never, she's got a pretty low partner count, but the one or two guys that she slept with, one of them gave her herpes. And now you got it. So it could be one, it could be many. What I'm saying is you just have to be careful. That's pretty much how I went about it. And no, I've never been responsible for an abortion. I've never got a girl pregnant and I've never had a venereal disease, period. Sexually transmitted, you can't say venereal now because it's like venery. You know, venery, there's your, that's your vocabulary word for the day. Venery, venereal disease. Look it up. You're from a line of super troopers. I am all that is man, all that is man. Wait, wait there. Yes, that's for you, destiny. Got something to say about destiny too. A little bit later. Happy birthday, Rolo, love from India. Your command over the English language and the way you articulate is top class. Keep going strong. Thank you. I think, you know what, would you like, okay, since it's my birthday, I can express this to you as well. People always say Rolo uses $10 words all the time, man. He's just trying to make people think he's smart. Yeah. I'm trying to speak like somebody who has an education and I have never written down to my audience. I expect you guys to like, if you don't know a word, that's okay. Somebody says something. The English language is a very, very rich language. It's not just, you know, bitches ain't nothing but tricks and hoes. It's not, it's, there's so much more to it. And I think we should like use the language. I'm not saying you have to speak in like Elizabethan England or like in iambic pentameter. Go look that up. There's another $10 word for you. But when I can't even like say the word superfluous on the Dr. Phil show, that tells me there's something wrong with the American population right now when it comes to vocabulary. I try to educate you and entertain you. Happy birthday Rolo, RT, changed my life for the better. Really appreciate your content. Keep on going. Well, you know. Well, I'm a whore. Yeah. Let's see. And I'm, I will read as many of these today as possible. I have not done a Q and A in so long. I can't even remember. Okay. Okay. Okay. Since you want to see this, wait a minute. \u266a I'm a whore. \u266a Their debut album is called Thicker Than Water. And when you see and hear tonight's special guest. This is Nia Peoples. Nia Peoples was a piece of ass back in 1993. Just, I'm going to go out there and say that. This was from, there was actually, hold on a second before I get too deep in the weeds. This show was from a Paramount Studio show, which by the way is where I went to go film the Dr. Phil show. So it was like coming home. I have done four different shows for Paramount Studios when I was in my mid twenties. The way this worked out. Oh, Jesus Christ. Thank you very much. Thank you, Big Mo. Thank you, Big Mo. Big Mo, you can come in later. Tell these bitches to go to hell. You can come in later and tell these bitches to go to hell as soon as I start taking everybody in here. So the, God. This was from a show called The Party Machine. And what I used to do back in the day was I was also a studio musician. And so I would get called for gigs. And this was gig work. Okay, this was not, I did not play for the trip. I was asked to play with them, but I was in another band at the time and I couldn't like actually go along with them. But they were just, they were looking for hired guns, hired hands. So for this show, for this episode here, it was like a real, there's two songs on this tape here. I only gave you the one because there's like a hot spicy solo in this one. But that guitar is the one I was using in the video. And yes, I did have very long blonde hair, which I will show you some pictures of later on. Cause this is the, I have been around the sun 55 times as of today. Thank you very much, Zach, for your contribution. You're all, you'll always be discontented. You can either deal with instructively or creatively. Thank you, Cirolo. I made my choice a long time ago. Happy birthday. Thank you. And please show us your Warhammer armies one day. You know, all you have to do to see my Warhammer armies is go to and follow, subscribe to the Masculine Geek. Masculine Geek. Just go look at, I don't have the, maybe Sammy can call up the URL for me. But it's, if you go on YouTube, just put that in, Masculine Geek, put that in the search engine, you'll find it. I play D&D with these guys. We do like stupid nerd shit all the time just because it's fun. And it's like, it's, I mean, it's not technically Red Pill stuff, but it's just like guys who are Xers. There are no boomers. There are only Xers in this thing. I think other than like Red Pill Thor, I think Red Pill Thor is the only Red Pill boomer, I think I know. With the exception of maybe Robert Kiyosaki and a few other guys, but other than, I wouldn't call, I wouldn't really call Kiyosaki a boomer. I mean, technically he's from that generation, but there's, it's like, sort of like your mentality is being a boomer and then like your demographic is being a boomer. But thank you very much for that, Zach. I appreciate, I appreciate you. Oh, and then this, is it working? Yeah, cool, cool, cool, cool. And then you can see devil horns behind me there. I'm finally kind of working that out. What I need to do is I got to get more lighting in the back there. I've got, I got new lighting that I've been trying to monkey around with a little bit. Okay, would you agree that hypergamy is more of a straitjacket now than beta bucks can be crowdfunded? No, I don't think so. Only because you have to, the reason why, because you don't understand why I say that it's not a straitjacket. The reason I say that hypergamy is not a straitjacket is so that people don't come at me and they go, that Rollo Tomas, those red pill guys think that hypergamy means that if a girl finds a better guy, she's just going to drop him and go fuck the other guy. The black pill doomers think that, like nihilistic, spurgtow, doom pill, guys who like want to find a reason for their own self-defeat. Yeah, yeah, they absolutely think that. That's not a red pill way of, let's put this, that's not a red pill fact. That's not an objective truth. In fact, I've done my best to, I'll say counter that, but I've done my best to sort of like buffer that. So when I'm talking about hypergamy not being a straitjacket, it means that there are many variables. So for instance, here's the easiest one to understand. You want to know why? Because when you're, let's say 20, 27, and the girl you're with is 26. Now she gets with you and she's in much more, a much greater position of like sexual market power. She's in like more, she has more sexual agency, right? She, you need her less than she needs or more than she needs you. That switches when she hits 32. And let's just say for sake of argument, you have a great relationship and things work out for you. Maybe you get married, maybe you don't, but you're just in a long-term relationship. You get to be 31, 32 years old. Now you are entering into your prime peak potential when it comes to sexual market value. And now suddenly the tables have turned, right? Now she needs you more than, in a sexual market value evaluation, she needs you more than you need her. Whether you acknowledge that or not is irrelevant. It's just sort of like the unspoken, you know, under it's the 800 pound gorilla in the room. It becomes more and more so the older both of you get. So when you are hitting your stride say like 36 years old, and you have the things that make you the most attractive, assuming you have maximized your potential. Now, the hypergamy that worked in her favor back in when she was 26 and you were 27, now that you're 37 and she's 36, now the tables turn. You wanna know why marriage is such a, marriage is that can definitely be a straight jacket, especially the way we do it right now. But the reason why women want those fail safes for long-term security is because they know that those tables will turn at some point. And they want to make sure that they get dividends on the investment they made in you 10 years prior. That's why I say that hypergamy is not a straight jacket. There you go. Hopefully that's, see how succinct, there's another $10 word, succinct. I made that comprehensive, concise. Happy birthday, Rola. I wanna tell you, you changed my life for the better. Awesome. Say my name. I first found you on SoSwap about 2005. Ooh, man, you are old. Just like me. I used to search for your posts specifically, respect the last boomer. Let's see. Oh, hey, Purple Pill Podcast. Well, you can have one of these. How's that? Happy birthday, brother. Thank you for all I've learned from you. Excellent. Standing on the shoulders of giants do, and by the way, so am I. I'll be the first to admit. Do you see a shift in more content showing women are leaning red pill? No, I don't. Example, Xena crying on FNF the other night. Yeah, I mean, acknowledging the truth or acknowledging the factual basis of the red pill. I don't even wanna say like, I hate even using the word truth right now. You know why? Because everyone wants to use the word truth in a subjective sense. They wanna say, well, my truth, his truth, their truth, Bob truth. But back to your point. Do I see it happen? Yeah, I see the acknowledgement of red pill facts. I see the acknowledgement of the, like in most cases, the begrudging, there's another vocabulary word for you. Boy, I'm full of them today. Full of it, that old man's full of it today. So I see the sort of realization and the acknowledgement for sure. Absolutely. Whether or not they turn into someone like Pearl or Allie or Torsha, who I love, or Janelle or just, what the hell is her name? I don't even know. Give me the name of the next flavor of the month with the red pill females. In that perspective, I think that women will get into the red pill up until the point where they have to deal with that shit that I've been dealing with for what, 20 some odd years now. And it's a hot kitchen. So if you can't take the heat, don't even get into the kitchen in the first place, ladies. Thank you. Thank you, purple pill. Do you, oh shit, what the hell's your name? I'm sorry. Sergio, Sergio, thank you very much. Hey, I remembered. Not a senior moment. And no, I do not, I did not get an AARP card in the goddamn mail, Aaron Clary. Thank you very much. Who will probably be showing up here any minute now. Happy birthday, Rolo. I've just finished my birthday, 32nd and my dad's 70th. Oh, good. Congratulations. Threw a big party for him, me and my dad. Me and my dad has birthday on the same day. Oh, April 2nd. Good. Hey, well then you get one of these because we're all Aries. We're all Aries. Yes."}
