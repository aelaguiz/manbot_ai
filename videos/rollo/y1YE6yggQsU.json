So, like, really, like, y'all acting like he really popping, pushing P, like, y'all acting like he came out the womb saying P. Y'all ready to get your, get your anger on, anger on, anger on, you know, I don't want to get back to you, it's all about good feelings. Welcome to the next installment of The Rational Male Live From the biggest whole city in the world, this is Silicon Valley, Nevada, not Vegas, the Northern Command Center of Red One Studios, I've got something else that's about that, and boy, do we have some, some easy giddits for you today. Yep, we do. Oh yeah, you know, I tell you this, whenever I get to the, whenever I get to the political side of things, or I get to the social side of things, everybody has an opinion, and we'll see more and more of this coming up in the future too, but before we get started, I don't need giddits. And I had sex for the first time, I was like, huh? Now look, I was in a relationship, I was with a guy for four years, but when I first had sex with him, I was young, and I didn't know who I was, I didn't even know my buddy, I didn't know, and so I was like, people have made out for it to be very grand, and I didn't feel it, so then I dismissed sex, I was like, clearly it's not for me, like, it's not like, yeah, maybe this is it, maybe this is, and it wasn't until I met you that I was like, holy shit, this is what people are talking about, and so to your point, I'm not telling people to go out and just sleep with anyone, but man, when I met you, I was like, I knew what I had, the spark, the electricity, the intimacy, the passion you can have from sex, it wasn't there, but I wouldn't have known that it was missing if I hadn't then had the experience and then met you. Finish last. No, no, no, I think nice guys win at a certain time and at a certain age, and I don't think that there's a set age on that, I don't think it's like 28, nice guys start, I think it takes a nice guy with a good foundation, and then meeting a girl at that time who's like, I'm looking for certain qualities for the rest of my life, also, I think a lot of fuck boys, so to speak, turn into really nice guys, or they can, like I think anything can happen, and I don't think good girls are hard to come by, or nice guys finish last, I think it's like the perfect combination of timing, and then it can work. He chose poorly. Why guys would have a problem with a woman with a high body count, though? Do you understand the logic behind it? I think it's insecurity, that's where it comes from. Do they really want to have a woman that is just a virgin? Because she's not gonna be good, and she's gonna have no experience. They don't need you to be good, though. That's so boring. Isn't that boring? It just sounds transactional to me. So guys that are alpha guys that want to be, you know, head of household and consider themselves leaders and want to provide for their women, they don't find it unattractive that a woman would have inexperience, because they feel like what's going to make that experience in the bedroom so powerful is not that she can bounce off the walls or knows all these tricks or knows all these sexual things and, oh, look, she's doing something like out of a porno. That's not what's appealing to them. What's appealing is that she's really excited to be there for him. She's present. She's committed. And he doesn't need her to be an acrobat. He just needs her to be loyal. Well, I'm a whore. Up there that have boyfriends that are treating them with disrespect, standing them up on dates, not calling back when they say they will, not showing up when they say they will. And when they do show up, they show up with some smart comment. No flowers. They don't hold the door open for you. They don't buy dinner. They think you need to buy dinner and you need to pay half and you need to do this. Simply just ask them, do you believe that men should provide and protect women and children? And if they don't say yes, are they real men? I don't know. I would leave that for you to decide. This post is going to get all kinds of people talking about blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I'm not going to let a girl do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do. I guarantee everybody listening to this came from a woman. I don't see how you can disrespect one. I don't chase booty. You don't unfollow her because you're showing emotion. You need to be able to stand in that fire. I promise you can do so much better than these red pill, Andrew Tate dating guru people. For one, these people are not happy. And I know that they're telling you that. They're like, look at my sick ass life. And I have this boat and I have these chicks on this boat. And like, I know that they're pitching all of that, but like, these people are not at peace. They're always angry about something. And if you've ever had a friend who like, every time you call them was like always pissed and like had, you know, an ax to grind, just not really like a comfortable energy to be around. These people tout that they're like, you know, the role models for young boys, but I would never want to grow up and just be angry and alone at a microphone all day. I mean, that sucks. I mean, I don't care what your bank account says. The other thing that's important to acknowledge is these people are never in like happy long-term relationships, which again is like, you're touting. Um, who wants to tell them? That you're like a genius and expert when it comes to dating, but like, all you have is failures. That's just, I don't know if you get a fitness coach, I expect them to know a thing or two about being fit. If I, uh, who wants to tell them? Get a dating coach. I expect them to, you know, not only ever have horror stories for their dating life, which is what it seems that these people have. So seems worth, worth thinking about that before you listen to them. Hmm. I see. I think men are having a harder time, which is why people like Andrew Tate popped up. I have people like my dad and I'm not a great admirer. That keeps on giving beauty and the beast. And I do think that's the best Disney movie ever made was that it's a real female hero myth. And the woman beauty is beautiful. So she's high up in the female dominance hierarchy, but she's witty and well-read and intelligent and adventurous and brave and courageous and truthful and all of that. And she doesn't fall for Gaston, the psychopathic persona. And young women are much more likely to fall for men like that, by the way, than women who are slightly more, uh, um, what would you say? Yeah. Why is it? Why is it? So they'll get in the irony of this. Yeah. Yeah. Juxtaposition. Maybe go, go look that up. Fall for dark triad men. And that's partly how psychopathy propagates itself across the generations, but they can be enticed by psychopathic personas, but she prefers the beast. It's like, well, the beast is the adventure. It's like, well, is this terrible man? You know, like he's, he's rough. He's unhealed. He's, he's, but he's got potential. Right. And that's what really attracts her. And she wants someone who can guard the walls and make a safe haven for the children, but it was generous enough to who's productive enough to be useful and generous enough to share. And so she civilizes him. Do you realize that the reason she ended up in the beast's castle in the first place was because he kidnapped her father? Bunch of sexual partners before they get married. Are they more likely to file for divorce? No, because men aren't filing for divorce period. It's 80% of divorces that are being filed or filed by women. And so that's the issue. It doesn't end up being the same thing. When you see whether or not men or women are happy in a relationship as men, they start off as virgins. They're pretty happy. And then it drops off and then it sort of flattens out for women. It drops off and it just keeps dropping. The more sexual partners they had before they got married, the less happy they are in relationship. For rich men, they can't help but attract women that like lifestyle more than connection. Because a woman that really values connection, she doesn't like a rich man's lifestyle. A woman that really needs emotional connection, she finds being with a CEO or being with a really successful man is hard for her. She leaves because she wants emotional intimacy. So rich men are almost left with women that love lifestyle, who will compromise an emotional connection in order to get that financial investment. And so rich men are left with a pool of women who are not as connected to them. And then they go to hell. Oh, man. I timed that just perfect. Oh, man, timed that great. How we doing, people? How we doing? OK, I'm gonna jump right in today. I've got a bunch of stuff to get into. Primarily, I wanted to talk about the sexual revolution, because apparently that's topic du jour these days. And it kind of dovetails into something I've been writing about. Article that will probably be going live, I think, tomorrow. I don't usually do on Sunday, but like tomorrow morning, I'll probably publish this. And number one thing I wanted to get into today, tonight, whatever, is I wanted to talk about sort of like the post sexual revolution, just the fallout from that. And a lot of it has to do with the fact that we're in a position right now where we're going to stay. We're in the latter stages, I think, of the sexual revolution, which is still an ongoing experiment right now. And I was looking at a tweet not too long ago from Rob Henderson. And I've quoted Rob Henderson on this show so many times, I can't even recall. Rolf Dangan, Steve Stewart-Williams, Rob Henderson's on that list. Gad Saad's on that list. Marty Hazleton's on that list. And Rob is one of the few guys that I sort of have been following, sort of the progression of his education. Anyways, he's a doctoral candidate, I think. And I want to say he's at Oxford right now. I'm not sure. Kind of a sort of a bootstrap, pull yourself up by bootstraps success story. And I like that. I like his attitude, but I've seen him kind of shift from being a little bit more analytical and objective to sort of getting into, I need to be an influencer. It's not enough to just be a research guide or an author or anything else. And Lord knows, this is certainly not a topic I'm unfamiliar with. Being an author of five books myself, please go pick them up on Amazon, available on Amazon today. But if you haven't read The Rational Male, it's kind of require reading for today's pod class. And well, just being here in general, available on Amazon. Actually, all five of them are available on Amazon, Audible, and you can get them on Kindle, of course, as well. So I don't really do plugs all that often. I started thinking about that. I'm like, why don't I plug my book a little bit more? I presume everybody's already read it. So maybe that's a bad presumption. I don't know. Anyways, actually, I should say it is a bad presumption because I got enough people right now who make stupid presumptions. I'm not anybody here, of course, but to make kind of stupid presumptions, by the way, yeah, you can go. It's in the description. It's in every single description. Thank you. Thank you for the compliment. But it's in every single description. Just that's below the fold. Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Here we go. Thank you. I'm the monkey. Hey, thank you. Thank you for coming back. Thank you for contributing tuition. Thank you for paying it forward for everyone else today. Okay. So anyways, yeah, we have to stop the show. We always stop the show for PeePee. Sorry. Anyways, and I'm keeping a track of Super Chats. Now, just before we get underway here, I hope I don't run into the same issues that I did last week. We had, it was really difficult to get Super Chats up or any kind of messages to superimpose on the screen. I think we're past that now. I think of whatever the problems were, the issues were that StreamYards finally worked those out. I did a rule zero yesterday on Aaron Clary, Captain Capitalism, Cappy's channel. And we had a real feisty debate on that show. And I thought it was actually pretty good. So if you haven't seen that, and by the way, it's only like, I don't think it's more than 90 minutes. So I'll tell you the one thing about Cappy is this, is like he gets in, he gets the job done, and he gets out. Right. And that's it. No dicking around. No screwing around. No nothing. It's just all business. Minimalist, as you might expect from Aaron Clary, the master of minimalism. But it was a really good discussion, a really good talk. We were talking about the governor of South Dakota and her sexual exploits and her scandal. That's not a scandal. That won't be a scandal that no one will care about in about another half an hour. No one cares. They only care if you're a dude. If you have a penis between your legs, then that makes a difference. But apparently not for what's her name from South Dakota, who has had this ongoing affair for something like six or nine months. I think maybe even longer than that. With one of her staffers, staffers. Yes. Christy. Thank you for that. Thank you for reminding me, Christy. No, no. I'm new. I'm there you go. Oh, OK. Oh, thank you. You know, you don't always have to make a super chat. Sometimes I catch these just out of the corner of my eye. Rasha is there. Here's the question you're not going to look at. Oh, oh, contrary, Jason. But when is the sexual revolution experiment going to end? It's not. It will never end. There will be some sort of. Fallout, there'll be some sort of legacy of the sexual revolution that will stick with us forever. It's very similar to when I say and people. Quote me on this. Everybody, everyone, all your house. But when I when I was talking to Jed Abila, for example, I think this is the most recent time. I told her I said, look, you know, everyone, you know, who was born after 1964 1965 is a feminist to some degree to some in some way shape or form feminism has influence molded configured. Whatever has has the idea law, I ideology or the even if you say I don't really believe in it. But the the practices or the ideology or the presumptions that maybe that's a better term the presumptions that are made in feminism. You already carry those somewhere inside of your head right now. Like when we get into the conversations about and we will by the way get into this today, but when we start talking about, you know, repeal the 19th, right take away women's rights. We should never have given women the right to vote the very fact that you're like indignant about that or maybe you're indignant about the fact that somebody is actually suggesting that that's evidence of your feminist training. So if you were educated in the enough certainly in the United States, but if you were educated in the in Western culture or at a First World Western country in the last 5560 years something like that you have had feminism in some way, you know inserted into your way of thinking. The other thing is and by the way, I'm not saying that's a good thing or a bad thing. I mean, maybe it's a bad thing who knows but like the very fact that people would say I'm not like I don't identify as a feminist. Lots of women will say that hell half the women we're going to discuss in today's show don't necessarily identify as being feminists. They they would not like to they every everything that comes out of their mouth is a feminist talking point or it is a derivative of a prior feminist talking point, but the the whole thing comes down to like the fact that the way you think or the what you the presumptions you make of what ought to be and what not ought to be are have been at least in some way influenced or structured by teachers that you've had who have also been influenced by feminist thinkers feminist thought feminist ideals. Gloria Steinem Betty Friedan, I'm trying to think of some other ones. I'm these are the militant feminists that everybody knows right our bodies ourselves, right the feminine mystique. I don't I think most people when they talk about like they will call them like third wave feminists. So there's no waves of feminism. But when people talk about feminist they can maybe they can name Gloria Steinem. They can't even name Betty Friedan. They can't name anyone else. In fact, if you go and you ask them like the average woman that goes on fresh and fit and they rattle off some like feminist talking point from the 70s, they would never be able to name a name where it came from. So but they nonetheless, excuse me, by the way, double mountain coffee. Nonetheless, they are influenced as well as you on some and as well to myself on some way in some way shape or form when it comes to feminism. Now the thing also applies to the sexual revolution. I was born in 1968. The sexual revolution, you know, more or less began right around 1965 ish. I usually peg it right about that time. Some people will say it's before some people say it's after but let's just say it's like the mid 60s and that's the that's going to be the jump off point for today. We're going to talk about the sexual revolution, but also like feminism, which I should also add that feminism at least the one that this the brand of the the more contemporary feminism that we think of today is actually a derivative or a product of the sexual revolution. So when we start talking about when I say, hey, you know, you've been influenced by feminism. You're also influenced by the sexual revolution. So for instance, I'm born in 1968. I have never known a time in my life where casual sex or what we think of as casual sex anyways today or all of the great talking points that we're going to get into in the 2024 election cycle because everybody's going to get back to virtuous virtue signaling and conservatism and trad con ism and neoconservative neocons. I went that's even a thing anymore. We're all going to get back to the save the West narrative that I'm making that prediction right now. In fact, I think I've already made it before but as a result of that we are reanalyzing things like the sexual revolution and we it's still a quote-unquote experiment and I don't think enough people really realize how long-term that experiment is. It's not like we had the sexual revolution of five years over. Well, that was a good experiment. Let's go look now. We're somewhere else. No, no, we're not the fact that we're even talking about like, you know, let's just say male athletes in female sports right there. That's a that's a product of the sexual revolution gender identity the belief and I do my like to the religious level belief that gender and sex are separate from one another. That's part of that belief. That's part of that intersectional. Let's say feminist, but that intersectional education on gender versus sex and you will hear this repeated ad infinitum like over and over and over again last time. Of course, I that I drew attention to this was when Matt Walsh was on dr. Phil with the one another the feminist professor and then you know, the bearded lady and his friend her friend hits whatever they are friend and explaining why you know that the presumption of gender is based on one thing that sex and gender are separate from each other and they are not and the closer we get to people accepting the fact that evolutionary psychology is actually a real deal or when people understand the the four laws of genetic behaviorism that flies out the window, but nobody that's that's like a college course. That's hard to wrap your head around. It's easier to say. Well gender is something in sex is another thing. Know what you're doing is you are oddly enough the woaxy liberals who believe in this kind of stuff and I do say belief because it's really a it's a form of belief because empirically speaking. It's incorrect. But when you look at the the degree to which people keep repeating this over and over again, it's it's all founded on social constructionism and oddly enough. I've found and you're going to see we're going to find out today that conservatives actually buy into the same crap and there are as we I'm going to give you the primer here real quick as we get into today's discussion today. There are three sort of fallacies belief fallacies that we need to consider before we get into the sexual revolution. We get into feminism. We get into all this ism crap, but those are the three things are this. Okay. One is social constructionism. I've talked about that so many times which I think is sort of the foundation of this emotionalist, you know, gynocentric stuff. So we'll come back to that but social constructions. The other one is the the myth of the noble Savage right then the naturalistic fallacy. Okay that if something is natural, it's necessarily better that if we can go back to some sort of tribal shamanistic way of life that that's going to be more satisfying and content inducing and make you more happy and you get back to the basics and we're going to do some sit and meditate on some Shoreline somewhere like that's we're going to get back to two basics. We're going to we can take we can smoke weed and we can we can take ayahuasca and the Amazon Rainforest, but we can't take DMT because that's not natural. You know, we can we can micro dose psilocybin and mushrooms and everything but you're not supposed to take like synthetic stare. You can't take trend, right? That's what that baby would that be wrong. So it's the naturalistic fallacy and then the last one and this is the one I was just getting at is really the the ghost in the machine. Okay, what that means is that there's sort of a body mind or the soul versus you know, there's a something outside yourself your consciousness exists beyond your but separate from your body and that's really a lot of the basis of a lot of religions. It's a base of a lot of superstitions. It's a basis of a political thought as well. And it's this understanding or this idea anyways that there is some sort of body mind separation and the now hear me out here. I'm not saying I'm not trying to put this in like woo-woo magic thinking at this point, but really what it is is if you take that idea not only the social constructionism side of things, but if you take the idea of the ghost in the machine and you put it a parallel it I should say with the idea of gender ideology or the which of course means like, okay, there's a difference between gender and and your and your sex your sex is just like your plumbing in your biology and everything else is like sort of up to you and the individual really what that is is the separation between sort of like the spirit and or the mind or the being influenced by the culture and the body itself and that's the the separation between those two and religious conservatives do exactly the same thing. They just do it in a different flavor. They just do it in a different context woke see leftist liberals do the same thing as well. The only thing is is it works in their benefit when they're trying to explain to you that it doesn't matter what your what your body type is. It doesn't matter what you like if you have, you know tits in a vagina or you have a penis hanging between your legs. You can be anything you want to you can decide whatever the hell you want to it's all subjective. It's all relative relative, right and there is no separation between the body and your or there's there is a big separation I should say between your gender identity and your body. Okay, the same thing exists. I should say between the guys who want to say separate themselves from like well, there's they have this sort of spirit or the soul or whatever else and again, if you want to know what role Tomasi's faith is all about I've written quite extensively about it in my fourth book. So I'm not going to dig too deep into it right here. But the difference is is like there's this consistent belief that there is a separation between the body in this and the soul of the body in the spirit which of course is consciousness in this in this case. All right. Thanks Tetrix. Bye. Thank you for your contribution. There you go. Is that what you wanted? There's there's that there's that attention you ordered and now everything's slowing out. Great. Okay, so I'm probably going to have to read your super chats. I apologize in advance. Actually, let me get to these real quick before I do that. Let's see if I can get this up on step up. See ya. God damn it. Extreme yard. You need to really do something about this. Okay. Thought about this question yesterday. I think it's right on topic. Do women ever feel guilty? Okay, we're going to keep that one for later on. I will come back to that promises and let's see what else we got here. Oh Sam bought it. Thank you, Sam.
