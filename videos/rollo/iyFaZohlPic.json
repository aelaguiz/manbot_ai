We're going in. It's been a long time since I've hosted this show, and this is my show. I've got Ryan, I've got Jack Napier, I've got Red Hawk, I have Redfield Thor, I've got some dude who looks like he belongs at the WWE, I have a fine Englishman with us today, I've got some guy who looks like he belongs in Boogie Nights, and then I have the one, the only, inimitable, J. Sexton Esquire, which means landowner by the way, with me today ladies and gentlemen, I present to you, the Legion of Doom. All right, now let me turn off the echo collation so you don't get echo. There you go. All right, gentlemen, you can unmute yourselves now. I haven't used that song in so long, gosh, I forgot I even had it still on the board. All right. Okay, let me just go around the horn here. Ryan will join us at some point, Jack Napier will unmute himself at some point as well. Gentlemen, how are we doing today? I have James Sexton with us today, who is fresh out of his interview with Lex Friedman, that was awesome. Did anybody see that? Anybody catch that yet? It just came out. When did it drop, James? Yeah, earlier this week. Earlier this week. We did it live, we shot it last week in Austin, and six and a half hours, we talked with two like five minute bathroom breaks, and he edited it down to like four hours, but yeah, it's doing well. How much got in from what you saw? A lot. A lot. I actually think this stuff he took out was probably where we went off on like ridiculous tangents because we're both like movie buffs, so we went on a whole thing about like how awesome Gary Oldman was in True Romance when he played the pimp, so he took that out, you know? No, it was good. I mean, it was a great, you know, Lex asks interesting questions, you know, I think he's more interested in asking interesting questions than trying to offer answers, and I always really like that, so it's good stuff, it's good stuff. People asking about where Cappy and Fitch is, if they drop in, they drop in, they have the link, but we'll see how it goes. Oh, and matter of fact, who do we have here? Tren Lawrence has decided to join us today, yeah, okay, so boy, we're gonna have an all-star cast here today. This is the ugliest fraternity I have ever been invited to play, I have to tell you. You know, they always say, oh yeah, it's the, what is it, the Avengers unite? No, no, this is Legion of Doom. Does that make Matt Walsh Wonder Woman on the other side? Yeah, I was gonna say, so I wanted to call everybody together, boy man, whenever I do, everybody shows up, right? I wanted to do today's topic because I sort of started locking horns with a lot of these trad cons just recently, and I didn't even realize I was doing it until I had Jeremy Boring, who, by the way, is the, I guess one of the senior partners at Daily Wire, I didn't realize that. That's the founder. I was like, who is this newbie? No, wait a minute, no, that's that, it's that Jeremy. He's the guy who, I believe, locked horns with Steven Crowder not too long ago over his, oopsie, here we go, now we got John Fitch, John Fitch in the house, everyone, yeah, geez, how many guys do we got, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, I got room for one more dude, they only let you have 10 people in there. You can take it, Rolo, as long as you want it. Yes, yes, yes, yes, by the way, chat, if you guys have questions, especially for James, James has about an hour before he has to go to a deposition or something, I forget what, he actually has a real job amongst all of us, he's the one with a real job. James has been, James, let's just introduce you first. You have been doing divorce, you've been a divorce attorney for, what, 20 years now? 22 years. 22 years. I'm 23. And I just did a, I guess it was kind of like an impromptu interview of you when I was up in Lake Tahoe, and I don't think people really understand, remember our history such as it is. It was funny, because I think I started using clips from your Soft White Underbelly interview, and then, I don't know, I guess it got back, you got banned, maybe you just followed me and stuff, and then you emailed, you reached out to me and said, hey, I'm that dude, remember? Well, you're actually, yeah, you're given like a kinder version of it, like, let's just put it the other way, which is, I wrote you like two years ago, and, you know, either you ignored it, or it ended up in your spam, because I got the name, you know, the word sex in my last name, so I ended up in everybody's spam, but I wrote like, hey, man, love the books, like, really, you know, just think you're great, like, there's a really interesting intersection with divorce stuff you should be talking about, I'd love to come on, never heard from you. Never heard anything back from me. And then, I do Soft White Underbelly, it's got like 3 million views, and I'm flipping through YouTube, I'm watching your stuff, as I do anyway, and suddenly, you're talking about me, and I'm literally yelling at my TV, going, I emailed you, man, like, what are you doing? Like, I want to, I'll talk, and he's like, I got to get this going on the show, and I'm like, yeah, no shit, thanks. So, I actually- If he doesn't return your calls, it means he's a friend. Well, I emailed him again, he still didn't write me back, I don't know how, like, get, you're like finding El Chapo, it's like impossible. So, I finally just went on one of your things, and sent a $50, like, whatever chat, so I, and I just said, hey, this is my email address, I'm trying to get ahold of you, and then you wrote me like 10 minutes later. Yeah, yeah, I hit you back, and then like- You'd be a hard guy to assassinate, that's all I can say. I'm like, who is this dude? And then I'm like, oh, it's that guy. Yeah, but we ended up having a pretty good, what, about 3 hour conversation up in my house in Chicago. Yeah, we rolled through it, man. I think we probably could have gone 5, 6 hours. You know, see, that's the great thing, it's like, there's like, there are a few people who can out-talk me, you're one of them, and Mike Sartain is the other one, so, yeah, so, but yeah, we had a good conversation, and by the way, nothing but positive feedback on that, I mean, literally, there was, I'm usually looking at like, held for review kind of comments for like all of my shows and everything, nothing in that one whatsoever, everybody was like, just glowing on that one, so. Yeah, it's crazy, you know, the Software Underbelly interview with like 3 million views, it has, I think like 24,000 comments, and I haven't read all of them by a stretch, but I would say it's like, you know, 95% of them are positive, and it hit a nerve, you know, with people, I think, you know, even the Lex thing, I think it hit a nerve with people, and I think people appreciate that I'm not just, I don't want to say talking out of my ass, but I'm not just sort of speculating philosophically, I'm pointing out what is actually happening in the chair in front of me, in 22 years of practice in divorce law, and what's happening in courtrooms, and what's happening with actual people, like the women who come in and explain to me why they cheated, the men who come in and explain to me why they cheated, or why they got cheated on, or what was going on in their marriage, and, you know, people lie to their therapists, people lie to their friends, people lie to social media on the daily, but you don't lie to your lawyer, you know, lying to your lawyer or your doctor, it's like the two stupidest people to lie to, because there's confidentiality attached, and our only job is to protect you. So, you know, people tell us the truth. And so I'm trying to broadcast that truth without betraying the confidentiality of any of my clients, because I think this is a time where truth is in, you know, high demand and scarce resource. So, you know, that's one of the reasons I've always liked your work, Rollo, and I think you're very authentic. Thank you very much. So I wanted to sort of gather the tribes here today, because, like I said, I was sort of coming under fire from, I don't know why I'm actually personalizing this, but I had, Jeremy Boring was coming after me, just kind of indirectly, I think, and of course, Matt Walsh has to pile on, and all of a sudden you got, what, Michael Knowles is coming in at me, and I'm trying to think who else was involved in all of this. Who else is running up the flagpoles? Who else is running me up the flagpole this time? Jeremy, Ben. Right. Davey Wired. Davey Wired. Davey Wired. Davey Wired. Candice. Candice. Candice. Of course. Candice. They all come in, though, don't they? Candice is lying low right now because of her, like, she shows, or she hates on Crowder, which by the way, the quote unquote leaks are out now, which we've all, James and I have discussed privately, which I'm not touching with a 10 foot pole just at this point. But she comes at Crowder really hard for his divorce and all that stuff, and then she just gives this glowing, loving softball interview to the Tates, or to Andrew Tate, and just loving on him to death. And then literally two weeks later, the stuff with, what's his face? Russell. Yeah, Russell Brand right now. And so, oh, these allegations are credible. I'm like, what's wrong with you? But she, I'm starting to be, I'm starting to look at Daily Wire right now as sort of this, they're starting to look more and more like, I don't say controlled opposition, but they're certainly looking, they're positioning themselves right now to be the Fox News of the 2024 election cycle right now. And you can see this because of the people that they're bringing on, that they're the talent that they're hiring right now. And part of that is sort of throwing the red pill under the bus as quickly and as efficiently as possible right now. Because a lot of these guys were on board with this stuff, where they wanted to be a part of that. I mean, hell, you had Michael Knowles, who was on whatever podcast. And I'll tell you, the other thing that gets me is like, and much, Glenn knows what I'm talking about here, is as much as I like Brian and whatever from whatever podcast, it's like, it seems like they have some sort of deal going on with Daily Wire at this point, because it's almost as if that's the safe version of Fresh and Fit that everybody can go on there and just sort of, you know, wag fingers at the, at the, well, let's call it what it is. It's the white version of Fresh and Fit. Well, it's the safe version. Like they can go on there and feel comfortable and going on and just wagging fingers at the ratchet girls that are on there. Go ahead. You mentioned safe, but weren't they the guys who had like the fun fucking anime girl on there with the red hair and the crossed eyes and the tongue all over the place? Yeah. That's considered safe. Yeah, that's why we called it the white version. Well, it is. It is when you got Lila Rose sitting across the table from Adam 22. That's the that's the battle royale that they want to see, because it's it's it's the sort of traditional conservative, you know, big con is I think is what Steven Crowder called it when he was doing his when he was having his war with Daily Wire. It's big con that's trying to sort of like legitimize themselves in these spaces right now and the best way that they can do it, especially when it comes to marriage. And that's why I wanted James on the show is when it comes to marriage, they think that they have a monopoly on marriage and they think that they have some sort of like like holier than that. Like it's what I would expect because they didn't want conservative sex dolls. They did more or less. Yeah. And so like when when I'm calling them out and say, well, if you guys really feel as strongly as you do, why don't you come out to Las Vegas and sit across the table for me and James and Michael Sartain and we'll talk about this live in real time. And nobody wants to do that, of course. They all want to have it on their show recorded so that they can pick and pull whatever that whatever clips that they want out of it. And I don't want to. It's funny how they behave exactly like the left does when they were trying to debate the left about all these topics. Not so long ago. Ryan quote, but. I'll leave me out of this. I'm trying to take it serious. Yeah, let's do it. Before we jump in here, though, I want to just sort of go around the horn here and see like I've been married for twenty seven years. I've got one kid. So so we have to get our married man, daddy cred out of the way really quickly. Jack, I know you're single. You have no children, so you have no you have no seat at this table. Ryan, you've been with this. What's your situation, Ryan? And how married? It's been about years and I don't talk about BF trophies on here at all. I think anybody who mentions they have kids online. No offense. It's kind of ridiculous. It's like isn't there supposed to be pedals everywhere? Isn't that what they rant about? And then meanwhile, they show pictures of their kids every chance they get. It's like pick a lane. I know I got into I got I got into a bidding war with Matt Walsh. He's like, I have six. He was he was he of course, he's going and fighting Pearl right now. Oh, I saw that girl has no kids, never been married. Twenty six, twenty seven years old. And she's going to tell us how to how how to be a good wife. I still think it's funny that Matt Walsh is only definition of a good man is how close to Matt Walsh are you? It's like couldn't you pick Jesus or something like he's supposed to be the role model? Oh, that Walsh. Are you just a cop? Yeah, seriously. Like you are played. I'm the best. I am the best person to marry. You know, I mean, exactly. I got into a bidding war. It's like it's almost like paying poker with with Matt because it's like he's like, I've been married for over a decade and I've got six kids and I'm like, damn, I was like, holy shit. Nobody says over a decade unless it's like 10 years and six months, by the way. Yeah. It's like what a flex. Hey, I've done something for like a March, like the bare minimum amount of time to be considered in like guys like I've been a girlfriend, I've had a girlfriend for two weeks. I don't think it's that long to be honest. No, it's not. The marriage, I don't think it's really that long. What's the average? What's the average duration of of a marriage before a divorce happened for the first divorce? Yeah. First marriage is usually breaks right under the 10 year mark. It's like seven to seven to 13 is like the big window. And that kind of makes sense because, you know, people marry. They have a year or two, then they have kids. And then by the time the kids get to school age is when like the wheels have really come off and people start to have, you know, the autonomy that they're spending a little more time outside the home and going like, oh, maybe there's something more compelling happening outside of here. So, you know, but I'm always like whenever somebody flexes on the fact that, you know, I've been married 10 years, I've been married 15 years. It's like, OK, like that's. You know, I don't know that you're happily married for that period of time. And you know, someone's been married 10 years and has six kids, so she's been pregnant for like the majority of your marriage, essentially, when you do the math on that, you know, which again, you know, listen, you can never tell from the outside how a marriage is doing. I mean, all of these people that are just endlessly talking about how great their marriage is and how their marriage is better than somebody else's marriage. They're in my office having consultations. You know, all the people that say I've had people on Andy Cohen on Bravo talking about Oh, we don't have a prenup. Yeah, you do. I wrote it. Like you have a prenup. It's in my it's in my safe in my office. It's just not filed anywhere. So you're full of shit, you know, and you may be shocked to learn that, you know, people in the media space are in fact often full of shit and playing a character. Wait, what? No, I'm sorry to shock you. But I actually think this whole thing is a conspiracy because I think they're just going to release like Jeremy's engagement rings. Like there's going to be some Jeremy's thing on Daily Wire where they're like, Oh, we're selling this now. In addition to the razors, you get an engagement ring if you pay this price. I think they're, they're, they're, you wouldn't be surprised. But I think that's exactly right. Rian's got it right. Which is Matt Walsh's gauge of people is how closely did they resemble his particular ethics and his particular life choices. He's a big fan of beards. He's a big fan of anything. He's a big fan of, you know, Catholicism, you know, and we can go like Pax Christi tattoo, you know, we can compare them here. We've got similar Catholic themes, tattoos. I went to Catholic school my whole life before even the Jesuits, you know, Fordham University, I couldn't get enough of them for my legal education. But I mean, look, I think at the end of the day, this is just such a, they've all just drank the Kool-Aid on a very safe message. I don't think I'm surprising anyone in this Legion of Doom to know that a lot of wives and girlfriends would rather that men in their life watch the incredibly sterile message of Matt Walsh and of Ben Shapiro and of that whole group who are all married, who are all religious or purported to be religious, you know, who are all this very safe and sterile. I get it. I get it. I don't blame a woman for being like, oh, yeah, my guy's church going, synagogue going. He's not, you know, he doesn't have a bunch of women sitting around him on a panel. He's, you know, not around women. Like it's harder to be Rollo than it is to be Matt, you know, like Matt doesn't have like when you're when you're judging bikini contests and you're in Vegas, and you have a ton of beautiful women around you, and you're popular and you have a platform and you choose to have a monogamous happy relationship with your wife because you're satisfied. I'm a lot more impressed with that than a dude who hangs out with no one but other married dudes and has no women around him ever, other than maybe like the women at church and their ability to be monogamous. That's great, man. I'm really good at eating healthy when I'm sitting in a closet, you know, but like that doesn't mean I have great willpower. That doesn't mean that I could survive in the world because you let me out. And I'm going to go to the first KFC you let me near. So I'm just not impressed. Like when fish dream, they dream they're sharks, I get it. And it's really easy when you're in that environment, sitting around roundtables with large groups of dudes only talking about how much you're all really, you know, totally pious and fidelitous. I get it. And look until you don't anymore until the wheels come off and you're in my office. So I just don't, yeah, I just don't, you know, I think that everybody's turned this into the media space has turned into professional wrestling. It's good guys and bad guys. You go heal this week and now your hero, the following and it's just ridiculous. It sounds like he is a lawyer, man. I love this. Oh, man. Oh, God. Crazy is like you would think like if anybody's going to be like pushing marriage, it would be James. Right. Right. Industry on you guys getting divorced. Well, I do not have to do it. I know. You'd think I'd be giving out the engagement rings and I would be like, sign up. It's a great idea. I remember one year on Valentine's Day, I put on Instagram. I was like, happy Valentine's Day. Go out and get married. I was like, maybe start a closely held business with a significant cash component that will be difficult to value at some point. Have a bunch of kids. If you're concerned that he drinks too much, just marry him and have kids. I'm sure he'll change. Don't worry. You know, like, but the truth is, like I have job security no matter what, because people just are going to keep banging in there and step on the same landmines over and over again. But I don't feel the need to get out there and say to people, like people act like a divorce lawyer, like I'm walking around a bar, you know, going up to happily married men going, hey, man, you can do better than this. I don't need to do that. Like I have a friend who's an oncologist. He's not walking around trying to encourage people to get fucking cancer. So like, I don't kill it. I just bury the dead body. I think the more, the more, listen, Matt Walsh, that whole crew, they are doing me a favor, man. If you are creating a definition that, yeah, get married young, have 50 million fucking kids and like, that's going to work out great. Don't worry. That's model your life. I've heard Matt Walsh give where he says like, yeah, you know, you don't have to know somebody that well. Like, what is all this? You have to know somebody that well. I knew my wife for like three months and we got married and it's like, OK, so you're you're legit telling people go out and just like, you know, you get along enough, you have somewhat aligned values. Fuck it. Just marry them and then definitely have a bunch of kids. Like, dude, I owe you some money. I should work for the arranged marriage crowd, doesn't it? It's the worst fucking advice on the planet. What I don't also don't really understand with these dudes is why it seems to be presented as some kind of countercultural or even slightly edgy message. It's like, hey, man, we're making marriage great again when the whole of mainstream society is also pushing the marriage agenda. It's you know, they make out as if there's this huge push against marriage in the culture and they're really funny. The only people who are somewhat skeptical about it are people probably on this podcast, which, you know, let's be frank, I mean, is a fairly small, you know, in terms of the general media. It's a fairly small sort of sector of that. And some of the people on this panel are fucking married anyway. So I don't know where they get this idea that marriage is pushed against. So we've got to protect marriage because everybody fucking wants to do it anyway. They're like lambs to the slaughter, you know, for the most part. The left is pushing. They wanted gay marriage. So they got that right, which, by the way, was like for divorce lawyers, you want everybody to be married. Divorce lawyers. We were like, well, hey, yeah, let gay people be as fucking miserable as heterosexuals like make them like they're having way too much fun. Yeah. Yeah. And for us. Oh, my God. I was like for divorce lawyers, it was like people having like for a dentist, a second mouth being discovered somewhere else on people's bodies, like double my customer base. Great. You know, but, you know, I totally agree with what Troy's saying. I mean, the reality is, is that no, no one's been anti marriage in this in this space, in the red pill space. I mean, it's such an oversimplification to suggest that people are anti marriage. Though they need us to be anti marriage to be that bad guy. Yeah. They really do, because they come at like Rollo and say, Rollo, you don't know anything about marriage. Oh, I'll find out. He's married. Twenty six years. Oh, four. Then all of them. Thirty one years. I'll skip the kids for Ryan. But twelve grandkids. So, you know, they need us to be a bad guy for sure. Well, it's like what they want is they want us to do marriage their way. Like, I don't know. Keep the system going. Government depends on child support agencies and, you know, collecting alimony. And we have the lawyers like James that need to get fed, too. So just keep the system going. Starving lawyers like. Yeah. Instead of saying like, no, how about it's insanity to do the same thing over and over again. Expect different results. James. What's funny, Glenn, is when you say like, you know, they want to do us to do marriage their way. I don't know that they're doing marriage their way. Oh, good. Like this is like like what what way are they doing marriage that's different than Rallo or anybody's marriage? Like there's kind of only one way to do marriage, which is marriage is a legal status conferred by the state. If you signed on the line that was dotted, you're fucking married. What you do in that marriage, no one's ever going to know. Not even, by the way, spoiler alert, not even the two people in the marriage very often know what the hell's going on in the marriage. A lot of times, you know, so so marriage is just the union of two people. I don't know that there's a right way to do a marriage, a wrong way to do a marriage. Like whenever I speak places, there are people who say like, well, what what's the better way for people? I'm like, listen, for you, what's the right way? What's for me? What's the right way? There are people whose marriages, you know, it's a very personal thing. It's like diet or exercise. What's the best diet? I don't know. For who? For me, for my body or for your body? Like we were not the same person. It's the right marriage for people. It's not a universal question. So the bigger issue is they're just trying to vilify a group of people so they can be the good guy. And we're the bad guy and the bad guy is busy in the Ukraine. So red pills, what's here? Of course. I've heard Matt Walsh now talk a million times about no fault divorce and no fault divorce is the fault of it. I don't think he even has the vaguest understanding of what no fault divorce even means. His suggestion that like somehow, you know, it would stop divorce if we got rid of no fault divorce. No, no. I practiced matrimonial law for a decade while we were still a fault state. All it did was made me an extra 10, 20 grand on every case because we would have to litigate the issue of fault. So I would have to put witnesses on the stand to talk about the fact that the marriage fell apart. So if you really feel like you want that for me, I mean, I appreciate it, Matt. But like getting on and doing your, you know, we're canceling divorce lawyers. That's our daily cancellation. Like that's the most preposterous. You're not even, you're approaching it from a completely wrong angle, which shows how completely ignorant you are of the subject. And you wouldn't actually have a debate one on one. Like I'm different than Raul. I'll come to their, I'll come to their studio. I'll sit down with them anytime I'm invited. I will sit down and talk because I get paid to argue and I don't have someone giving me a teleprompter to read the facts that I don't even vaguely understand. So I will happily have a professional. Do you think that marriages is possible at all now in terms of the longevity, just because of all the options that people have got and all the temptations that people have got? You know, if it's not really working well, I can just go on Tinder and find someone else. So fuck it. Let's break it up. And I suppose that leading on from that, do you think the marriage ever really worked? In other words, did long term monogamy that was put into a contract ever really work? Or was it just that people were forced to stay in it before and now they're not? And so it's just falling apart, it seems. Yeah, I think it's a great question. I would say that I think marriage has new and different antagonists than it used to have. I think marriage has always had antagonists. I mean, I've said it before and I'll say it again. You know, whatever your religious perspective is, theoretically, God gave us 10 rules and he spoke to us and said, OK, here's 10 rules. Thou shalt not kill. Honor the Sabbath. The only thing he repeated twice was don't fuck people you're not married to. He said, it's the only one. Thou shalt not kill. Said it once. Don't steal. Said it once. Don't covet your neighbor's wife. Don't commit adultery. It's like Fight Club. Like first rule is don't talk about Fight Club. Second rule, don't talk about fight. It's the same. He was like, don't fuck other people. Seriously, guys. Don't fuck other people. So, I mean, this has clearly been a problem for a long time. Like even if you believe the Ten Commandments are made up, OK, 2,000 years ago, someone made that up as a rule. Like that's a pretty like they said, oh, when God spoke, he said this twice. So this has been going on for a while. So I think every generation, marriage has different antagonists, singles bars, you know, phone sex. Now, it's, you know, like if you listen to Stevie Wonder's song, Part Time Lover, which is about someone having an affair, like it's almost quaint to listen to it now because now it wouldn't be all these weird machinations of like call up, ring once, hang up the phone to let me know you made it home now to be just text me and let me know you got in. So I think everything has changed. But that being said, I think marriage can be successful. Of course, it's just not something that's as scalable as we as a society are trying to pretend it is. Marriage is and I've said this 100 times and I'll say it 100 more. Marriage is like the lottery. You are probably not going to win. OK, you're probably not going to win. Don't make that your 401k. You're probably not going to win. But if you win, what you win is so great that I don't blame you for buying a ticket and trying. I personally don't buy lottery tickets. But when somebody says, yeah, I played a lottery, hey, man, somebody's got to win. And you know what? As long as you're not blowing money that you need for food or to put shoes on your kid's feet, you're not hurting anybody. Go out, give it a try. So I would still be, listen, marriage, when it works, when you have somebody who's married 20 plus years and they're still crazy about each other, that is the exception, not the rule. But when you do it, it's phenomenal. It's phenomenal. So why not buy the ticket, take the ride, but have a prenup? Wear a fucking seatbelt, guys. You can be a safe driver, but wear a seatbelt. Well, this is a guy I was going to say, this is a cold that thought, Ryan. This is the kind of conversation that I think that that like guys like Matt Walsh, they simply don't want to get they don't want to get wrapped up in right now. Like Glenn and I just did a show with the Iron Disciples and we talked about marriage from sort of a biblical sense of a more religious side of things. And it's like I almost feel like I have to like treat them with kid gloves a little bit because like you get too real with with the guys like this, then their whole their whole mission statement really kind of falls apart. That's why whenever I throw out these challenges to have them like sit across the table from me on like Access Vegas or something like that, I know damn well they're not going to take that because if they did, they would run into myself and they would run into like, you know, the documentation and just basically there's this mound of empirical evidence that points to saying like, you know, odds are just what James just said. Odds are it's the exception to the rule, not the actual rule itself. James, just hold that thought real quick, Ryan. But James, what I want to get into some statistics here really quickly. Now, when you were on with me, you mentioned that the divorce rate is now at what? Fifty six percent. Fifty six percent is the latest statistic. And I think people really need to like hammer that home because you'll find about what that means. That means fifty six."}
