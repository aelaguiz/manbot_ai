Greed is right. Greed works. Oh, you guys want to get rich? This is not a shill stream. I promise you this is not a shill stream. You will learn a great many things in this show today. I think of any niche community, I think of any M-Line group of guys that needs a red pill the most, probably crypto bros. Everybody's a bro. Why is everybody a bro? Passport bros. Gym bros. Crypto bros. At least there's a little bro at the end of, an O at the end of crypto. I'm in Reno, Nevada, and my two compatriots, let's say business assistants, are both in Miami. All right, gentlemen. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I wore this today just for you. Okay. Yes. Oh, there we go. It's funny. It's like all these people are going to be like hacking up in this. I can't believe Relo Tomassi sold out. Fuck that guy. I'm wearing a fucking Raiders hat. A Raiders hat. Unsubscribe. Unsubscribe. You guys are in Miami. What are you doing in Miami? Is it raining there still? Is it like, did you, would you make it in time for the next hurricane? It just started raining like maybe like two hours ago. Oh my God. Well, I mean, it is. It is that bad. It is. It is. It is. It is. It is. It is. It is. It is. It is. It is. It is. It is. It is. It is. It is. It is. It is that time of year. There, this is like hurricane season right now. It's until like November, middle of November, I think. Yeah. I mean, I mean, what was it? Tropical storm Hillary Clinton attacked the west coast a little bit. God. Could they have been more obvious with that? Hillary Hillary in the center of the storm. When you had the next one, Michelle Obama, Michelle Obama. I'm like, hi, I'm like, I had to get my second wind because I'm actually like crazy exhausted right now. But I just got done doing the wet Republic bikini contest yesterday, bro. It's a tough job. It's like triage, man. It's a rough job. No. Like, honestly, some parts of it are actually pretty rough because like we were in like the heat was one hundred and eight yesterday in Vegas. And so we went to. Oh, you want to see what do you want? Crypto stuff. I'm in this. Tits, sir. OK. There you go. OK. Three diglets. Everybody gets your. You know what? You get one of these because you're the first super chat on this show today because I just throw them out willy nilly today. Oh, good. I'm all. I'm glad. I'm glad. I kind of I want to encourage haters and spammers and schmuck faces on this one today because like this is going to be fun. I look, you know, before we get started, you guys are kind of my de facto business partners these days. Well, Miguel's always been. But Charlie is like way more into it now. And before we just jump into what you guys are doing and what I'm doing, I want to talk about like the cultural aspects of crypto. And we're not going to just just talk about. We're not just going to talk about hex. And by the way, Miguel made me a hexagon. I'm sorry. It's his fault. This is his fault. He's ruined forever. Yes. Godfather. Godfather's a hexagon. There it is. Say my name. There you go. OK. Yeah. So I still have that pulse, that pulse chain T-shirt. Oh, yeah. Bye, guys. That's the end of the show. That'd be a great place to start it right there, too. I mean, like. I mean, like you were pretty I brought you over here to Vegas and stuff to go to PulseCon and you were pretty fit. You're pretty surprised how famous you are and how many people knew you at PulseCon. Yeah. Yeah. That was that was a very interesting, like social experiment for me because I wasn't expecting that whatsoever. I had people there were like, did you see my life? I watch your show every day. But you're here for PulseCon. I'm just wandering around this place. But, yeah, it was it was interesting to me. And by the way, I use that GIF again with the Ghostbusters one where like they all cross the streams. And I was thought about that. I thought it was a bit of a funny goof, too. It's like in that part where they all cross the streams, it's like the crypto community, the red pill community, like black Twitter and real estate guys. Right. Like because I was throwing in like George Gammon, Ken McElroy and, you know, Robert Kiyosaki and Jason Hartman, of course, because I was it was just it would seem like such odd bedfellows, you know, like everybody sort of like put it come our powers combined. You know, we are Voltron or some shit like that. And that's what convinced me is that there's actually there's crossover not only between like, say, George Gammon's like rebel capitalist group or his collective, his collective group. What convinced me of that was working with Kiyosaki for, well, actually now almost four years. And then, you know, George Gammon and I have been good friends for a while and I didn't even realize there was that connection until George said, hey, you do want to go talk to Robert. Robert Kiyosaki. Robert Kiyosaki. Oh, Rich Dad Poor Dad. Yeah. Who has been on you guys. We've had on, you know, what, two years ago, I think it was Q4, it was quarter four for Cultivate Crypto. And then you were just recently on his channel after after we met him in Vegas with you as well. So that was awesome. Yeah. We just did a we did a whole we did a whole interview with him. We did about a quarter of it in his private chat because he just I want to flex on everybody. But then we did a we had a really good conversation, including a lot of crypto topics and real estate and money and everything else was really kind of interesting, because I'm at least my sort of new perspective right now is money, muscles and game. So but that that covers a lot of things like you guys are the money part of that. Gammon's the money part of that. Kiyosaki's the money part, McElroy, Gammon for sure. And then, you know, the game part and the social skills and all that, you know, the Red Pill side, because those were the guys that were at PulseCon. And then we're working on the fitness side, too. We've got Red Pill Thor, we got Drew Bay, we got Thomas, your trainer, O'Neal Thomas and Derek Thomas and other guys, too, as well. I almost want to put Glenn in there, but I don't because Trenhead? Oh, yeah, of course. Yeah. He should be training. Tren Lawrence. He's kind of a jack of all trades. Tren Lawrence, you heard it here first. Tren Lawrence. Yeah. God damn, it's weird to be back. I have done so many different podcasts in Las Vegas and I come back here and to do just like a random one like that's not my show is kind of weird. So again, you guys are in Q4 or excuse me, Q3 for Cultivate Crypto. So just I mean, full disclosure, yeah, that's where we're going to talk about that, too. But when I get you guys on, I always want to talk about something that's just a little bit more. We don't have to just talk about, hey, follow this link. I would like to talk to you guys about like the social aspects of stuff and like how the crypto culture actually kind of needs the red pill. When we went like Miguel, when we went to PulseCon last year and people were like coming up to me like want to take selfies and get autographs and whatever else. Again, I wasn't going there because I thought that was going to happen, but it did. And there was enough of them there that sort of kind of rattled my cage a little bit. And remember the party we went to after? Yes. Yeah. Was that Fremont? Where was that? It was like downtown. It was downtown. We went to House of Pain. The actual House of Pain actually owned that place. And then we were on stage with KJ's doing jump, jump. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And so I'm meeting all these guys and most of everybody's younger than me, but like the people that I was meeting there were some people that I knew from like Miami who knew Christian Fitts. Right. And then there's a guys who are just sort of like these newly minted millionaires riding around in their convertibles, whatever, supercars, wherever they were. And they're like, they got some chick that they probably didn't have like six months ago. Yeah. I kind of understand why they're reading my book. I get it. I'm glad I can be here for you. But yeah, it was it was a very interesting experience. I kind of want to like touch on that a little bit. But before we do, I don't think that it's any great secret that we are all. God damn it, Miguel. We are all in some way connected to the hex community, the hexagons. And we have been taking it on a chin a little bit recently, but I want to get an update with you. You did. You recently did a video about the highest stakes movie and what they got right and what they got wrong. I kind of want to dip into that just a little bit. And then can you just give us sort of like a quick update on like what's going on with Richard Hart? Yeah, for sure. So I'll start. I'll start off with the movie. So the movie was a big, big success. It was played, I mean, all over and stuff internationally, played in just about every major city in the United States. And then and then it actually got picked up so much by Brennan Theatres that it ended up going off into Europe. I mean, Asia. I think I think there may have been like one in Cairo. So you know, it kind of touched almost all the continents in the world and stuff. You had all the major cities there. So a lot of times, like especially on the first nights, and so there were so many that they ended up having like one, two or three week showings of it. And from there, it kind of showed the success of the movie. Now, um, one thing that they were trying to do with the movie was they didn't want it to be a movie where it was just like, look how cool hexes they wanted to show to them both sides of it first, like, what's kind of the middle ground versus like, this is a scam versus and it kind of was almost it was kind of almost like when they said scam, they were almost attacking all of crypto as well, kind of because most people are very skeptical about crypto in general. So it's kind of lumpy in hexes, like, oh, it's a crypto thing. And so it must be a scam versus like, oh, this thing, it's just an invest, it's just an investment vehicle. And then another one like this is Richard Hurt is God. Right? Yeah. And it ended up being I think it ended up being pretty good. The one the one thing that kind of like, that kind of caught me off guard a little bit was I had never met the the the two people in the the the guy from DeVry or DeVry University in terms of like the professor and then the other lady that investigates scams, I've never met them. I didn't even heard of them until the movie started. So that was really interesting that so I guess they pretty they pretty much brought them in as to be like counterpoints to the rest of the community. And the funniest thing has happened. So after the movies come out, these guys essentially have been closet hexagons now. I mean, they they consistently are on Twitter all the time talking about, you know, how much they like hex. And they're like, pretty much from the outset, you couldn't even tell they're not hexagons because how much they talk about hex, which is really, which is really, really hilarious to me. But but then like, was it like I mean, probably to you, was it like glaringly obvious that they were like just sort of like hobby investors or they were just like only peripherally aware of what was going on with like with hex and with with pulse chain and Richard? I would say that I completely didn't know anything about crypto really outside of Bitcoin. Like they don't even understand Bitcoin very well. And as time progressed, they started learning more and more about the markets. And effectively, you know, Richard started teaching them and talking to them and as well as other hexagons. And they started understanding like, oh, this is a CD, or this is a or this is some sort of like, you know, it's like the yield, the yield makes sense and stuff. It's in the yield doesn't come out of thin air and stuff like that. It's actually created here. And then okay, so why is why can it have such a high yield, while still having such a low inflation rate? And then it explains it all and stuff. And then they're like, okay, I'm starting to understand it. But it's so but it's like, it's like watching a person like they're coming into the crypto space for the first time, and they're jumping into the pool. And that's what's happening to them, basically. What they're taken back by was like, wow, this community is gigantic, like absolutely gigantic. He's like, there's people in every city, like it is crazy to like, I could literally fly to any city on this damn near on this planet. And if I sent a tweet out, and I talked to the telegram chats, I could probably end up getting a group of like, maybe 10 or 15 guys be anywhere. That's great. I mean, it is like a crazy sort of feat. The only other group I know that could even do anything like that would be the red pill as well. Yeah, yeah. So it's a it's a it's a really now the hex is a very hex and pulse chain, you know, the whole hex pulse chain ecosystem is a very unique sort of thing. Because we've been I've been a part of other communities that have nowhere near that level of like community. It's very superficial, like it's very just on Twitter, we're on. We're on for hex itself, it is a very YouTube heavy community, like it's probably got the highest amount of YouTubers for any ecosystem period. There is like second to none, basically. So they have the largest amount of Twitter followers, largest amount of Twitter accounts, largest amount of what's called YouTube accounts. I've been pushing the front on getting them on Instagram, which has been tough. But like Instagram is kind of like the new frontier for them. It's a new frontier for him for the hex guys. You know, it really is because it's like, this is a kind of go the culture is it's about privacy a little bit, right? So it's because the government's kind of like, I don't like this whole thing. Everyone likes to hide behind a avatar, right? And you know, we're what's going on now is crypto people are sort of pushing, you know, starting to put their faces out there, especially with like, you know, like, you can now pay for like, to be verified. So you can put you have to put your name out there and stuff. You're starting to get a lot more people legitimate people coming out of the shadows and kind of, you know, like not exposing themselves, but like, Hey, this is me. Like, my name is actually Miguel. Hey, nice to meet you. You know, it's because a lot of people were like, you know, they're completely lying about their whole their entire name and everything like, like, you could know someone is Hector, and his real name is actually Alex, and you would never know that. Yeah. So that's kind of what's going on. So like, it's I only know rg3 by rg3. His real name, I might I know him. But like, what does that stand for? Because I know the football player to anyway, the so, so the movie was basically filmed during the peak. So right before right before the all time, it started right around 2021. And as and then as they continue filming, the prices just went to bananas. So the summer it did really good. It hit, you know, it hit it hit high, like 20 cent range. And then deep into 2021, it hit, you know, it's fit, it's a notorious 56 cent price range, which was the big promise that, you know, Richard kind of said, like, you know, this thing's designed, it's not promised, but it's designed to do 10,000 x in it, and it hit the number. And it kind of shut up a lot of haters and stuff. But what else happened in November was Bitcoin hit its all time high and started going down. So one day, it was like 67,000. Yep, that's 69,069. But pretty, pretty nice price. I mean, the thing is, is we hit the all we hit the we hit $64,000 in the summer. And then it kind of like lingered for a while. And then it just started pumping back up again in the market. You're like, we're back, you guys, we're back. And so everyone was very happy. But this is also what it what it captured what was what happens in the overall cycle to every coin. So it took a picture of what happened to hex. But it's also what happened to Bitcoin. It happened to Michael Saylor as well. You know, Michael, Michael Saylor, like this is he's like, the grandpa, you know, he's like, I kind of put a meme on my channel all the time where I where I show him basically acting like a crazy lunatic, where it was like, sell your house, sell your kids to sell everything and stuff. I know you've had this business. I know you've had this business in your family for 37 years, borrow on it, mortgage it. And then buy buy the greatest asset on earth Bitcoin, right. And to show that even no matter what from like the the holy of holies Bitcoin to like the stinkiest shit coin on the planet. They're all degenerates, right? Or they all lose themselves to mania. Because when the bear market follow cult leaders. Yeah, it's like they go on a really dirty book. And then when the bear market happens, they go on a in their real discipline. Now, you know, I was I'm in muck mode. I'm in muck mode. And then when the bull market starts, they turn into a fucking, you know, they're in the streets fucking with whores, you know, rooting in the gutter. Charlie, what did you think of the movie? No, I liked it, actually. And, you know, I've done the whole journey, the whole journey with hex, which, you know, at the very early days with hex, I bought into the idea that was put out by, you know, some of these crypto news channels, like Coin Desk and everything that had vendettas out for Richard Hart, you know, they, they basically, the early days said it was a scam. And I was like, Well, let me put some money on it and see where it goes. Right. So I put some money on it back in the day. And I was one of the best performing positions in the last bull market for me as well. So it was interesting, because I could see both sides of the coin, basically, when I went into the movie, and I liked how they presented that they actually, if you watch the entire movie, you'll probably come out with it saying, wow, this is a hex funded movie, they actually like kind of went on the, you know, what do you call them the opposition points, like against tax more than they did, like the positive points, because the positive points, if you watch the movie, kind of like Miguel said, the people who were, you know, most skeptical, most skeptical about it at the beginning of the movie, when they actually did their research, they basically got turned into hexagons, because it makes sense. Now, once you do your research, and once you understand it, and then, of course, once you make money with it, as well, all those things help fuel, you know, people really enjoying this community and really enjoying that asset, right. And so, yeah, it was just interesting to kind of see them go kind of not, I wasn't as extreme as they were, but they kind of went through the same learning process that I did on hex, because, yeah, you can understand Bitcoin, you can understand a theorem, you can understand all these other crypto assets. But yeah, the way Richard Hart has worked with tokenomics, and with his community, and everything is, you know, rare in the crypto space, I think there's a lot of people who can't make a crypto, as well as in that basically fits all aspects. So yeah, I was pleasantly surprised by the movie and really enjoyed it. And it was fun watching it with the group that we had, because we had about 100 people who came to our crypto mindset meetup back on August, early August, the first week of August. And we had about 100 people with us in the theater, you know, and there was a few, I think there was like, maybe 10 people in the theater that weren't from our group. And like, we're all hissing and jawing at the screen, like, Oh, shit, I remember that. And like stuff like that. But I think we took a picture afterwards in front of the cinema. And out of all the hex movie meetups, or whatever, we had pretty much the biggest group. So it was fun to see kind of, you know, that full circle of what's happened. And when you watch the movie, you're like, I want to watch part two. And that part two is already playing out in real life with Paul's chain. Right. I almost I almost wonder if it's not like, like, I don't know if you guys can recall this far back, but the the red pill movie by Cassie J. was like funded by well, I mean, it's funded by Mike Cernovich and funded by like, Milo Yiannopoulos and, and well, the guys from a voice for men and yet with Paul Elam and Dean Esmail, those guys who featured heavily in the movie, of course. And I remember when I came out, and I'm like, this is just going to be this kind of like journey of self discovery for this, this feminist, you know, who goes from being a feminist to not being a feminist, because she has some sort of sympathy for the men's rights, you know, thing. And I'm watching it, I'm just I'm hacking up and discuss and like, I'm wondering, like, if something gets made about like, like a documentary or a movie or whatever it is that gets made about your particular niche or something that you're like, kind of uniquely aware of, you're just like, Oh, God, I can't believe they fucked that up. Like, I can't believe they or they, they took that route. And you know, that they're bullshitting. And you're like, that's bullshit, you know, but you can't really say anything about I wonder if there's like not that kind of like frustration with with people when they watch something like this, especially when they're like, you were saying before, like the pulse chain community is very in depth, like almost emotionally invested in the community. And people say, well, it's a cult. Well, it's like cult. It's because I mean, it's like guys from people from all over the world. I mean, I can understand why people would think so. But it's a community for sure. Do you think that the community is hacking up and discussed at it? Or do you like they're, they're like, you know, throwing shit at their TV? Or do you think that they're like, they're sharing the same opinion that you guys do? So it no, no, they like the community really support it. We really did, you know, RG three, and the guys connects and stuff. They did a they did a great job getting the guys for the documentary. But the thing that you know, ever caught everyone is just it's like, you know, the end of the movie, which was the Titanic, the ship sinks. No, no. And this is the this is the funny thing about it. So if we did the same movie, and I did it about chain link, or I did it about aetherium, or I did it about any other coins, you know, the this, it would be it would be the same story, it would be the same sort of story, because you would start interviewing people. And then you'd interview guys who essentially borrowed on their whole, you know, like, I took my house, I took my entire house savings, and threw it into aetherium at $4,000. And now I'm down this much, or like, Oh, man, I was really into Luna, or I was really into whatever coin was was popping back in 2021. And it's down right now, the the interesting thing is, is like, certain coins will come back, like this, the big, the big telltale sign is that the community sticks around and survives. And that's one interesting thing about this community is that, like, it's very sticky, and they are still there, whether they're, you know, they're, they're pissing and moaning and crying, which is mostly a couple of, you know, it's usually just a silent, it's a loud minority, basically. But that's, that's kind of that's kind of what's going on there. Now, it would be like, the whole thing, the one thing I will say that because they had to show both sides, is I feel like they didn't show the, they could have showed the community just a tiny bit more. But I understand what they were trying to, they're trying to do, because it was, it was made by this professional filmmaker and stuff that, you know, he had won a bunch of awards already. So he really wanted to have it like, a nice general story piece for someone that could just pick it up. And then they don't know what's going on. So it's, it still was a very good movie, and it was pretty fair to hex. But I they made it very, they kind of whitewash it a little bit for for the general public, because it's, it's sort of like that, like, it's sort of like you meet a guy like, Oh, that guy is a, that guy's a, you know, guitar players, guitar player. You know what I'm saying? Like, that guy's a jazz man's jazz man, you know, virtuoso. Yeah, yeah, virtuoso and stuff like that. So it's like, that's, that wasn't that movie. But at some point, we'll make that movie. Like, that's the one thing like, you know, like, because, you know, we're business partners, you know, me and Charlie, and we're all working together. We're doing a lot of interesting stuff in Vegas, is that eventually, you know, we're gonna we want to make it a real red pill, a real red pill movie to show what it really is like. And then at some point, we're gonna do a real crypto movie to show what it really is like as well. Because it the thing is, is like, you're like, it's almost it's almost you almost want to show like the whole fight club sort of thing really like, and just cut out the bad part with the path of bad, you know, like, with the show, like, well, like people making gains and people like, not knowing anything, and then catching the the fervor of like the bull market, basically, right. And but you know, the thing is, is like, it didn't like one thing is like, in the movies, you want to also show the guys who actually won a lot and stayed winning versus like, they like when what happens with some of these movies, and especially some of the crypto movies are coming out is that they're only focusing on the people that are losing. Right, right, right, right. And they're not focusing on all the people how much money they made, as well as all the guys in the in these movies were up a ton as well. And they just didn't take profits because they get caught up in the team. Because even though hex as an example, hit 56 cents, it could have easily gone to $2 or $1. Like, why not? I mean, it already hit 50 cents. What's a fucking other two x? Yeah, we're okay. Now, where is it now? And where is it going? And we won't just stay on hex for the whole show. I promise we will. I just just so we can sort of like the catch up to where we are right now. So so right now, and what happened? Oh, and is Richard gonna fight the SEC? Yes. Okay, so Richard's gonna fight the SEC. He's already been doing tons of tweets about like, law cases and everything. So yeah, Richard's gonna end up. I don't speak for Richard or anything like that. But if I'm just looking out as like an observer, he's probably going to end up using this as a way to like, you know, not just defend hex, but also, you know, make a bunch of noise, which brings more attention to Paul's chain and hex. And there's a good chance they're gonna, they have a good case. They have a good case, but they're trying to settle with him right now. So they're offering him like, depending on where you look and stuff. It's like a deal like a 12 to $14 million plea deal where like, he just pays the 12 $14 million and he gets off scot free except he can't talk about crypto anymore. That's the caveat there is like, okay, you'll let you go. That's it. But you can't talk about crypto anymore. So obviously, he's gonna he's gonna fight that basically, because I mean, if you if you actually, if you look on the news, like XRP is winning their lawsuit. Coinbase is gonna win their lawsuit. Uniswap just won their lawsuit, like every crypto company that's getting sued by the SEC is kicking their fucking ass in court. Can I let me can I interject something here? Because this is something you and I have talked about offline. I don't think we've ever made this public before. I don't know, maybe you have I've actually maybe you did actually on your show. But the SEC filing against Richard Hart came what the week or maybe like four days after Sam bankman free fucking walks and they need a scalp. And the scalp is Richard Hart and XRP wonder and XRP wonder their thing with Coinbase and then Coinbase relisted XRP on Coinbase and then Coinbase launched their l2 base protocol. So they basically just got embarrassed. So they scramble just to find the next thing so they can save face. That's literally what this is about. And almost all the lawsuits like they're just suing all of crypto. It isn't just like a hex thing or pulse chain thing. I mean, they're going they were going after Uniswap. Basically, they were trying to there for people don't know what Uniswap is. Uniswap is basically a plate. It's like a digital exchange you use when you trade aetherium for other coins. So instead of using dollars, you use aetherium and then aetherium buys you whatever altcoin you like, basically, right. And they were trying to they were trying to say, hey, because you created Uniswap, you are responsible for everything that's ever been launched on your on your protocol. So it's like, imagine you created the internet and then you're responsible for everything that happened on the internet. No, I didn't. I didn't do that. So that's what happened. And they in the in the courts agreed with Uniswap. It says no, you are not liable. You just created this open and free protocol here. You are not responsible for anything that people launch on here. And then very quietly Uniswap, like started, you know, taking the because what happened right before the lawsuit happened, they not delisted hex, but more like maybe you couldn't type in the name. And then after the lawsuit, they read the reinstated shadowband it they basically it's a classic shadowbanning is what that is. So they shadowbanned it and then now it's not a shadow. You know, I'll tell you something is like when I first got what I think was fresh, you actually got my my Instagram, like sort of up to speed, you know, now I use it all the time. And I understand I see the value in it. Thank thank you. Fresh. But the what was funny is like, I didn't know I didn't and I didn't realize this was happening. He goes, Oh, man, you're shadowbanned. I'm like, how did I get shadowbanned? I'm like posting pictures of Ned on the on the on the frickin thing. And like, just a couple of people will follow me like my haters will follow me and they'll report like the loosest ass, you know, offense that they can. And you get up to like one to one, two of these three of these things and you get shadowbanned."}
