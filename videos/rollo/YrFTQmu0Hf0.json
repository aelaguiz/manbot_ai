And all of you were at the last night's festivities. I think everyone here was. That's pretty crazy. And so what do we do? Where did we go? So, yeah. So. So last night. Last night for my birthday. So two. So it was two years ago. We did. Gosh, I go back for three years ago during the pandemic. We did it at Mike Evers house and we had like 54 people show up, like 54 girls show up. We had a photo shoot. All the nightclubs were closed. Sorry, Governor. We broke all the rules and we just had a fucking massive rager. This was October of 2020, October 2021. Then we had. I did my 10th episode. Belzerian came on. That was two days later than I had my I had my birthday party. Dan came to that. And it was a huge one that we did at Omnia where everybody dressed up in orange for the Texas Longhorns and they were cat ears because I'm a cat lover. Then last year, everybody dressed up like a cheerleader. We did it at Zoo. That was my first. Yeah. Shout out. Shout out to Ron Nicoli for setting that up. And then I talked to Jason Strauss. We had one at Hakkasan. And my boy, DJ Pauly D was spinning and everybody dressed up as Barbie and Ken and had a shirt on. Attempted to. I am. All the girls were wearing pink. And that was pretty awesome. It was a pretty awesome rager. And you'll never believe this. For the 10th year in a row, I was hit in the face with a cake and I just did not see it for a long time. And I don't know how I keep forgetting every time that somebody's going to hit me in the face with a cake. The video is in post-production right now, actually. And I never get to eat the cake. In 10 years, I've never once got to eat the cake. So anyway, that's what happened. Are you sure? Huh? I can take a second, like a little bit of it. You guys can check. I'm just so mouthful. You guys can check on my IG story. You can see all the debauchery that we got involved in and just see really why the decay of American society is happening. It's because of us. It's because of people here. Right in Las Vegas. It's happening right here in Las Vegas. We're the reason. Ground zero. We got it. Awesome. Okay. So I'm just going to start off with this question, because I was having a conversation with James Sexton, who's going to come on my show in November. James Sexton is this famous divorce attorney, and he has a really interesting take on divorce and intersexual dynamics. And he's not anti-marriage. You'd think, being a divorce attorney, that he might be, but he really isn't. But he does see things from a different point of view. And one of the things that I'm starting to notice, because I just finished Book of Numbers by Aaron Clary. Fantastic book. Everyone here, there's no reason to not read that book. It is so short. It's fucking phenomenal. Aaron Clary, who will be back in Las Vegas in November. Please. Let's get Aaron Clary on the one. Aaron Clary is an economist, but he's probably the only economist in the world who basically looks at the amount of time that women spend looking for men, and the amount of time that men spend looking for women, and what is the economic cost of those things. And then he looks at the predicament that happens when you have social media that make women and men delusional as to what they can get, and therefore they are wasting their time. They don't qualify for who they can get, and they're dissatisfied with their current partner, because social media has sort of ruined their ability to get the dopamine head off their perfectly good partner that they found. And like what I like to say before, someone who was, I have a friend of mine, I mentioned her before, Jojo Vonsalty. Jojo was in Wichita, Kansas, and she was probably the cutest girl at the Hooters in Wichita, Kansas, let's say 2004. And one day she gets a message on Instagram, and she gets flown out to a party in Los Angeles, and then all of a sudden she's modeling in Los Angeles. What would have happened in 1985 is that the cutest girl at the Hooters in Wichita would have dated the personal injury attorney, or the cardiologist, or whoever. There would have been some sort of matching. In Wichita. In Wichita. You would have had a match of like the sevens and the sevens, and the eights and the eights. But that's happened. That's ended. Because of social media, what's happened is every girl who's attractive in Wichita, who's attractive in Waco, who's attractive in Cheyenne, Wyoming, who's attractive in Secaucus, New Jersey, all of them leave to go to Miami, Las Vegas, or Los Angeles. You have disproportionately attractive women in those cities, and if you're ever in a place like Waco, you just realize all the women, as soon as they turn 18, either have four kids or they left the fucking town immediately to get out of there. And so what happened is now there's a disproportion where there's no middle class for men anymore. There's no average dude who gets an average girl and lives happily ever after. And then conversely, women keep comparing themselves to the hottest shortstop, power forward, or country singer that they fucked one time backstage at a concert, or hit them up in the DMs, and they're like, well, this is what I'm worth now. Because I got a message from Champagne Poppy one time, Drake, therefore any man who does not compare with Drake cannot be my boyfriend, because this is the standard upon which I live. And because of this, the dynamic between men and women have been fractured since the creation of social media. And so what's happened is now we're wasting massive amounts of time on Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge. And one of the things that they go over is literally 6,000 left swipes for one date is what some women are going through. The top, like I mentioned before, the top 10% of men on Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge are getting 63% of the right swipes. The top 20% of men are getting 83% of the right swipes. You see Tyler over here cheering because he gets nothing but right swipes. But what's happened is a disproportionately small amount of men are getting all this attention from women, and the vast majority of men are deemed to be unattractive by the vast majority of women. Most women find most men to be unattractive, whereas conversely, and I've used this stat before and I love this statistic because it kind of shows the difference. The top 63% of right swipes for women go to 43% of women. Again, the top 63% of right swipes for men go to the top 10% of men, but the top 43% of women, which means men see fives as fives, sixes as sixes, and sevens as sevens. Women see fives as zeroes, sixes as zeroes, sevens as zeroes, eights as zeroes, nines as like fives, and tens as tens. That's how they start to see men, and they start to see these things disproportionately. We've done, on this show, ad nauseum, the delusional calculator where we have women come in there, we ask them what the average height they want. They all want six feet tall or taller. How much do they want these men to make? Six feet tall or taller, that's the top 14% of the population. They want to make $100,000 a year. That puts you in the top 26% of the population. The top 26% of the population, they want them to be obese. Well, men who aren't obese, that's only 25% of men that are not obese, and you want them to not be married. Well, guess what, ladies? All the good-looking guys who are fit make $100,000 a year. A lot of them are fucking married. By the way, 30% of the men on Tinder are married. 30 fucking percent. That is one of the most outrageous statistics. For some of you, it's probably not. If you're an exotic dancer or whatever, you're probably like, yeah, I thought it would be 50%. But for most, for me, where society has broken somewhere, if 30% of men on Tinder are married, that is mind-boggling to me. They're not even considering the concept of monogamy. Now, everything I just said, it does sound like a lot of gloom and doom, and what my question for you is, who here believes that in the future, you would be comfortable with a traditional monogamy? This is something that you're looking for. A traditional monogamy. Jessica. Closed on his end, closed on your end. Jessica, would you be comfortable today with a traditional monogamous relationship? Are you in a relationship right now? I would think I would be. Closer to the mic, please. Yeah, I think so. Yes, monogamy is something I think I'd be mad about. So let's not think of it theoretically. Do you think that the concept of you living in Scottsdale, finding a man that you find attractive enough to be in a relationship with, but he's not so attractive that he's going to have a hard time not cheating, stepping out on you, those things like that. Do you think traditional monogamy is the only way for you to go forward? No. You don't. What other alternatives do you see? Maybe an open relationship, maybe, but with trust and honesty. Not hiding it and not doing it behind their back, but open about it. And it'd be open on your end as well? Correct. Okay, so that's what you would look for. So polyamory. That's the word for it, sorry. Okay, now I know. It's the Greek word that means poly means many. Sorry. Yes. Monopoly. Cool. Many loves. Cool. Alexis, what do you think? I'm not a monogamy type of person. I believe in communication and comprehension on all partners. It doesn't mean I'm against monogamy, it just means I don't feel it's right for me. Are you still filming studio adult work now? Absolutely. I'm contracted with browsers. Beautiful. So in doing so, have you ever had a situation, because we talked about this with Sarah before, where she's in a relationship and she still films. Have you ever done that before? Yeah, I certainly have. Did that ever make your partner feel uncomfortable or was your partner in the industry? How did that work? One partner I think definitely made him feel uncomfortable because of his friend saying, Hey, this is your chick, dah, dah, dah, dah. And that's an insecurity issue on him, not my problem. The other person did not have an issue at all with it, but it's just different people for different things. So monogamy is not something that you want to do in the future? Nothing. Yeah. I've had it in the past and I know for a fact that there's just something that I'm not... I don't even want to live with the other person. Got it. I'm a very lone wolf. I'm very comfortable. I've got my own things going on and they could be a neighbor, but I'm not really interested in living with the actual person. Same. Got it. Katie, what about you? I could do a monogamous relationship for sure. Okay. Now, what are the scenarios by which that would happen? What do you think? What does that look like to you? So definitely wouldn't happen in Vegas, right? So it would be if someone from Calgary, it would be back home dating some guy who works in trades. It would be a completely different scenario than dating somebody who's out in Vegas. So whenever I hear women say this, and I totally appreciate this, and again, if this was 1986, I would believe you. The problem is there's no way you'd have a wandering eye for the plumber that you're married to a fucking plumber. When you say the trades, that's what you mean. You mean a plumber, electrician, a carpenter, or maybe even like a vocation like accountant, attorney, whatever. Teamster. Teamster, whatever. And you're saying from that standpoint, all of the stimulus that you see on social media would not cause you to stray at all? No. You don't think so? No. Okay. Now, would you also be open to the possibility that that doesn't work out and that you don't have a traditional monogamous relationship? Yeah, that's fine. Yeah? That's fine. Okay. What would that look like? So personally for me, I have no interest in hooking up with other people if I'm really, if I'm into you, I'm into you. You're my person. What about just to be petty? No. No. And then send them a picture of you. Let me get pissed off. No. Hey, remember when you didn't call me before? Here's Tyrone. Fuck off. We should ask that later. Have you ever hooked up out of spite? Yes. That's a good one. There's actually an article on that recently. I'll see if I can look it up. Write that down. I'll look it up. I love that idea. Okay. So it would be a polygynous relationship for you? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Got it. Sabrina? I would prefer to have a monogamous relationship at this time. Yeah. Yeah. Would you be comfortable with any other type of relationship? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Would you be comfortable with any other type of relationship? Or you'd just rather be single? Are you in a relationship right now? I am not in a relationship right now. I think I'd be open to the idea with the right person, but I would take a lot of time. Yeah. A lot of time. To be comfortable with a polygynous relationship? Sure. And you don't think you'd be interested in other dudes in the relationship? Or would you? What do you mean? So a polyamorous relationship would be you would see other men and he sees other women. Sure.  would be like you and both of you see other women? A polyandrous relationship would be the two of you see other men? I guess I'm really fine with other if it I guess I wouldn't want to say polyamory I would say more like an open relationship in the sense that I would want to keep my commitments to one person on like a deeper foundational level for sure but maybe sexually explore with other people okay there we go let's go to the commune let's do it the sex commune let's do it all right let's raise the children in the village all right Ali what about you yeah no I'm fine with monogamy I'm also fine with poly but I prefer more of like a hierarchy poly so there's a there's a main girl in the unicorn no that's a triad more so I mean like I'm if I'm if I have a boyfriend and he wants to like sleep with other chicks on the side that's fine as long as our relationship comes first okay so so let's talk about this I again I'm going to keep recommending this until all you guys fucking read this book the evolution of desire by David Buss it is the most phenomenal read the 2016 yeah the newest one that 2016 version when you read the book one of the things they talk about is women are far more interested on what two to one all the way to ten to one more interested in the concept of men procuring resources than the other way around like so they would they would look at there's one study they would do where they would take a man and they would put him Rolex watch with a suit on then they have a guy with the t-shirt and jeans and the same guy dresses a McDonald's worker same thing with women they would have a woman she has the Cartier watch the Cartier bracelet the really nice gown the the Vera Wang and the fucking $750,000 Himalaya and then right here she's just in like a sundress and right here she's in a McDonald's uniform for women the they would ask what is the likelihood of you considering dating or getting to a relationship with any of these three men the man at the top it was like 83% of the women said yes the man in the middle it was like 17% and no one said that they would consider being in a relationship with a guy in a McDonald's uniform zero his ability or rather his status which indicated how much money he could make or his ability to procure resources or his competency was by far the most important indicator and as women got older it actually became more of a more of an important indicator than how strong his jaw was or how tall he was for women for men they didn't give a fuck if she worked as a mechanic or an astronaut or a firefighter or sandwich artist if she was hot they could not have cared it less they absolutely there was no difference between the girl that had the Himalaya and the girl who worked at McDonald's men found all men found them attractive so that's the difference it's a massive difference now here's the here's the thing that happens we talk about like a patriarchy or a hierarchy when you deal with that situation if one gender is so concerned with the other genders ability to procure resources wouldn't make sense for that second gender to do everything they could to procure resources wouldn't that make them more assertive more aggressive in order to procure those resources and in doing so create them at like manifest the world that we live in the roads and the infrastructure and the buildings and the electricity I'm again I'm not saying do you understand what I'm saying my point is this is like like the reason why men are so assertive and end up dominating so many industries in the world is because they're trying to fucking impress women yes do you understand and if women weren't selective we'd still be living in caves that's the difference every single every single large accomplishment that has happened the invention of the transistor even do even relativity like like Albert Einstein discovers all guys trying to get in yeah Albert Einstein a great example Einstein gets a one's a Nobel Prize for the photoelectric effect and he does general and special relativity and then he ends up like dating a bunch of like beautiful women apparently he supposedly fucked Marilyn Monroe at one point like that's what ends up happening right everybody does it Steve Jobs was dating multiple supermodels you obviously see you know Elon Musk has kids with like nine different people at this point the all these accomplished were what's were done by men to become assertive and aggressive to impress women so because why is that is it because women think of this in a vacuum no it's because women whenever surveyed are more and this is by the way is a 37 culture study in every one of these cultures women were more interested significantly more interested in a man's ability to procure resources especially in like Middle Eastern countries South American countries not as much in places like Norway funny you should say that I've got you don't even have to go back to 2016 you can get it right now today in 2023 couples in which the woman is the only earner report lower life satisfaction yes like well it's very common for when a woman out starts to eat out on a man for divorce to to soon follow many women will at least temporarily be the breadwinner at some point in the relationship changing employment trends and gender roles will affect many households but our new peer reviewed study shows that for heterosexual couples well-being is lower when the woman is the sole earner versus the man who is the breadwinner or if both parties are employed and this has happened a lot because all of a sudden you have girls you know since 2019 get on OF and they're making you know 20 a listen like for some girls 20k a month seems like nothing right that's like not that much all 100k a month is not a big deal but a hundred K a month that when the average man in the United States makes anybody $39,000 a year yes 39 39,000 a year and you're and you're and you're pulling even 10k a month of OF right of course OF is gonna take 2,000 so 8k a month of OF it's still you're making above the poverty like above the poverty line in one lump in one month correct so you do you guys understand the issue that that's the problem so now all of a sudden you have the girls who look off and do this and they'll we have an issue where all sudden the the wage gap changes to the op to the other way where women are making so much money and it becomes it puts some stress on the relationship I've seen this happen many times Sarah you have a an interesting situation what would what would you be interested in a traditional monogamy because you're still filming no you totally make a good point about that it depends on this depends on the scenario and the person that you're with because yeah so I still film but outside of that I don't want to be with anyone else except for my partner and I know that doesn't make sense to a lot of people but it makes sense to me because it's a job but like that's how I feel in my mind you know I can separate it a lot of people aren't able to compartmentalize it like that right yeah exactly but I've learned to do that when I was younger maybe not but now was that a process for him to sort of like accept that and to get to get into that or was it's just something you just got lucky you found a guy who was like on so I've dated a lot of guys who weren't okay with it obviously and it didn't work out because I don't I'm not the type of girl who quits my job for a guy whereas a lot of girls in my industry will and then you're like where they go and then they come back in a few years because they're with a guy you know what I mean but I've never done that because this is my career this is how I make money it's a limited time that you can do it so make it while you can so yeah I got lucky and found someone who understands that and it wasn't easy at first but you know it's like once they get to know you as a person they're like okay I love you like I can look past that I think a lot more guys like average guys today are going to have to deal with exactly what your man deals with right now now this is like people go well she's a porn star porn star problems right no it's it's like every guy's problems right now because OF makes it more and more and more common even if though even if she's just pulling like you know a few hundred bucks or $1,000 a month that's sort of like you know just a slush fund or so you know just like you know gravy money or something like that they're still going to have to be okay with that because women are still make like it's easy money how much how do you can you expect me to give this up and so we create these kind of like these social contrivances to say well I'm an independent woman and you need to accept that and yada yada yada but like you're at like a you're a level that's up here but the average guys are down here and they still have to deal that's why I asked you whether it was a process for him or it was just you just you just got lucky with it's a little bit of a process and in like you said the women are making more than most men yeah and you can't ask them and there's no way guys like especially like average guys can really compete with at least not in the immediate like the now right so later on they might be able to yeah exactly oh sorry I lost my train of thought oh I was gonna say otherwise you can date a rich guy who will take care of you mm-hmm but then and they're few and far between like I was saying and I don't want somebody to rely on someone else's money yeah exactly so you know you deal with that so yeah it's tough but you have to find the right person and then like I was gonna say it's like it's by order of degree right now so it's one thing to be a porn star and be making a lot of money at it and then finding a guy and then saying okay well I can do this one of two ways I can find a guy who can accept me for what I'm doing what what my career is and this is how I make money or because you're most likely you make more than your guy right but the or else or the or the other scenario is I find a guy that is so exotically rich that he can pull me out of pornography and just like take care of me for the princess that I am right and that's like that's a more rare animal than the guy who has to learn how to sort of just accept a lot to you like you you'll see girls just leave the industry and then they're like you know they met a rich guy and then a couple years later they're back again right right because he got sick of them or he found somebody else or whatever it's so like that's not a good scenario either definitely hotter fitter definitely definitely not every girl who gets a who breaks up starts doing porn but every girl I talked to who does porn there was always a breakup not every time it's always like something you know what and then I was like my friends have been asking me I was like fuck this I'm gonna do this you know Sam it's usually yeah that didn't happen with me like I knew I wanted to I was just very interested in the industry yeah it was something I wanted to do it because of a guy or anything but but yeah that does that does happen pretty often yes what do you think Ali so I've done like Pauly and monogamy and I feel like it just depends on the person and situation and I also agree with like everything she was just saying have you ever read the book the trap no it's really good it's about how girls get stuck in sex work because their whole lifestyle depends on it and then it's like really hard to stop doing it because the money they're making I would recommend it it's hard for me to stop trapping who's that by honestly I don't know but if you look it up on Amazon I don't know who asked that the trap I think it's like the trap in sex work or something like that nice nice nice Kylie what do you think no comment I've been waiting for it to come all the way around here we go what's that for the question about traditional monogamy right oh I said like yes I would be open to it I've done both yeah okay nice so you would be open to either one yeah okay got it I got a good question here this thought maybe it's just a follow-up here this is for a thank you chat for this one this is really good please ask the women on the set how much does their age play a factor in their dating life is it a big deal okay you have noticed any difference no okay interesting you all right that's that's pretty interesting Alexis I would say I definitely get hit up by a lot of more younger guys now really yeah interesting definitely but I maybe it's because the roles I played and they've seen that but yeah what is your what is your perfect kind of guy now what is your perfect kind of guy now perfect kind of guy I well I would say actually take the guy out and just say person definitely have to have a sense of humor it has to come up you know bring as much to the table that I already bring okay and that is very rare yeah that actually makes it harder for me to date than anything else because immediately I'm just it's it's you know if you're not going to come to me with as much as I can bring then I just really don't need you sitting at my table at all yeah and I include that with my friends I have business people everything yeah one of the things that's happening is on many college campuses about 60% of the people that are women and 68% of the graduates are women so you're having women with college degrees oh in some cases have I earning power in some cases they don't they're going into places like education that you can get an advanced degree and not really make a lot of money but when they do that then they're there the men that they're choosing from again our trade workers who don't have degrees who don't make as much money and then like you said you almost can price yourself out of the market because you own the guns and the coffee beans you don't stand and you have the podcast and everywhere you go everyone wants your autograph and you're famous and like yeah yeah it's a lot more difficult I think for a lot of a lot of guys a lot of guys cannot really just don't measure up to the to take on that toll yes okay got it how about you what was the question again have you as your age like say when you're 20 so like you're now has it impacted your dating strategy and how old are you Katie Moore I'm 25 right now my strategy no but I it is something I am concerned about like getting older and I don't know it's it's concerning like what if I'm still single and I'm a little older and I are you single now Katie yes you are okay so let's if you guys want to pull those Katie up off the streets go ahead and send her a message the Katie Moore Katie Moore on Instagram let's get Katie married I remember your name let's get let's let's get let's get Katie a blue passport can we do that also let's get her over here Sabrina has age impacted the way I date I don't think so not at this point no and how old are you I'm 27 27 yeah it's interesting go ahead Ali I don't know that it's really changed I mean I'm as I get older I feel like I'm getting wiser and I'm not dating the same kind of guys that I was dating when I was younger yeah you think that's because you're wiser or you can't date the same guys the same guys aren't as attracted to you I'm not as attracted to them okay yeah and then I kind of cooled down on drinking too so like that will impact that would that because that affects your right there's studies that show the correlation between like drinking and like the number of sexual partners and it is outrageous like it is great I"}
