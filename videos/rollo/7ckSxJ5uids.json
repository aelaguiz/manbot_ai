This is the gayest Red Pill show of all time, this is, I'm just saying, because they're gonna say in the chat, this is the gayest Red Pill show anyone's ever come out. It's a full meal, it's a full meal, yeah, we're just happy here. I'm thinking we need to do a Black Tape version, like a Black Tape episode. For sure, we could get, yeah, come in Black Tape, for sure, yeah, I'm sure we would not get demonetized at all. Well, if that doesn't set off Matt Walsh, I don't know what will. Okay, beautiful, so why don't we talk about this? So, do you guys know who Matt Walsh is? Have you guys seen the documentary, What Is A Woman? Have you guys heard of that? Does anybody here, raise your hand if any of you have heard this. I've never seen it, actually. I've heard of it. You've heard of it, has anybody heard of it? I haven't seen it. Okay, cool, do you want to go ahead and describe what, essentially what happened? Oh, you mean with myself and Matt Walsh, or just like in general? Are you guys aware of what the Daily Wire is? Daily Wire is the Daily Wire. They have, they have, what's his name, Ben Shapiro's on there, Matt Walsh is on there, Candace Owens is on there. Basically, it's like Fox News wasn't conservative enough, so there's a more, there's like a new Fox or Fox News. It's online Fox News. It's basically an online Fox News, and so that's what, that's what it is. And so one of the commentators on there is Matt Walsh, one of the talking heads, and Matt Walsh has an issue. So one of the things we talk about on the show is we try to, we don't give a lot of prescriptions, but we do have a lot of descriptions. And one of the descriptions that we have is that marriage, right now for men, is kind of a difficult deal. I'm not against marriage overall, but when you see like 80% of marriages or divorces are initiated by women, 56% of divorces, of marriages end in divorce. It's 52% for your first divorce, it is 68% for your second divorce after your second marriage, and then your third marriage, it's 73% chance that you're going to end up getting a divorce. And then there's a bunch of other things that happen when it comes to like family law, when it comes to alimony, and when it comes to stuff like that, it's just, it's one of these situations where it's becoming harder and harder. Also, prenups are getting thrown out. It's harder and harder for men to want to get married. And as we've seen, the divorce rate is declining, but the marriage rate is plummeting. Very, very few men actually want to get married now. And the other thing that's happened is that when men get divorced after the age of 40 and they lose all their money, they are nine times as likely to commit suicide. So these, all these statistics come together and it paints kind of a bleak picture. And the picture has been painted on shows like this. And then the traditional conservatives that are about God and family and apple pie and monogamy and heterosexuality and all this kind of stuff, they don't like this message. And so they come out and they attack, they attack this type of content. And the guy they specifically go after is you. Well, yeah, well, they don't name me by name though. I'm just one of those red pill guys, or those nebulous red pill guys out there in the ether somewhere. I want to get started here by asking, well, I know some of you already. So I think I already know the answer to this question, but is anybody married at this table? It's interesting. This is the first time we've ever had this, because it's usually like a half or a quarter of you guys are married. That's interesting. How many of you guys are in a relationship right now? Relationship. You're in a relationship. Okay, cool. So just two of them. Okay. Any of you guys, who here has a bachelor's degree? Anybody have a bachelor's degree? No? Master's, bachelor's. That's the first time we've ever had that. There's usually, there's always like two people who are married. Two people who aren't. This is great. I'm excited. Why don't we ask you about three countries? Okay, there we go. Nice. Are there any blondes here? Anyone who's a blonde? We got a few blondes. Okay, got a few blondes. Okay, awesome. I identify halfway there. Halfway there. Anybody who's pro abstinence? Anybody who's pro? Nobody. All right, cool. Let's go. No one else is in a, none of you are. You know, actually, maybe that's actually a good thing. Are you guys having any trouble like finding guys that you really want to have some sort of relationship with? Or do you want, I should say this. Do you want to be in a serious relationship? Kenzali, go ahead. What do you think? Yeah, where are they? Where's the good ones? That's what everyone asks me. And I'm like, oh, girl, your heart's just closed. But then I open mine. You haven't manifested it yet? Put it back, put it back. Never mind. What are the experiences that you're having? They're coming to you and pretending to be one way and they're a different way. You're meeting. Oh, by the way, I just read this yesterday. I forgot before I mentioned this. I'm reading The Evolution of Desire again. One of the greatest books ever. The book on dating. This is the greatest book ever written. It's by Dr. David Buss. There's like, they're on its sixth edition. This is the academic version of it. It's called Evolutionary Psychology. The textbook. And one of the things he talks about is on dating apps, what percentage of men are married? On Tinder, Bubble, and Hinge, what percentage of men are married? Go ahead, Dee. I'd say like 34%. 34% to get up to the microphone. Christiana? 25. 25%. What do you think? Percentage of men that are currently married on dating apps? Probably like 25%. 25%. What do you think? I was thinking 30. 30. It should be zero. That's right. It's zero. What do you think? I'm going to be like 30. 30. I'm going to pick the high note. I'm going to say 70%. 70% are married. What do you think, Bree? I'm going to say 47. 40. 15. 15. The answer is 30. Wow, you guys got it pretty close. What a ridiculous, hold on. What a fucking insane statistic. That we totally take for granted. The fact that 30% of men on dating apps are married. That is madness to me when you think about that. Yeah. What's the reason why? Are they open or not? Honestly, because here's the thing. Marriage was a covenant and now marriage is sort of like the old college try. It's like, I want to have kids in a house. It's an LLC. Marriage is now like a tax benefit and sort of like a handshake deal. That's what it's become. Marriage is sort of like long-term dating now. That's what it's essentially become, right? It's definitely more of like a business deal than like actually romance. Yeah. I feel like everything that the government gets involved in turns the absolute shit. That's fair. Like the government touches it and it just like turns absolute shit. But if they just touch the IRS a little bit more and it completely abolishes, like I think we'll all be happy. Did you realize that we are the government, right? Fuck the government. We the people. You the people. Kinsley, what have been your experiences? Well, that's funny. You guys are bringing up married men on dating apps. Yeah, okay. Let me see. Well, I was just talking to someone recently and he's like, oh yeah, we're in the middle of a divorce. This guy, we like started talking a year ago and then I didn't see him for a long time because of stupid reasons. They don't sound stupid to me. I'll bet you they're not that stupid. Oh, this girl like said some shit that wasn't true about me. I'm like, I don't even know this bitch. But anyways, that's like my common story. And he believed her? That sounds exhaust us. Stupid. Honestly, I think it was just him anyways. So then I see him again online a year later and he messages me and sure enough, he's like still living in the guest house, like still going through the divorce. It's like a tender divorce. All my money's like tied up. He's like, we don't sleep together. She left me for another girl. And I'm like, okay, this guy is like so full of shit. Yeah, a lot of guys are full of shit. Were there any other experiences that you had like that? Is that generally what you say? Hey, so Kensley, just so we're clear, like he was never in the middle of a divorce. Like everything he's saying to you was most likely a lie. And that's the thing. One of the things, again, I'm going to keep recommending this until every one of you ladies reads this. You should read The Evolution of Desire. It goes over the concept where men and women have long-term and short-term dating goals. For women, they actually are quite similar. When you want a guy that you want to marry and you want a guy that you want to just like have a short-term fling with, the short-term fling, he's actually better. Like you want him a little taller, maybe a little bit more good looking, but you don't need him to be dumb. You don't mind if he's dumb, but you don't need him to be dumb. When it comes to men though, when men want, when they're picking a marriage partner, a long-term partner, they tend to pick someone who's physically attractive, but they want high agreeableness. High intellect is good. High levels of empathy is also important. When they're looking for short-term sexual partners, men, it gets embarrassingly low. They do not care about IQ at all. They don't care about any of these things. Like the levels drop to absolutely zero, and that's one of the main differences. The other thing that kind of shows the dichotomy between men and women is when men cheat, about 80% of the time, they're looking for a short-term, I'm sorry. When men cheat, about 70% of the time, they're looking for a short-term sexual fling, and about 30% of the time, they end up falling in love with their affair partner. For women, it's the opposite. 80% of the time, women fall in love with their affair partner, and 20% of the time, they're just looking for dick. That's essentially what happens. So it's quite the opposite. Can you see the difference? I see. Carly, Carly, what's your experience here? Looking for dick. In the past, when I have cheated, like, you know, I had a connection with every single one of them. Like, they were cool. They were dope. There was something that I liked that I didn't already have, so yeah. I have a question. Why did you cheat? All right, all right, all right. What? There was something I was lacking on. Yeah, they say that women, I've never cheated, but they say that women cheat because they're dissatisfied in an aspect of the relationship. But why not leave? Because you still want him, too. I had. There was more than just, like, the sexual, you know? But do you think that was fair to your partner? Absolutely not. Oh, accountability. I take it. But yeah. Stop the count. Yeah, it's a lot cheaper to stay, I guess. I mean, that's probably what it is. No, not at all. I've always been very independent, so yeah. All right, Carly, so go ahead. So how many times have you cheated on a guy before? Oh, my God. We need to go around the table for that one. Yeah, that's fair. When you did, I don't know how many times you did, but when you did. Yeah, what about that? How many times? How many different people? Separate incidents, different partners. I would say roughly around six. Six, with what, with, hold on. Carly, six with the same guy? With a bunch of different guys. No, no, I mean. Well, like, all the same guys. Same guy was getting cheated on. Yeah. And is he watching this now? Six times. I hope not. No, not, okay. Are you still with him now? No, I'm not with him, absolutely not. Okay, can you tell me what are the attributes of the guy you were with that were. Oh, my God. Like, what that you didn't like? Because, you know, a lot of guys are hearing this, like, I don't want to get cheated on. Okay, fair enough. I think that's. Can you get closer to the mic? Yeah, talk into the mic. Just grab the mic. Pull it closer to you. Yell this. Pretend, pretend, pretend like. Grab it. Pretend like you're cheating on someone. Grab it. I think that in a relationship, you need to always consistently have the same dating inspiration that you always have. And I think in a long term relationship, you lose a lot of different things along the way. And it becomes more of a business relationship than a romantic, physical, loving relationship. And I think you can get lost along the way in that with different relationships that you develop. And so in the last relationship that I was in, I felt more of a business friendship relationship. And that's why I sought out other things for more sexual, romantic, things like that. Like the spark was gone, basically. The spark was gone. Yes, and it was still a great relationship. And I think we still brought a lot to each other. What was the business? We didn't have a business together, but we were both very business-minded, so we inspired each other to be successful. And then, hold on, the guys you cheat with, what are the attributes of those guys? What's the commonality? Were they all a certain height, a certain eye color? All tall. Tall and handsome. And handsome? Were any of them dumb? Were any of them just dumb? Probably. Oh, for sure. The one that I'm really interested in right now is dumb as shit, but he's hot as shit. So is it Thunders from Down Under or Chippendales? Don't worry about it. Oh, don't worry about it? Okay. Dr. Buss, the prosecution rests its case. Yeah, for sure. Do you want to get married someday? When I find genuine love, which I don't necessarily believe in anymore. Do you find any accountability in yourself for not being able to find genuine love? Absolutely. I feel like I am very selfish with myself and my time and my energy and my love, and I don't necessarily want to share that with anybody when I have that all for myself right now. Got it. I got a question for you. The guy that you cheated on, was he overweight? Was he supportive? Was he nice? Was he comfortable? All of the above. Was he familiar? He was overweight? All of the above. All of the above? Yeah. So he wasn't as hot as the other guys that you cheated on? I mean, I was attracted to him. Really? But I mean, I was attracted to other people too. Did he make more money than any of the guys that you cheated on? Don't worry about that. It's your zodiac. I see. There it is. That is like flies directly in the face of the mate switching hypothesis, and it flies directly in the face, or I should say it confirms dual mating strategy. No, time out. Real quick. Zing! No, it doesn't. I'm going to explain to you why. Ladies, Barbie, how many times have you cheated on your partner? Actually, zero. Yeah, okay. How many times have you cheated on your partner, Tiffany? I've never cheated on my partner. Remember, 17% of the time, they're not falling in love with their partner. I broke up with my boyfriend before I cheated on him. Okay. So you weren't technically cheating. No, it was never technically cheating, because the moment that I had a thought of it, I broke up with him, because I couldn't do that to my partner. Was the thought of cheating the thought of being with another dude, or the thought of leaving your man? No. So what happened was it started to become a sexless relationship. And that's pretty much the statistic of divorce, because it's sexless marriages. So they're going to go see you elsewhere, and therefore they file a divorce. So that may be the case sometimes with men getting erectile dysfunction, and the wife is very unsatisfied, therefore the wife probably files for a divorce. The prosecution rests its case. Am I right? Captain Sartain. I don't know. It's like a loaded question for me. It's kind of the same as hers. The relationship. Can you get closer to the mic? Talking in the penis. The relationship was over. You just broke up. Yes. So I just got out of a long-term relationship, or so I wanted it to be. Yeah. I cheated, but we were on a break, and I had just gotten cheated on. This is an episode of Friends. So I did it as a form of self-sabotaging, almost, and revenge, but revenge only hurts the person that's doing the revenge. For sure. So it hurt me, probably, honestly, more than it hurt him. Rach, you? Have you ever cheated on someone? Yeah, I was like 19 years old, and I was drunk, and it was with my best friend at the time. And he was cute, and one thing led to another? No, it was just a really drunk moment. It was off Everclear. I mean, that pretty much explains it. By the way, we really don't talk about this enough, because these are two different things. Alcohol? Yes. We don't talk about this enough. So specifically, it is tequila. What would you like to know? It is specifically tequila, cocaine, molly, mushrooms, marijuana. Hey, weed doesn't make you do that. Weed sometimes takes anxiety to zero. So it does. Hey. Weed takes anxiety to zero. Listen, there are dudes out there, 100 dudes out there, that will tell you, a girl smoked some, and she was way more down. 100%. If she has anxiety about hooking up with a dude, she smokes a blunt, for sure. It's like smoking a cigarette. It might give me more anxiety. I'll be like, oh, fuck. No, look around. Tiff, look around the table. What you're saying is not accurate, honey. No. It alters your state. It alters your state. Marijuana? Really? You think it's like smoking a cigarette? I mean, I smoke it a lot, because my finger is stuck in a gang sign. But that's why. But you're used to it. You have a tolerance. Yeah, I'm the anomaly of it. Okay. So, no. My point is, like, when we do these things, there's two things. Number one, I've seen girls come here, no intent on cheating, and then it's tequila, they're on stage, somebody gives them some molly, and then they just end up doing shit. But here's the thing, ladies. You're still accountable. If you get drunk and run somebody over, that's still DUI homicide. If you get drunk and you accidentally push somebody off a balcony, that's still manslaughter. Even though you were drunk, even though you were drunk, and even though you were on molly. Because I hear women do this sometimes. They do this, like, well, yeah, I cheated on him, but I was fucked up. For real. Ever clear? I was 19. Yeah. That's all we get our kids on at 19. It's like brain surgery. What I'm saying is, you may be fully in love with your boyfriend, but because you were in that situation and you cheated, he's not going to give a shit. It's still a problem for him. Go ahead, Carly. So, I do want to clarify. Because I was in that situation for a very long time, and I kind of did what I did, I have discovered a different side of myself where I felt like I love free love. And so, I don't necessarily want to be tied down to whatever. So, you're polyamorous now? I am not going to label myself as anything, but I'm learning different things about myself. And so, I will say that that's that. That's that. Do you mind if we ask how old you are? I'm a whore. 28. You're 28? I didn't say that. That's horrible. Why would you ever say that, Rola? We love whores. I love whores. Free love. More whores. More whores. More whores. More whores. He's never cheated? Never cheated. Have you ever, Christiana? No, I've not. No? Rita? Are you sure about that? You know the answer. Rita, I have no idea what you're talking about. Rita, have you ever even had sex, Rita? Never. Never? I'm fucking a Virgin Mary. Rita, can you talk about one, like, maybe super awkward situation where one met the other? Has that ever happened? Oh, I mean, you know, they might be best friends, they might not be. They might be. They're not going to be best friends after they figure it out. No one's safe. No one's safe. No one's safe? No one's safe. Never cheated. Never cheated? No. You just left because you had the feeling. I would never do that. I respected him so much. I wouldn't be with someone that I did not respect. Okay, ladies, can I ask you guys a question? Have you guys ever been in a relationship with a dude and said, I need a break? We need to go on a break. Has anybody ever done that? Yeah. Okay, cool. Has any of you guys ever done that? Has I need a break ever led to sexual intercourse with another guy? Has that ever happened? No. Yes. Who said no? I have. It has not? You didn't? Believe it or not, it's coming from the porn star dressed like a nun. Okay, go ahead. It happened all the way back to my hometown, so like, AKA, it was over, but then we did get back together like six months later, so like, yeah, it's been a long time. Okay, so I need to explain this to you guys. Now maybe for some circumstance it doesn't happen. If a woman says, I need a break, that means she is going to go sleep with someone else. Maybe something happens, she gets deployed to Iraq and she doesn't actually sleep with someone else. But for the most part, that is what those words mean. Please do not be confused by that. If you want to take her back later, take her back with the understanding that I need a break means I am going to sleep with someone else. That is what it means. And I've had way too many people, sorry, Carly is getting upset because I'm giving up game right now. I'm not getting upset. I'm fucking with you. I'm fucking with you. But do you guys understand, because there's a lot of guys out there who are listening to this right now and they're in this thing, it's like, well, you know, it was a lot of stress. She's going through stress in her job and she's just going through things and she needs a break. When a man needs a break, he might actually need a break. He might have colon cancer or fucking need to get a promotion in his job or something that has happened. When a woman needs a break, there is sex with another man in store. I just want you guys to say, but I want to also throw this out there before you say what you're going to say. How many times when there are break is initiated, is it the woman initiating the break versus the man initiating the break? Go ahead. Every time I've genuinely needed a break, it was just like Michael was saying. Sometimes a guy just like actually needs a break. It was that for me. I wasn't out seeking other things. I really need to like hone in and focus on myself because what I was in was suffocating and I wasn't able to like see myself clearly. It was an actual break. It wasn't, Oh, I need this break so I can go fuck other people. No, no, no. Oh, please, please understand when you say I need a break. If I put a polygraph on you and said, are you going to go fuck some other dude? The polygraph would show you don't intend on fucking another dude, but you will. That's the point, but you will like the thing is like, while men and women both have our weaknesses, men, for instance, we like sexual variety to the point where we sometimes we cheat in relationship and we cheat more than women do. Okay. Women, a lot of times what they'll do is they will have a feeling like their brain will tell them these are my intentions and then their body will go and fucking do so. We'll go fuck Kyler in the fucking, you know, the, the bartender at the foam cannon party and they'll be like one thing led to another. I love Carly, the look on Carly's face. It's like, it's like she's just, she's hearing the truth and like, yes, again, like it just, it's just very different. I did suck the bartender's dick today. Wait, stop, stop, stop. You did. You sucked a bartender's dick today? Today. Wait, what happened? That's nasty. Wait, what happened? Um, he let us in early. Free drinks. You know, he saw we were working and so he was like, yo, come to the bar. And we're like, okay. So we get a couple of free shots. And then my tip was his tip. Yo, she's not the kind of girl you want to take to a concert. Hold on, hold on. Carly, Carly, does, is this the guy that you're interested in or is it another guy? It's all casual. But you said there was a guy you were interested in. She's interested in all of them. Okay. It's all casual. No, I only have one fake boyfriend right now. You have one fake boyfriend. But we're not serious at all. We're not. Well, clearly because you were with the bartender. He's out doing his shit. I'm out doing my shit. Okay. Nice. And we're all doing our shit together too. No, you're doing your shit together. Yeah. Okay. Very nice. Yeah. He's my favorite. Okay. Got it. He's, he's, he's ranked number one overall. And you guys, you guys would do shit and there'd be other women involved. Not yet. Not yet. He doesn't want to. He doesn't want to. He doesn't want to. Would you want to? Of course. You would want to. Every girl wants a double threesome. Okay. Hold on. Time out. Time out. Okay. Best friends. Guys. Now, let's do this. Cause I know, I know some, listen, there's a possibility. There's a possibility. When I asked this question, there's a possibility. There's a possibility. When I asked this question that some of you are going to want to say yes, but not actually going to say yes. So here's what I'm going to ask. I'm going to ask this question a different way. Do you think most girls, maybe not you. Do you think most girls want a devil's threesome? Do you think most girls? Raise your hand if you think most girls. You said the devil guy, right? Yeah. Two guys. Eiffel Tower. I feel like every girl thought about that. For those of you playing the home game, a devil's threesome is? It's two guys, one chick. What's the tower? Eiffel Tower. Eiffel Tower. Devil's Tower. Eiffel Tower. There you go. Roll up. They're both great. See this? There's so many. See this? Yeah. It's right here. There's a bitch in the middle. They're not crossing swords. It's not. Not yet. Until later. It's only a game. You make a game. Okay. Hold on. Before we go. All right. Just so we're clear. Raise your hand again if you think most women do want a devil's threesome at some point in their life. Most women? Most women. Okay. So Bree thinks so. Okay. Cool. Want two guys at the same time? At least once in her life. Yeah. She just wants it once? At least once. Cristiano, what were you saying? That sounds like a lot of work. No. No. They do. Cristiano, what they're saying is they're doing all the work and you're just a Chinese finger puppet. You're just enjoying the ride. You're just enjoying the ride, sis. Is that what a passport bro is? Because they're- No, no, no. No, no. No, no. We'll go. Oh, sorry. Hold on. That's Eskimo Brothers. Eskimo Brothers. Yes, totally. No, that's Eiffel Tower. It's not a passport, bro. It's not a passport, bro. Okay. Two things. Number one. Number one. I'm going to ask a couple questions. Number one. In the chat. In the chat. If you think a devil's threesome is gay, if you think it's us or gay, put a one in the chat if you think it is. Put a two in the chat if you think it isn't. Okay? Hey, Tensley, if you want to point it straight up, could you point the fan straight up? Point the fan straight up. Yeah. Straight up. We're freezing to death over here. That was amazing. He's like- And you guys are talking shit about the sweater. Wait, what's a passport, brother? Okay. That's the second thing. So what's a passport, bro? Go ahead. Roll it. Explain the passport, bro. Because of women like you. I'm mad. I'm mad. I'm happy. I'm throwing it out for the boys. What did the boys ask for? They simply think that they're going to find a better, more traditional, more feminine, more less ratchet girl. I'm not here to get mad. I'm here to get mad. Wait, wait, wait. Carly. Carly. Southeast Asia. Let's see. An eastern block. Eastern European country. South America. Carly. Carly, let me ask you a question. I understand. Your choices are yours. Okay? What do they think of, like, say, there's maybe thousands of men who end up watching the show tonight. And they see it, and they're a little bit discouraged in the idea of trying to find a good wife that is going to be loyal to them and then be the mother of their children after hearing what you're saying. Sure. Absolutely. Can you see how it might be a little discouraging for them? 100%. Okay. Now, if it's discouraging. And maybe they find you're their type. Physically, you're their type. But then you talk, and then you say these things that are discouraging. Now, these same men are like, well, I need to find someone who maybe doesn't have the same options that Carly does. So I'm going to go to Bucharest. I'm going to go to Latvia. I'm going to go to Venezuela. No, not Liechtenstein. The standard of living in Liechtenstein is too high. Here's the thing with me. Okay? In my current time, in my current energy, in my current presence, I want nothing to do with a serious relationship. So that being said, that's why I am so fucking crazy, so raunchy, so sexual, so... I think for Vegas, you're like a seven on the crazy scale. How old are you guys? You're not doing hardcore porn. You're not that crazy. But that's what I'm doing right now. And that's okay with me. And so I'm not looking for anybody that would be physically, sure, you could be attracted to me. But mentally and relationshiply, that's not what I'm looking for. So I'm sure there are girls that are looking for that. That doesn't mean that you have to find them out of the country. There's plenty of good girls here. I'll say, on the flip side, I'm right next to you, and I'm in a relationship that we're monogamous 100%. Neither one of us have cheated. We're coming up on our three-year anniversary. And I feel like we're very similar in the way that we look, we talk. We're actually friends in real life as well. And so it's like there can be stark opposites. It's just finding the person that's right for you. Yeah. And it's just phases of life. I'm sure in seven years, I'll be calm and married with children. No, you'll have an epiphany. And it won't be in seven years. It'll be quicker than that. How old are you now? She's 28. I am 28. 28? Yeah, you got one more year. Just turned 28. I'm done with partying this last year. The past three weeks, I had an epiphany, and I was like, yo, I can't be doing all that. Hold on. Kensley, Kensley, I want you to consider something. So just hearing what she's saying, and then you're like, where are all the good men? Do you understand how the good men..."}
