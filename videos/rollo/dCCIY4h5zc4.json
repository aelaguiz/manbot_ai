You'll need this. I cannot live this. Grow stronger! That's all you have to do. What a great movie that was. How we all doing? My class in session here. God damn right. Oh, we're going to talk about Justine's Childs today. Don't go chasing waterfalls. I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong. Here we go. Live from Reno, Nevada. In the high desert, my secret bunker. My nuclear bunker underground in the high desert somewhere in northern Nevada on Bureau of Land Management land. Welcome to the Rational Mail. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Before we get started. Husband is responsible for the emotional well-being of his wife and of his family. You just can't come home and pass out in the lazy boy and say, I made I made the money for the groceries. I made the car payment. Your most important responsibility starts when you walk in the door of your house, not when you leave the door of your house. You're responsible not just for provision and security. You are responsible for the emotional well-being of your family. OK, and so I'll do Pat Husband 101. Sometimes she tells me things and I want to fix it. I learned a long time ago I'm supposed to listen and not fix everything. It's not about the nail. Have any control over what you wear when you go out. Oh, hell no. No, no, no, no, no. If you wear something a little too revealing, I should have a big say. So just because like you were a reflection of me. No, if that makes sense. No, I walked out here and I'm a woman of 2023. Women can wear what they want to wear. I should have to talk to my husband about wearing what I should wear. You know, by the same time, also be respectable and respect your husband. If I want to wear a bralette, I can wear a bralette. You should I should have to come out of the house with just no. I'm not saying we're breaking up. We're breaking up. We're breaking up. We're breaking up in the underwear. That's what I'm saying. I know. I mean, I'm not a school. A man should not be able to play a man. I'm going to take this off. A man should not be able to tell a woman what she should and should not wear. It's 2023. If they're flying. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And when it's when I tell women what they know about the 1990s, that's anything. Something really interesting. It's the bad boy paradox. They call it that young, naive women are attracted to those Machiavellian types. But when they get older and more experienced, they start to be able to see through that. The reason they're attracted to it, as far as I can tell, and I talked about this with Bust to see if I was way off on the wrong track, is that those reckless, fearless people mimic real fearless competence. And young women aren't good at distinguishing between the two. And so they get sucked in by this sort of psychopathic recklessness because they think it's fearless competence. And of course, the guys who are doing that, they'll prey on that because they're trying to aid competence. But what the women are really after in their heart of hearts, they might be out for an adventure, too, because there's that element of it. But they want that fearlessness that does go along with true generosity and competence and also the ability to keep, you know, real darkness away. ...make more than their husbands and heterosexual marriages are up to three times more likely to get cheated on. Another recent study found that men's stress levels rise if their female partners... Researchers find that promotions to top jobs dramatically increase a woman's likelihood of divorce, a pattern that does not hold true for men. In a series of studies published in the American Psychological Association's Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, men felt bad when their wives beat them at something. But they also subconsciously lost confidence when their wives got any wins, even when they weren't in direct competition with their partners. And this is true across all kinds of... Hoop earrings, duly noted. ...achievements, personal, social, and intellectual. Men felt worse about themselves when their partner succeeded compared to when she failed. And when their partner succeeded at something they failed at, their self-esteem took an even bigger hit, and in turn, their relationship satisfaction diminished. There's quite a bit of... Boy, man, she really makes men sound like they're just infantile, fragile little children with just inferiority complexes, and they're all insecure in their masculinity. Oh, my goodness. I wouldn't want anything to do with them. Yeah, that's called pandering. Just so we're clear. ...manipulate women using their menstrual cycle. So this is a dumbed-down chart of a person's menstrual cycle. As you can see, it starts with our period. This is when we bleed for seven days. We are moody, fatigued, and in a world of pain. During this time, it is best that you shut the f*** up and buy something useful like food or tampons, thus making you seem like a considerate person. Next, we have days 7 through 12. Our period has ended, and our estrogen levels begin to rise again. This is a great time to give compliments, but don't confess your love just yet, because days 12 through 16 is ovulation. This is peak estrogen in when we are fertile and full of eggs, which means we're super horny. So this is the best time to seduce your target or confess your love, but make sure to wrap your willy. Or not, if you're trying to trap someone. She's not full of eggs. She's full of one egg, just so we're clear. I mean, that's bad medical advice, but okay. Days 17 through 21, our eggs release and begin to dissolve if not fertilized. This causes a sudden change in hormones, which intensifies our emotions. This is a great time to gaslight and manipulate us, when we are most vulnerable and susceptible to trickery and mind games. You can do the most emotional damage during this time. Now, this chart is missing something major, which is PMS, which stands for premenstrual syndrome. And for me personally, this is even worse than the period itself. This is when our estrogen drops and our skin breaks out. So call us pretty. Also, our libido becomes non-existent. So this would be the worst time to seduce or ask us out. Let us nap instead. Many women experience drastic mood swings and feel absolutely insane during this time. God, she makes it sound so good, doesn't she? Oh, God. But when Rolo says it, he's a son of a bitch. You don't see that in society. You see women my age, where we... Honestly, it's 50-50. That's a workforce. Women are trying to change it. That's the whole point. We already are. It's not even trying. We are changing it. You just have to give it time and stop bitching. Okay. Let me ask a few more... And just be thankful. Let me ask you a few more... And work hard. Let me ask you a few more questions, then I think we'll get to an interesting point here. And this is what I'm really curious to see what you think. Okay. So, now that we defined patriarchy, do you think that patriarchy is the cause of gender roles or is it the result of gender roles? I think it's an excuse. I think it's the result. Okay. So, then here's what I want to know. Historically, weren't men in the productive sphere while women were in the reproductive sphere? Okay. So, isn't patriarchy just the natural evolution of men and women just giving in to their expected roles? Again, I think that goes back to survival. Like, those were the roles that we needed to survive back in the day. But again, today, we don't need those things. Women don't need to have children. Like, women can go out and do all the things that men do. You don't need to fall into those gender roles anymore. But that's what makes us special. Men can have children. I want to do something they can do. Okay, but not every woman wants to have a child, and they shouldn't have to. I never said they have to. I said I want to. Okay, let me get to the next question, then. Why is patriarchy seen as such a bad thing when women always expected men to provide? I think that women were taught to expect that. I personally enjoy it because of the patriarchy. But you don't think that's a biological thing? I think it depends on who you are. Like, I'm white. Again, because it's different in every society. Some societies are matriarchal, so it all depends on society and where you're from. A lot of old societies, like a lot of Native American societies. And why are they not around anymore? Because white people killed all of them. Actually, they were the ones who got it. So, no, you actually don't know your history. Native Americans were also very mean to us as well. We fought each other. And you want to know why Jamestown got all the smallpox? It's when the Indians gave them gifts, like rugs and things. They actually put smallpox on the rugs. It'd be like putting COVID on someone and then giving them cake. Never forget, these two are old enough to vote. Just throwing that out there. A lot of feminism is here, and it's going to change the world as we know it. My prediction? This is going to be a counter-movement to the fourth wave, where women start embracing their femininity instead of tearing down masculinity. Cool, women have joined men in the workforce. But now they've realized that they've lost sight of the things that actually make them strong women, like their warmth, their love, and their ability to nurture the people in their lives. They're realizing that they're now in debt to sexual liberation and hookup culture. It ruined them. And now they're realizing that competing with men resulted in no fulfillment whatsoever. They just serve their male boss instead of the man in their home. All for what? 12 weeks of paid maternity leave? Yeah, you could keep that. Feminism destroyed the traditional family and the natural dynamics between men and women. And now women are waking up. We're going to see a fifth wave, and the women that lead it will be the ones that recognize masculinity maintains society, while femininity maintains life. Welcome to the fifth wave, my guys. The fifth wa- So, basically, matriarchy. That panders to guys, kind of like the pastor at the beginning of this show? I'm confused. My question is, why are these beautiful women single, bro? Why the fuck am I single, bro? Why the fuck am I single? Guys, I've been single. I'm going to be single. Oh, my God. For four fucking years now. In a few months, bitch. I haven't had a boyfriend, like, officially. No, dude. And I just think about it, and I look at myself, and I'm like, bitch, you're fucking pretty, bitch. Like, I'm not jealous. I'm like, you know, my ego is thick or whatever. But, like, dude, I'm pretty. Bitch, I got a ass. Bitch, I got my own place. I make my own money. I cook. I clean. I do se\u00f1ora shit, and I'm not even a fucking se\u00f1ora. Like, I got long hair. I'm Latina. I got a good personality. I'm funny. Sometimes I got an attitude, but I'm not, like, crazy. That's nasty. It is nasty, right? Isn't it nasty? Married. My business grew 278% over three years. If you look at some of the most successful people in the world, they got one girl, dude. They got one girl. And they got a solid girl. They don't have none of these little tweety birds running around. They got a solid chick. And the reason they do that is because it creates such a stable place to operate. I know that I've got somebody that's creating a home life for me, a place to relax and rejuvenate, you know, my life force. I don't have somebody arguing with me. I don't have somebody calling me, texting me, I'm not doing enough, blah, blah, blah, or trying to juggle three chicks and all that shit. That's fucking work. That's not a full-time job, man. When you have, like, one person really there to support you and help you so that you can focus on the bigger task, you can't put a price on that. But it doesn't make it right, right? For you to have a girl at home and then go out and have sex with all of these women, like, why are we placing value on that? Well, relationships and sex and relationships, like, the mating process is amoral by nature. It's not meant to be fair. It's not meant to be moral. It's not meant to be any of that stuff. We're here to reproduce. And unfortunately, there are unflattering realities in the reproduction process. And if we're here to reproduce, then are you reproducing with all of these women that you're having sex with? No, but you're still... But that's the point, right? You're still copulating because that is the act to reproduce. How does that make you valuable if you don't respect your penis? He believes a high-value man can sleep with as many women as they want to, and they're totally fine because they don't... because men don't view sex outside of just an act and they move on. No, officer. There's a lot more to it than that, but we'll come back. Generally speaking, that's what he says. And women, they can... Generally speaking, you're full of shit. So if they sleep with a lot of people, they're damaged goods. But men can be totally up to par, sleep with as many women as they want, and everything is cool. And so she kind of called him out on it. She's saying that, no, it's just for reproductive purposes. So, like, as animals, there's no morality to it. It's just reproduction. And then she called him out and said, well, all the women you're sleeping with, are you trying to reproduce with them? See, because if you ain't trying to reproduce with them, then what you're creating is your own reality of morality in sexual encounters with women. You're not just trying to reproduce. You're trying to have a good time. You're trying not to reproduce. Okay, I got to pull that out because I will probably get chapped for that one. How's it going? Oh, wait. Thank you. Whoever gave me this. That's nasty. It is nasty, right? Isn't it nasty? God, perfect. Thank you. Thank you. That will be like forever. I'm going to have to trade that one, I think, to Chris Pogson for a good one. Big Mo, if you're watching, let's deal. Oh boy, what a what a great day. Hey, happy Easter man. He is risen, right? Yeah. See I know Christian ease Speaking of which I'm gonna be doing a I'm gonna be doing a religious talk with the guys from iron disciples and Glenn Lawrence actually if you don't know who Glenn is he was on Access Vegas with myself Troy no myself red pill Thor John MLD and Aaron was on there. We had a just a sort of a meeting in the mines and he was he was there kind of like He's an interesting cat. So I'm gonna be doing a I'm gonna be doing a Talk with him and the probably the only guys I have any respect for as far as like the crystal red pill is concerned which is The iron disciples and I like these guys quite a bit. They're kind of a come-up right now But there are a couple of twin brothers actually and then I want to say it's Mike there's another guy that there's like three of them and Really? It should be a pretty good Conversation. I would I would hope it's gonna be a good conversation. Thank you guys.

I don't know when that's gonna happen, but Should that should be happening soon, you know, as you know, I've been on her show several times Oh, and there's Glenn Glenn has decided that he is going to be a member, too I need to get a sound drop for how's what you like to know more if you become a a member I Need to get a name for my members my members the red pill members Like to think of like some like cutesy like nickname for like members of this. I just opened up memberships It's as cheap as they would let me make it I'm only doing it simply so I can sort of keep control over the chats when when it gets out of hand quite honestly But I you will also be able to get like early access So when I actually take the time to prep this show a day in advance as I did for this one um, then um then uh Let's see. Oh, then you will be able to get the advance notices that's number one and then number two is um, i'm gonna i'm gonna just I think for my members i'm going to Start releasing show notes uh for the shows themselves because for every one of these shows I do like a lot of notes for um, That's doesn't even look like a lot of notes. Wait. Wait. That was my most recent notes here. I'll show you I actually do I actually do a ton of A ton of these things like like i'm a note taker as you guys know, so that's actually today's show Now there that's my show notes as of the videos that I pulled and then uh, oh dude, come on dude Slayer slayer. Oh See the thing about slayer is you don't just say slayer you have to I had no lie. Okay. God damn it No lie. Here's here's a quick. Here's a quick rollo story I Can now go if I look like i'm more yoked It's because the the gym that I go to now because i'm in red one studios the gym that I go to I can Skateboard there I can literally be at the gym And just by walking I could probably be there in like five to eight minutes So I have no excuse not to go to the gym and it's a good gym I was in there and I was I forget what I was doing something I was working out on a machine or something like that and I I am not kidding. This this actually happened Okay I'm sitting there and I have i'm gonna have a slayer tank top on i'm lifting and everything And this and I have my earbuds in and so i'm just like in the zone i'm working. I open my eyes I'm looking and there's this lady and she looks like she's probably like in her like mid 60s So maybe or like just pushing 70 almost And she's walking by out of the out of the gym and I swear to god. It's got his way. Wait, she's like What the fuck just happened, that's true I I Later on I find I come to find out that her grandson's really into slayer Like she knows you're not supposed to just say slayer. You have to like yell Slayer It was funny as hell too. Yeah, shout out to pearl pearls in the chat. Hey, hey pearly pearly Yeah, yeah. Yeah, you just yeah take it to we're gonna we're gonna get to you girl girlfriend I want to all you know what, you know, let's just do it right now so I've made it. I made an erroneous comment at one point. Um while back and I said that pearl Buys or subs I have so I took that as hearsay back in the day, by the way uh, I think it was probably like around july or like august or september is when I heard that and Quite honestly, that was kind of stupid on my part because if you've ever heard me talk about subscriptions. I've also said that Subs are a vanity metric meaning that if you don't know how youtube analytics work In fact, if somebody says oh, well, they got a whole bunch of subs that makes them a better channel No, no, actually it doesn't Your engagement your analytics your click-through rate your your audience retention your impressions Those are the things that generate actual money and that's how you can judge the quality of a channel not based on On subs and i've i've been very vocal about that in the past. I know how youtube works In fact, I even addressed that on the dr phil show When I was trying to explain to imran ahmed as to why he wasn't actually the person who took down andrew tate back in August because he wanted to take credit for taking the scalp of Andrew tate back when he got canceled off of like, uh, youtube and twitter and and big tech just basically like blew him off right so His you know presumption is that oh, well, you know, he had a 1.3 million followers on on twitter Well, yeah, he did but you got to remember he's his account was probably as old as like What night 2014 2016 So you're talking about progressive like buildup. It's not like you just got it overnight, right? And that's twitter if you go and you look at the uh, how andrew tate's like subs worked out Everybody's like well, he got he got canceled and he had a lot of subs it's like you don't know if you're gonna say that you think that sub count is actually the um Is actually the metric of a good show. I will point you in the direction of fresh and fit in august of 2021 when abba and preach first decided that they wanted to take a piece out of the Myron and fresh were getting too big for the britches and so they go and throw these these accusations of sa You know, uh forced sexual copulation and exchange for favors. And what was it? Um, using seeking arrangements and then Sa sexual assault but seeking arrangements and all that stuff all that good stuff that went down in august that nobody remembers anymore um I will point you in the direction of those things. I'll come back to that. Hold on one second. Let me Star that there we go. So Let's let's also look at the fact that subs really don't make all that big a deal But I will say right now that and here you go. There you go. Got it. Thank you. Okay You're getting off that do you do you know me do you know my show So as far as pearl pearl's concerned, um, yeah, I I I did not know I don't have the stats in front of me there are certain ways of sort of like Finding out whether somebody has bought subs, but really in this day and age It doesn't really make too much difference if someone does buy subs so, um, it's kind of neither here nor there, but I was wrong just me a couple, um, Hold on one second. Go ahead glenn. What did you say? Let's Well, we're gonna we'll talk about that here in just a second. I'm I I am gonna just keep my mouth shut about Jal so and i'm not even gonna say that i'm just gonna go by using the uh, the acronym for jal at this point um, so Let's see. Hold on one second Well, I will tell you that yeah Okay, so if you want to talk about like having people on your show, I think honestly there was a there was a point where I'm watching what's happening with mire and fresh. I just played the officer tatum Clip we're gonna dig into that today too. We're gonna dig into some of destiny's. Uh, uh nonsense, uh videos about um Gosh, what marriage and stuff? I got it I got a I don't want to say a little bit of dirt on destiny But this is like nothing that people haven't already figured out But I think it's kind of he's kind of very hypocritical about some of the stuff he talks about knowing what some of the decisions and the behaviors that he's sort of been participating in for a very long time so I figured maybe it's time to sort of dig into that and sort of like bring that to put that in the Into some sunshine, right? Sunshine is the best disinfectant so as far as um Pearl getting run up the flagpole. I should also say that this is also a trend that's going on right now Abba and preach came at me for doing what for calling them out on their bullshit about um about donovan sharp and Do I know that abba and preach? Went and had a phone call with anthony johnson and said hey say this about him No, I don't but you know what? I do know I do know that the material that they were using to throw at at donovan about two months ago Was old material from like two or three years ago that was thrown out by anthony johnson in an effort to discredit donovan Because donovan runs the cme which competes directly with the 21 convention. There you go What do you have to say about that? Well, we don't know who he is. We didn't take any money from him blah blah blah Okay, fine But you're still using that why on earth does he even show up on your radar? Oh, he was talking shit about me and my wife And who else hasn't who else hasn't Right, right who my myron and fresh talked about and this again remember this is like from august of 2021 We're still reheating this stuff. You know, why because there's it's a slow news cycle in the manosphere That's why because we don't have anything else to talk. We don't have anything to bitch about Oh, let's go and dig something out from from way back when and by the way, it's not just abba preach. It's also uh ben shapiro if you saw I did by the way, if you didn't catch it, I did a Midweek show on thursday and I talked about exactly this again. It's not even just him. It's also Uh amala from from prager you it's uh, ben. Shapiro. Of course. It's matt walsh talking shit about Ryan stone of all people on planet earth ryan stone gets shit from you Say my name and When I see this stuff, I see that there is this want or this desire to to sort of come out people right now And that's really the theme of today's show Like I said, you know, is this the future of masculinity? I mean that sort of tongue in cheek but the reason why i'm getting into that is because right now We're in a critical stage I think as far as the manosphere is concerned because we're just this side of uh, The election cycle here in the united states and that's when you're going to see people pivot That's when you're getting to see people say. Oh, you know what the manosphere stuff is not playing as well as it used to But until that point they're going to ride it because these people also know that that's the most likely place that they're going to find an audience so that when we get into the 18 month cycle of the Of the election cycle here in the united states, which really kind of has already begun if you think about it um But that that whole the whole the whole gotcha stuff the whole hey, let's go dig up Um, let's go dig up some videos from over a year ago The one I I commented on that ben shapiro was talking about on thursday That was over a year ago And he's reporting on it as if it just happened just recently It's the one where he's like, you know, he's has he's the the fart smell when I was joking around, right? He's like, oh, I can't believe this stuff and it's not ben shapiro It's ben shapiro's writers It's the people who are in the production side of the whole thing that are picking up on this and going hey What are the kids talking about talking about this this time of the day or this time of year Uh, let's talk about fresh and fit So they go and they throw throw something out there and they dig something up from a year ago Which by the way is exactly what i've been preached to Which is exactly what officer tatum is doing which is exactly what a lot of these there's a new sort of I don't know crop of content creators Who are just basically looking for low-hanging fruit and it wouldn't even be low-hanging fruit if it was recent So when I when I see what's going on with with pearl it's like you can like pearl's an entertainer Okay, she if she whether she's part of the master. She's not part of the manosphere. She has said herself that she is an entertainer Okay, fine You still have to know who you're having on your show same thing. I would say to adam sosnick as well Right know who you have on your show. You're past a hundred thousand subs Guess what you're responsible for whoever you put in the seat the hot seat next to you and you can't go I don't know who he was, you know, god damn well who he is You know god damn well who nick fuentes is, you know damn well who john anthony lifestyle is You know who the people are that you bring on, you know, julie or what? rudy giuliani is They just had him on patrick bad david show. They're not gonna put him up there. Well, we didn't know who rudy giuliani is Coming in here. He's just talking like he's crazy Get the fuck out of here So you have to be responsible for your own show that said There is this new crop of guys who are basically they just want to be critics And they want to find some some material and by the way, I would count destiny amongst that as well I would count abham preach officer tatum, uh with a lead attorney guy Whatever the hell that guy's name is all these guys who want to come at people in the sphere right now they all Notice that they're digging up old videos notice that they're digging up stuff that they know is going to play So that's what i'm going to get into today i'm going to start with officer tate i'm going to start with some other stuff too so Let's continue. What do you want? No, he she did not pay me to chat. Okay, just so i'm i'll clear the air right there for you guys This is not a paid. This is not a paid promotion. I don't do paid promotions here The only thing as a matter of fact, wait, wait Even this even devil mountain coffee Hold on. Hold on. Here's my I got to get my plug to my boys, right? Um"}
