Eisenberg. You're goddamn right. All right, guys, here we go. You asked for it. Live from Las Vegas, doing my show. I guess this is kind of really an Access Vegas show. When I'm in Vegas, it might as well be. Anyways, here's your midweek stream. I have Michael Sarting and I have Gary Grinberg. Gary Grinberg. Gary the numbers guy, whatever you want to call him. There you go, Gary the numbers guy. The original G. Has actually flown out here and answered the call. Thank you for doing it. The first thing I want to tell you is thank you for being the first one to take this challenge. Because a lot of people have a problem with me. I'm not saying you do, but a lot of people have a problem with me. And they always want these debates. And I'm like, okay, fine. Here's a place that we can come and have a formalized debate. Let's do it. You're the first person to answer the call. I'm going to say this, man. Being a coward is nowhere to live life. Can you give my audience a little bit of your background? We've got to introduce you. First of all, a lot of you guys in, I'm assuming Red Pill, might know what astrology is. And you guys understand that chicks do this stuff. And they say Libra, Mercury. And it sounds like a bunch of gibberish. And it sounds like a bunch of bullshit, to be honest. But see, if you have a car and you put a woman in the car and she can't drive a stick. This car doesn't move. You don't blame the car, do you? You blame the practitioner. So I'm basically here to tell you guys, all that astrology nonsense you heard in the past, I'm here to set the record straight. Because what you're looking at is the first person in their profession who's ever been invited to the White House under the Trump administration. And we'll go more into my history a little later. Are you the official astrologer for the Trump administration? Would you say you're the official astrologer? This is what I'm going to say. I'm going to say December 2020, when all the walls were closing in, I was the one they called to invite to the White House. Nancy Reagan had her own official astrologer. That was an astrologer. His name was Mr. Quigley. And Mr. Quigley\u2014no, I'm not kidding. That was his name. And Mr. Quigley would go around setting the schedule through Nancy Reagan for Ronald Reagan. But the problem was Reagan's cabinet thought she was cuckoo. So you had a little problem here where the wife is pulling you on one end and your people are pulling you on the other. I understand that. But when it comes to numerology, which, by the way, supersedes astrology, I'm the guy. Just so we're clear, because this is one of the things. It's the no true Scotsman thing. These other astrologers are fake. These other numerologists are fake, but you're not. That's the argument. I'm going to make this thing. It's all about what can you show. Can you actually\u2014what have you done in this field? I think we agree on that. What have you done in this field? It doesn't matter what you do in life. Are you the best of the best at what you do? And when it comes down to it, the fact is everyone else is broke. I actually got mine. For sure. But I think what's maybe more important is what you can show empirically and what objective truths that you can prove and what things you can actually predict. And that's what we're going to do today. We can. We can. And we can go back and forth. But some of those things\u2014just skip ahead here. We'll talk about the 2016 championship with the Cavs. And I followed that whole thing very clearly. When Kyrie Irving, born in 1992, you're the monkey, hit the game-winning shot in 2016, right? And I'll let you go through that whole thing. But let's try something different. The year before, in 2015, Kyrie Irving broke his kneecap open and Kelly Olenek pulled Kevin Love's arm out of socket. And the Cavs still gave the Warriors a fucking beat. They almost won that series. And the next year, once that happened, I predicted the Cavs would win the championship. And then Draymond Green gets suspended. And then you go on a news program and you start predicting that the Cavs are going to win. Actually, I made that prediction in 2014 that the Cavs would win the NBA Finals in 2016. That's why they had me on the news. But my Twitter account got suspended. That's what happens when you say too many truths. Your Twitter account\u2014just like you. You got your Twitter account suspended. So I said that in 2014, and then they suspended my Twitter account. So it wasn't 2016 I said it. I said 2014. Right. But I just don't know necessarily. I think a lot of people would have thought the Cavs would have won that championship. I don't think that necessarily proves neurology. Against a 73-19, the best record in NBA history. That went down 3-1. That were already down 3-1 to the Oklahoma City Thunder beforehand. Correct. And almost got their ass beat the time before in the Finals when Kyrie and Kevin Love were injured. Now a lot of people watching this are like, I don't keep up with basketball. The point is, that was an educated guess. LeBron James was the best player in the world at the time. But my point is, a lot of the predictions\u2014like you also did predict that Donald Trump was going to win the election in 2020. And that wasn't correct. So the thing is, we're sitting there\u2014 That election was stolen, my friend. Okay, that's fine. But again, numerology should account for that. No, no, no. I actually\u2014 Numerology should account for that. Actually, I said the election would be stolen. And again, that Twitter account got suspended. So again, we can go back and forth. But I actually said certain things. Let me go back to the Cavs' 2-16. Just for my clarification, what exactly did you predict? I predicted the Cavs would come back from 3-1 down and win the NBA Finals. I went on the news and said it. You actually saw it. Everyone can go on YouTube, Cavs, GaryTheNumbersGuy. You will see it yourself. The point is\u2014 I don't think they were down 3-1 at the time. I think it was 3-2 at the time when you made the prediction. They were still down. And then Draymond had been suspended. The whole point is this. In NBA history, 0-32 were teams that actually were down 3-1. None of them won. I called the first one. In the Finals. Yes. I was the first one who called it. Not in NBA playoffs, obviously. The biggest stage is the Finals. Just the previous series, the Golden State Warriors were down 3-1 down to Oklahoma City, which is why I thought they had some serious problems. And that's why I didn't think they were going to win that championship. I'll tell you what. My little betting slips that year, they say it all. Because I had all my money in the Cavs. Everyone in my group had their money in the Cavs. And again, I'm not perfect. I make mistakes. I'm human. What I'm basically trying to say is I'm not going to be the one who's going to say everything I say is going to be 100% true. I'm trying to tell you I'm better than everyone else at it. That's it. Yeah, that's problematic, though. Because one of the issues is if I'm supposed to, like, where have you won the lottery? And if I'm supposed to follow you and sometimes you're wrong, then this is not a predictable, testable model that you're putting out with numerology and astrology. So you want me to win the lotto? Is that what you're telling me? I mean, if you're a numerologist, I do think that would be kind of\u2026 Okay. So let me tell you. People have came to me and asked me that stuff before. So here's the thing. If the odds of winning the lotto are 100 million to one for you\u2026 Sure. \u2026it'll be 100 to 1,000 to me. I'm still not going to hit that 100 to 1,000, but my odds will be a lot better. Again, it goes back to the point I'm saying. I can do it better than anyone else because of my ability to understand numerology and astrology. That's it. I'm not going to win the lotto. For all we know, the lotto is fixed by the CIA as a money laundering operation. So that's probably not the best example. Or another example would be then just run a hedge fund and then just go ahead and start running\u2026 Yeah, I consult many hedge fund managers. Right, but then you wouldn't even be coming in here on a fucking spaceship if that was the case. I consult with billionaires. I understand. I get that, man. But then your picks would be so much better and you'd be able to document it and no one would ever\u2026 Here's what I'm saying. Let's try this instead. Let me do this a different way. Okay. So the scientific scrutiny against what you're saying about numerology and astrology, just get rid of it. It's very easy. All you have to do is run a fund that does better than the medallion fund. That's all you have to do is beat their returns and then show it. But you need to start from a certain point and go through another point. Then you need to accurately predict the invasion of Ukraine and you need to actively\u2026 I actually did that. Can you please put that up on Twitter how I said the Ukraine war would start in 2022, in 2021? I actually said that on Twitter. Yeah, but did you say in March that it was going to start? I said I got the year. See, this is what I'm trying to say. I got the year. I got the year. We all knew that they were putting troops up there. Again, that's not a test for prediction. Not everyone knew that. Even the Ukrainian president said they're not invading. No, he may have said that they're not invading, but we did see that they were putting troops on the border. Well, maybe you and I saw it, but most people didn't. So the fact of the matter is my prediction is valid. You don't need numerology to predict. I'm not saying you needed numerology for that one, but I'm saying the numerology led me to the same conclusion as common sense. So here's the point. If you have common sense and you see evidence pointing to a certain direction, no matter where you get it from, you're going to say, okay, this is the way it's going to be. So for instance, Ukraine. Are you saying common sense would be more practical than numerology? It's actually the same thing when you actually start thinking about it. One plus one is always going to equal two. Same thing with numerology. Math is the only universal language there is. Let me start a little bit so people can understand where I'm coming from. Let me tell a little bit of people about my past, and then we can go back to the questions. So 9-11. That was one of the biggest days in world history, and it was the day that changed my life. I woke up. I saw the TV. I think I'm watching the movie Die Hard. All of a sudden, I'm thinking, wait a second. Flight 11 hit the World Trade Center that looks like an 11 side by side. They both have 110 stories. Let's see here. New York's the 11th state in the Union. New York City, 11 letters. Hmm. All of this stuff, and I'm like, wait a second. What's going on here? Is this a coincidence? Because that's what someone with common sense would start thinking. Is this a coincidence? But see, I know history, and I've always studied history. You said you were into history, too. When did the Great War end? The Great War, World War I, ended on 11 and 11 at exactly 11 o'clock. They were still firing bullets at each other at 1055, but at 11, they all stopped. At that point, I'm like, okay. I don't know what's going on, but I see smoke, because that's what common sense is telling me. At some point, it stops being a coincidence. When I see that Al-Qaeda attacked America on 9-11, I'm like, okay, that's one thing. Then when you see that Al-Qaeda attacked Mumbai, India on July 11th. I think it was July 26th when they attacked Mumbai. No, it was 11th. Actually, look it up, because I already used this example many times. And then they attacked Spain on the 11th, too. Those were the three biggest attacks in Al-Qaeda's history. So I'm thinking, okay. So now it's getting to the point where do people out there actually know something that other people don't? Because why are they doing things on specific events? Let's talk about the pandemic. The World Health Organization called COVID-19 on February 11th. Why did they pick the 11th? And guess what? They said it was an official pandemic on March 11th. So you tell me, when does this stop being a coincidence? Because they keep doing this over and over on big events. Because the Civil War did not end on the 11th, and neither did World War II. Again, you're cherry-picking. I'm not cherry-picking. I'm picking the biggest events in history. No, again, World War I is not a bigger event than World War II. I just said World War ended on 11-11. Exactly. World War I did. World War II was a bigger event. That's in your opinion. That's in your opinion. World War I killed 100 million people. It was a bigger event. That is your opinion. What was the date? World War I led to World War II. You can't have one without the other. Find this out for me. When did we go to war with Vietnam? The 70s? Yeah. 1965. Do we know the date? Do we know the date? Again, you are cherry-picking. This is called the Texas sharpshooter fallacy, where you cherry-pick different ideas. What would happen? A coincidence would actually be if every war ended on 11, or if a predominance of wars ended on 11. That's not what's going on. No, no, no. I disagree. What happens is, when you look at, and I'll bring sports examples, when you look at an example, Steph Curry at the line, he hits 90% of his free throws. Another guy hits 60%. What you're doing is saying, oh, none of this is valid because you don't hit 100%. That is not how the game works. I'm trying to tell you, if you look at what I'm saying, most of the biggest events in history will line up with exactly what I'm saying. But it's not even most. It's not even partially most. It's just cherry-picking. Tell me a bigger event than 9-11 in our history. A bigger event? The pandemic? The bombing of Pearl Harbor. That was a bigger event than 9-11? Yes. Since me and you have been alive, modern-day history. You just said that now. 500,000 American troops died in World War II. It was a bigger event than 9-11. 3,000 people died in 9-11. It's horrible. I went to war for our country because of 9-11. I understand what you're saying. But the biggest thing that had happened before that was the bombing. In our lifetimes, the biggest thing is 9-11. I can say the biggest thing. For sure, I can say that. I just break down the whole thing about how 9-11 happened on the left. What I'm basically trying to tell you is, it doesn't matter what you believe. It doesn't matter what you believe. It doesn't matter what I believe. It doesn't matter what the people listening believe. It matters what the people in positions of power are doing. If you see what the people in positions of power, through the history, they're always planning events under certain dates. For instance, Wall Street crashed on October 29, 1929. 2-9 is 11. Before people say I'm cherry-picking, let me explain how numerology works. There's only three possible ways to become an 11 or to be part of the 11 energy. One is to be born on the 11th. Second is to be born on the 29th. 2-9 is 11. And the last way is to be like Kobe Bryant. Kobe's born 8-23-1978. 8-2-3-1-9-7-8 adds up to 38. 3-8 is 11. Now, the reason 11 is not broken down is because it's a master number. 11, 22, and 33 are all master numbers. I'll show you an example. Why would those be master numbers? Why are they more important than any other number? It's basically like AM and FM radio on completely different wavelengths. How is that measured? How are the wavelengths measured? How is the energy in those numbers measured against other numbers? Basically, people who are 11s, people who are 22s, people who are 33s have basically dominated society. Example, Barack Obama\u2014 How do you\u2014 Let me explain. What's the metric for an important number versus an unimportant number? The people who actually have those numbers. So the numerology is dependent on the person itself? No. The numerology is when a person is born, they're imprinted with energy. Okay? So if someone's born\u2014 What kind of energy? Okay, I'll give you an example. I'll give you an example. If someone is born on the 11th, they're going to be born with charisma. People who are born on the 11th have a lot of charisma. Now, how do I actually prove this? Because me saying it means nothing. I can prove the fact that the number one podcaster in the world, Joe Rogan, is born on the 11th. I can say the guy who started podcasting, the crazy French guy, Alex Jones, is born on the 11th. I can say the person who made it from nowhere, Candace Owens, born on the 29th, 2 and 9 is 11. I can bring up Aiden Ross, born on the 11th. How does a punk-ass kid like him make it big? Because he's born on the 11th. who were born on the 11th have charisma. This is a fact. But then there's hundreds of examples of people who don't. I just gave you the top guys in the game. But it doesn't matter. No, no, no, no, no, you're telling me. Aiden Ross is not the top guy in the game. Joe Rogan is, but that's the problem. First off, the Mumbai attacks were on the 26th. I just looked it up. The other thing, I'll show you the pictures of it, okay? The other thing is this concept of like Aiden Ross, you cherry pick, you brought up this one example that that Michael Jordan and, who's the one? Kobe Bryant. No, not Kobe Bryant. Oh, the same birthday. Jim Brown. Jim Brown have the same birthdays. And your example was that Michael Jordan was the greatest basketball player of all time. Do you disagree? Of course he is. And then the idea that Jim Brown was possibly the greatest football player of all time. Well, no, but Jim Brown isn't even the best running back of all time. You cherry picked and went down. Well, according to Barry Sanders, he is the best running back of all time. Barry Sanders retired just not to beat that guy's record. So you're saying he's not, but Barry Sanders, the guy who played the game, said he is. Everyone else, the NFL's top 100, and everyone else who voted don't even put him in the top three as far as Jim Brown is concerned. He's a great player, but to say he's better than, say, just even throw out Jerry Rice, Joe Montana, or Tom Brady. I was talking about running backs. Well, but again, that's not what you said. And the thing you said, the greatest football player of all time. The Hotep Jesus interview is still up there. And the point is, you cherry picked. You went down the list of football players to find one that had the same birthdate as Michael Jordan. This is the Texas sharpshooter fallacy. That's what I'm saying. But I'm giving you examples of the top people in the game. When I say Michael Jordan is the top guy in the game, most people who actually understand basketball would say that because Michael Jordan's born 217, 1963. That's not why he's not. That's exactly why he is, because he's an 11 and 11s have the best ability when it comes to becoming athletes. He's the best basketball player ever because the man was a psychopath with a 45 inch vertical who literally led the league and scored. He scored 37 because he was 11. And it's because, you know what? No, it's not because. And because of determination, because about because his father didn't accept him because his father accepted Larry. I got a question. Do we know when Tiger Woods was born? 1230 1975 and 11. Hold on. Hold on. 1230 1975 1 2 3 0 1 9 75 adds up to 28 28. It's number of wealth. He is one of the richest athletes in the world. Just like LeBron James born in the same day as him. 1230 1984. And again, these guys care about their money a lot more than Michael Jordan cared about his charisma. Would you say that Tiger Woods is one of the best golf players in here? Ones and 11s are the same. Ones and 11s are the athletes. Ones and 11s are the athletes. Now we're what now? Ones. So one of the there's not just one a prime number. I'm like, I'm trying to get the math here. The math is the math is very simple people who are athletes athletes start with a is the first letter. By the way, the English language is collected in numerology. It's called your Montreal or letter ology. So if you go down the list people who are ones actually are really good athletes and people who are 11s, we can go down the list and you'll see nothing but ones and 11s pretty much with all the we'll actually see other things besides one. So that's the main you're that's the main thing. You're going to say yes. No, it isn't actually and actually it is. In fact, they just did a study where they looked at billionaires in China under their different astrological signs and they've actually found. I don't do astrological signs. Okay. Well, no, these are year of the snake year of the rat. Okay, those astrological signs Chinese astrology and in doing so they found that like actually the ones that were supposed to be the poorest that was the most common astrological signs for Chinese billionaires. Yeah, I can't comment on their people's when you but when you do anything like the University of Cambridge did multiple studies on this and found that like you made the statement before that Geminis are more likely to suffer from mental disorder. There is no evidence to support this whatsoever. There have been numerous studies to do this. There's one study where they did 10,000 men who re and who enlisted in the US Marine Corps and try to see if their astrological signs lined up with Mars. They lined up with Venus more often than Mars. I don't do that astrology. That's what I'm trying to tell you. You're trying to tell me about that chick stuff. I don't do that. Again, one more time. I heard you on another show. Yes, sit there and talk about Gemini. You talked about Aquarius and you talked about that is not what I'm known for. I am known for Chinese astrology and I'm known for numerology. You might be trying to bring other stuff into it. No, I'm not. I'm not you. I don't even teach that stuff. I got you. But you you might want to ask Cotep Jesus to take that video down because there's no reason to because you did you did talk about what's called Greco Roman astrology. I talked about on numerous cases or Vedic astrology. Have you ever talked about ballet dancers? Probably not. No, you've never in your life one time mentioned ballet dancers. What's her name? Jenna Jameson used to be a ballet dancer. Okay, so you probably mentioned it sometime. Does that make you? Does that make you? You know who I'm talking about. There's a ballet dancer. There you go. Good stuff with the car thief, right? Anyways, what I'm basically trying to say is just because you say something once doesn't mean you're an expert on the subject. Okay, I brought up Western astrology. I don't even teach that stuff. I teach Chinese astrology and we can go into that if you want to. I can bring up the fact that John Jones born 1987 the year of the cat won his first UFC title in 2011 the cat year in the cat's enemy year the rooster. He got stripped of the title in 2017. And then again in 2013 the year of the cat. He becomes a champion. I got a question. I'm the newbie here. I'm trying to parse out like how you come to these conclusions. So like for instance, I'm looking at Tiger Woods December 30th. I 30th Rio 1975 1 975. What's his number? Okay, so you do 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 0 is 6 1 975 is 22 22 and 6 is 28 then you reduce 2 and 8 is 10 1 and 0 and 0. So he's a one-life path. Why do you reduce because you have to come down to the do you reduce with other only only numbers you don't reduce with our master numbers? Because master numbers are in a different way. I'll give you an example. I'm still curious is like how do you come to the conclusion that one number is like because just think of it this way 11 22 33 everything that's doubled up is called a master number for a reason. I'll give you an example Vladimir Lenin who started the Soviet Union was born on the 22nd. The Soviet Union came to power in 1922 because he's the one who let it George Washington born in the 22nd helped start in America. People who are born in the 22nd are master builders. You're into sports. Who's arguably the best coach in NFL history? I've heard you say this before Bill Parcells because he was the exactly exactly check one more. But yeah, okay. So we can say that Bill Parcells coaching tree and again extends to Bill Belichick's coaching tree is probably the most extensive in the NFL. He is born on the 22nd. So what basically I'm trying to say is people born with certain on certain dates have certain abilities. And if you actually use this as a psychological method, you'll actually see that people have certain abilities. For instance, if you're born in the first, you're good at arguing. If you're born in the fifth, you're good at talking to the ladies when you're born Michael the fifth. I see. Here we go. Here we go. Not good. So so so again, we are going to bring up examples of this stuff. Not the stuff. I don't talk about Mike. Did you have another question? No, I was just going to say I'm still confused as to what would make a one more powerful than like a nine. What are what are nines? Okay, for instance, because what I'm trying to get at is if you're going to say that a one is different than a two to three, four, not all the way. Okay, let me get to a nine. Let me give some examples. Then people who are ones are leaders. Even women who are ones have leadership abilities. Sheryl Sandberg CFO of Facebook. So people who have one energy. I don't know if I listen, listen, listen, listen, but go at 90, 80, 85% of women have no leadership abilities, but the women who are born in the first 10th 1928 because they have the male energy. One is male energy. They have those leadership abilities. Napoleon was a one-life path. He was a leader people who are born in the second are good at writing. Don't you have a best-selling book? I've got a few. I sure also say people born on the second are more feminine. That's what I don't think they can be. They can be but the problem is like these are the what you're saying is you have this idea. That like, well, it's not an exact science and sometimes I can be wrong. But you actually want this taught in schools when we have a bunch of edgy uneducated people who don't understand science technology engineering and mathematics. You want people in schools to learn numerology 100% and astrology when it's not even exact. So it's not even a science because you don't know it actually is a science because in science what you're going to do is try to disprove your own hypothesis and you don't you cherry-pick certain people's birthdays that happen to fit with whatever you're doing. If we were to take a population-wide survey, which I can show you 13 of them that is not possible because there's 7 or 8 billion people on the planet. The only thing is possible is we can take the people at the top that everyone knows about and show examples with them. It's not the only no. No, that's the only thing we can do. How are we going to measure 8 billion people on the planet? You can measure exactly. You can measure you can measure the population United States. I can tell you I can tell you 28th number of wealth. I can tell you the richest man in the world as Elon Musk and he's born on the 28th. I can say the guy who used to be the richest man in the world before must took over was Bill Gates born on 28th. I can stay Steve Jobs born 224 1955 2 2 4 5 is a 28. Hold on. He started Apple on 4-1 1976 adds up to 28. You're laughing but he's a billionaire using this stuff. Yeah, but that's the fact you're laughing but he's a billionaire using this information. He wasn't using this information. He did not tell me when he was born. No, no, he actually did. He did not use the information of when he was born to build Apple. How do you know that he used Steve Wozniak to help him build? No Steve Steve Steve and the Wazniak created the Apple computers, right? He actually created the brand. Well, I know I agree with that. But that this one number is Steve Wozniak 7 genius genius starts with G. Jesus letter. But again, if we were to do that if we were to go through and look at people born on the 7th and test the IQ. Oh, yeah. Oh, yes. You will if you go on it. Yes, you will because I actually talk to teachers and they tell me their students born in 7th. It's not a scientific survey 5th. It's not scientific at all. That's how it's not scientific. It's scientific. What would you have to do is you'd have to have a population level study of like maybe 60,000 people and you would test people not born in the 7th. You would test all the other dates versus the 7th and you would find some sort of positive correlation. There's no positive correlation whatsoever between somebody born in the 7th and their IQ. None zero. There is no pot. One more time. There is no positive correlation between billionaires and people born on the 28th. Absolutely not. Then why is the richest man in the world born on the 28th explain that because you don't because you don't understand science blame because because you don't understand. One out of 30 one out of 30 is 3% or one out of 30 is 3% doesn't even Bill Gates is the guy who used to be the richest guy in the world doesn't even count as why he doesn't count because he doesn't he doesn't count as even 1% of the billionaires on this planet. That's the problem the rich and it's seven the normal look it up look it up David. I believe I believe seven either know three of the richest seven people in the world are born on 28th. Look it up again the normal distribution of billionaires. We're not going to find that most of them were born on the 20 you actually will you will not you actually will not. Tell me tell me that we will not tell me why I'm going to put a little me why my sport on the 28th is the richest man in the world and tell me why again. He's the richest man in the world because and who do you replace and who did he replace again Bill Gates last century? The guy richest guy in the world born on the 28th. This doesn't prove anything. How does not prove it when the richest guy in the world is this decade last decade switches, but they're still born on 20th. Let's do some math. Let's do some probability. Wait, wait, wait. Let me let me let me direct traffic here. Okay. So first off the idea is correlation and causation is the correlation the causation or the causation correlation is like, how do you find out in a science with the scientific method that what you're saying because what you're arguing for at this point is really that correlation is causation. So look at all these these coincidences here. That's what you've done. Well, no, here's the thing is okay. So coincidence, whatever we want to call them. You're looking at a series of incidents, right that all coincide. Okay. So if you're going to say that so-and-so is born on the 28th, this guy's born on the 28th Tiger Woods. I don't know how you have the math works out. If you're looking at these little statistics or these stats here with these with these individual people, what you're saying is there's a predictable framework amongst all of this. So what would happen is if somebody was born today and they happen to be on the 28th, then the if we track that person that person is destined to some sort of greatness or something like that. So what I'm asking is how what is the process? What is the scientific measurable testable experimental process that says if I watch this kid who was just born today on April 28th or coming up pretty soon, right? That kid is going to be the next billionaire. What's the process to figure that out? Let me say this number one. I will post something on Twitter after I'm done with the show that will prove that 28th are the richest people in the world. Now, does that mean everyone born on 28th is going to be rich? No, no. What? What? Hold on. Hold on. There is. So there's no. It's a there's not even a distribution that even shows they're even 1% wealthier. There is none. There have been multiple studies on this. There is no distribution that shows that people born on the 28th or any wealthier or people born in the 7th hour. So that's what you said. That's what you said. Irrefutable, but but unassailable. When you look at the actual richest people in the world or the smartest people in the world, you will see like a for instance, what's his name? He freaking died. Steve Hawking. Stephen Hawking was a seven life pack. Again, most people. He wasn't born on the 7th. He was 1 8 1942. 1 8 1 9 4. You're just I know I'm not. I said, but you are and that is not scientific. This is not again. You're not letting me speak. Okay. I said there's a two ways to do it. If you're a seven, if you're a three, if you're a five, either born, if you're a five-way path, for instance, you're born on the 5th 14th. One in four is 523rd or your total number adds up to five. Those are if the total number adds up to five. It's called a life path. If you're born on a certain day, that's the day number you're born on. So again, this is all confusing the people. I understand that but here's the whole point. If you guys want examples of this people who are born in the 5th 14th 23rd are the most attractive people in the world. Go on Facebook put in those dates and you'll see it with yourself. It's very simple. See that's the thing about numerology. I always wondered why some people were rich now. I understand why they're born on 28th or their eighth. I always want to understand why some people were actually, you know, really funny. Well people born on the 3rd 12th 21st or 30th are the funny ones. Chris Rock, Roseanne Barr. When you look at things from an everyday perspective and you start looking at it through these lenses of an understanding how numerology and astrology works. You start looking at the world in a completely different way. Let me just say a few things. Michael Jordan born 217 1963 11 life paths mentored Kobe Bryant. Kobe Bryant born to 823 1978 mentored Kyrie Irving Kyrie born 323 1992 11 11 11. Here's the point and it couldn't be that they all had really great now. They're all great athletes in their 11th. The point is people with certain numbers gravitate towards each other. Now, let's talk about you. What's your day my friend? What's your birthday birthday April 2nd 1968 April 2nd 1968 4 2 1 9 3 8 adds up to 33 and 0 68. Now, if you're you're you're don't age me too. Okay, my bad. You're basically a three-life path in numerology. What's your birthday October 5th 1977? Okay."}
