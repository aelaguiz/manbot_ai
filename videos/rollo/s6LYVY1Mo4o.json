I apologize in advance. This is not the show I wanted to do. This is the show I had to do. I knew eventually it was going to come to this. I knew eventually we were going to come full circle. Congratulations, we have completed the circuit. You know the taits are going to jail when the Petersons are comfortable talking about the taits. It's almost like everybody's got to get their last digs in. It's going to be inevitable. Yeah, we're going to talk about that today. But I have to point out a few other things here. Whenever I give you red meat, there's always a nutritious prize inside. Yes, it's like when you give your dog a pill and it won't take the pill, you just have to plug it into some cheese. Welcome to the cheese. Soda bourbon. Bourbon soda? That can be cut. Don't need to tell anybody I said soda bourbon. But I cannot do TikTok reaction videos dead sober or my face is just going to be the entire time. How is your current relationship with God? That's an intense question. I don't know. I think it's good. I think there's more that I could be doing. I was reading the Bible more a year ago and then since my sleep schedule kind of went off track, I stopped waking up as early and then I stopped reading the Bible in the morning so I should work on that because I did feel better reading the Bible more. Seems weird. I know to all you people who aren't Christian that sounds strange. It was strange to me too. It's still strange to me. I don't know how it works exactly but it makes me feel better. I'm trying to go with the flow so if things don't work out that I want to work out, I'm thinking well maybe that's not meant to be. Maybe God doesn't want that for me. So I've been trying to operate like that and it's been good for me I think because I like to exert a level of control over everything that isn't good for me or the things around me and so I've let that go a little bit. How is your current relationship with God? That's an intense question. Which is why people like Andrew Tate popped up and people like my dad. And I'm not a great admirer of Demographic evidence suggests that women have become increasingly unhappy since the early 1960s. So you know cross-sectional studies continually conducted year after year show precisely that and it could easily be because they've you know they're taking on more and more responsibility. You think well you have a career and it's fulfilling and all of that but it's not just fulfilling. It's stressful and difficult and if you have a career and a family especially if you're a single mother well good luck to you man. You run off your feet non-stop and you're a target for every predatory male in the neighborhood. It's not a pleasant mode of existence and it's not one I would recommend for people even though there are many single mothers who do you know heroic work doing the best they can for their families but they're completely overwhelmed. You can't work and have kids and be single. How the hell could you do that? It's two full-time jobs at least and that's only if you have one kid. How do you feel? Disgusted with everybody who follows me. Are you joking? You guys say bagel and tomato too? No one says bagel. I'm literally going to take your... A little freaking out about me posting about asking for a babysitter online. I talk to these people. I'm not a moron. I don't particularly like agencies. I don't like the people that agencies send over. I find that the people I found off of Instagram are really kind individuals once I find somebody. So you guys should calm down. Order let's say and you make an advance on a woman the feminine, you make an advance on the feminine then we'll say archetypally and you're rejected then that interjects a tremendous amount of chaos into your existence. The chaos that's attendant on such a fundamental rejection. That rejection may require a total rethinking of the total rethinking of the order because the fundamental purpose of the order at least as it's manifested by men the masculine is to be attractive to the feminine and so if that's not working then the order needs to be restructured and so how would you symbolize what it is that calls for order to be reordered if you wouldn't symbolize it as chaos? Emotion! And all the women are rejecting you. Who's got the problem? It's not all the women. That's a bad road to go down. If all the women are rejecting you, it's you. We both agree on this but why is enforced monogamy the solution for people that are involuntary celibates? Well it's the solution to the it's the solution to the relationship between men and women fundamentally is monogamous social norms. If these men are unattractive if these men are unattractive to women I don't mean just physically unattractive I mean women aren't seeking them as mates. They need to become men. That's the solution. And we both agree on this. But they need to do that in a society where monogamy is the social norm. But isn't it the social norm anyway? Well, that was partly my point although to the degree that we deviate from that we tilt towards a more violent society. It's not the cow. Beauty and the Beast and I do think that's the best Disney movie ever made was that it's a real female hero myth. The woman beauty is beautiful so she's high up in the female dominance hierarchy but she's witty and well read and intelligent and adventurous and brave and courageous and truthful all of that and she doesn't fall for Gaston the psychopathic persona and young women are much more likely to fall for men like that in a way than women who are slightly more what would you say? Mature. Wiser. So they'll fall for dark triad men and that's partly how psychopathy propagates itself across the generations. They can be enticed by psychopathic personas but she prefers the Beast. It's like well the Beast is the adventure. It's like well it's this terrible man he's rough, he's unhued but he's got potential. And that's what really attracts her and she wants someone who can guard the walls make a safe haven for the children but who's generous enough to who's productive enough to be useful and generous enough to share and so she civilizes him. I hesitate to talk about Andrew Cate because I don't know that much about him you know but I'll tell you what I know and what I think and people can take it for what it's worth. First question is why is he so popular and the answer is well if you have to choose between being depressed and anxious and laying down stairs and covering yourself with cheeto dust and looking at pornography and being timid and never going out or you know listening to someone like Andrew Cate who says like get the hell out there and take the world like that's better. That's the shadow right speaking in some ways right like if you're naive and timid and anxious and intimidated and useless and resentful there's going to be a bit of a monster that needs to call to you to say gird up your loins and get the hell out there in the world and so it's better to be a monster than a rabbit in some ways right or at least there's some utility in the more monstrous predatory path that isn't there in the pathetic rabbit path and that's partly because if you are a pathetic rabbit you're going to become a predator anyways you're just going to become a dark backdoor backbiting gossip monger resentful tape things because for some reason people think that there's something there and there's not like we were chatting on social media for a while he the things he does for business I just don't care I don't care about the drama he was kind of interesting to go to he was like I'll buy you a ticket to come out and say hi and that's literally what we did. We went out and he bought me a steak and he was a really interesting person he's way more of a douche bag on socials than he is in person and that was it that's the drama what he does for business I just don't really care but I'm not going to do business with him and I'm certainly not interested in him romantically I'm certainly not interested in him romantically oh boy you know it's been how long has it been now it's almost two years gosh good times man really good times how are we all doing today today's going to be a good one today's going to be a very good one coming in hot coming in hot yes I do have a new before we get started today I needed to also point out if you haven't seen it already I tagged it up on the I have my chat I've got a brand new monitor right here just dedicated just for the chat it's like one of those coding monitors that you turn on the end so yeah today I'm going to have to initiate a new rule I'm going to I'll still read super chats no problem I'm just going to stick to like $20 and above because I was going over a lot like Glenn and I were going over a lot of my old videos and it's like you know things when I'm going for like two three four five let me quit lying five hours a lot of the times is because I'm reading like $1 super chats and I've always wanted I've always prided myself on like reading every single damn super chat and even if it is still like a $5 one it's like really really interesting I still might read it but I have to institute this because it's just for just for logistics alone you want to know why I'm was it the last time I was the last time of the time before that I think I was like pushing like five hours and 20 minutes guys I gotta stop the insanity I really do I have to do something and people I've always avoided that because like I don't want it to seem like oh rolls on the take you just want your money like well I mean I this is a live stream and that's how things work but man you want things to be a little bit more concise then that's just basically what I have to do I know there's other streams that all will only read you at a hundred dollars or higher but I think I'm being I think I've got a pretty happy medium right there and I'm always trying to be cool with you guys and by the way if I ever do well actually if I ever when I do my next AMA my ask me anything or Q&A or something like that I'll read everything so just throwing that out there just make sure that you guys don't think that oh my god the changes come on the take I love that man I'm like my favorite thing is when I get guys who are going to say well Rolo you only go on these shows so you can promote your books yeah see look here's the first ones in already thank you very much you'll still get the good you'll still get the good stuff here you'll still get one of these I'll still give you sound drops I'll take you out what is Tom like a style you know I love doing that man that's I like the sound drops I'll tell you what's funny is the sound drop people when I was on access Vegas on Thursday we had this one girl on who was a professional wrestler she was on the far end of the table so she's like directly opposite me and every time I throw in a new sound drop she would I'd stop her in the middle because she would just be laughing too hard but yeah it was pretty fun if you haven't seen last week's access Vegas we did it on Thursday we got another one coming up we're doing one damn near every week now with the exception of the middle of October so here's the dates the dates are going to be the sixth and that's a Friday and the reason we're doing it Friday is because Mike Sartain's birthday is the fourth and the fifth he's so he's so bi bitching and he's the dark lord of Vegas that he gets two birthdays so there oh shut the fuck up thank you very much okay bye bye wait see I even have a sound drop for idiot trolls but so he's got it his birthday coming up and I'm not going to give away the I'm not going to give away the surprise you're going to have to watch my Instagram this Thursday which will be October 5th if you want to see what was what's really going on and yes I have to dress up for this and yes well here I'll just give you this part of it whenever Mike has a birthday all the girls that he knows like all the girls that he promotes and pushes and does the you know the swimsuit USA and paradise challenge and our show and everything else they all get together they collab together in a WhatsApp chat and they come up with a theme last year's theme was like cheerleaders and this is the first time I was even introduced to this because I think I've done like two shows with him before all this happened and we went out to Zouk that night it was the first time I ever went to Zouk which is a very very nice club in resort world in Vegas and so we were out there and I hear all the sudden right around the corner come like about 20-30 girls in like cheerleader outfits so it's just it was like wow but now I'm in on it I'm sorry I'm the only guy that is in on it because we're partners in the you know he's one of my you know Mike is one of my best friends I will say that he's actually one of my best friends anything worth doing is worth doing for money if you pay me thank you Paul Paul also is going to be doing his are you guys actually going to beat each other to a pulp this week probably he's supposed to be professional wrestling we'll see what we can do let's see what we can do for you guys I tell you I everybody knows that I'm in Vegas now and so everybody wants a piece we're going to get into Michaela Peterson today I wanted to sort of catch up with, catching up with the Petersons. It's almost like Ozzy Osbourne, catching up with the Osbournes. You know, it's almost like a reality TV show at this stage. But I thought this was interesting and it was funny as hell because people kept asking me, hey, what happened to Michaela? Like, where has she been? And I didn't even know, because I don't give two shits about this. I've been like dealing with Lauren Southern and all that other crap, right? And so I'm trying to stay, I'm trying to keep my head down. I know what's coming for the 2024 election cycle. And by the way, everything I'm about to get into today is also very relative to the 2024 election cycle. So keep that in mind as we progress today, because all the crap that I got into last week, and I don't know if you guys have seen, thank you very much for that. I need, God, I gotta get a dog. I gotta get. Hello there children, how's it going? Ned thanks you too. Keeping my boy off the OnlyFans one super chat at a time. Torsha. What's this? There you go. Not talking Dr. Phil, worrying about his hair. Yeah, yeah. I'm not worrying about my hair, trust me. Cause this is actually real hair. I guess it doesn't pull off. It's not like it's not a cap or anything. And by the way, I was just, people just, okay, God damn. I feel like I gotta give you guys like updates in the beginning of the shows, because I know damn well, you're not gonna listen to like once we get past the second hour. But the, some more updates today. I actually posted a few pictures of myself. Like I did a half back. I pulled my hair back every now and then I'll go without a beanie just to like throw people off. Throw people off the scent. Thank you very much. Hello, Rola. We are Rational Pack in Turkey are following you, Dr. Redpill. Oh, by the way, I need to talk to Dr. Redpill. I know he's coming out in November and I want to hit him up and see if I can get him to Vegas or else. If I can't, then I'm gonna go to Philadelphia or whatever the hell he is. Cause I'm gonna do something with Dr. Redpill when he comes out. I have decided. Thank you very much for your participation. Thank you for your support. I love each and every one of you dearly. Another one. Jeez, you guys are killing me today. All right, I will get to these. I promise you. Tate is the one of the rare guys that's not only successful and intelligent, but he's also a pookie and Michaela loves that. You know what? We're holding, I'm holding onto that one. That's too good. Hold, you know, here you get one of these for that. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. And I need to clarify some things. I haven't done it. I haven't done a show on Tate in quite some time. And this is kind of like, I'm still not doing one on this one, but I kind of have to a little bit. So I'll dig into it. I've been kind of like holding my, holding my ground on Tate right now. I'm sort of Tate agnostic at this stage just to see what happens, to see where the cards fall. So, and yes, before you go and throw shit at me, yes, I'm aware of sartorial shooter and stupid ass sneakos crap. And I'll be happy to address that later on, maybe towards the end of the show today. But we're not gonna get into that today. Today's really more about why is it that Michaela Peterson has decided to now come forward and start talking about the Tates? Well, I'll tell you why. It's because a guy like Tucker Carlson interviewed the Tates. It's why, it's because a guy like, oh, I don't know, Piers Morgan has like what, interviewed him what, four times? He's been on Pearl once or twice, I think. In fact, Pearl has the dubious honor of having him as the last interview before he got arrested. And let's see what else. Yeah, so, oh, and then, oh, well, then you got Candace Owens, of course. And I brought this up in my, by the way, there is a midweek video. I really laid the hammer down on, I was, I'm sorry, I was a little heated in that one. I actually, I shouldn't even apologize for that, but like, I'll tell you, I was, it was righteous anger. So I threw some grenades at Matt Walsh and I regret nothing. I don't think they're ever gonna, they're never gonna take the, they're never gonna take the challenge. Another, there's another, that's another episode, by the way, or that's another announcement, I guess. I've been announcing this for almost a year now, from November of last year to right about now, well, till now, if you want to debate Rolla Tomasi, if you've got a bone to pick, if you got the chip on your shoulder, you wanna call me a fucking asshole to my face, you are more than welcome to come to Vegas and do so live in person across the table from me and tell me why I'm wrong. And I'll be happy to explain to you why you are mistaken. The only two people who have in this, in one year of that challenge being laid on the table, only two people have taken that up. One was Sergio Solis from Purple Pill Podcast, which I'm, you know, I have to give him props, you know, I say what you want to about Sergio, but like he had the balls to come out and do it. And Gary, the numbers guy, Gary, Gary Ginsberg, or what's Grinberg or Greenberg, how do I say your name Gary? I'm sorry, I butchered it. Anyways, GG33, right? Gary, the numbers guy, he took the challenge and came out and talked to me and Mike Sarte, actually he wanted more of a piece of Mike than me, actually, but still those are the only guys that decided that they wanted to come out. So where are you at guys? Especially guys who like have really hardcore, hard-ass takes like Matt Walsh, let me tell you why you Red Pill guys are anti-American, blah, blah, blah, blah. You're like just shit and diarrhea, just blowing out his mouth, knows nothing about what he's talking about. And three shows, well, actually technically four, but three shows later, let's call it four, okay? Because this was kind of before, but like in August, I go and I do the interview with James Sexton, the divorce attorney who did Soft White Underbelly. And by the way, just did Lex Friedman's show for about three and a half hours. He told me it was about five or six because they chop out parts and everything. And guess who's talking about him now too? Joe Rogan, I'll tell you how that happened here in a minute. I talked to him in August, we're talking about divorce, we're talking about marriage and Lord in heaven above, I really wish I would have had this information. I apologize profusely, Jim, for not having like answered your emails or getting back to you sooner because I would have loved to have Jim's information and his knowledge base when I was going head to head with Hafiz or Ruslan or God knows whoever else, right? Or hell, even Destiny, at least parts of that debate that he says that I didn't do anything on, except for the parts that I did something on, right? So I would very much have loved to have had Jim's like, you know, picked his brain and had his knowledge base before I launched into those things. So along comes Grifter Pearl and decides to, you know, essentially reheat my vasectomy tweet. That didn't play as well as her handler's thoughts. And so now she's like decided that she wants to jump on board with the divorce this and divorce that because she, I tell you, I will give her one thing, okay? Here's the thing is like either she or she and her people really keep their finger on the pulse of what's going on right now. And so when, was it Jeremy Boring from the Daily Wire or Matt Walsh from the Daily Wire or Ben Shapiro from the Daily Wire or Michael Knowles from the Daily Wire or Candace Owens from the Daily Wire or even Andrew Klavan from the Daily Wire, old ass Andrew. And I love Andrew, but he's probably the one dude I really like on Daily Wire. And I think what's really fascinating is how quickly, I mean, just like lickety split, man. I mean, like Johnny on the spot, she's just like whips out the next fire bomb about marriage and divorce and guys shouldn't marry. And, you know, it's a racket about, and the only conclusion I can draw is that she has some sort of contractual arrangement or she is an employee or is she is a shill or whatever. Do I have a fucking pay stub from Daily Wire to show you that she's on the take? No, I don't. But all I can do is point out the fact that she's the only one that anyone on Daily Wire ever quotes not me, not anyone else. They wouldn't even say Jim Sexton's name and he was on Lex, fucking Friedman. It was some divorce, some alleged divorce attorney. We don't know who the fuck he is. But here's this Pearl girl who's talking about this stuff. Get the fuck out of here. Don't take, like who's, I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. Like who is not seeing this shit, right? So anyways, well, Rollo doesn't have any proof. I even said that in the video. I said, I don't have any proof. I don't have like a pay stub or anything like that. I don't have a bank deposit or what is it? Electronic transfer of funds. Of course not. All I could do is look at what's going on. You should do, Jesus Christ. It's right in front of your face. But anyway, so I'm going through this stuff with Jim Sexton, that was in August. Then of course we did the rule zero thing right after. Which of course Matt Walsh decided to pile on too. Then I went and did last week's show on Matt Walsh once again and sort of ripped him a new one. And then finally, just because of a response to response to response, it's like playing Inception. The Inception is like probably back in August somewhere. And I'm at the lowest part of the Inception here. And now we've finally gone from, oh, here's a video of a reaction of a video, which is a reaction to this video, who was reacting to this video. And it's like down, down, down, down, down, down, down until you get the bottom of the Inception. That's basically what my YouTube career has become when I do red meat videos anyways, which is playing some sort of online 3D, 4D chess. And it's really just like, well, what's at the bottom? What's the most bottom most chess board look like? It's like insanity. And then dealing with like guys who want to say, who really love Daily YRO. I can't believe you're punching right, Rolo. You're supposed to be a conservative. I am? I'm not a liberal. I am not a conservative. I don't know what the fuck I am. Let's talk about it base by base, but that's never been what I've been about. So anyways, we get into that. And now, of course, I've got what Michael Knowles says. Well, we would love to have you on here for a debate. Just sign this NDA. No, wrong. I signed an NDA for Dr. Phil and I am regretting it to this day still because I have yet to do the Dr. Phil breakdown episode. In fact, I almost got in trouble for doing the one I did immediately after the shooting last November. So if you want to see, well, how come Rolo doesn't do anything and how come people don't take him seriously? I did two fucking shows with Dr. Phil for fuck's sake. Like go look at that. God, I have more than a man can take. Yeah. So anyways, and now, so here we are and Michael Knowles wants me to come out and do his show. I'm probably going to politely decline. If he wants to come out to Vegas, I'll be happy to talk to him like a fucking man. I'll be glad to do exactly what we do on Access Vegas. You come to Vegas. We can restream to my account live with you guys and your wonderful $40, $20 Super Chats. And we'll take questions from the audience and I will run the table with you. I will table you in the first 30 minutes. Get me, you come out here and face me and Jim Sexton. We'll do it in 20 minutes. Cause you, like the problem is, is these guys don't have a leg to stand on and they know they don't. That's why they're never going to, that's why it's never going to happen. You say, oh, we're going to have this debate. We're going to have this big come to Jesus, you know, big round table discussion about marriage and conservatism and this. And I'll tell you the only one who has the balls and the sack to do that is Andrew Wilson, who, by the way, I really like. And I think we probably agree on maybe 80, 85% of stuff. Now I'm, he's very much a quote unquote ortho bro, but at least he's like, you can actually have a conversation with him. But I'll tell you right now, Andrew Wilson has more ball, has more ass in his britches than fricking Michael Knowles or Matt Walsh or Jeremy Boring or anyone else at Daily Wire that has yet to even, you know, acknowledge any of this shit. They won't even, they won't even say my name. Won't even say my name. That's the only thing I can think of. Because Pearl's easy. She's low hanging fruit. Honestly, I think she's probably controlled opposition for controlled opposition, but that's me. All right. So there's that. And yeah, and you can tell her I said that. Thanks, bye. Send that one off. And I know you will. I know I'll hear it. I know I'll hear it back very soon. So thank you very much. So today we're going to dig into McCain. We're going to dig out McKayla Peterson. The reason I started with nothing but like McKayla Peterson intro videos today was simply because I wanted to give you sort of a timeline. Last time I had locked horns with McKayla Peterson was in, let's see, well, technically it was the last part of November of 2021. And then really into December of 2021 as well. And she pulled exactly what I would now come to expect from people like Michael Knowles and the rest of these people. And even Andrew Tate has been on record as saying exactly what I'm going to say here in a moment, which is most people don't care about truth, including McKayla Peterson. She has no, Jordan Peterson. They don't care about truth. They care about content. They care about clicks. They care about engagement. They care about, and I'm not saying I don't myself. I care quite a bit about that. But as I said before, I was joking around this when I was doing the intro for today's show. I was talking to my wife today. I was saying, you know what? I hate doing these red meat shows because everybody thinks that they'll see this one show and they'll think, oh, that's all Rollo's about. And I'm like, no, that's not what I'm about. But sometimes I got to do them. And so what I was saying is like, it's almost like when you have to take, like your dog has to take medicine and you can't get the dog to take the medicine because it tastes like shit, right? So what do you do? You like take the pill and you push it in a piece of cheese and you give the dog the piece of cheese and it eats it up, right? So it gets what's good for it inside the cheese, but there has to be cheese around it. So welcome to the cheese. This is the cheese, but I'm gonna try to give you some good information, some nuts and bolts stuff along the way here. So whenever I do red meat videos, I just want, this is my standard caveat is I'm not doing this just to be, oh, gossipy or salacious or whatever everything else. It's gonna be, sorry, there's no way around that. But I am going to try to do my level best to ensure that you guys get something more than just like, oh, I can't believe it. Give me more meat, Rollo. Give me more cheese, dad. You have to pay the cheese tax. I'm not gonna just give you nachos with just cheese on them. I'm gonna give you nachos with like meat and cheese and jalapenos and cilantro. Do you guys like cilantro?"}
