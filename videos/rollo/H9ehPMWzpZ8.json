Hey, welcome back guys. We're really glad to have you here for Access Vegas. I'm your special guest host, yeah, I'm your special guest host today. I'm Mia Khalifa with my co-host Lana Rhodes. Get ready. Don't date older men. We can't get our shit right together, guys, sorry. You told every one of these girls to keep their volume down. And I did, I turned it all the way down. I don't understand what's wrong, it's my phone. Thank you, Steve Apple. All right, here we go, guys. From our guest, we're going to go ahead and get to our guest. She is from Albuquerque, New Mexico. She's a realtor, a model, and she manages a dental office. It's Christina. How you doing, Christina? You doing good? I've been well. I love having normal people on here. Closer to the mic, please. Normal people. I've been really well. Good, good to have normal people. She's from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She has a golfing caddy business, and she has the Football Barbie podcast. This is Gemini Barbie. How you doing, Gemini? Good, how are you guys doing today? Terrific. Awesome. She got that, heard the Philly in you. Yeah, just a little bit. When I say water, it really comes out. Water. She's from San Diego, California. She is an atmosphere model, and she knows all the words to every Cardi B song. This is Rita. Rita. Rita like margarita. There you go, Rita like margarita. That's right. She's from Frog Level, Arkansas, by way of Houston, Texas, by way of Las Vegas, Nevada. She's a Swimsuit USA world finalist and a world-class bartender. This is Miss Kylie McGahey. Hi. How you doing? Good. Awesome. And she's also a DJ from Newport Beach. It's Ally Cat. What's going on, DJ? Hey, hey. Nice to see you. She's from East Los Angeles. East LA. You can spell her name anal backwards. That's her name. She's a comedian. She has a podcast called Laughing With Lana. This is Lana. How you doing, Lana? Hi. What's going on? There's a penis on my show. Yes. We have been demonetized. There you go. You're welcome. Awesome. And from Chattanooga, Tennessee, now living in Sarasota. She just travels around the world, and she just models. It is Maya. How you doing, Maya? I'm doing great. How are you? You're also a Swimsuit USA world finalist, too, right? I was. Very good. Awesome. Nice. All right, so we have everybody here. We have Rolo Tomasi. Have you tweeted anything that's gotten you a deep shot recently? No, I have not tweeted anything super controversial. Although, I did do another list of things that make for a high-value woman, because apparently all the trad fem girls are coming out of the woodwork right now. And apparently, you have to be a pastor. You have to have had three children. You have to have divorced your husband. And you have to also be working on OnlyFans and or porn right now. So apparently, those are high-quality women right now. Like Christianity and porn at the same time. Yeah, I didn't quite hit the same as I did when Matt Walsh and Ben Shapiro were retweeting my other one. But it is what it is. Nice. Nice. So this whole week has been crazy. So it's funny that you say porn for Jesus. So a couple of weeks ago, we had Courtney Tilla on. And she did an interview where she talked about that she was doing porn and that God had directed her to do porn. Now, let's put a couple things in context. Number one, she said, I am a porn star, but I just film with my husband. And number two, she never said anything about God telling her to do porn or anything like that or being a Christian. So what happened was all over the news, it says Christian woman claims God told her to be a porn star. It goes incredibly viral. And then it just reminds you once again that the news is just there to entertain you, to trap you, and to manipulate you and has absolutely no bearing in reality whatsoever. So it's just interesting when you say Jesus for porn. And we are canceled. We are absolutely demonetized. We are demonetized. Did you have a list of any questions? Well, first I've got to start off with, like, we've got to do the basics here. So I already know how old you are. Because everybody is going to ask me this anyway. So we might as well go around. I need to get, like, everyone's age and your current occupation, I guess. We already went through our current occupation. And your status, single date. Relationship status. Oh, no. Sorry. I have to do it this time. We need to know highest level of education for this theme today. Perfect. We're going over demographics. Let's start right here with Ms. Kylie McGahey. I am 21. I'm dating Michael Sartain. What? No. What? Why am I just pointing out? Blasphemy. And I'm currently still doing school. My name is Rita. Well, you know that. But I'm 30 years old. And I did two years of college. Community college? Yes. Regular college? Community college. Okay. I'm Gemini. I just turned 33 a week ago. And I have a master's in public administration and a bachelor's in political science. From where? I'm from PA. So I went to Westchester University. So I did six years of college. Nice. Excellent. Excellent. Rita, what's your dating status? Your relationship status? Oh, I'm single. Single. And sorry, single as well. Yeah, we're going to be talking a lot about that. All right. I think I know what to expect from you. But go ahead. All right. So my name is Christina. I'm a realtor. I finished some college. A realtor. I have a 19-year-old daughter. But I just started seeing somebody. Yay. I'm 34. There you go. I'll be 35 this year. So I'm almost there. Kat? Yep. I'm Kat. I am 27. Just turned. I'm in a new relationship. Okay. Does he know about it? He knows. Good. That's important. It's Vegas. Am I wrong? Am I wrong? I'm not wrong. He knows. He knows. How come he's not on your Instagram yet? Fuck that. Are you going to do soft launch? Yes, I know you're going to do soft launch. I didn't want to jinx it, so I didn't put him on. Yeah, okay. And I went to Cal State Fullerton. I also went to Orange County School of the Arts for commercial and instrumental music. Nice. Do you have a degree in any of those? I did not graduate. I did not graduate. I did not graduate. I did not graduate. I did not graduate. I did not graduate. I did not graduate. I did not graduate. I did not graduate. I did not graduate. I did not graduate. I did not graduate. I did not graduate. I did not graduate. I really did not graduate at Cal State. I dropped out. Just, how long did you spend there? I think it was just a year. Okay. Maybe two. Because I'm trying to establish that we don't have dumb bitches on the show. But we have very intelligent women on our show. Well, I dropped out of school because I realized I was making more money without a degree. Yeah. Okay. So, pragmatism stepped in. That's why most of the men have dropped out. Awesome. Lana, what's going on here? I am 33, I'm in a relationship with my little dick here. And I- That's little? And the chat, they're like, that's little? That's what they're saying in the chat. I'm like, that's my dick. That's average. Oh, she's- Oh, God. No, I'm not hating. But- Wah, wah. No, I am single. I like being single. I'm 33 and I have gone to school, I went to school for, I did a certification for cardiology tech. So, I was a cardiology tech for nine years in a hospital, but other than that, no, I do comedy. I don't work in the medical field now. Do you make more money in comedy than you did in the medical field? No, I actually own a business doing doors and window screens and solar screens. Yeah, I'm like- So, you actually have a trade. I really have a trade. Oh, even better. I'm a boy at heart, for sure, so my dad raised me to be very independent, so I have a business where I do window screens, solar screens, window repair, and sliding glass door repair, so yeah. Get it, girl. I make more money doing that than the hospital. There you go. Got that hustle. Entrepreneur. Maya. Maya, hit it. So, my name's Maya. I'm 21. I'm single. I had one semester of college, and I have a certificate in interior design. Nice. That's awesome. Nice. Okay, cool. Single? Single. Yes. Got it. Got it. Is there a reason why you're running a relationship status? Well, the reason why I'm throwing all this out here at the beginning, I mean, I guess this is standard. We should probably be doing this all the time. No, one thing I do want to point out, once again, we have multiple girls with degrees on here. Right, right. Because the whole thing is it's always, they're not realistic, why don't you bring normal girls on here? And we do. And it just, again, we're trying to establish something. We had Miss Nevada on here previously. She's a ran through hoe. And I'm like, what the fuck is wrong with you, dude? One of these days, you'll say Nevada the correct way. Nevada, yeah. Last time we had a girl, she was a lieutenant, went to jump school in the Army. She was the second woman to ever go through jump school. So on one hand, they're like, these girls are dumb. And now she's an officer in the U.S. Army, but now she's too masculine. And the point is, we were just trying to illustrate they can't win no matter what the fuck they do. So we're just trying to show like, hey, listen, we're going to bring up hypocrisy to both sides. But that's one of the interesting parts of it. Anyway, go ahead. Well, so I wanted to start with this, because today's theme is, are these shows, these Gen Z dating shows? I failed to see how this is a Gen Z dating show. So let's give a little context for everybody. What he's talking about is whatever podcast, Pearly Things, he's talking about Fresh and Fit. He's talking about us. And then there's a couple others that I'm missing. I mean, there's a bunch of smaller ones like Nofugazi, basically where they have a purple pill, where they have a guy sitting there and then a panel of girls. And then we get the reaction. These things have become like very, very popular. Several of them get a million views per episode. The clips get millions of views. Guys are just making their entire living off these shows. They're really great. But the other thing that's happening that's really interesting, and this happened when we had Stephanie Palomaros, she came on Fresh and Fit with us two Wednesdays ago. She came on there and they trashed her in the chat and she had 1,200 new subs the next day on fucking OnlyFans. That was the point. That means she's going to make $144,000 this year from going on there and being abused for three hours. And the point I'm trying to make is, men, listen to me. If you want to call them trash, that's fine, but you can't call them trash and then subscribe to their fucking OnlyFans. That's my only point, man. The thing is, it's not just them. You have to hold yourself to a certain level of accountability as men. That's all I'm saying. So anyways, there's a, let's see, an article in the New York Post. Sorry, it's the New York Post. But again, it's, the mainstream is actually starting to take notice of shows like this and the other ones we just mentioned earlier there. Making women look dumb is a disturbing new podcast trend. And so I wanted to read some of this to you guys here really quickly. Oh, we got a super chat. For shame, a podcast with hundreds of thousands of subscribers and followers across online platforms is stoking the flames of controversy. And they're talking about whatever, which is whatever podcast is in UCSB, University of Santa Barbara. And it's like not controversial at all. Like compared to the rest of them, these guys are like super PG. They just let the girls talk the whole time. Are you guys familiar with any of these podcasts? You guys have heard of Fresh and Fit? I've only heard of Fresh and Fit. I don't know the other ones. And Pearl. Yeah, I follow both of them. Yeah, it's a pre-show that she does that gets a lot of views. Yeah. See, we're not afraid to mention other podcast names on this show because we're not in that league just yet. So they are stirring the flames of controversy by belittling female guests and making them look dumb. Whatever hosted by Brian Atlas. We've been on that about two weeks or four weeks ago. Yeah. Beginning of May. Masquerades as a dating talk show while delving into gender roles, body counts and legitimacy of the patriarchy. Have we ever asked body counts on this show? No, we never have. I don't think we have yet. I mean, you're welcome to say. You're welcome to say it, but we're not going to ask it. 666. There you go. Go get it, girl. That means you're not a quitter. That's what that means. Not a quitter. You're not a quitter. I got to 600. You're like, let's go. And by the way, that's the girl with the sharpened canines. Just saying. Yeah. Or sharpened teeth. By all means. The podcast team. Excuse me. The podcast team of whatever podcast. Yeah. Uses social media to seek women panelists, only to later roast them online in Snapchat. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uses social media to seek women panelists, only to later roast them online in snippets pandering to the virality of inflammatory hot takes. In other words, it's perfect click bait. Hmm. Welcome to the internet, New York Post. Duh. In one episode, the panelists, who are all women... Ok. Rate themselves as tens, much to Atlas' shock. Oh, I've seen that one. I love that one. I'm going to be honest. I'm not going to rate you guys, but none of you are tens, he says, in response probably to Atlas' shock. Oh, I've seen that one. I love that one. I'm going to be honest. I'm not going to rate you guys, but none of you are tens, he says, in response probably to Atlas' shock. chorus of agreements in the comments by users cruelly joking about the women's weight and appearances. Oh, I've seen that one. I love that one. I'm going to be honest. I'm not going to rate you guys, but none of you are tens, he says, in response probably to Atlas' shock. Oh, I've seen that one. I love that one. Yeah. So let's go around the table and say, what would you guys rate yourselves on a one to 10 scale? Here we go. Yourselves. Want me to go first? I'm Raven. Before we do that, let me also, let me before, I got to establish this as well. Okay. So have we like hand selected you guys to be on this show? Have you guys heard about the show? You know who this man is. You know who this man is right now, right? I actually picked Teresa because I knew she had like an advanced degree. Like I'm not picking people, I wanted Kat because Kat is a musician. She's an artist. That's the reason why I want it. Yes. We have models on here too. But like the thing is I'm trying to be extremely, I'm trying to disprove what the fuck they're saying. No one, here's another thing. No one have me on your fucking show. No one's going to make me look stupid. If you want me to come, if you want me to come on your show, like you, the thing is if I make myself look stupid, that's fine. I say something wrong, that's on me, but you're not going to make me look fucking stupid. So that's the thing that really pisses me off is when people are like, I came on your show and I just didn't know anything and it just made me look stupid. And I'm like, I don't understand why you're mad at me because that happened. Do you understand what I'm saying? That's the only thing. I get it. Anybody have me on your show. Try to make, try to make me look stupid. Go ahead. Do you want to do this now? Yeah, let's do it. Let's just do the quick, uh, just around the horn here. We'll start with my perfect 10 girlfriend, Kylie. What do you rate yourself? Um, like a seven. She said, so she says she's seven and a half. Okay. Rita. I think I'm a nine. Okay. Rita's a nine. Go ahead. Maybe an eight. I think you're maybe only ever like a 10 in someone else's eyes. Right. I always feel like there's room for improvement. Realism. Okay. Cool. Every single girl on like whatever podcast. It just depends on a good day. Cause as being a woman, it's hard. It is hard. I'll tell you right now, if we went to, if we went to, if we went to East LA, you're not a six. You're eight, nine. Don't worry about it. You're good. You have to. Got to. Yeah. It's different in Vegas, but like if we're in Topeka girl, you are not a six. You're doing good. I'm from there. You go in Philly. You're a 12. You're regional. You're regional. You're a 12. You're a 12. You're a 12. You're a 12. You're a 12. You're a 12. You're a 12. You're a 12. You're a 12. You're a 12. She's got teeth. She's a 12. Alright, let's go, Kat. I think your energy is an 8. Yeah, Kat's an 8. Go ahead. I think I'd be an 8. Okay. I think it depends on the day. When you're asking anybody, I think it depends on the day. So right now, I feel like a 10. Okay. Good for you. Kat, I'll tell you this. If you were around goth people, do you think it would be different as far as your rating would be? So you think it's contextual. Yeah, definitely. Right, so some of it is contextual. Now, I will tell you this, guys. It's not all contextual. So one of the beliefs is that beauty is subjective, right? That's what we all say. Well, somebody likes this. It's in the eye of the beholder. So here's the thing. It is subjective when we come to things like maybe hair color or the size of a girl's butt or something like that. But it's not subjective when it comes to facial symmetry, signs of youth, hip-to-waist ratio because they've done studies where they do multiple cultures and they control for things like environment and culture. So what's left is hereditary. And amongst all these different cultures, men find a certain hip-to-waist ratio in all these cultures the same. Fertility and youth. Fertility and youth. And women find men who are a little bit taller than them to be more important. Women tend to find body count to be less important. Men tend to find body count to be more important. Things like this amongst all these cultures. There were no exceptions in all 37 cultures. So what we found is that beauty is not completely subjective. It's partially objective. And, like, again, when you have a beauty competition, you can kind of tell the girls that are going to win that do very well. Generally, men tend to agree on who those women are. If I went to a bunch of dudes and I was like, hey, guys, Selma Hayek in Dust Till Dawn, who thinks she's hot? Every one of the dudes would say she's hot. Everyone is in agreement. So it's a little bit less subjective. It's a little bit less subjective than people think. All right. Anyway, so that's the whole thing with that. Anyway, did you want to follow up with something? Okay, we went around the horn. Now, okay, so you're 21. You're 21. Now we have a little bit older, more, let's say, seasoned women at the end here. I'm old as fuck. No, you can call me old. Hey, hey, hey, I don't consider myself old. I think I'm older than everybody here. My knees call me old. But do you think that your estimate of yourself and, like, your sexual market value, really, that's what it is. You're estimating your sexual market value. Like, you said a six, right? Yes. And you're 33. I'm 34. 44. Would you have said something different? 34. Would you have said something different when you were 24? No. Fuck. No? No. I would have rated myself maybe a two or three because being older, I feel like I am in the best shape, the best mind. That's hot. And it's just personal growth. So you age with fine wine, like fine wine. Okay. Go ahead. That's exactly what I say. That's my life saying. I like to be like fine wine, get better with age. Yes. When I was probably 23, I probably honestly thought I looked hot. But then five years later, I'm like, I don't know what I was thinking. I really don't know what I was thinking. Do you honestly think you're in better shape than you've been? Oh, yeah. You're a higher value at 33. No, no, no. She's in better shape. That's not, yeah. She's a competitor now. Yeah. Oh, yeah. But you have better shape. But, like, the difference is you understand some man, it's not like the fact that you have an additional master's degree, have a really nice job, and are well-traveled, those things are not as important as you just being young. Do I think that being young is important? No, to men. To some men. I'm telling you that some men see it that way. I'm sure. But, I mean, to me, I mean, if you try to guess my age, like, good luck. You know what I mean? I try to take care of myself. So I think, honestly, it's about, one, your level of maturity, and two, how old do you actually look? Because, I mean, you know, they're both 21, but I wouldn't be able to guess whether they're 21 or 29. You know what I mean? Like, they could be younger, older, you know? It just depends on how well you take care of yourself. Rita, what do you think? I feel like I've gotten better looking with age. Like, when I was younger, like, I was maybe, like, attractive, but I feel like now that I know more about the world, and I've traveled, and I've done things that make me happy, like, I feel like I look better because I'm actually being myself. Thanks. You guys all realize that your sexual market value decays with time, correct? I'm not trying to have kids. I don't think that's true. I feel like I think I get better. Well, you're a fitness competitor, though. So here's the thing. I don't think people know that. Go ahead. Teresa, here's the thing. What we're saying, though, so here's the thing where there's kind of a difference. For a man, the things that make him sexually attractive and the achievements in his life are actually the same thing. So him getting the $40 million contract to start as a quarterback, that makes him attractive to society. It's an accomplishment, and it makes him attractive to women. The fact that he's big and strong and tall and has a deep voice, that makes him attractive to society and makes him attractive to women. For women, they're two different things. A woman who cures cancer doesn't make her husband's penis harder. Does that make sense? Yeah. But it's different. So for men, the things that give us personal self-worth are the same things as the thing that increase our sexual market value. That can also happen to us when we get older. For women, it's not the same. For women, the things that make men physiologically attracted to you are different than the fact that you're world-traveled, a good leader, a really good speaker, have a master's degree, and know more stuff. It's very different. Do you see what I'm saying? Because smart men like that shit. What do you mean, Lena? There's a lot of men out there that really don't. The intellectual women are more attractive than what the fuck you look like. I think if it's an intellectual woman that you can have a conversation with and she brings you peace, then yes. But if it's an intellectual woman whose intent is just to compete with you the entire time, then the answer would be no. That doesn't make you more attractive. Well, like the guy that owns Facebook. His girl ain't pretty. Zuckerberg! Oh, man, we're going to talk about Zuck later on. His girl's not pretty. She's not very attractive, but he's one of the richest men in the world. That's because he imported her from Southeast Asia. That's Kalamala. No, she went to college with him. Yeah, that's true. She's a Chinese plant. Exactly. She's ugly, but she's got one of the richest men in the world, so you can't really say that. It doesn't matter what a fucking man values you at. If you value yourself, what does it matter? It would matter if you want to date a man, right? Does that make sense? It's like if I go, it doesn't matter what my bank account says. I should just have that Bugatti. Until you go to the lot and try to get the Bugatti, and then they're like, wait a second, you don't have enough money in your account, objectively. So when you say it doesn't matter what a man thinks, you're correct. Until you want a man, then it does matter. You see what I'm saying? Because a relationship is two people. I guess I don't want a man. There you go. No, that's a boy. I don't want a relationship. A man is the type of guy that understands that women do get older. For sure. There's nothing wrong with women getting older. You want to grow older with somebody. A boy is the type of guy that's like, no, I need the big tits. I need the fucking makeup. I need her to be fucking perfect. Can I be a man and want both? You can have both. I'm not saying it's not realistic. You can have both. Can I also be a man and recognize all the value you have and then still want someone younger? Of course. But that's the problem, right? That's the reason why I bought the car I bought instead of another car is because the car I bought was better. Why don't you buy it for yourself? Just like you buy a car that's nice. A car doesn't talk to you. Neither does a younger woman. A younger woman doesn't really talk. I know one that talks to me. I know one that does. The trick is getting her to shut up. That's my point. No, that's not a trick. Stop saying that. She has a knife. She has a knife. She has a knife. She's amazing. She talks to me. I'm giving y'all a minute. I'll talk a lot. I'll talk a lot. That's a good one. We were at Roll & Smoke the other day, and he's talking about F-16s, this, and B-52, that, and God knows whatever else planes he's flown and maybe not flown. You know all this stuff because you listen to this stuff all the time, and I'm like, damn. You probably could carry on a conversation. Well, maybe not as well as he could, but you've been around enough to pick up something on what he's about, his background, his history, right? Do you learn things from this guy? I say it all the time. Obviously I'm dating Michael, but I like older men. Even if I wasn't dating Michael, I'd still be dating someone around the same age. It's not even just people I'm dating. My friends are generally way older than me too. For many years it's been this way, like 10 years, 5 to 10, even plus, years older than me. Those are my best friends, good friends. It's because, yeah, they know more than me. They've been through more life experiences, and I learn so much from them just being around them. But you know what? They can come back and say that they learn from me too. So, you know, I don't really think. It's a give and take. Do you get, because I know you guys go through this, I know for a fact you guys go through this dynamic, but I have people, especially women who are sort of anti-red pill or they're very anti-whatever it is we're doing, and then they'll, and I know you guys do this on purpose. He says, hey, I'm 45 years old, and then suddenly you go, yeah, I'm 21. And then it's funny, and I like how you guys do this because you'll say that, and I know it's plain. Well, it does, but you let them discover it. You don't go and put it in their face. So then you say, oh, I'm 21, he's 45, and then somebody like the host or somebody in the audience or somebody in the chat will go, oh my God! You know, like they're shocked about it or something like that. My favorite is when I tell stories about a girl I went on a date with in 1996, and she's like, that bitch. I can't believe that shit. I can't believe you went on a date with that. I can't believe you went on a date with that bitch. I'm like, babe, you weren't born for five more years. Why are you cheating on me with that bitch? And I'm like, it was 1998. There's no way. You weren't even swimming in the balls yet. That's ridiculous. I was talking about a girlfriend I had once in like 2002, and she's like, I can't believe you were nine months old. What the fuck? Well, I was, and this is like a common thing that I've had to, a question I've always had to feel, because like women will say, women in particular will say, what you have is just, wait, hold on, let me throw that on there. There it is. That's nasty. That's nasty. That's nasty. They'll say that he's robbing the cradle, right? Or the most common one that they say is like, what are you guys going to talk about? Like do you guys have some sort of like intellectual conversation? Like you're just like walking around just drooling, not knowing what the hell to say. I think from like both of our standpoints, like I get way more hate on it than he does. Like to him, for a guy to be dating like that, it's like, oh, I regret it. Don't they call you a whore? But then for me, it's like, oh, you have daddy issues. What's wrong with you? What kind of trauma have you been through? And I'm like, nothing. Men my age suck. I'm like, I should have been sorry. So that was my next question. We joke about this all the time. She's like, she looks at pictures of me when I was her age, and she's like, oh, God, you were cute. I would have dated you. And I'm like, no the fuck you wouldn't. There is no way you would have dated me. You wouldn't have pissed on me if I was on fire. Please, I'm on fire. Please, just piss on me. So I cannot be on fire anymore. She would not have peed on me. I'm telling you. I hate seeing this stupid meme. And it's guys that do this. It's like, not women do this, but it's the meme that says, I wish I could have met you earlier so I could have loved you longer. And it's like, she was in the foam cannon party in Cancun when she was younger. She wouldn't have anything to do with you back then. Those foam parties are great, though. Not unless you eat that foam. It's not good. I went to a foam party and I got a rash. I got a bad rash. It's an accident. It just goes in your mouth. This guy, I think it was in November or December, he's like sending me pictures of the foam cannon party. Now, ladies who are in your 30s, would you consider dating a younger man or do you look for guys who are older than you? And then I got another question. We didn't ask her what she thought about this either. She's 21 also. At this point, I don't even know what to answer. We've been around. Are you into older guys or youngish guys? Older. Older guys. Older. So I'm 21. Most of the guys my age don't really have much experience with life. They're more focused on partying. A lot of them are in college. And I also want to be with somebody who I feel like I'm very much so into more masculine guys and I want to be with somebody who feels more like a man to me than a boy still trying to figure it out. What's a man to you, in a sense? Somebody who has their own sense of self. They're shit together. 21, you're still figuring it out. 45, they're still figuring it out. Girl, thank you. It's like fucking real here. I think it depends. Do you have an age limit? Ladies, we're making this up as we go along. We really are. Do you only have a certain age you'll grow up from your age or do you care? I don't want to go too far off. All right, well, let's throw the next question out here. Al Pacino just knocked up his 29-year-old girlfriend, and he is 83. No, he's 83. 83. 82. 82? 82. So is 82 too old for you? For the 29-year-old? Technically, you can get a girl pregnant even when you're 90 years old. No, no, no, that's what we're asking from a cultural standpoint. Is it haram? How old is too old? I don't know, because I loved it for Anna Nicole. And Nicole Smith? Yeah, of course. She won that man's purse money. I'm so confused. Anna Nicole, you must be. You think she's like, oh, no, this is our love child. I love it for her. Like, bro. The thing is, here's what I think. You know what she's doing it for? I support it. Here's the thing. I think if it was someone else, people would think it's creepy. But because Al Pacino has, this is something we talk about in my program, because Al Pacino has so much status, it's OK. Like, if Derek Jeter was in his 80s, or what's his face, Frank Sinatra. If Frank Sinatra had a baby with a woman in his 80s, no one would complain. Mick Jagger fathered a child at 74. Yeah. And let's not forget our good friend Dr. David Buss is a father at 70 years old as well. Wow. I think the first thing I think of is this. When it's like that old, like the man is this old, I think that it, what comes to my mind is this poor woman is about to have to raise this kid by herself. Yeah, solo. That's the only issue. That's the only thing I kind of think is, at that age, that's a little bit. That's what I'm saying. But you're still like, well, now we're, well. Even if it doesn't matter the money you have, you have to have a father, a manly figure in the house. Yeah, no, I agree. I'm saying it's a trade-off. I'm saying it's a trade-off. I'm saying it's. Haram! I said he's haram. For those of you who don't have headphones on. You don't have that. It's a business deal. I mean, she has all this money now. Haram. She can find a young guy. She can hire a nanny to take care of the baby. Cat with a solution. See, that's what I. I mean. They say women don't come up with solutions. With all these podcasts like this one and Pearl and all of them."}
