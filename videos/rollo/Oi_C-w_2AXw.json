Let me explain something to you about boundaries because I was talking about I've harped on this for for a very long time Boundaries mean nothing unless there is some sort of consequence. Thank you those. Okay, there's so that but that's controlling though, dude Well, it's controlling. It's not controlling. Why are you controlling people? Here's the thing So I'm gonna use another extreme example. The guys have hit me up all the time They'll say roll on my girlfriend or my wife, whatever. She wants. She's comes to me She says hey, I want to go and have a girl's weekend out in Vegas So I want to go have a girl's night out. I want to go and and do these things. Is that okay with you? Are you okay with that? And really that's really more in a relationship sense. That's a shit test. Okay, it's not about the permission It's not about whether or not you're okay with it or not It's the fact that she wants to go in the first place So what I tell guys to say, yeah say yeah, sure have fun. You go go out with your girlfriends That's what you want to do. Sure. Go ahead, honey. I support that right? She comes back all her shits on the sidewalk and all the locks in the door"}
