Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Ease up, ease up. Yeah, well, we'll talk about that. Yeah, yeah. Of course. Everybody's used to that. Come on, now. They'll say, though, for one failure, you get one victory, right? What do they say? One-oh-shit? Your race is ten attaboys. It's more like a hundred online. Live from Rio de Janeiro, this is the irrational mill. Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're going to talk about that. Everything's coming in today. We're coming in hot. Oh, yeah. This is the part you wait for, isn't it? This is like why you watch the show. You're like, OK, we're done after the first 20 minutes, because all we're going to see is the buildup. You just want to see the videos roll. No, no. Well, she feels like she's a ten. Well, don't back down now. Yeah, I didn't say no. OK, so she lives in the mic. If she feels she's a ten, that's how she feels. She's a ten. Nice. This is a ten. You know what's great? You know what's so crazy? We can't do that. Like, I can't just go go to the fucking Staple Center and be like, hey, I'm starting at small forward for the Lakers today. I can't just say that because I feel like that. As men, we are totally, every single moment of every day, we are judging our performance. The world is constantly telling us no. Who we can't date, what we can't lift, what athletic ability we don't have. We're constantly, this idea that I could just make up my own value is absurd. I have X number of dollars in my bank account, X number of fucking subs on my YouTube channel. These are defined. My abilities are defined. How much I can bench press is defined. All the stuff we do, there is no way for us to just make up some fucking number in our head and say, I'm a 10. Real men pay the bills. Real men put the clothes on your back. Real men take care of you. Sister, sister, don't marry no Bretton Bridges. Get you a real man. Take your time. Get you a real man. Anybody can get some Bretton Bridges. Driving your car. Cashing your check. Wearing the suits you bought. Eating the food you pay for. Come on, get you a real man. If you can't find a real one, stay single. Then you will. I'm 26 and I've never been married. So I've never met the one or whatever, you know? But I know I've never met this guy. I think about him. I wonder about him, you know? Like, what is he like? Where does he live? What does he do? You know, I'm thinking he's got to be pretty special, right? But I don't think we should hype up our soulmates this much because I've been waiting my entire life to meet this one man and I'm not trying to sound mean, but I know he's not going to be worth the wait. You know? I'm sure he's a nice guy, you know what I mean? But it's like, it's just going to be some guy named Greg in a graphic tee. If someone pointed at Greg and said, Leslie, you get to marry this man, but you have to wait 36 years. I wouldn't even get in line, okay? Do you understand? I'd wait half an hour tops for someone like Greg. ...for these websites and they are for their potential partners. Because that's what guys want. That's why they dress that way. We're all saying we don't want them to do that. Firstly, we all see the types of women that all of you guys go after and it's these types of women, number one. Number two, you can look at... How do you not know how to differentiate sex from a relationship? I'm sorry, but men want... Men want in a relationship and men just being attracted to a woman. There's very different things. We're not going to choose that. We're all saying we don't want to marry that girl. Sneko, could you look around the panel and tell us which girl you think is probably the most provocatively dressed right now? Just the one with the most skin. Okay, so your ex. Like, what? Are you high? What's your point? What do you mean, what's the point? The girl that you chose of all of the girls are the ones that are most provocatively dressed. When I chose her, she was covered. She was covered. Yeah, if I could speak, I have never dressed this way in my entire life. There you go. Xena dressed me. Who is Xena? Who is Xena? Who is Xena? Your girlfriend. We're at the end of the show, Byron. We're at the end. We're the donos. We're the superchats. It's just not... Flawless victory. The red-pill dogma of, like, these women should not be posting all these pictures online or whatever or she's posting pictures like she's single. Not necessarily. It was just because, like, from my experience, when I post stuff like that or I have OnlyFans, or I was a stripper before, when I was stripping, I had my partners being like, I don't want you sharing your body with nobody. But if you're saying you personally, you're okay with it. So, this is going to seem a little weird, but it might make sense to some guys. Because we're with women together, I actually like that she's that attractive and other women find her attractive on social media because it just sort of makes the polygyny work easier, if that makes any sense. What happens with a toxic relationship is they give you love in doses. So, they'll give you a bit of love, then followed by a lot of trauma. Then love, then trauma. And what happens is we get addicted to that love. We see potential. We're like, oh, but it used to be so good. Or do you remember when he used to do that to me? How can I let him go? So, they hold on to the good and forget the trauma in between and they end up staying with that person. But the reality is, if you have to think about when it was good, it's not good. Yeah. Yeah, because a true, healthy relationship, there is no, oh, but I know what he used to be. I know what we could be. It is just, we're cool. We're calm. It's not like fireworks all day. It's that steady peace rather than, I remember when we used to have it good or I remember when he was so kind. There's no holding on to memories. You're always going to have more sex being in a relationship. This is something I've learned. Unless you're Dan Bilzerian, you're always going to have more sex being in a relationship than trying to go hunt for different women every week. Oh, in a man's standpoint. Correct. Because I'm like, for women, I'm like, no, I have a lot more sex when I'm single. Right. That's not, that's sad. I do, obviously, I have sex when I'm in a relationship and I f*** a lot. But it's still one of those, like, I just want to cuddle sometimes. So, when I'm single, I go to your house with purpose. Yeah. So, I'm going to say at least 200. 200 grand? You can be 30 years old and make 200 grand. Oh my goodness. How many, what percentage of men fit these criteria? 2%. 2%? Much lower. It's 0.049%. Yeah, I mean, by the way, they've done polls with women and they'll say, I only want a man over six foot. The percentage of American males over six foot is very, very low. The average height of the American male is, wait for it, 5'9\". So, stop looking for all the things, ladies. When you check those boxes on the dating app, try to pick ones that are at least somewhere within the standard of deviation. It is nasty, right? Isn't it nasty? Oh! So nice that Ben Shapiro's finally caught up to, let's see, the Manosphere 2016. Oh my gosh, hi! How are you doing? I'm good. Hi. It's so nice to meet you. Oh my god. Hi. How are you doing? I'm doing well, thank you. Hello. How are you doing? Good, good. How are you? I'm good, I'm good. Wow. I'm sorry. Oh, you're the... She's like... Hello. How are you doing? Andy, what are you doing? There she goes, there she goes. Wow. Hey, Andy, Andy. Excuse me. Andy. Oh, dear. Okay, that's enough of that for now. We'll come back to that one. I promise you we'll come back to that one, because I think that's well worth the entire watch. It's pretty good. How are you doing, guys? How are we doing? Oh, man. Okay, what should I get? Yeah, well, you know, I'll tell you what's funny is I used this... Where did it go? I used this as the thumbnail today. I've used this... I don't think I've ever used this as a thumb, but I like collecting, let's say, pictures of like alpha... I think I've used this for alpha tells, I think is what I use this for. And again, it's not him. It's her in that situation. Some people have sent me, let's see, videos of... Was it Henry Cavill? And I forget the name of the little girl who's in The Witcher. She's probably not a little girl anymore, but just watching her bite her lip kind of thing. And just sort of like, there's these sort of unconscious, uncontrollable, subconscious behaviors that you'll see. I mean, we always like to talk about... I mean, in the days of the pickup artists, right? I mean, still, I guess today too. We used to talk about IOIs, right? Which is indicators of interest. Those are really strong indicators of interest. And I wanted to start with that today because we're going to get into some topics today. I'm going to dig into infidelity for a little bit. But the reason why I am getting into infidelity today is because on Access Vegas, I brought this up. I actually brought this up twice on the last two episodes. And I think I started asking this question after Adam22 had sort of initiated or launched his campaign, the CuckMe campaign. And I asked this question. It's like, what is marriage today? And I got some really interesting answers. One of the reasons I used Mike Sartain's clips today was because it sort of speaks to what I've been asking and talking about. It's like, what do we do about marriage in the 21st century? And part of that conversation, I was getting into it with some of the ladies and some of them are in throuples. Yeah, that one girl cat, she's part of the throuple. Do I have to remind you guys again? Hey, man, you guys really ambushed Zorka. No, I didn't ambush Zorka. Nobody did. You can't ambush Zorka. He's like Drax from Guardians of the Galaxy, right? You know, Batista. It's like, nothing goes over my head. I'm too fast. I would catch it. It's like that literal autism stuff, but it's like funny autism. That's Zorka. Zorka is not ever ambushed. Just so you guys know, no one ambushes Zorka. Even if you try to ambush Zorka, you don't ambush Zorka. But you do ambush me, however, simply because I was unaware of the throuple situation. But as part of that conversation, I was asking some of the ladies who are in sort of open relationships or even Mike for that matter is in a, I guess technically you would call it an open relationship, open on his end anyway. But there's like stipulations, you know, there's rules that are applied to that whole situation. It's really kind of customizing your own relationship or customizing your own marriage. And so I wanted to know that if we are in Berserka, yeah, you're right. If we're in an age that is a post marriage, you know, 21st century, what is marriage? What does that look like? Because a lot of people will look at something like, like what's going on with Adam 22. And again, I see it as a hustle. That's basically what it is. And I tried to give you sort of the, you know, see the force for the trees and all of that. But again, it asks the same question. What is marriage? And if there is a set rules, if there are, if there are a, there's a ground rules, let's just say, what constitutes cheating? Because I asked that as well. And it speaks to a bigger conversation that I've been talking about recently when it comes to like innate versus sort of learned mating strategies and what serves those strategies and what doesn't, what arrangement serves those strategies and what doesn't. So when I ask Kate, okay, so what is cheating? So if the, if they're in an open relationship, if you have a completely open on your end, open on her end, like what's the point of the relationship in the first place? Why not? Why would it not be more pragmatic to just simply spin plates, date not exclusively? Why would you have a main in the first place? And ladies too, like why would you have a main guy? Why would you pretend to have some sort of semblance of a conventionally monogamous relationship versus I want to go out and, you know, and tap strange on the weekends. And I've been talking about this for a long time. I got into the open cuckoldry talk when I was doing my coverage of Lena the plug and all that stuff from two weeks ago. And again, the same questions keep coming up over and over now. Recently, I'm going to, we're going to riff on another video here too, but I wanted to point out. a few things here because I think a lot of our concepts of what is cheating and what is not cheating today are all based on one commonality, which is this 20th century understanding of traditional, conventional, closed on his end, closed on her end marriage. So what is cheating? If you're in a monogamous, committed relationship where that commitment entails, I'm not going to fuck anybody else and you're not going to fuck anybody else either. That's how it's going to work out is that's the boundaries, right? We talked about that. If that's the boundaries, then what is, what are the boundaries when it's open on his end and closed on her end? What are the boundaries when it is open on both of their ends? What are the boundaries when it's, you know, closed on his end and technically open on her end? Cause she's advertising herself or perhaps she's works in the porn industry or she's got an only fans page. These are like the questions that we've been talking about for quite some time now. And again, these are, this is analysis. So let me start by saying that this is analysis. Yes. I'm going to talk about Brittany Venti today. Yes. I am going to also get into a couple of other things today too, but those are the main things I'll get into, but, but I want to give you guys some nuts and bolts, you know, topics here first before you get into the red meat, cause I know everybody's just like salivating right now. You know, I'm, I'm sick to death of people mischaracterizing the red pill is some sort of like bonehead, you know, all these guys do is think with their dicks and their incels and their misogynists and they, they always say this. So here's a, the, the opener and opening salvo here is a lot of the stuff that I'm going to get into today is going to be like really nuts and bolts. I got statistics, I got research, I got all kinds of stuff to back this shit up and always have, by the way. But today's going to be a little bit more data heavy because I'm going to get into some stuff with, we're going to talk a little bit about Dr. David Buss. I just picked up a clip, actually it's an old clip, but it's a, it was just re, maybe it's the clip itself is new, but it's from an older interview between Mike Sartain and Dr. David Buss himself. So for anybody saying, well, those guys don't know what they're talking about, dude, we, those are the people that we interview. Richard Reeves, we interviewed Richard Reeves. If I can get doc, if I can get Gad Saad to come to Vegas, he's got a new book out. I'm really going to see if I can catch him on his book tour because I know he's making the rounds right now. So I'm going to reach out to his people and see if I can get him on access Vegas sometime in August. But he's got a new book on happiness and you know how I am about happiness. I'm just a bunch of a fucking joy. Little Mr. Sunshine. So we'll be getting into that today too. Bodybuilders ain't attractive. Are you sure? You're sure about that? Because I'll tell you right now, this, this broad, she seems to think so set up. It's that it's that damn, it's that bite, the shot under bite. That's that fuck me under bite. It's funny to me because I think I have some other, like I could drag them out if you really want to, but I have some like other shots, like kind of, you know, very similar to this, videos and stuff like that as well where you can see that in action. But here's the funny thing is like whenever anyone, not just me, anyone draws attention to that, they think you're, Oh, you're reading into something you're not, that's not really what she's about. And I, I think it's more, it's almost more fascinating to me to see the, the rationalizations for why I would even like put, use this as a thumbnail, much less, you know, draw attention to it. You can't, you can't know what she's thinking. Come on. Really? Really? Yeah. Okay. What about, uh, what about when Lena, the plug was like sitting there and just getting, you know, getting railed and she's got the, you know, our eyes roll back in her head. You don't know what she's thinking. She could be thinking about Bible study. You don't know that you can't read her mind, mister. You leave her alone. It's funny to me that that's the, like the, it's almost, it's more entertaining to me to see the defense than anything else. Oh, there you are. Hey, there you are. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for supporting the show. Ned's college fund is, uh, he's almost got full tuition for this semester. Thank you. Okay. Yeah. So just bringing up the fact like whenever, whenever I post any pictures online, particularly if I'm with like, if I'm at like a babes and toy land or if I'm like with some of the girls from access Vegas, the first thing anybody wants to do is of course they want to like, you know, throw the green lines, like the green line mafia comes out, right? Rollo's leaning in. He's, he's, he's at a, he's at a 7% inclined towards the girl who's like four foot 11 trying to get into the frame. It's funny to me, like when, whenever I am leaning in or it seems I always, it's always by the way. Thank you very much. We do, we do talk about by the way, when we do, uh, the, uh, the gang photos after, uh, after an access Vegas, we do shot, we do shots with all the girls after every show. Uh, and so if I've got the, if I've got like say Maya, by the way, who's absolutely stunningly gorgeous, but like, she's only like maybe five foot tall, maybe five, three or something like that. So here I am just kind of like trying to, you know, fit in the frame and people go, you're leaning in, man, just do you think? So in the back of my head, that's the first thing I'm thinking of. Thanks a lot. Greenline mafia guys. If you don't know what I mean by green line, the green line bros, it's whenever you lean in, they're going to like angle you. They'll put a little green line on you and make you make it look like you're leaning in of some, in some way. So therefore you can't possibly be alpha. Be gone. Nana. Be gone beta. Uh, what do you got here? Uh, not sure if you mentioned this, but I've noticed that women can be jealous of a man's success. Don't underestimate women. I've actually done an entire show on that, my friend, um, in fact, I, I called attention to that, uh, right after the Dr. Phil show. And I was, uh, rudely introduced to a Robin McGraw, who also, by the way, uh, believes that, uh, women are, are these unknowable, mysterious forces of nature and how, how dare you, uh, guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty, how dare you, how dare you try to figure out what's women are thinking? Well, you don't know what they're thinking. Uh, if you've saw, if you've seen the, uh, I really got to do, I want so badly to do like to riff on my show that I did with Dr. Phil, but I can't do it until the show is officially canceled. So because they're still like, they're still finishing out the, this year's season. And I don't know when they, when they're officially off the air, but once they're done, then I can start talking about in a little bit more detail. I've already kind of talked about it, I guess a little bit, but yeah, Mr. Superfluous. Yeah. I'll tell you, it's funny is they're using the term superfluous in the Barbie movie. And I'm just like, once again, God makes a joke and I'm the only one that gets it. And yes, I, I just, uh, let's, would we like to go around the horn really good, the red meat horn here? I need it. I need a sound drop for the red meat horn here. Um, so yeah, I'm well aware of pearls kind of stepping in and I'll tell you the whole thing that went down with her and, um, uh, Pierce Morgan or Pierce Morgan basically brought her on under false pretenses. You want to talk about ambush? There's your ambush. And I'll tell you this, if you go on those shows, be prepared for it, especially if it's mainstream media. I knew damn well, I was going to be ambushed when I went on, on Dr. Phil, just figured that they're going to do background checks. I remember what she was doing the, uh, she did the, uh, what was it? She did the interview with, uh, Ethan Klein, H3H3. And she was just shocked, shocked that anybody would do any background check on her and find out what her dad did and, and what, you know, she played volleyball. How did you know that? You're not shocked. You're not stupid. Now you, you don't get the stupid pass anymore. You don't get the dumb girl pass anymore. They not, I don't know. You don't get that pass anymore. So if you're doing like, you know, playing guitar and singing songs about, you know, I don't know that Austrian painter back in the day. Um, yeah, you're probably going to get called to the carpet, especially when it's a guy who's in the past is like brought you on the show just to have you and run you up the flagpole. You're red meat, red meat. That's what you are. It's their game. I told Roosh this, I have told how many Jotep Jesus, we've had this contact conversation before, uh, you go, you go into mainstream media, expect them to fuck with you. That's what everybody told me about. Like Dr. Phil. They were like, roll it. Don't you know that he's going to try to ambush you? I'm like, yeah, I do. Thank you. I've been doing this quite some time. I'm ready for it. Let's go. Oh, it's going to be, you're going to, you're going to stake your career on. This is going to be the hill you die on. I'm still doing this. And Dr. Phil is gone again. God makes a joke and I'm the one that gets it right. Same thing with, uh, with Pearl, especially after all the bullshit that went down, Pearl is a shit person, simply simple as that. And if you choose to associate, but you, you, you're abandoned ship, please, the, the ship is sinking. You know, the rats are leaving. It's time to leave. It's time to get off. It's time to abandon ship. If you're on the Pearl, you know, the SS Pearl time to get out, do it now, do it now. Yeah. So yeah, I'm aware of that. Um, I'm also aware of Brittany Venny's thing and I do have her on tap and on deck here. Uh, yeah, I'm also well aware that she took it upon herself to, uh, to dox my daughter. Thank you. Thank you, Brittany. I guess now that we're family, you don't mind me, uh, bringing up, uh, Mason and some other people that I'm well aware of. See, the thing is, I think people are really kind of like shocked that I have information that I do. And it's not like I go looking for it. I have people who like, man, you know, I heard you talk about Brittany Venny here, like here's some pictures from back in the day. Like people will come to me. I don't have to go to them. They come looking. They come for me. All that shit about Lauren Southern. Yeah. I'll talk about that too, if you'd like, but I do have, I have technically their medical records. I do have medical records, uh, that she was in fact pregnant about this time last year, August 8th of 2022. I have them, I have them right in my possession and people go, well, you need to show them stop talking about it and make them public. Uh, if I do that, then I will most definitely get banned on this channel. And I will most definitely lose my, my Twitter account if I do that. So my, uh, once again, my offer still on the fricking table, I will give you physical printouts of those documents. If you decide that you want to come to Las Vegas and sit across the table from me, and I will show you in black and white that I do actually, in fact, possess these documents. So until you're ready to put your money where your mouth is, shut the fuck up as simple as that. Uh, Hey Rolo, did you see the debate about women only have the right because men have forced them? Yeah. Men are forced to enforce those rights. Yeah, it was. Uh, that's the guy, Andrew Wilson. I mentioned him on last week's show as a matter of fact. And um, yeah, he took her down. He took, well, it's not too hard to do with Farrah. In fact, it's almost like an unfair fight. I, I hate to say it, but I'm almost kind of like feel somewhat sympathetic for, for Farrah. Um, because of the people she's been associating with. And I think she has like her intentions were like, she's actually genuinely curious I think in some ways. And so she goes on these shows and she just gets her ass handed to her because most likely it's destiny or someone else. I don't know who it could be anybody, but I do know for a fact that destiny was feeding her lines on the show that I happen to be on with, uh, with her and Mike Sartain and Justin Waller on whatever podcast that he's admitted as much. And um, I think she's just, you know, getting bad in for information for people. And so, but anyways, uh, yeah, I did see that. So, you know, go on this show, say these things. And she's not the only one, by the way, you've got Angela and I, you've got Natalia, by the way, from, from sauce cast, unfortunately it's fallen into all this bullshit. Uh, you had, uh, I don't want to say Amy Dangerfield because I don't know what her relationship is with destiny, but that might be another one of his like destiny's angels, right? Like Charlie's angels, destiny's, um, trying to think who else, uh, well, certainly erudite, uh, whatever her name, I don't even remember her name was more than likely. I'm not saying there's like these deliberate collabs, but it's funny how like Lauren, Lauren Southern has a relationship with, with destiny, uh, probably Brittany Venti. I know that she is very tight with Lauren Southern. Got it. They're all, everything's connected, man. It's all inbred on that side of the whole, whatever the fuck we're even calling that. And so when I see this, it's like, it's almost like, you know, the degrees of separation from Kevin Bacon. It's like the degrees of separation from, from destiny. Um, but you know, it is what it is. I'm, again, I'm trying to get back to nuts and bolts these days, but I did see that. And I mentioned the, uh, is it, what's his name? Wilson, uh, where'd you go? Well, Andrew, Andrew Wilson. Yeah. Uh, I did, I did watch that and I watched the, I thought it was interesting because like she had, she's got nothing like women's rights are enforced by men. And I think I brought this up on last week's show. It's like the, uh, the idea that, uh, you know, violence is the ultimate, ultimate decider. Like you have rights in so far as those, those rights can be enforced or protected or, you know, delivered to you at the, you know, the, at the risk or the, the threat of violence. And that's really what it boils down to. It's men who are going to go and fight other men so that you can have your right to vote. Ladies. It's men who are going to go and fight with other men so that you can, you know, let's you and him fight. Right. Uh, so that you have a right to a safe and legal abortion. I mean, when it comes down to it, if it were to come down to it, that's what, that's what would it, it would entail. So ladies, you need men. You absolutely need men for, for one, one way or another. Um, where'd you go? Here you are. Uh, Hey, Rolo might be a stupid question. There are no stupid questions. This is the pod class. You come to the professor, you may ask whatever you'd like. Uh, but how can you be 100% sure a man's girlfriend slash wife has, this is a big difference between those two statements has true genuine burning desire. Even if she says, I want your babies, even if she says, um, well, uh, I would say time on the clock. First of all, it's experience understanding like, you know, well, first, I think one of the reasons why most guys can't, like, this is a hard question for most guys."}
