Is this not why you are here? I'm going to do everything in demon voice today. Yes. Is that a question? Yes, we're going to be celebrating Halloween early. No, this is not the Halloween show. You know how much I love it, but... Apologies, this took a lot longer than I expected. No, Rolo does not actually believe in demons. No, no, no. What do you think, though? What do you think of that thumbnail? I spent a lot of time doing that. It was just too easy. It was like Damien the Omen 2. There is no sound to this because there was this nice schmaltzy piano music that was going on in the back. And I know damn well that if I played it... Look at this. Oh, gosh. It's almost better without the music. You can concentrate on this a little bit more. I had no idea about that. Today we are going to exercise the demon that is Jada Pinkett Smith. Yes, we are going to press the cross to her forehead and burn the crucifix into her flesh. 18 years. Oh, my God. 18 years. Three years separated. Yeah, separated. According to them. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, let's keep going. Shall we, children? What is it is to hear Donald Trump talk? And as embarrassing it is as an American to hear him talk. I think it's good. We get to hear it. We get to know who people are. And now we get to cleanse it out of our country. Now, this is a story all about how your wife got flipped upside down. And I'd like to take a minute. Just sit right there. I tell you how you became the butt of the joke everywhere. In 2022, on the Oscar stage, you heard a joke. And then you went into a rage. Screaming and cursing. Slapping won't cool. Popping off at the mouth. Made you look like a fool. Cut your bald head and wife. Who was up to no good. Started smashing kids in the neighborhood. She got in one entanglement. And that means an affair. She said, hit it from the back. Because I don't think Will cares. You pulled up to a table. And yes, it was red. We yelled to our friends. You hear this? Daddy said. Now look at your kingdom. It looks more like a duck. Focus more on Jada Bell. And less on Trump. Many surprising things in the book. But the thing that surprised me the most. That I actually had to reread it. Because I said, is this true? Was that in 2016, you and Will decided that you were going to live completely separate lives. It was not a divorce on paper. Right. But it was a divorce. So from the year 2016, which is seven years ago now. Yes. Y'all have been. Catch that laugh? Wait a minute, wait a minute. Apart. Catch that laugh? Oh, man. I need a sound drop of that laugh. It was too good. Might not know, but he proposed to you while he was in jail. I talk about this in the book when I go to see him in Rikers. When I wrote about that in the book. And when I had to talk about it. Speak my words for the audible version of the book. That was probably one of the more painful parts. Seeing him there. The condition that he was in. And having to leave him there. And he was in bad shape. And so when he asked me to get married. He was at Rikers. And I knew at that time that. A, he needed somebody to do time with him. Which I was going to do anyway. And you have to marry me. Right. I'm here. I see why we love you. And then to. But he needed a rock. He needed. Because of our friendship and because of everything we have been through together. He just wanted. To feel that solidified foundation. You know, because I promise you, he would have married me and divorced me as soon as. Right. Because so many people in that position don't have support. Right. None at all. None. You know. And. Right. He was just like, look. And I just think it was the mind state that he was in. You know, he, he wrote me this long letter. And I think even before Pac went to jail, he was starting to trend. He was starting to shift. In a certain manner. Good or bad. Good. Really good. And I think that for him, he just felt like, okay. If I can. Tether myself. It'll keep me on a trajectory. The concept of she makes rules for betas and breaks rules for alphas. In my early twenties, I was on one side of that. And I definitely on another side of it. Now, Lana, if a girl consistently says I don't sleep with guys on the first date, what does that mean? It means that Dave slept with guys on the first day. So obviously they're making a rule, a new rule for, for the things they've done before. Because they tend to be in a different phase of life at that point. Because what happens is during their phase, they have higher sexual capital. So they can, they can afford to make mistakes. We're talking about early 20. We're talking about 20 to 20, 18 to 20. She can like 22 year old, 23 year old. She can afford to make mistakes that she can't afford to make when she's 29, 30, 31 years old. Because what happens is you've got a 10 year window for a woman through a, hopefully you, you live a very long life. Let's just say 90 years and a hundred years or something like that. So 10 years out of a hundred years is where you have that space to maximize your, uh, your reproductive, uh, you know, you solve your reproductive problems and then consolidate on long-term security. What happens is, and this is why I disagree with Dr. Buss as far as the mate switching hypothesis is concerned is it takes place after the mating has already there. So why do women cheat? Okay. We can have that discussion, but why do they get into the situation that they get into in the first place? Tell these to go to hell. Based purely on physical attributes. What would you rate me? Overall 8.5. Okay. What could get me to attend? Okay. I appreciate it. Species of men. Now there is a successful high status, a species of man that women date and then complain about because they have too many women and too many options. Women don't even see. And I'm serious. Like I've done this before where me and my girlfriend will go, we'll go to like Jack in the box or whatever in the middle of the night. And then afterwards we'll drive off and I'll be like, describe the cashier and they don't remember status. He's a piece of furniture to most women. He doesn't matter. They just don't notice these men at all. But a guy in a Ferrari, I guarantee you, she remembers that he had blue eyes. I promise you she does because that's the way it works. It's not that women are even like disregarding these men or like they're not dissing these men. They don't even notice these men exist. Like literally they're not even acknowledging that the Filipino who's five foot five, who's a cashier at Walmart, that he's unattractive. They're not even acknowledging he's unattractive. Recognize he exists. I don't chase booty. You know, you just need to relax and stop overreacting. Should I explain this joke to you now or later? I think I'll do it later. Going to like this one. If you're on board with girls, ditching the pill, I'm going to need you to reassess your thoughts on TRT. I'm not saying TRT needs to be eliminated, but it is misused. And that misuse is what I want to focus on. Just like the pill TRT shuts down your body's natural production of hormones and simply put that shit is not normal. Since the direct to consumer marketing is so aggressive, virtually every man is inquiring about this. And men, I'm not blaming you for inquiring. You're constantly fed the narrative that T levels are decreasing and yes, they are. And we should be concerned about that. Just because they're declining overall across genders does not mean that yours is low. In addition, In a 2017 study conducted on the US military, 4.5 out of every 1000 servicemen were prescribed TRT. Of those prescribed TRT, 44.5% met the guidelines for receiving it. Why the obsession with TRT amongst young men? Well, I asked you guys and my predictions were confirmed. Gym culture, women's standards and social media were the popular answers. I want this video to serve as a starting point for an important conversation regarding our society's obsession with synthetic hormones. I've gathered tons of studies that I'm going to share with you guys in a long form video in the upcoming weeks. This is not an attack on men. It's an attack on the lives that you're going to shed. Thank you very much. Can I be in charge for a while? A lot of quote, powerful forces of society out there that have essentially convinced a lot of young men that to try to approach a woman would mean rejection and that that rejection wouldn't just be a simple, no, that they could shrug off, but that it would be something damaging to their psyche, to their self-esteem, which is really too bad because as Alexander also notes, for the men who do approach women, most are successful to some extent, specifically 68% reported making at least one successful romantic connection. So yes, it is scary to approach a woman and potentially be rejected. And yes, odds are you will be rejected at least some of the time and potentially even all of the time. But still, I think a lot of young men out there who maybe do spend too much time on in-cell forums, they wrongly believe that it would be simply impossible for a woman to approach a man. And that's not true. It's not true. It's not true. It's not true. It's not true. They wrongly believe that it would be simply impossible for them to get a girlfriend when the data does show that actually it, it is possible for you to get a girlfriend. I know some people out there are going to throw out things like dating app statistics that say, no, only 20% of men, you know, are rated as attractive by women on dating apps or whatever it may be. But here's the thing, dating apps do not represent the entirety of dating. And I have no trouble believing that dating apps specifically are very hard for men because they're almost entirely men. Very few women are on dating apps. And so it really just skews success rates for males. I said, I'm getting a hose, man. No hose, man. What are you talking about? What is the gym? It's over there. You guys are going to, are you going to accept me as a gym rat now? Finally anybody see my, my interview. Sorry, I'm not doing this to flick. I swear to God. I have here. Look, I'll, I'll prove it to you. I'll prove this to you here. Look, see, I have to wear the old headphones because my road super pro, very expensive ones decided to take a shit on me. Just like a little while ago. You want to know why I was late? This is why I had to go fetch my old ones. Now I got to go see if they're still under warranty. Oh man. All he does is take time to put his hair back, put his hair back. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Jacked. Gosh. You guys think I'm Jack, man. You don't even see the guys that I go hang out with at the gym. Yep. Yep. Yep. You guys check out the, check out my video with a heat. A Tata heated Tata Yamagishi. He is the IFBB world champion, international Federation, international bodybuilding Federation, IBBF, like, I think that's what it's called. I'm mixing up my, mixing up my acronyms. Sorry. He, they thought I is a, the owner of powerhouse in Las Vegas, which is where I've been working out. When I go to Vegas to do, cause I, I live half of my life in Las Vegas now. And I live, you know, it's funny. It's, it's interesting. Whenever I wake up, I'm like, okay, where am I? Am I in Vegas? Am I in Reno? We are. Live from Reno, Nevada today. So there you go. Is roll on daddy. No, I'm a TR. If I don't know, does, does TRT count? Is that a, is that a, does that make me not Nadia care? According to this dumb bitch it does, but we're going to talk about that a little bit. Cause I got into that topic with my good friend. He day Tata and his trainer, George was his last name starts with an M Marine Moreno or something like Marengo. If you watch that video, which has been entirely demonetized now because I was stupid enough to not figure out that the overhead music at the gym was all copyrighted. So if you want to leave me a nice tip for that one, please do. Cause I ain't making any ad revenue, but it was too good an interview not to, not to, not to sort of prop up again. It was really good. I, I am, I think I, I probably need to do a little bit of explaining about that video here before I jump into a Jada Pinkett Smith being a demon. Cause I know y'all like your demonic possession conspiracies. So we're going to get into that. Yes. So anyways, I, I did that show and I, I did the interview. I did that at the red one, the studio, which is the Southern command center in Las Vegas. And it was really good. It was very well received. I mean, if I don't know what the view count is, but I thought it was, it was good enough for me to like it. So I don't know. That's all I got. I'm the only one I got to please. Right. So during that conversation, I was talking to George. He was the guy who is the train, I'll say trainer, but the training partner, like lifting partner, I guess. Peter Tata, and he also owns a put that I think I got it right here. I have his card. What am I doing? I should just give him a plug. Shouldn't I? Is it American medical? There it is. It's a. No, it's not that one. Here we go. I got his I have his card right here. It was a la la la la. It is American metal. Well American medical wellness and American male wellness is it is in Las Vegas, Nevada, and he has a I guess I guess you'd call it a hormone optimization clinic and I was listening to him and I was reviewing the video and I gave me a lot of ideas. I took a lot of notes. I wanted to sort of throw that down here. I'm going to get into that a little bit later today because I thought it was pretty good because it's not just about like male shaming. Everybody wants to say it's male shaming. I asked this question from George and I said, hey, why is it that we can give estrogen and hormone therapy essentially to menopausal women and there's no stigma attached to that. There's no, there's no, there's no tea. There's no, you know, estrogen tick-tock videos being thrown out. They're saying, oh my God, I can't believe we're doing this. We are banging the gong about like hormone optimization for women who are in menopause. We don't have a problem with that. But we do have a problem when a guy is taking TRT. They do have a problem when guys are hormone optimizing themselves. So she was, you know, talking about how the, you know, the, the, what is it? The US military soldiers are on TRT. They're being prescribed this but they're not meeting the standards for it. And I think we could probably get into some really deep discussions for that. I'm not the foremost leading expert on TRT and even Mike Sartain, who was the one who convinced me to try it in the first place. I mean, he knows a lot, don't get me wrong, but I would say that the guy, Dave, who was on Access Vegas with us on Thursday is a very much an expert on it and George also from American Medical Wellness and American Male Wellness in Las Vegas. They most definitely are and we talked about peptides and we talked about them right now. I know that they're going to be making peptides illegal, completely illegal, every single peptide included. Well, I know that Ozempic, which is semi-glutide, which is by the way, the Kardashian drug, women are taking, I guess it's Ozempic is the, is the, it's not the clinical name. The clinical name is semi-glutide, but it's so that it's for weight loss and some people are saying, oh, it's going to be the new fen-fen or something like that. And you know, everybody's like up in arms because women are taking it and losing weight and looking good. And when Rolla Tomasi goes on and takes TRT and I've been doing it since January of this year, by the way, so I haven't even done it for a full year yet and it makes effort feel good. It makes going to the gym feel good. I mean, I look forward to it. I want to anyways. I've always lifted. I'm people just like even before I was on TRT, I was, what was it? When I was, it was 2022 and I'd be on Myron and Fresh's show and I'd be wearing like a tank top because it's hot as fuck there, right? And I'm wearing a tank top and it's for actually, it's freezing in the, in the studio. So you go from like really super hot and humid outside because it's Florida and you go inside and they have to keep it like the whole room has to be refrigerated because I got so much hardware in there. But so you're going from, you know, cold to hot to cold to hot and I'm in there and people are looking at me and they're going, when did Rollo get so jacked? I'm like, dude, you only see me from like here down, right? In this, like every Sunday, 1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern. You only see me like this. You don't see me in the gym. You don't see me like, I mean, a few of you follow my band. So if you will, if you go and check out my band shots on Trial of Ascension on my Instagram, you might catch a full body shot of Rollo Tomasi. I'm not fat. I'm not even like, you know, I used to be very thin and people are making comparisons right now to like when I was doing the talks for the 21 convention and oh, look, his hair was all like, he must have had, he must have beat cancer. I'm like, no, dude, I didn't beat cancer. All right. I just had a different lifestyle then and I have a different lifestyle now. So the long and the short of it is, is you can change your body composition. You can change your mind about yourself. You can do, you don't have to be in the shit storm that you're in right now. You can choose to do something different and I think that's what bugs dumb bitches like this. Not going to like this one. If you're on board with girls ditching the pill, I'm going to need you to reassess your thoughts on TRT. I'm not saying TRT needs to be eliminated, but it is misused and that misuse is what I want to focus on. Just like, okay. So I want to just like, you know, because this is just like hot in my brain right now. So I'm just going to throw this out there. I was going to, I'm going to come back to this later on in the show today. But did you notice how she tries to compare this with a pill like right from the jump? Like, well, any of you because who talks about that by the way? Mostly red pill guys, right? Mostly like, well, I mean, you could also say like some of the more trad cons also talk about, you know, the pill makes women fat and crazy. Yeah, but it's it is what it is. We've the pills a bit. By the way, the pills been around since like what the early 60s actually, so I think maybe even the late 50s didn't become like super popular or they didn't really start the sexual revolution until the mid 60s, but be that as it may nobody was like, I mean, we've had well over 60. Let's just round it off 60 plus years to see what the effects of hormonal birth control have done, you know, messing with estrogen levels. And by the way, there's more than one pill. There's there's different. There's different effect. I'm not just saying I'm not just talking about what you call it. I'm not just talking about the the progesterone. I'm not just talking about those. There's there's actually different forms of pills and there's of course nor plant. There's this last I checked. I think that somebody can correct correct me if I'm wrong on this, but I believe there are something like 23 different forms of birth control for women right now. And there's one for men. Well to technically one is wrapped rascal to is keep her pecker in your pants. That's those are the two forms of birth control for guys, right? Why is there no wise? So when men decide that they're going to get you get on TRT and usually it's men who are I don't know late late 30s, maybe certainly into their 40s. Let's just say let's round it off again because we need a starting point. Let's just say mid 40s, right? Maybe early 40s. That's when you have a problem. That's what that's when it's a big deal, you know, and the reason for that I think is really comes down to intra sexual competition and the latter half of our show today is going to be dedicated to intra sexual competition and I've got three parts today. I'm going to try to stay on Target as much as standard. I'm going to stay on Target as much as I can today. The first part of today's show is going to be dedicated. Of course to the demoness herself, which is Jada Pinkett Smith and get out of here. Get out. So I'm going to talk about Jada Pinkett Smith because I am I stand vindicated. I should say I have been following the Jada Pinkett Smith Will Smith drama be it as it may since let's see July or June or July of 2020. That's when it came to my you know, my attention people said hey check out this red table talk with with Jada Pinkett Smith. I'm like, okay, and if you go back through my backlog and I was going to go and pull clips from my own videos out of you know, just so you guys get a fair context. I still might go and do that. I don't have them really queued up. But the reason why I didn't is because if I do I know damn well, I'm going to face copyright strikes and everybody in their mother because right now they're a hot commodity and I'm sure the algorithm is looking for Jada Pinkett Smith. There is the the interview right now and I don't know the interviewer's name the woman's name, but I showed it just briefly and I might come I think I might come back to it here in just a moment, but the the woman who was on the good morning. The today show the today show interview with her and what I think is interesting is that if this had been a guy if this had been on not Will Smith, but let's just say for sake of argument. You have a guy who explains to you that well, you know, we're still married and I'm all on board and everything else but we're living separate lives and blah blah blah and then later on seven years later. It comes out. Sorry. It was all bullshit. And here's my expose book. And by the way, they both have books. Do you remember Will Smith's book? Do you remember the interview with Oprah Winfrey? I sure the fuck do because I did a full-on video about it back when that happened because everybody was saying well, if you're not talking about Will Smith and you know, what what what good are you Rollo and there's a lot of red pill lessons that go along with Jada Pinkett Smith and I am not the foremost leading expert on hip-hop culture. I am not the foremost leading expert on Jada Pinkett Smith and her her, you know, Wild Ways and her background and Tupac and everything else, but I do know enough to see the patterns. I am very good at pattern recognition. So when I was talking about Will Smith and I was talking about Jada Pinkett Smith when they were on the red table talk, everybody gave me a just a heap and helping a shit and then when when she started mouthing off again on red table to her girlfriends, I started talking about, you know, the cucking of Will Smith then the what the cell phone video that came out because she was when people want to say it was leaked, but there was a leaked cell phone message or whatever it was to and I can't remember the name of the psychologist, but whoever their marriage counselor was who was like a celebrity pop psychologist at that time. I can't remember it's on the tip of my tongue. Somebody will remember this but the video was of it was Jada Pinkett Smith and she was the one who was shooting the video saying oh look at it's Will Smith and he's he's behaving childishly and look at him and now I need then she goes and she looks at her phone and she's like talking to her psychologist or whatever saying tell him he's behaving like a child, you know, and and Will Smith is there kind of not not having it and it was maybe a brief flash of out. Maybe he had just been fed up with her bullshit at that time, but it may it also put him in a bad light. There's no way Will Smith does not come out looking like shit in all of this. There's no way and I'll tell you I talked about this with Mike on just briefly on access Vegas and we were we were having some words about it like before and after the show. We didn't want to do a dedicated show about Jada and will because I know I was going to be doing this. Yeah, it's all about healing. Yeah, of course agent by the way today. I'm only going to be reading like 20 20 bought $20 and up super chats. I should have put that in the thing. Maybe a Sammy if you can do me a favor and announce that it's $20 and up and I'll read those I'll still be happy to put your stuff up there only because I got a lot of stuff to get to today. So just going to be a this is a very content dense show today and I've got I got all kinds of notes here about what I'm what we're going to get into. So what you got here? Let me throw that up. Okay. Okay. There you go. Did you have fun? Thanks here. I'm just going to throw these up. Is there a valid reason for women to take TRT? There is actually that's actually not too bad as a question. See, this is what I'm talking about. This is what slows the show down. But thank you very much. I appreciate each and every single one of these by the way. But the the long and the short of it is is that Jada got into this relationship and remember they've been at this for like close to 20 years now. I think it's like when I was looking at all I know it was it was when I was giving you the breakdown. In fact, maybe I'll do that again. Let me just throw this up there because it's easier to just sort of give you the the the condensed version of all this. If I just show you this one right here. No, maybe we just dig through these again. Too good not to. There we go. This one right here. And by the way, I had to keep this silent because I knew that there was some copyrighted music in this. Okay, 1997 just got married 1997. Look how short her hair is. Okay, so she's always had short hair. She's always had been like, you know, halfway bald. Okay. That seemed like a passionate kiss. No. Okay. So wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, because we have to look at the body language and all of this too. Okay, because I want you guys to see this. Look at the look at the look here. Wait, wait. I've got to see like that. Oh, that was it. Hold on. There that one that one right there. That's what the fuck are you doing? You've seen that look before. Have you guys seen this look before? I know you've seen this look before. If you've been with a chick for any amount of time and she's just kind of like she's I'm just with this motherfucker because I have to be that's the have to be just married 1997. Okay, and it yeah, you are most definitely that is a look of disgust. Okay. Now keep this in mind. I put I threw all the intro videos. All my intro videos were carefully curated today because it's going to it's going to tell the narrative of the demoness here. Okay, so that looks like. What were you doing? What were you just thinking now smile? Okay, see that see the big toothy grin that one right there. Got to remember that when you're casual and you're sort of emoting with your face with a facial gesture to we communicate in so many different ways. Now, remember that the cameras are on them always just married still 1997. There's the kind of it's almost the what is it the the fear grimace the the primate fear grimace, which is like this whenever you see like a chimp or you see a monkey of any kind like a gorilla or a bonobo or even macaque monkeys. They all do that. If you see them do that, that's actually a fear a fear reaction response a reflex. I should say it's also by the way, there was a time. I think there maybe it's still around now, but I remember when Roy C was talking about this back in the day. It's the the beta male or the new male new and you the new male fear grimace. It's the one where the guys are like they'll be showing whatever their new toy is and they're like like that it's and then they would compare it to like the you know, the monkeys that are like like this. It's just scary. Okay, see that? Wow. Wait a minute."}
