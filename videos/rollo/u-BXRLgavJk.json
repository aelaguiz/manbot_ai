All wings reporting! Red ten standing by. Red seven standing by. Red three standing by. Red six standing by. Red nine standing by. Red two standing by. Red eleven standing by. Red five standing by. Red five standing by. Are you threatening me? Are you threatening me? You want to fight me, don't you? All of you want to fight me. What you think, son? You say, man, this Escalation's got out of control. Ain't the best when you get into that today. I'm back, I'm back, I'm back. It's the secret weapon. Deep within the Nevada desert, live from Reno, Nevada. This is The Rational Male. Yep, yeah. I should not be doing this show today. I should be sleeping. But I am the hardest working man in the Red Pill. But you guys already knew that. No, you didn't. Thank you very much. Thank you very, very much. What? All right. You know what I need to do? I need to back up. Here, this is why. Okay, you guys see that license plate on that? That VW, that's right there. That's the VW, whatever that is. That backed up. Can anybody tell me what, what nationality, what country does this, does that license plate come from? Like, where, where did this come from? I mean, maybe it's an exotic and somebody's like, I could Joel X 23. I mean, is that a legit thing or is that a vanity play? It might be a vanity plate. I might be wrong. Can I get to Germany? So that is a German, a German car or a German? Well, license plate. Anyways, it's decorative. Yeah, you're probably right. I was going to say, I'm just wondering, like, the reason I wanted to know, it's like, is that like from Serbia or is that from Canada? Because that's the difference between these two. Like, I know that they're both foreign nationals, right? And that was the first thing. That was the first thing that that Myron brought up is that like, these guys are idiots even to do like, even if it's staged, if somebody like reported this to the cops and I, you'll know that it was staged when there are no police charges filed. Even the the the restaurant doesn't doesn't, you know, doesn't chime in doesn't doesn't because technically that's a crime like even just fighting is a crime where they press charges or not. That's that's still a, you know, a pub. I guess I want to say it's a public crime or something like that. But yeah, I think it's I think it's I'm fairly sure it's staged and here's the thing is I hate to have to like speculate that it is because what this represents to me is like an escalation an escalation in clout chasing an escalation and trying to get a you know, get a rise out of people because right now if you go through if you go through any of the twitch the twitch streamers if you go through any of the and I know there's all kinds of reddit subs. Thank highs high destiny subred. I know I see you guys too. I get your get your updates all the time. Hi Aiden Ross. Hi guys. Yeah, it's all over the place. I get it. But I sneak out to write but the the long and the short of it is this ends up becoming an escalation. Now, here's the here's the other side of the here. This is the story. You don't know. Okay. So when I am in Brickell with with Mike Sartain and Sterling Cooper was with me. We did we did our first show and it was this was right as the fight had just happened or the video just went live. And so I'm there stir. It was either Sterling or Mike sent me the video and I so I checked it out for you. Maybe my name not even have been them but I see had not even seen it. Big Mo hadn't seen it. We were looking at it like on my phone when when it had gone live so it would just it had just happened or the video had just gone live. So it was probably oddly enough. It probably happened about like like five minutes or ten minutes before I had to walk from my hotel over to the new place. I probably I probably just missed it, which is I'm like damn fight. I just got over there a little bit earlier, but up so I get over the studio. We're talking about and of course we're goofing on him or we're laughing it up and they've got it, you know, instantly got to put, you know, at John's Zorka in the titles and everything else. I get it. You know, they play the game, but I would have done it but so we're talking about it and me and me and Mike are like joking around and we're like, you know, he's was he's a John circus personal trainer and I'm John circus athletic psychologist. I don't know what Sterling was Sterling was his style stylist or something. I don't know but we know we were goofing on him the whole time and then we got done with that show, which by the way, I thought was probably the best show that we did during well during that for the freshman fit shows myself Mike and Sterling Cooper. I thought it was really excellent excellent show. It always is man because we always we talk some real shit. We're not like we're not it's it's like we it's a meeting of the minds and I really I think that Myron kind of misses that as well, but it was a really great show. So then we're done now. Here's the story part now. We're done and we go down to Chipotle, which is Chipotle pulled the whatever down downstairs because it's it's very close to where like they're it's no secret. They're they're building is the SLS down there. You can't miss it. And so we go down to Chipotle because we're in between shows we're in between our show and the after-hours show now, if you've ever been to the Chipotle in and Brickle, I mean, it's a nice place but like everyone goes there and so we go down there we get in we get our orders in we sit down on one of them long-ass benches thing and so it's now here's here's how it is. It's me. It's Myron Myron's girlfriend or some chick. He seems they're fresh is with us and Mike Sartain and myself. Okay, all of us are sitting there and I'm like looking around them. We would make an excellent target just sitting right here. You know, all of us together and Mike looks at me and he's he's kind of like he's he's looking a little sketch because Mike's Mike has situational awareness from the military, right? And we're looking around we're eating and stuff and hero even hero freshest dog fresh freshest Sheba and you his dog is with us and there's probably about maybe six guys. In the seven guys in the in the Chipotle with us and they're eyeing us and they're looking at us like they want to come and like ask us questions. They want to interrupt us but like we're but we're eating right so they don't know if it's like cool to come and like talk to us and when I'm in Brickell I get noticed all I get recognized all the time and I'm thinking maybe that was the whole thing but it wasn't and I figured out what it was soon as we were done Mike's like we got to get out of here. I'm like, why is that he's like because these guys have been eyeing us since we walked in here and I was like, okay, I figured it out and I don't know if they were like they want to start some shit because that was the thing to do on that day apparently because there was a bunch of other I don't feel Aiden Ross's guys or somebody there's like these twitch get kid gangs going after some other guy who do didn't like the other guy or some shit like that. And so there's like was a gang of like three of these guys. I think they were they might have been like circa guys or the tick tock ticky tocky guys. I don't know but there's like it was almost like it's like West Side Story. I'm like what the fuck is it like they're the most non-threatening you know, weesh guys. I'm like, why are we worried about these guys? Oh, but you know, you never know who's packing right? So so we leave and then when we're on the street and we're coming back and we're like so we're in between shows because we just had to eat something quick so we could get back up to the after-hour show. Then we had like at least at least two groups of individuals came up to Myron and myself and fresh and everybody and wanted to get our take on what was going on with the circa thing the circa fight and what was happening at that time. And then I came to what we and we couldn't do it. You know, we had to say sorry. We can't do it right now because we had to go do the show later on after the after the after-hour show with what's her name Jasmine Jafar. If you want me to talk about that, I'll be happy to as well. But but when we after that show, I know that Myron came down and talk to them again or for me for the first time because they were out in force. There's a lot of guys who are streamers or influencers or whatever the fuck. They're going up and down that Boulevard and probably looking to see if anybody if there's going to be something else because they wanted that scoop, right? They wanted to be the person to get the video put it on their channel and get the get the hits and the click so they could get some viral viral video. And so there was these groups of guys that were coming around basically. They just want to interview us. I didn't feel like threatened or anything by these guys, but I thought it was interesting because all it took and by the way, Berserker and Hs. Tiki time, maybe even Aiden Ross. Maybe they got more bang for their buck out of this, but it's this escalation and cloud chasing to the point where people were like, oh shit. There's something going down at the down on Miami Boulevard. Let's go over. Let's go check it out. Okay, go down there. I go hang out by Moxie's. They go up and down that strip right there looking and just waiting for shit or waiting for Myron and fresh to come out or maybe me. I don't know or whoever and get their take on what just what just happened. And maybe hopefully there's going to be some more violence or maybe somebody else is going to get punched punched in the face. And I was I realize there's probably about four or five groups of guys that were down there like maybe in pairs or something like that. We're going around with you know with their phones and whatever maybe even their you know, their small small rigs and looking for looking for something. So so yeah. If anybody knows anything different, I'm I would love to have you guys tell me what's going on. But yeah, I think what's funny is like everybody is talking about why you went. Oh, would you like me to tell you why I'll tell you exactly why I'll get I'll get to you on that. Hang on one sec. You know what? I got to do here. I have to sorry. I have to because the stream is now starting to slow down and I have to do this. You have to bear with me. So I need to video this really quickly here. So I got you sound if you could see that maybe you can. So when I hide comments, I need to sorry. I have to take this video because it only shows from my side right here. And like if I go to like central bohemian, thank you very much for your thing. I click on here and it doesn't still doesn't want to come up. And then it's very very slow. I'm also going to sorry. I'm I have to take I have to video this real quick because I'm going to send this to stream here because it doesn't show on your side. It shows on my side. So thank you very much for that. And then if I close this out fades. I let it out. There we go. Yeah, so that's very very slow. All right. That's video number one. Sorry. I had to do a sound show. Thank you very much for your 49. Oh, hello. Once you read once you read pill one are either going to love you or hate you. There is no in-between. Thanks for saving me from becoming a cuck in both relationships and dating single moms. I still date them but I'm upfront about my intentions and they love it. Well good, you know, people always like to think that I want to say in fact, we're going to in fact, we'll get into this here in a little bit for some of the video that I'm going to riff on today. But a lot of people want to say that the red pill will tell you avoid single mothers. Yeah avoid marrying them avoid, you know investing in children that are not your own and we also explain why that is in the nuts and bolts of that for sure. But again, it's just it's information and people just simply don't like that. They don't like the fact that if you are in any way revealing some sort of unflattering details or unflattering statistics about women that that automatically means that you are preaching something or you're trying to convince somebody of something and I want to point this out right now. I don't I don't think like except for maybe like Rich Cooper who has essentially built a brand off of like no single mommies right in the divorce machine that I other than him. I don't think anybody else has been talking about that much and even yes, I understand Donovan Sharp is married a single mother or whatever we get that that's old news by the way. But be it be that as it may I mean you could if you think that's hypocrisy on his part or anyone else's please take that up with him. That's not that's nothing that I've ever gotten into in the show. Oh, what do we got here? See I hate this shit. Can we get that? There we go. There you go. Rollo bro. I keep doing what you guys are doing good work by watching listening good God work God work God's work by watching listening you and Michael Sartain on a schedule feels like red pill iOS software update Jen 2023. Well, thank you very much for that. Gosh, I was going to make a if you guys want me to read it on screen. I'm just do $10 and up today unless you unless you have this $2 super chat and you make fun of Chris pox and then I'll read that one. What do we got? Shout out to Mr. Producer for awesome content while you and Mike were away the sharps Elena and Ruslan at red one students. I saw that also do you like the Spanish Greyhounds Galgos in my profile? Yes, I do. I love girl goes, you know, it's a any kind of sight hound feral hounds sight hounds Galgos Saluki's. I know that's kind of like my breed. Um, oh well, and by the way, Ned is. It's like Ned basically wants to run on three legs right now. He's like a tripod dog. It's only because he's got his his stilts. He's got his his his splint is on which by the way is coming off tomorrow. So if by the way, if you still want me to sign his cast give it to me today and I'll be happy to put it on there because it's coming off tomorrow and I'll take another picture of it. If you guys really want to give me a super chat and I'll put your name on there. There's still a little bit of room on the back. But I thank you guys for for all your donations and helping out with with with Ned's medical funds. They weren't cheap, but but if you want to get your name on the cast, I'll be happy to do that for you. Thank you. Yeah, I I did see I did see the part of the Ruslan thing when it was going live, but it's it's such a it's a reheat is all it is. I mean, you're just basically covering old ground and I mean God bless, you know, Glenn for for doing it. That was supposed to have happened in San Diego, right? Glenn, but you know, be that as it may I don't think you're going to I don't you're not going to convince him of anything because it's always going to come down to, you know, can Tarzan beat up Superman? I thought that's all it comes down to and even if you have the most and I learned this by the way over the course of this weekend as well. You can have the most empirical hard data and people will still say, oh, well that was from 2015. That was from 2019. It's not no longer whatever it is or that was done by this person or the Pew Research Center and you can't trust them in the CDC. Are you kidding? Where were you in 2020? There's there's so many ways to make things unfalsifiable and that's something I actually want to get into today as well. But yeah, I thought was actually I thought Donovan's Donovan show with Elena and Elena. Thank you for for for being there. I wish I we hit the wrong weekend. I would have loved to have seen you when I was out there, but I was in I was in Miami. I got to you already. Hang on. This is like the worst. I don't know why this is doing this. There we go. That's right. Got that right. Hardest working man. That Zerka fight looks staged. Yeah. I think no fight not staged. Okay. No more excuses from corny for corny and embarrassing behavior. No fight not staged. You don't think so? I don't know man. I don't know. It's it doesn't it certainly didn't smell right to me. Sir, any sir anything on acoustic? Well, actually, yes, if you listen to the introduction for Phoenix, which is our second EP for Trial of Ascension, go get it on Spotify. Actually, the links in the description, listen to the intro to that. That's actually an Irish bouzouki that I'm playing in that one. Ever heard of Jeff Williams's solos are sick. What band? No, maybe I have. I probably have. I just don't know. Jeff Williams is roll a Wednesday night at FNF after hours with Sartain was great Friday night. Not so much for obvious reasons. Yeah, and I'll explain. I'll explain why I ducked out of there on that. This is for Ned's college fund. Thank you very much. And you know what? I need to do one more thing because I know what's going to happen on this. I need to sorry. I gotta have to get some more video of this really quickly. So Ned's college fund. Thank you very much. Now, let's get rid of it. What was this? Let me see there. See, I can't even see. I can't even get that one to show up. There we go. I heard you ate. You ain't got no husband. Thank you. Yeah. No, I apparently you didn't see me at a at Adam Sosnick show. And see then it pops up once again when I hit that again. There we go. This is better. Okay. All right, good enough. I think that'll be enough for streaming or to get an idea what's going on with my system here. Roll a serious question. If you have a 50 million if you have a 50 million dollars and a yacht and a private jet and you're 30, what's the best way? You can get an e-girl on OnlyFans model to be your girlfriend. Also the Windsor cup you think with circle one. I think the ambiguity of whether or not somebody wanted they didn't is probably what's really stoking all the engagement right now, but if you have 50 million dollars and a yacht and a private jet like first of all, what the fuck are you doing? And please tell me and you're 30. Of the best way to get an e-girl. Why would you want an e-girl? Like that's it. I know this is a goof question. Why would you want? Why would you want a girlfriend at all? This is what I'd really like to know. Garrett Garrett Gaines, my man, my man, Garrett Gaines in the house. Everybody everybody. We're there. It is. Garrett Gaines, my my newest protege. If you haven't seen Garrett Gaines, I've used his his his clips in my shows before he does sort of like man on the street kind of interview type stuff. And it's really good. I really enjoy his content. That's why I've been sort of buffing him out lately. We will probably have him in Vegas January right right around the avn awards and I definitely want to set him up in some situations where he's going to get some much better responses. I think so. I'm not trying to set you up Garrett. Anyways, let's set up a boxing match between me and purple pill Sergio like Sergio Solis. Sergio will probably do it too. That's why. Can I show this please? There we go. Lord panic Uncle Rolo little behind on the show. However brand management book five. Thank you taught me how but book five the where to go. Whenever you mention a book on here. I have to bring out the whip out the book book five, which is the players handbook. Thank you. Taught me how anything we see online is not real. Yeah, you know who taught me that Mike Sartain after reading brand management. It's now what if anything we watch is not real thoughts. Yeah, it will certainly put you in a frame of mind and I think that's a really good question Lord panic. One thing that I think that I covered actually my fourth book in in religion in the introduction section of that was I was I was talking about the differences sort of like societally and just sort of like in our collective conscious between the 20th century and the 21st century and what we know now because we have social media because we have more access. We have like mass media. I should say maybe that's a better term mass media of the internet. Like I could not exist right now. If it were not for the internet, like I wouldn't be able to do what I'm doing right here. I wouldn't be able to write these books. I remember I mean how I went to I went to universe. I went to college at a time. I remember I went later in life when I was on the cusp of having you know, pretty decent information available online, but I still use the University Library had to go and look up actual, you know books and read books and stuff like that, especially for case studies and experiments and research for psychology research, so I did it analog for half of it. I used of course I use the internet back then. Of course we have the internet but it was not nearly as advanced or I would just say as easy to use as it is right now. And when we started having these conversations about like fake news in 2016 when Trump was a thing, it was starting to become a thing and I thought about this and I go, you know, some of this just seems like it's just unfalsifiable bullshit and that people just want to be able to sort of back up their own bullshit, but then I realized, you know, I the only reason I'm able to do what I do right now is because I have access to so much information. So when I was asked on the dance project about like, what is the red pill and I have to I give my standard answer and everybody thinks all roller just likes to talk about himself. He just like he's so long-winded because I have to be because if I'm not some dumb fuck autistic child from Twitch will go road doesn't know this. Can you imagine not knowing that what an old man like that's that's the response that I'm ready for already. So if I'm not comprehensive, if I don't like say something like if I don't back up with the fuck I'm saying and I don't do that like I'm the way I think right now is is really a result of my writing for the last 20 some odd years because when I'm right even when I do but a new sub stack which by the way, I've just post a new one, but even when I'm writing sub stack or writing my blog or I'm writing a book. I'm always thinking what how is this going to be misinterpreted if all you got was one little snippet of this paragraph right here who's going to take that and say all the red pill is all about, you know, you know cheating on your hose. That's that's what they'll say. So what I have to do is I have to think like like I'm playing chess two or three steps ahead of my opponent. I know what the criticism is going to be. I've done it long enough to know what the criticism is going to be before it even gets asked. So yes, I do get a little long-winded because of that, but it's by necessity. Well, why can't you just make things simple? If it was real, it will be simple and easy to understand. No. No, it's not the red pill is a college course. That's why we call this a podcast red pill 101. You go to school. You it's a college. It's a it's a college major because I have to know something about Neurology Neurology of brain science. I have to know endocrinology. I have to know evolutionary psychology evolutionary biology anthropology sociology health political science. I have to know something about economics too, right because there's so much crossover and I am a jack-of-all-trades a master of some that is but no by no means all so so I still like if somebody has a better working knowledge of it, for instance, like Jim Sexton when it comes to divorce. I'm happy to tap his knowledge base to you know, at least relate something and sort of dovetail it into some concepts that I've used in the past, right? That's why I was kind of just I really really wanted to get Jim out there. We got some other stuff coming up with Jim in Vegas and Jim by the way, Jim second James section. My God, he's he's been on Lex Friedman. He's already talking to Chris Williamson. Good luck there man, Jim. If you're talking to Chris, make sure you drop my name like six or seven times in that show and you'll just watch that. I twitch kind of come on that have fees like watch watch for that. It's so funny. I got I have I actually have an interview to of on trigonometry really with with Chris that I'm going to talk about today, but I have to I have to be a master of all trades and or a jack-of-all-trades and a master of some and that's always why I get if you want to know why I get long-winded or why if I have to like explain what the Manusphere is about that's that's usually why but it comes down to this want for like this 20th century simplicity. And this 21st century need to back up whatever the fuck you're talking about. And so when we look and we say, okay, well this news is fake news and that news is legitimate news or we see something happen live in real time. We can't even necessarily believe like live in real time that this shit hasn't been staged. So if we look at the Zerka fight, for example, I hate that I think this way, but I have to think this way that my first presumption is this is bullshit because I know the individual well, I know Zerko's involved. It's got to be bullshit, but I know who bankroll Zerka wink wink nod nod and I know the pre the build-up the pre pre-show that happened before all this happened. So of course the first thing I'm going to ask you guys is do you think this is a hoax? Do you think this is a hose job, right? And maybe it is maybe it's not even when I did the the Chris Rock or excuse me, the the Will Smith Will Smith smacked Chris Rock. It certainly looks like it was bullshit or it could have been some sort of setup now in light of all the crap that went on after Jada Pinkett Smith, you know comes clean. Nobody wants to talk about Rollo. You're wrong. You want to talk about running up the flagpole? I got run the flagpole for that thing. And then when she comes out and says I don't we haven't called each other husband and wife for ages, right? Like when she's in the in that interview, I'm like fuck where up like where's my props vindication? Where the fuck is the problem that nobody remembers and nobody cares. They only care about like wanting to prove you wrong at least in the moment right there, but I have to like presume that anything that happens like that is that big a deal is bullshit. It's it's it's in some way a setup. And I also want to put and so would you like another example of this? Remember when I said that Adam 22 and lead of the plug and all that crap that went down with him being upset about like giving her to another man a big black man like Jason Love and I think at Jason Love and and Destiny just happened to be at the no jumper studio. Let's talk to just the biggest cock in the world. Oh good. My boy. What what good fortune we have let's get this blue haired guy in here and talk about cuckoldry. Well, how do you feel in your open relationship about letting your wife go bang other guys because I just let a woman or a man just go bang my my wife for the first time, but you know, she is a porn star and so am I and I feel really bad about it the fuck out of here. Who doesn't see this as a hose job? Who doesn't see this as a bit? Apparently nobody but when I so but when I said Adam 22 and all that crap like there's always one event right the event in this case was the porn shoot the movie when the porn movie was released two weeks later build up for two weeks to the event and then you got like the Logan Paul thing what then that built up to the fight and it's just this big whether it's legit or it's not the people who are behind the scenes of handlers that are doing this are still playing it up as much as they possibly can because they want schmucks like me to go and like, you know, play the video. This is exactly what's going on. I think with the Zirka thing, but vindication. Thank you very much. I told Mike this too. I said, I think the Adam 22 lean of the plug thing is just just has been a big meta scale setup. Well, lo and behold, most likely taking the money he made off of that that porn."}
