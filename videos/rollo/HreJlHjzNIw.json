What's up, guys? Welcome to Fresher Fit and Access Vegas, man. It's a special show. We've got the whole squad here. We're dual streaming. Actually, maybe tri-casting in this case. Yeah. We're Fresher Fit, Michael Sartain, Rolo Tomas. We've got a bunch of lovely ladies here. We don't got our intro song here, so we're just going to get right into it, guys, with the announcements. Rumble.com slash fresher fit. Go ahead and get all the behind-the-scenes content there, because you know we're going to get kicked off YouTube at some point. Fresherfit.locals.com.

We have a new Access Vegas channel. You can check out Rolo's channel. He's got Rolo Tomasi, Rational Mail, and Rational Mail Clips. For me, it's just Michael Sartain. You can find that for my podcast, and we do Access Vegas. I was going to say, you're probably already watching on my channel as it is. We're simulcasting right now to my channel, and you guys' channel will be on mine for the first hour, and then we'll switch over to you guys. We do now have a dedicated Access Vegas channel. Go sub to that, just so we can get up above 1,000. It's really just an archive right now, but we're trying to build it up, so we have a dedicated place. Today, if any of you guys are on my channel, don't super chat on my channel. Either go to Rolo's at the first hour, or go to Fresher Fit and super chat over there, okay? Cool. So, what else was I going to say? Oh, and then get my book, Why Women Deserve Less. Number one Amazon bestseller. Yeah, but it's only 75 pages, bro. Yeah, that's it. It's like they deserve less, bro. Hey, man. You only gave them 75 pages. Why they deserve less? They should have had more less. They didn't get enough less, bro. Yeah, I know. It's fine. All right. So, we're going to go ahead and go around the table and have the ladies introduce themselves. Go ahead, Fresh. Ladies, on the panel, give us your name, your age, what you do for a living, dating status, and if you want, of course, your body count. And we'll start right here. So, name, age, what you do for a living. Well, hi, CEO. I'm Toy Hardy. I go by Toy Hardy, CEO, as well. I'm also dropping a book. It's called The Desired CEO, The Leadership Bible.

So, what is your age? Under 35. Look, look, look. Is this a law that I didn't know about before? Yeah. So, 34? I'm not 35. Close enough. She's not 35.

I have adult conversations all the time. Okay. So, how old are you? I just want to say what I have to say. I'm sorry? If I may, again, explain who I am. I don't like to talk about my age. I think it's neither here nor there. It might be important to you, but it's not, because I'm still a millionaire, under 35, and that's important to me. That's fantastic. So, am I a nice share of my age? So, how old are you? That's good for you. Okay. I'm happy. So? You're beautiful. 34. 34? Can we just put 34, just so we can move forward?

Microphone. Taking the shredded boy. So $40,000 a year? Mm-hmm. Really? You'd be okay with that? Yeah. You guys don't know me. We've talked about this in previous podcasts. I was the breadwinner. I've seen her boyfriend. He's shredded, and that's probably not good. But not even that. I was the breadwinner in all my past relationships, and I always took care of my\u2014 Where are those guys now, though? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Where are those guys now, though? Doing boy tings. Fuck boy tings. I don't know. Exactly. That's my point. It doesn't last. It doesn't last when women are breadwinners. But I'm not interested in their money. I'm interested in the connection I have. Are you the breadwinner in your current relationship? No. Oh, okay. Interesting. Yeah. Okay. Perfect example of women say one thing and do another. But okay, we'll keep going. We are equal. We're exactly equal in financials. You guys make the same amount? Mm-hmm. Are you guys the same in\u2014like, is there equal\u2014is it equal partnership in your relationship? Yes. Absolutely. Why wouldn't it be? Who has the final say? In what? He's the man of the house, so he can decide on certain things, but I own the house, so I have the final say in certain things. Yeah. She wears the pants in a relationship. Okay. You're the boss. All right. Move on. Yeah. B for me. Dad bod, 70K. Dad bod, 70,000? Really? Yeah. Why? I like dad bods. A little fluff. Yeah. Why not? Giving Leonardo DiCaprio, right? Yeah, but he's a multi-millionaire. I mean, Shredded's cool and fun, but they\u2014I don't know. I'm\u2014 Okay. What about you? Cap, cap, cap, cap. What about you? Well, I've tried the big boy stage, because I'm actually\u2014I love husky boys. I go for over 200 pounds. Big boy. I need a big boy. Well, that's not husky if you're over 200 pounds. I'm 230. I'm not that husky. Well, my last one, I would say that was like\u2014my last Chubby Chaser man that I picked up was 375. Yeah. Okay. That's a little bigger. Yeah. He was a little bit bigger, but he wasn't very\u2014 You could cut him open and sleep inside of him during the winter. Right? Oh, my God. He was a little bit bigger. He was a little bit bigger, but he wasn't very\u2014 Okay. That's a little bigger. Yeah. He was a little bit bigger, but he wasn't very\u2014 You could cut him open and sleep inside of him during the winter. Right? Oh, my God. So, no joke. I almost got stuck under there. Yeah. But that's a different story. Yeah. I've got lots of stories. So, I would go with the dad bod, though. Just keep it simple. Katie, go. Because\u2014 Well, question. If you would go with the dad bod, why aren't you with one right now? There's plenty of fat dudes all over the place. Well, that's the thing. So, like I said, stories. So, my larger man, like, it was really, really hard to be with him, because it was like lifting him up into the shower. Like, I had to, like, literally had to perch himself and push his arm on my shoulder. You're an angel. And oh, my God. He was a big boy. What? Did you need a winch? I know, right? And so\u2014 Did he have a lot of money? No. And that's the thing. So, you were with a fat bro guy? Yeah. He had a very big name in Playboy, but I can't say it. But I'm just saying, like, he was a big guy. Oh, he had status. He had status. There's always something, bro. There's always something, bro. He had status. But, like, literally, I can tell you right now, he's a very famous photographer. And I told him, like, I won't model for you or have\u2014take pictures of me. Doesn't matter where you're at. Miami, Vegas. Doesn't matter. You should mention that first. But, honestly, I never took pictures with him. I said, I'm here for you and you only. I'm not here for anything else. No pictures of me. What happened to the noise? That's not true, because he had status. Yeah, it was broken back. Yeah, but even if he had status, I never shot with him. But that's why you were with him? No. That was not\u2014I was with him for his chunkiness. I love thick men. Was he black or white? He was white. She's capping all over the place. What about you? A, B, or C? I mean, if I have to pick, B. Like, none of them are ideal. You'll take a guy that makes $70,000 a year? I'd prefer not to. I'd rather be in shape and take. Well, it's one, two, or three. It's $40,000 per year. It's two then. So, you'll take $70,000 per year, but dad bod? Dad bod. Yeah. Okay. All right, what about you? I would say the same thing. Like, at the end of the day, like, with the Beyonce and Jay-Z, they say that women have better relationships when they're way hotter than their guys, so I love that. And then speaking of, you guys had a really muscular, buff celebrity on your show in Miami who is my ex, a famous boxer, and he's the biggest narcissist cat person ever. Everything he said on the show was a lie. Who are you talking about? I know who she means. Mike Rasheed. Who? Yeah, Mike Rasheed. At least he tells his age. But anyway, at least he's not scared to tell his age. I'm not scared. I just would rather a conversation be about something else. Because you're going to tell me something about my age, but I've literally defied statistics. I literally wasn't going to say anything about your age, just for data collection purposes, but I don't know why you're so worried about it. I'm not. You are. You ask me a thousand times. But this is our show, and this is how we ask questions. We collect data on the girls that we interview so that we can compile the data. I'm 33, okay? I can tell she's a CEO. I can tell she's a CEO. All right. Hey. 33. Thirty-three years old. Well, I mean, you could say Mike is cat, but he's pretty real with everything he says. Hey, George, what's the next one? Scorned women. Questions for the ladies in the room. What is your least favorite sex position and why? Okay. We'll start here and then work our way. Broke? Was that the position? No, sorry. That's my title to say? CEO? Yeah. Toya, least favorite sex position? Um... Least favorite... Mmm... I look missionary, so probably, like, maybe from the back. You don't? That's your least favorite? I like missionary. I like the, you know, I like I'm attracted to my person. Kiss me in the face. Whisper in my ear. Eye contact. Who cares? I don't know. I have good vagina. So, and a cute face. So no one minds looking me in the face and saying, So my least favorite, CJ actually talked about this on her podcast. When, like, a guy has your legs above, like, on his shoulders and you're like... American psycho. And, like, you feel like, you're like, oh my god, like, I am so many roles right now. That's a good point. Damn. And, like, then you're like, I might as well fold all the way in half so that you can't see my roles. That's my least favorite. If that's what you're worried about during sex, then you're not having good sex. Veronica. Okay, I think, like, when the guy tries to be like, we can do it standing up, it's like, oh no. And it's like, here, you can bend over. It's okay. I'm like, oh no, because I'm so short. I'm like 4'9\". And your man is 400 pounds, so that's... Minus the chunky guys. Okay, minus the chunky guys, because that's why I don't date them anymore. I do Viagra and do all that shit. Did the 375 pound man ask to have sex with you standing up when you're 4'9\"? Did that ever happen? I think once, but, like, maybe he had to have, like, to sit in his chair, you know? And then I had to a little bit, but that's the thing. But his penis can't reach you. He's 375 pounds. Exactly. That's why you have to lift up his, like, fat apron and put it on my back. And it's pretty sexy. I fucking like it. I'm sorry. I like it. I'm sorry. Are you well? I'm sorry. I'm gonna go with the standing up thing, too. Anything standing up. But standing up like that, and it's like, we can do this, like, no. I can barely touch the ground. Alright, we're gonna move on. You talk too much. Anything standing up. Anything standing up, I agree. I don't like it. I don't know. It's weird. It's uncomfortable. It's weird. And you're not 4'9\". You're 6'1\". And she's 4'9\". Yeah. I'm barely making it. Yeah. Jamie. Miss Preston. What? Jessie. Go. Anything laying on my side, I think. You can't really get the momentum that you want. I feel like. Okay. No side action. No friction. No shower sucks. That fucks her hair up. Alright. Not even about the hair. I don't care about that. It's the water. Water's not your friend. Shout out to the lube company. It's called Sensuva. Maybe slip it. I guess anything to do with the ass. That's not a position. Anal is a position. Sex. Yeah.

Can I upgrade? I think I look better with no makeup than I do with makeup and stuff. Why wear it? Just like standards, right? If you don't wear makeup, they're going to be like, nah. No, if you look better, then don't wear it. That's not true. The whole definition of makeup is to make up for a lack of aesthetics, which is why girls wear it in the first place.

What about you? Do you think of something? I'm really sweet and kind and caring. Feminine. Yeah, I'm very feminine and submissive in bed. But I could also be dominant. I could switch. But I'm also... So you said you're submissive in bed. Are you submissive all the time or just in bed? Mostly, which is not good. I've been with people who have taken advantage of that. She brings flexibility to a relationship. Yeah, so... But kindness is really important. I know a lot of people are really fucking mean. So it's good to be a good person. So, yeah. And also, another thing. I would say that in a relationship, you want to prove that you really love that person and care about them. So that's what you bring to a relationship, Liz.

I would guide my family. Anything that required or would benefit from it. But would you want that with your man? The same way that I would need to be guided in certain areas of life."}
