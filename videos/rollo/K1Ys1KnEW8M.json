So, like, really, like, y'all acting like he really popping, pushing key, like, y'all acting like he came out the womb saying, pee! That guy's not retarded. Come on, now. Oh, boy. You guys ready for this? This is actually technically my first official show of the new year, and oh, my God. Oh, my God. We're already in deep. We're only seven days into the new year. Seven days. I think I might have been a little premature with my predictions. Live from Regal, Nevada, this is me, Rational Male. Deep in the heart of the Nevada desert. High desert tonight. Nuclear. Deep within the confines of my mother's basement, apparently. Fifty-five years old, sitting here. Mom! Mom! And Cheetos! Are you looking for ways to use those delicious Chrissy Hamm leftovers? Well, I've got the perfect brekkie recipe for you. Introducing my Chrissy Hamm Brekkie Sandwich featuring Abbott's Bakery Rustic White Bread. Now, Abbott's Bakery Bread is for those who see their kitchen as a playground to feed their creativity and evoke delight. Made for the makers, this premium, versatile range is my favorite gluten-free, dairy-free bread option. Soft, delicious, and doesn't fall apart in your hands. Now, for my recipe today, all you'll need is avo, tomato, egg, your Chrissy Hamm leftovers, my secret marmalade, clove, Dijon mustard, and mustard seed glaze sauce. And of course, the star of the show, your Abbott's Bakery Bread of choice. I've chosen Rustic White, but there's so many in the range to choose from. Merry Christmas, and I hope you enjoy. Oh my god. They just fit so perfectly. They remind me of something. I just can't... I just can't put my tongue on it. What do they remind you of? I don't know, but... Oh my gosh. This... Mmm. The size. The smell. The moon must be in retrograde or something. I just... Look, this one's even bigger. Oh my god. It's like... So juicy. I don't know why. Bright stone once. I'm pretty sure the whole conversation, I pushed him pretty hard. What was hard, Ariel? The therapist will essentially give him SSRIs, which I think you know the sexual effects that SSRIs have on the body, right? Some. There's tons of MAOs and tricyclics. You're talking about the type of SSRIs that used to be given to pedophiles. We don't give those to men. We don't give those to men. We don't give those to men. But he's not as informed as I think people like to be. Yeah. Well, I'm a whore! Least desired by men, I most judged other women. Towards the end of junior high, transitioning into high school, I developed a major tumor within one of my ovaries, and it would go undiagnosed for about six years. By the time it was removed, it was ten pounds. It was basically fully occupying my ovary. Oh no! It seems like that tumor stunted a lot of my secondary sex characteristic development, specifically my breasts. And so during high school, I had... I had... no breasts, and the tumor was becoming so enlarged that it made me look constantly slightly overweight. I was... flat and fat. Needless to say, not exactly the ire, the male gaze, the object of sexual desire. I wasn't very sexy in high school. And when I think about that time, it happens to coincide with the time that I felt most religiously superior to all of these girls. It was like this massive nerd copium where it's like, you can't make me insecure, because I'm better than you, because I hate myself. The time I was most judgmental toward other women when they had, like, relations with boys was when I hated how my body looked, and more importantly, I was angry that boys didn't look at my body, that they didn't love me. This is when I was most sold out to this rigid view of good women prescribed to me by the church. The more that men rejected what my body was, the more I rejected what women could be, and the more that I hated women who were what I should be. My creeping, aching sexism feasted on the anger I had for what wasn't mine. Toward women who just were breasted, were wanted, were nice, were sweet. The sexuality of womanhood evaded me, and I lied to myself that I was better off for it. And it was during this same period of judging other women, of jealously hating them for having what I couldn't have, and then coping and pretending like I was proud of it. It was the same period that I remember going to church every single Sunday and begging God to change my personality because I was convinced that he had messed up. I just, I just wanted to be light and nice and happy, just like all the other girls. Or so I thought. He was here with another girl. Don't listen to him. No, no, I don't think that was his friend. I think. I hope, I hope. You were on the show! Oh, no, no, no. I'm not sure he was with someone. No, I don't mean like with, with someone. He brought a friend, like a lady friend. Oh, okay. That was when I met him. There is so much tension in this room right now. Are you telling me you met here on the sauce cast where finance meets romance? We did it! The sexiest financial show in the world that we just made our first love connection Chuck Woolery style. Yay! Wow. I'm looking forward to it. I love that! He was here with a girl and she was still like, I'm getting that motherfucker. Wow. Yeah. I think you were on that show, bro. I was. Yeah, yeah, you were. Is this story true? Yeah, 100%. Wow. Kevin Savo. I have his number. We might have to call Kevin. Hold on. You should call Kevin. Guys, I'm sorry. Call him and put him on speaker. I'm sorry right here. Well, congratulations. He should start a hotline. 1-800-SAVO. He does. His name is Savo because his last name is Savo. Kevin Savo. Let's see if he answers. Hold on. It's ringing over here. You know what? I won't be offended if he picks up your call. Kevin Savo! We can't hear you. How you doing, bro? What's up, man? I'm out with this chick right now. Can I call you back in a little bit? What? What? He's saving hoes. What are you doing right now? You're live on a podcast right now with Lauren De La Guna, your fianc\u00e9e. Oh my God, Kevin. Are you cheating on me? Yeah, that nigga is. What is happening right now? Oh my God. Kevin, I'm gonna call you back. I feel like I just took a bath in battery acid. But he's short. A one. He's shorter than me. He's a one. Okay. Seven. Oh, I'm sorry. I really need tall guys. So, uh, he's like a six. He's a six. You're never gonna score. You're never gonna score. I have a lot of short friends, but... What about he's shorter than you? Three. And then what about shorter than you? Personal opinion, but I'm just not attracted to shorter guys shorter than me, so I'm gonna go with a five. He's a four, but he's rich. That's all you know about him. I'll go seven. Six. Okay, so he's like a seven. Eight. He's a six, but he drives a luxury car. He'll bump up a little bit, so seven. Seven. An eight. He's a five, but he has a boat. Eight. Six point five. A ten. Guilty! Guilty! Guilty! Guilty! I tried out threesomes. Threesomes? Yeah, the first couple were good, but then they got kind of weird because he kept losing interest in the other girls. I just didn't know that you were into threesomes. It's kind of neat. No, I'm just like done with all that. Well, I'm a whore! I'm so happy you don't like me anymore. Yeah, I could see why that would make you happy. What's your point of reference to what a marriage is? How can I naturally know how to be something I was never raised by? You don't know what a wife is because you've never had to blueprint a point of reference of what a wife is. In your mind, a wife is just getting a ring. That's not a wife. Are you ready to mentally, spiritually, emotionally hold your man down? Or is it just about getting a ring and being able to say, I's married now. This is not the color purple. This is reality. You don't have what it takes to be a wife. It's not just about the man. That's not the reason that marriage has failed. They love to blame it on the man. They love to say, he cheated on me. That's why it's over. I am bored out of my mind. I'm with you. Listen, the last relationship I was in, a couple of relationships ago. I thought you said the last one. I thought this was just not you. I told this woman, I swear to God, man. I swear to God. I'm just telling the truth, man. That means I'm telling the truth. I swear, man, I told this woman. I was stranded on, and I was so bored. I went through the worst periods of my life on a personal level. This woman didn't know what to say or do to help me to get through. You were physically there, but I still felt alone. I said to her, if I was stranded on an island, and they said, you can take either a thing or a person, it wouldn't be you. You told her that? I told her that. You probably could have just broken up if you didn't have to say that. That wasn't about tearing her down. Listen, I'm already on an island, and I feel by myself. Tell these bitches to go to hell. I told you about the manopause, this thing that I'd come up with. So I noticed toward the end of my 20s that lots of guys who had been training with a particular modality, usually bodybuilding, usually exclusively for the way that they looked, realized as they approached their 30s that they were getting out of breath, going up a set of stairs. Who the fuck is he? A 30? They maybe couldn't touch their toes, and they looked fantastic. But they just felt like they should maybe start to value different things. You know, come to think of it, I don't think I've ever seen Chris Williamson with a chick. Just saying. They then changed their training, and they would go and do Brazilian jiu-jitsu or yoga or CrossFit. And that precipitated a change in everything else. And I saw this in myself. I get toward the end of my 20s. I've achieved success in many of the ways that society tells a young man that he should value success. There was a discordance. Something felt off. You then think, maybe I need to assess whether or not the things that I've been told I should want are things that I actually want to want. Those guys are back! It feels like a quarter-life crisis. I think so many men go through this. No, just you. In the community, they don't really extend any grace to women. You know, they will bash women for being single moms. They will bash women for having an OnlyFans. And they have a lot of empathy for men that are incels. They have a lot of empathy for that, but then they don't have empathy for intimate partner violence. That's something that I never hear them talk about on the show. And that's a real thing. That's a huge thing. Do you know that that's the second highest way that women die? The first is heart disease. Yeah, well, at least you got that part right. The second highest is intimate partner violence. And that's a woman dying, not a man dying. That's a woman dying. Actually, I'm pretty sure it's probably street violence, but let's keep going. Where is the empathy? You want to talk about gender roles. You want to talk about modern dating. Why aren't you talking about intimate partner violence? Hey, what's happening? Hey. Oh, boy. Here we go. You guys ready for this? Hey, my friends. Sorry, that was kind of long. Maybe I should pair that down or at least time those things a little bit better. Yeah, especially the not so erudite one. I could have stayed. I could have cut that one in half. You're right. How are y'all doing today? This is actually the very first episode of the new year. I am Rolla Tomasi. What are we going to talk about today, guys? We're going to talk about the cake. It's all about the cake. Would you like to know about the cake? I'll tell you about the cake here in a bit. More importantly, let's just run and gun right from the beginning here. So I got wrapped up in a Twitter war. I don't even know what the hell to call it anymore. And apparently there is this nice little girl and her name is Isabella DeLuca. Decided that she was going to bake a cake. She knew you were coming, so she baked the cake. Let's see if I have this loaded. I don't know if I have it loaded just yet. Anyways, I'll load the tweet up here in just a moment. But getting back to it, I actually got dragged into this. Thanks a lot, Rachel Wilson. Thanks a lot, Rachel Wilson. Andrew Wilson's wife Added me to a I guess some sort of Twitter thing that she was doing. She she went after Deluca Not to be confused with De La Guna who was in the Kevin Sabo video right there, but the she's baking a cake That's all she's doing. She's just baking a cake man. What's wrong with you? Rollo? Can't you can't you take a joke? Can't you just see what she's doing? She's just baking cakes Um, and let me see if I've got the got the tweet right here somewhere Got it loaded up You know what I might not have let me uh Drag this. Oh, no, I do I do I've got it right here Sorry, I apologize for not having this already preset I'm more concerned with the Oh Here we go, oh boy, this was really great if you haven't seen this already, I'll show it to you real quickly Anyways, this is part of the thing Not so erudite decided to like chime in here about her breasts and how how stunted she was as a child So I'm sorry. I was that was a very emotionally damaging It was a very emotionally damaging section right there But down on the bottom right hand side or excuse me bottom left-hand side there. You can see miss de luca Isabella de luca Isabelle Isabella de luca doesn't matter And and her boobs and her crucifix and of course that was a a point of contention in that in that whole Twitter that whole Twitter war and Of course the only thing I keep what okay. So what do you think? My response was going to be to cake tits? Not the tits not the crucifix But the very fact that this is going to be and probably this is probably the shot across the bow I think for 2024 we're going to see more and more of this Crop up. We're gonna see more of the the trad con trad thought trad wife, whatever it is That's the new grift and she's she's just ahead of the curve right now on quite honestly She's just you know It was gonna be her or was gonna be probably ten other different broads that are gonna come out there and suddenly they've decided that They've turned a new leaf We're gonna talk a little bit about the epiphany phase today, too Because I think a lot of people sort of get confused about what the what the epiphany phase is I think it's the wall and it's not necessarily the wall I will talk about that a little bit today because it is relevant. It is pertinent to the the new trad thought craze that's sweeping the nation and so she decided to build to build to bake a cake, but of course the if you know anything about Podcasting if you know anything about like videography or anything like that. I've got to let's see I got the other cameras working here, too, right? It's not it's a little sorry It's a little fuzzy right now, but I got the I got the two cameras going right now and here Oh, actually, let's do on this one over here. Okay, because in this camera right here. I have The the settings on the the focus area set for like a constant, right? It's usually at a set area. You can do like a wide focus. You can do autofocus you can do focus on a point and Oddly enough when I'm watching the video of mr. De Luca baking a cake it seemed to me Anyways, that's the focus settings were set right about mid mid riff not at the cake not her face right about here and Here I could show you one more time right about there Well, you know the focus was probably right about mid section there Maybe a little bit down and you can actually set your focus so it will track and sit wherever you want it to be And so I you know, I pointed this out just my casual observations here and Of course everybody loses their fucking minds and everybody I was going to I was actually going to I still might if you really want me to I was going to put up the The the tweet and kind of run through the responses and everything but I can't because there's thousands of responses and I would spend probably the next four hours just reading all the responses to this and what my fire me firing back and everything else, of course and So I I get I get wrapped up in this thank you very much Rachel Wilson I'm kidding, but only a little but the The fact of the matter is is that this is not about cake nor is it about the crucifix around her neck? Oh, maybe a little bit and nor is it about her boobs for that matter? It's about the fact that this woman has is ahead of the curve I don't know who the fuck she was up until I mean, I shouldn't say that I didn't know who she was She was talking shit about the red pill I think back in December or November and I responded to her and I said hey look if you want to come on Access Vegas and you want to sit across the table. I opened it. By the way, you guys already know this I opened this invitation up to everyone and anyone I've done so since November of 2022 since we started access Vegas I said look if you guys want to have a debate like everybody's all want to debate him. He won't debate me Okay, fine you I will be happy to debate you in fact I put the invitation out to Debate pretty much anyone and everyone and the only people who up to this point who have taken me up on that offer I want to say Richard Reeves, but Richard Reeves more like an interview Gary the numbers guy fucking Gary The numbers guy has taken me up on this and by the way and to his credits Sergio Solis from purple pill podcast Those are the only two guys all these haters all these people. I don't want I want to debate him He owes me a debate. Come on out. Where are you? Where the fuck are you nowhere? So anyways, I extended that same Invitation to to miss DeLuca and I think she I think she accepted I'm not really even sure cuz I kind of didn't really follow up on it And then of course I started talking about the video she was doing about her, you know the cake It's all it's all about the cake And I was like, you know, this is gonna be the new grift. This is the new this is the new the pivot And by the way, she's not the only one There's a lot of guys that are doing making the pivot right now, too If you look at destiny and you look at like I forget who else was on this but like Lex Friedman, by the way has decided that he is going to host a debate between Destiny and what is it? Is it Alex is Alex Jones? I think those two on on his maybe I'm maybe I'm wrong about that but it was him and it's either him or it's Maybe it's is it's it's not Sam Harris. Is it? No, I guess it's probably Probably Alex Jones, of course and to Lex Friedman's credit, you know, he's jumping on the he's jumping on the hot see jumping on the bang bandwagon right now because there was just a Debate such as it is over the January 6th insurrection, right that happened yesterday. I only caught the highlights of it and the highlights were Pretty much what I expected Alex Jones shouting down destiny and destiny trying to shout down Alex Jones and it's like Alex Jones is like his is like his big like drunk uncle That's okay. Don't dork donger. Whatever your name is Like what did you like destiny? Okay, like in all seriousness, I know you hate me and the feelings kind of mutual sometimes but like in this case, like what did you hope to to achieve in all of this Like what what productive like, you know, what what productive thing came out of this probably not much but that's gonna be the new pivot and that's for that's really for really what I think hotep Jesus is calling the woke right right now and The woke right really is the woke left that's decided that the woke lefty stuff the leftist progressivist stuff isn't going to play very well in 2024 and they're right and They've decided that they want to you know, swing and pivot pivot pivot, right? And so now we see a new term. Thank you very much for this one. Hotel Jeff Brian hotel, Jesus the woke right now and Honestly, I I see this and I look at what's going on with with with the the trad thoughts the trad wives I kind of saw this coming. I didn't want to make a big prediction about it on the year-end show for For for rule zero, but I kind of did in a little bit I mean, obviously I was saying, you know everybody's gonna sort of lean towards the towards the political stuff and they already are that's gonna be what's gonna pay you if you Guys, by the way, if you are if you're somebody who's sort of like ambiguously part of you know If you're somebody who's sort of like ambiguously part of the red pill your red pill adjacent Lord knows I can't be red pill adjacent. God imagine me trying to sell you that one if you're red pill adjacent or you got into the red pill because it was It was productive. It was marketable It was something that was a niche that you could sort of like, you know dip your toes into and and at least you know once in a while have me on or have Mike on or have you know, God knows whoever else on and and interview them and now you've decided that, you know, you want to Quote unquote wipe the Manosphere stink off of you now that you want to do that Trust me that your pivot is gonna you're gonna want to lean towards conservative politics right now because that's gonna be what's gonna pay your bills, you know, you want to put food on the table start talking about Vivek or or Nikki Haley or Trump or whoever else right? Just talk about you this doesn't mean you have to vote for him and say just talk about them and You'll probably do pretty well as a sort of a sub niche or sort of a pivot niche And by the way, you when you decide to come back to the red pill in 2025 I'm gonna be here to give you the big fat finger. That's what I'm gonna do Trust me taking names right now writing it all in the big book of grudges The big big the big bad book of everything right the great big book of everything Coming up soon. I see you in there. Don't worry. I'm gonna get to I'll get you to to super chats here in a minute I see Glenn in there Glenn's in the Glenn Lawrence in the house Hold on Who's hitting me up right now? Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Oh, there you go Yeah I thank you Sam Sam bought is in that in the in the chat right now behave yourselves because he'll drop the bandhammer on you and I won't know that he dropped the bandhammer on you and then about oh, I don't know six weeks later. You go. How come I'm bad? I don't know Cuz you fucked up Sam decided he was gonna ban you so Be nice to Sam anyways Geez, okay. Well, yeah. All right. All right. God damn. All right. Here we go All right Rollo you mentioned in previous videos that if you were able if you were to redo your sexual market value graph You would move the male sexual market value peak from 34 to 36 to 36 to 38 I would like to know what brought you to your change of mind when I was making that comment Dan It was because I was reading the quote from Aristotle who had said Aristotle of all people saying it's the best age for a man to marry is like 38 and the best age for a woman to Marry is 18 and if you think about it, it's kind of like well You know men don't really become men until the 30 these days But they don't really hit their stride and they don't really hit their sort of peak potential years until they get to be about 36 I was kind of hedging my bets when I was doing that and you got to remember that when I was Doing the infamous sexual market value graph It was a completely unscientific, you know is just me going you know This is this is what I see happening. And so I went with that by the way that's about 12 years old right now and I I think I would probably push up just a touch a lot of people took me to task on that which if you want To see it's actually I think I have it right here There you go. This is what you're talking about If people took me to task on this they said, you know watch men actually become more More sexually valuable when they're in their 20s or they become like it didn't used to be that way, you know back in the I don't know turn of the century. It was much different I'm like, yeah, but I'm this is for the 20th century really partly for the 21st, I suppose as well So yeah, you could probably it's on a sliding scale put it that way. Oh and by the way, let me Now that I've got this I said thank you for bringing this up People wanted the first thing any any woman ever hits me up on about that that graph is I started at 15, right? Oh Rose he wants to go with 15 year old girls You know train seals, right? No, but the reason why I did that was because when I was when I had created that graph I was still a moderator at so suave and there is a teen high school forum I think it's still there. It's so suave right now. And so right around 15 16 17 That's when guys and girls start to become interested in each other It's not that I think that guys who are 38 should be getting with 15 year old girls. Thank you very much I leave that up to the teachers to female teachers getting with 15 year old boys. We'll just leave it at that, right? That's really more common these days than anything else But that's not what my point was The reason I started at 15 is because that's when you know When you're a teenage kid when you're a teenage boy a teenage girl, that's we start taking interest in each other That's why I started it there. Thank you very much. But of course everybody goes. Oh my god No, that's not what it was about And so if you're going to look at this and that guy, you know, of course I started well, where's the other one? Here's the this is a chart If you look at this, you know from 15. I also started this at 15 to nobody gives me shit about this This is in the second book. By the way, this is the timeline So I don't know I might I might there's a little bit of wiggle room I think probably historically it might move even further because now the The average age of first marriage in the united states is now 30 for women and 32 for men And I gotta please make a note of that Please update your software because a lot of people will still say it's 28 for women. It's like 29 or 34 No, it's 30 for women and 32 for men right now Please make a note of that. Thank you Um, but yeah, that's why I would do that. Um Hey, thank you truth matters.
