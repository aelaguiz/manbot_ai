me goddamn baby one more again, won't you put it on me one more again i need you if anyone could fuck again, it may be thing again for me goddamn baby one more again just let me in again the best shit in my life if anyone could fuck again, it may be thing again for me if anyone could fuck again, it may be thing again for me the best shit in my life if anyone could fuck again, it may be thing again for me good man gets a B here i love her that's beautiful i'm old fashion glad we got everybody here so i really did want to open i wasn't going to open with this i have been on and off in that whole pickup community you did a podcast with bradley the other day and you talked about being a top PUA and we have adam here and i'm just very curious because i've been critical of the whole stance for reasons that i brought up to you and you before i'm curious, did you get started as a PUA? i barely heard anything about that that's the only way i made my money but PUA would mean you explain what you're doing i never did that so pretty much when i was on twitch i kept getting banned and i'd return to like 200 viewers very low viewers so the only way i could get viewers was picking up girls IRL in the public and that's the first time i started making $20,000 a month because they're like they would pick that girl at the mall the redhead or whatever and it would be like a $1000 bounty for like a big tits how are you live streaming this? like somebody's following you around with a phone i had a selfie stick but i would drop the phone sometimes so nobody saw so i'd just drop it on the mall window or whatever and i'd pick her up and it would be like for 60 seconds i gotta grab the number or else i lose all the money or whatever but i was like all the clips are up i was doing 20 seconds 10 seconds quickly and i was like oh i like your toenail your toenail color you have the toes of a pedophile and the girls would laugh and people would be like how was that pick up? but now that i explain it i just want her in a state of play that's all i want i don't want to do no interview but yeah beautiful adam your thoughts? yeah it's pretty cool man so i was the first person on the internet to do a 60 second make out with a woman on the street on youtube? yeah this was back in 2006 i'm old the golden era this was back then so yeah man even then people wanted to see it they wanted to see you go out there and actually do it they made two documentaries about me where they followed me with cameras because they didn't follow you being like oh let's watch you succeed they were like watch this idiot fail so when i ended up succeeding on a real tv show this ended up being broadcast all over the UK it's a big deal they're like wow this shit's real and it was funny because until 2006, 2007 no one even believed it was real it was just the underground community it was after there was enough documentaries we ended up on tv shows they went from this isn't real to these guys are evil and that was the shift heartbreaker it wasn't a threat because they thought it didn't work and by the way it wasn't just pick up it was any kind of male improvement i really felt like i've said this before i feel like women in general do not believe in male improvement maybe not you ladies in general but for real other than the money i feel like a lot of times women find this finished product and they're like he was always like this he was always gorgeous and fucking funny and all this kind of stuff and they don't understand the time he spent in the gym or the eight figure business that he built they don't see that they just see the finished product so when people go to fucking Tony Robbins or they go to Bradley or they go to somebody like that and they end up building a business or they go to Adam Lyons in the end they just see the finished product i agree with you but also i think it's just people in general don't believe people can improve it's the same with women no one looks at a woman and is like once upon a time she used to be ugly and she had to learn makeup and all this stuff it's pretty interesting to see women in their mid-twenties as they're learning makeup and i find that's really fascinating they suddenly become really attractive over six months and you're like damn what happened was that cosmetic surgery she's like no i just learned how to contour off this youtube video they always learn after they break up with you it gets so fucking hot i'm like bitch i need a time machine that's because they're crying at home they're sitting watching youtube videos because they don't want to go out in public and they're like i'm going to get really hot how to get hot how to get hot great but you know it's funny we always joke about this we say like every woman is probably 15 grand away from being one of the hottest women you've ever seen i think it's more than 15 i think it was 15 plastic surgery is that plastic surgery i've never said so i just said 15 grand i think i'm like the only dude in the red pill space who's like pro plastic surgery there's two of us there's two of us hey ladies fix yourself get everything there's two of us it's an investment but it can be all sorts of things there are some people that genuinely have great bodies but that 15k might be in something else like self improvement even for women like education i just think human beings in general there's a reason that people are in the top 1% or the top 5% in something but think of Kylie Jenner have you seen her old photos her old before the money she looked like she should have sued her mom she was like not attractive at all but that money made her into well no one's ugly they're just broke oh this girl she was ugly you know well i mean by that logic it's true because you say 15 grand would you guys agree the ladies would you agree with yeah my boobs were like 7500 see 15 grand god damn no no i don't think that's i think you get one with the other i think it's buy one get one when it comes to the dow corning breast implants the mentor breast implants i think they did one at a time that's essentially i have a second question for you guys we talked briefly when you came on about TRT i don't know you are in TRT you said you had a stroke because your estrogen levels were so low yeah so really that could happen yeah i think people should really know this i'm actually big on educating this so you know growing up i was like i don't need testosterone and the thing is there was no drop in my sex drive i was fucking like twice a day every day so i'm like there's nothing wrong with me my levels are okay they're great and i didn't need to get educated on it 450 is great apparently so right what was that E2 this was just my doctor was like your T levels are 450 so i'm like great over the next couple of years i start getting sleepy in the afternoons don't really think anything of it and then bam one day i have a stroke i am in hospital for four days i can't speak i can't communicate properly i'm in a bad way it was a minor stroke thankfully you can see it like i'll say it's like one of the things i'm subconscious about i only talk out one side of my mouth and the more you start looking at me you'll see it's just one side that talks you're joking no you don't you'll see it it's this side barely it moves really yeah mostly it's the left side so you'll see anyway long story short they couldn't work out what triggered the stroke and so i go i get a new gp thankfully my new gp specializes in testosterone and he was like i want to get you checked he's like 450 before how bad is 270 he's like 450 is bad he's like 270 is terrible yeah i didn't think when you said 450 i was confused because that's not really a good number did you go to an endocrinologist so the healthy yeah i ended up so the healthy range according to gps is between like 400 and 700 but the reality is there is an optimal range that is very different but they just look for what's healthy not what's optimal so then they put me on mandatory testosterone so now my levels are between 400 and 700 so now my levels are between 400 and 700 so now my levels are between 1100 and 1200 i've never in my life related to someone more because when i was in my bodybuilding phase one tablet of letrozole will nuke like 98% of human estrogen in the mail i was taking like 8 and the only time i'll take less is when i'm puking it out with arimidex so i had i don't know what was i like 0% estrogen so that's my transition is your steroid stack if you could explain it it was at your peak when you were talking about 5000 units of tren i think i think i think i think and today she's a i think it's actually like 25% lower than what's on paper because there's no way those days i'm puking that hard i puke every day but the days i'm really puking hard there's no way i was poking but i remember at least 5 times a week i would have 4 buddies injecting me 3cc 3cc 3cc 3cc like cattle you were doing halo every 5 times a week of testosterone will turn you a trans man so 100 mg is a lot to a human i was taking almost 4500 a week it was like 2000 mg of trenlavone acetate 2000 mg of equipoise i think mastro 100 mg of anadrol anivar clen t3 dmp which is rat poison and dynamite and this one cooked me because i overdosed on this i cooked myself to death ice packs were melting so fast on my skin and my sweat was orange radioactive because this is fertilizer not meant for humans at least you were growing i was shredded also ghp had a growth hormone release effect so it was better than alcohol molly so i don't beat up my girlfriend i never hit a woman in my life but on all these i needed to calm down and coke for when i was working at the night clubs and i overdosed twice and don't do it here's the thing i've learned about this stuff that i think is super important get a really good doctor you don't need to do it yourself with buddies here's the weirdest thing i took all this one can take some notes over here i took all this stuff so for the next three years of my life erectile dysfunction but only with the hottest ones it was very weird and with other ones i just sat in my apartment sobbing crying why i won't fuck her and i'm just playing halo shut the fuck up and there would be group chats of girls saying he didn't fuck me he didn't fuck me so the one lucky girl that got fucked she was hated so much  that i can't even say it she didn't fuck me so she didn't fuck me she didn't fuck me so she didn't fuck me so i tried to talk to her but i didn't talk to her and i didn't talk to her but she didn't fuck me so i tried to talk to her but i didn't talk to her so i didn't talk to her so i didn't talk to her so i did not talk to her so i didn't talk to her so i did not talk to her so she didn't call  Answer four seconds late, you're doing what you're supposed to do on a date, which is the only thing. Drop her anxiety to zero. That's when she sucks the skin off your dick. But not date one. Immediately... Did I fuck this up? Immediately, hey, goodbye, muah muah, I'd walk away. And she'd see my back and she'd be like, that's the first guy to run away. She'd open my social media and she'd be like, at that same fucking bar, he's with the boys. He just left me for the boys. And then she'd chase. She'd be like, I don't want Circa, but I have to win him over. I want to be interesting to him, then I'll block him. And I'd sit at home plodding like, date two, I'm the most playful. I'm fucking the shit out of her, date two. Because date two, she's expecting the exhausted guy again. But I'm like, hey, and I excite them and they go, oh my God, daddy's happy now. And I would... It was a mindfuck. But I learned this. I learned I pick up all the women on my eighth hour of the shift at the club. When I'm drained, covered in sweat, tired, I don't want to talk to you. Here's what I love about this. For everyone listening, the science behind what he's doing, we've been teaching this literally for 18 years or 17 years, realistically. Everything you're doing is textbook. I mean, obviously, you know, right, because it's working. But the step-by-step thing is, first of all, we've got supply and demand. If anybody can get you, nobody wants you. And that's nothing to do with dating. That's just human beings, supply and demand. So I love your version of how to do it. There are so many ways of doing it, but that is a way to do it. There's... It's online. It's push-pull. It's a takeaway. I mean, yeah, which is David DeAngelo. We're going back to like right at the very beginning. There are Reddit threads of millions of guys who say, I know she didn't fake the orgasm. She had a great night and she still blocked me because she's some schmuck from the club. But if you're the one to leave, it's like when you take a girl to the apartment and you want to fuck and she doesn't. If you turn around and go to sleep, she's traumatized. She tries to wake you up and shit. Or I go leave for a cigarette and she texts me, where did you go? I said, I need this cancer because you're not fucking me. What the fuck? But I learned that all men are dogs. Wagging their tails for pussy, their anxiety increases. But when they're cats and they stay at a fucking windowsill thinking about their depression and ignoring the girl, she's so charmed when he actually shows some interest. Like, have you ever had a cat walk on your lap? You're like, oh my God, it likes me. But every fucking dog wants you. Have you guys, like for the ladies, have you ever like chased after a guy because of like in this scenario? Have you been the girl in this scenario before? Like when I was younger. Yeah, when I was young and stupid. Stupid, yeah, when I didn't know. And haven't done any healing. These are broken girls you're talking about, not healed women. So you think quality wise, you think like naive wise, like youth wise, like experience wise. You're looking for someone that's weak minded that you can manipulate. I'm an apex predator. If you look at NBA players' wives, NHL players' wives, those beautiful women all chase the shit out of the guy. You're supposed to chase. You don't want a man to chase you. It dries you up. Though, let's say we're dating. She's really just admitting I'm better than her because women only date up. I can date a McDonald's worker who makes $5 an hour. I can fall in love with her. She does not have the DNA to do that ever. You can never. Would you ever marry a McDonald's worker? Probably not. No, there's no probably. Absolutely not. Well, at this point in my life, no. At any point, you'd be like, go back to your fries. But us, if we had a cute, sweet girl that's loyal, and she worked at McDonald's, I'd say, bring some nuggets, babe. I would fucking marry her in a week. Men can marry a poor McDonald's worker. Women, no matter how great he is, they can't do it because they're up the devil. Dude, I got to disagree with you, man. I grew up poor. I'm telling you, there are a lot of women that absolutely date down. But listen to what you're saying. Listen to what he's saying. Listen to what you're saying. When I was poor, trapping, drug dealing, I fucked a lot of them. How many did you sustain? Zero. No, no. They won't stay with you. They will never stay with a broke guy. Dude, I'm telling you right now. I have seen broke women hanging out with dudes that are so in love with women. How long? 10 years, 20 years. They got kids together. She's like, one day, this guy is going to get off my sofa. You know what I'm saying? Dude, I'm telling you. Now, it depends where you are in society. That's a horrible life. That life, that guy on the sofa that you're painting? 100%. How is that a good thing? But that's the majority of people on the planet, man. Most people live that way. You're describing the upper echelons of society, which I agree with you. The upper echelons, those women absolutely will look today up because they put time, energy into their mental health. They've done the work. They're improving. Yes, the top 5% of women are absolutely dating up. You're saying you've got to cope with a cheater. If she's dating down, she's going to cheat. No, no. He'll be cheating. Dude, this will blow your brain. I'm telling you. He will cheat, but who has more options? Who has more options, the male or the female? Who has the capacity of evil? In the poor society we're talking about, right? In a poor society? No, no. Let's say you're in Detroit. Right. He can cheat once a month. That bitch can cheat a thousand times a month. You're telling me that dude got a good deal out of that? Most of the time, that woman is going to be running three jobs, looking after the kids, cleaning. She don't have time to cheat. Where? Dude. Women cooking and cleaning? This is an alternate universe. Where am I? Dude, I tell you what, man. Honey, you're going for broken women. Oh, no, no, no. You're going for broken women. We have a new player. We got a new player. We have a world class pole dancer and professional poker player. Oh, my goodness. Miss A, what are we calling you today? I'll go by Allison. I'll go by Allison today. We'll go by Allison today. Can we have everybody move in this way? So Ali and Taylor. Ali came in in the middle of this conversation. She's like, who the fuck is this guy? Can we see the three shot of them real quick? Just to see how they look. Beautiful. Are they in the way here? All right, nice. All right, cool. Now we're nice and cozy. And before we continue here, I have to make a public announcement. I don't know how much longer we got. How much longer? We got an hour or 45 minutes. In 45 minutes, we will be moving this, everything. If you're watching on my channel or if you're watching on Mike's channel, go and subscribe to the Access Vegas channel because we're going to kill our streams and then we're going to go to the Access Vegas dedicated channel. Again, I want to make sure because last time we did this, everybody's like, where the hell did it go? Access Vegas. If you don't know where it is, it's the first. It's in the description. It's in the description. It's in my description. It's in the description. Yeah, so go sub now because in about 45 minutes, we're going to switch over there. Just public service announcement. All right, Morgan. What do you think about all this? I'm sorry, Ali. Ali Morgan. We'll go by Morgan. It's okay. Honestly, what kind of girls are you dating? Well, when I was working, we're talking about my dating days. Oh shit. Right now, I'm with a teenager. I like teenagers. They're my favorite. But when we're talking about my dating days, they were paralegals, lawyers, doctors, whores, every kind of girl and they all kind of like acted the same around me, but all the arguments would come because yeah, I'm a funny guy, but if I can't pay rent, there's nothing funny about me because women, you know, like you guys, are you, do you have the capacity to actually marry a McDonald's working Chad like me? Could you do that? Well, right now, any woman ever done? Let's go around the table. You're like McDonald's employees are right now even making more than our teachers. Do I want to date? Maybe marry a teacher? I would say so, but to just slap a label on someone because where they work, money wise, right? And maybe not so much McDonald's, but if that's what he does and he provides for me and he's happy and we're happy together. You've done this before? Have any of your girlfriends or any Facebook mutual friend anyone in existence? So here's what I'm going to do here because I understand what you guys are trying to say. But the problem is that it's not that the McDonald's worker is untenable. It's that the McDonald's worker has to compete with all the other people who aren't fucking McDonald's workers. That's the problem. The one of the issues is like with ladies is like when they're when they get older and they're you have an issue where hey, you're still great. You're still pretty all these kind of things. Maybe you have a kid all these different issues. It's not that you're not great. It's that there's other versions like you mentioned 18. My girlfriend's 20 was just turned 21 and in this situation. That's the most that's the craziest thing I've ever heard because why can't you say that about men? What do you mean? Why can't you say we could marry a McDonald's worker? Yeah. Why is it different for men? No, no. My point is my point is for us. We look for signs of replication for women. They look for signs of survival and that's just say they're gold diggers. I mean, that's one of the I mean, we could just say that let's call a spade a spade. They're gold diggers and they should be they want to take care of their kids. That's their DNA talking. But why are we pretending like it's like they're capable of as much good in romance as men. We take bullets for women. We're the good guys. We're the way to die. You do know that. Oh my God. Like they're gonna okay. Can a woman be my ride-or-die if I got fired from my job? Yes. Why not? Because she sees your potential if you tell her about your dreams if you're like, this is what I want to do, right? And then she sticks with you. She supports you. She's right everything she needs to do and you get there. Look how charitable ride-or-die bitch. Rola, look how charitable. I'm going to beat her. One, all breakups and divorces come from financial insecurity, especially because of her. But two, if she's a ride-or-die drug abuse. Yeah, that's me. But if she's a if she's a ride-or-die and she sees the word ambition that's code for return on investment because she's a fucking gold digger. Wait, either way you look at it. Why is she a gold digger because she wants to be provided for if that's what the man promised her. She's a gold digger when compared to the opposite gender of the male. So when are men looking for pussy, which would be the gold that they're digging for? And that's the bad point. Not if he's actually coming to you saying this is what I'm going to provide for you. I may not have this right now, but this is what I'm that's not being a gold digger. That's him seeing the quality woman that I am and what I can do for him. A woman can't do anything for a man like for his career. You're saying what a man wants what a man needs out of a woman. He's like, you know what? I want every fortune for every fortune what I want out of a wife. I want a wife to do this. If you want to have a fortune for you, if you want to have a fortune 500 company become a homosexual and you'll win and die your head blue. All the all the biggest businesses are homosexuals because they don't deal with women. That's the truth or narcissists that there are homosexual narcissists, right? So I mean people that are usually the most successful are usually self-centered. How can a woman help my career right now? I'm the biggest thing on the internet. If I start taking someone seriously and dating them and not playing with my teenager. What is she going to do for me? Hold on. You built an entire career of picking up what women do for you and you need them, right? To show off to your students, otherwise you have no business. No, no, I had other jobs, but I was a drug dealer. I was killing it. Oh, check this out. Literally the most attractive career field a man can have. Yeah. Here's what you said. You made a career picking up the gender that is selfish and a gold digger. I agree. I actually have a lot of experience when I lived when I'm off to Hollywood. That was about 20 you guys golden age for you guys. I know you get it, you know, and I actually did it. Well, I tend to date lots of like older rich guys. It was boring. Like I didn't even sleep with them. The dates were like so much. I want to talk to them. That's true. No, right now. I couldn't. I agree. So when I started dating him, he was fresh off divorce. I walked away with nothing and I'm like, honey, let's build it all from scratch. Well, he's the first of all, he's the best job and we move but check this out right now. I have a bunch of women a bunch. They leave yacht parties to stay whether I'm in a penthouse or in a fucking dog house. They'll stay with me, but they're not choosing me over the rich guy. They're choosing a man who maxed out the fucking Trinity of looks Network and status. I don't say finance because you could have a hundred million muscles. If you're a fucking crypto nerd, you don't got pussy. I got looks Network and status that Trinity no yacht billionaires comparing to me. That's why the girls I fuck show me pictures of them fucking Leonardo DiCaprio. We're sharing the same fucking pool, but look what he has. He has the Trinity. When has a woman ever dated a man out of the Trinity? No, you need that. Holy Spirit, right? But now look at us Rolo Rolo and I met a cute loyal McDonald's worker. We will fuck it bro. Fuck a prenup. You can have half bitch, bro. Have you dated a McDonald's worker? You've said this a lot. I don't know. For I don't like Burger King. No, but like you guys are missing the point. The point is only one gender is capable of that action. Period. What? Name one. Name one celebrity. Let me clarify. Let me clarify. What action Sandra Bullock is dating? Who the other guy? Okay, action though. No one's great. The men in this table can date a McDonald's worker. The women cannot. Yeah, not your friends. So what you're explaining is basically is basic hypergamy, right? So it's like women only want to date at or above their either status or their looks or whatever they perceive as their sexual market value. Men don't have that attraction for that's all you're saying. But no, no, that's not what I'm saying because that's a watered down version. What I'm saying is they if what I'm saying is true and we all agree these women have to admit everyone they've dated was above them. Or their perception of that guy was that he was above them at some point because women don't want perception is real. I don't want to have it. Well, is it perception or is it like because they're probably every woman at this table will say like I was with this guy was so hot. It was so great. And then he said something somewhere along the way that Fuck things up like he was like, I thought it was great. He said something. So it's turn into a curry. Here we go guys. Ready? It's rich men, but not all rich men. Some rich men can talk their way out of pussy. That's number one. Number two, the 37 culture study by Dr. David bus in every single one of the cultures women cared more about acquisition of resources than men in some places like Norway. It was 50% more in some places like India. It was 200% more but women always cared more about acquisition."}
