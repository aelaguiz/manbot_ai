To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentation of their women. That is the... This is not the song I was going to use for today's show. I'm sorry. I'm one day late. Yes. Oh boy. Am I not a story for you? No. We'll talk about single mothers if you like. I'm good with that. I am live from Reno, Nevada right now, and I'll explain to you why in just a moment. I was up in Tahoe, but now I'm down here for the duration. I'll be right back. I'm doing Tahoe again pretty soon. You guys ready for white school? I'll say it was a timely topic. Very timely topic. Since my daughter just got married on Thursday. Thank you. Thank you very much. I didn't do much. I just raised her from infant to adult. Paid for a lot of stuff. Oh boy. Okay. Here you go. All the women out there, the boyfriend that you have needs to at least be trying to be the best version of himself for you. If you're a high value woman and you're beautiful and you're kind and you're loving and you're caring and you're all of the things a man wants, you deserve the world. She's not a Christian. You self-improve to get girls. You self-improve so you don't tolerate the bullshit that comes with the girls. I'm going to say that again. You don't self-improve to get girls, guys. You self-improve so that you don't sit there and tolerate the bullshit that inevitably comes with the girls. Guys, you guys see the ridiculousness every single night, right? Why do you want to have to tolerate that? 70 to 80% of divorces are initiated by women. Do you know why? Because she is the thermostat in the relationship. I asked Shanna regularly. One to 10 is our relationship and she's usually really close and she's usually a lot lower than me. Listen to your wife. If there's a theme that's coming up over and over again, do not ignore it. Do not sweep it because you may get to the place in 20 or 30 years where she walks away because for decades you've been ignoring her. We say to give a woman vote is like to let a monkey fly a plane. She doesn't make you loyal. Right? So let's let's cut the bullshit. There's a bunch of women out there who legitimately think their man is loyal. No, their man lives in Des Moines and has no options. That's essentially what's happening. Put your man on Charing Cross next to the Playboy Mansion and then let's see how loyal he is. Well, hey, look, but the thing that matters is you could probably put that man in Des Moines over there. He wouldn't do shit because of me. And you turn up, it's over anyway. And if you put me in Des Moines, I'm going to get plenty. I'm going to run the block down. Me, I don't give a shit. And that's the thing. There's all these guys out there that will run around acting like they're super loyal and that they'll play. Oh, I'm a man, a God, especially in the South. Man, bro. Jesus game is real. Jesus game is real. I did not think we'd go to this place. But yes, you are correct. I have absolutely seen this where a guy is like, I am a good man worthy of a good woman. And he is. The difference is I'm telling the truth and he's lying. Like through his fucking teeth. I have a girlfriend and I still from time to time hook up with other girls. Following clips have been taken from Jubilee's Middle Ground video on alpha males and beta males. While I think those terms are so cringe and fucking stupid, I genuinely thought that this video was a well-rounded, honest conversation between a group of men. So I just want to comment on a couple of things. It's something I want to do. To not do it feels unnatural. Anything you engage in in life over a long period of time over and over again is going to start to feel natural to do. But to do something different or perhaps do the complete opposite of said action, that will feel uncomfortable because you're going against what you normally do. You might just want this one moment for a relationship. I can understand that. Sexually though, I think it's all BS. To you. I think a man can absolutely be head over heels in love with a woman and still sleep with other women and it not mean anything to him. If it means nothing to you to do it, why are you doing it? To create a fulfilling life, you should have purpose and meaning by every single action that you do. And just because it doesn't mean anything to you doesn't mean it doesn't mean something to someone else. And I think all men have the proclivity to want to sleep with other women. Do they though? Or is this a story you tell yourself to rationalize and justify what you're doing? A man should create choice in his life. Sure. And these are the choices for you. Being single, being in a relationship. Parameters of said relationship is entirely up to you and who you engage with. But really, those are your choices. It's the lying that's actually the overall problem. When guys tend to go outside of a relationship, they lie to the woman. I agree with that. If everyone's upfront about their intentions and everybody involved knows what's going on, knows the parameters, everyone consents to what's happening, then go for it. The problem is you have guys who are monogamous, but they're monogamous because they're forced to be monogamous. No one's f- Wait, I thought there was only two choices, brah. Forcing them to be. It's unheard of to hear of a man being forced into a monogamous relationship. Can't really say the same about women though. They have no choice. They do have a choice. Stop trying to create a cop-out and act like they're powerless. Also want to clarify, I'm talking about men who have the capacity to be able to attract a woman to get into a relationship and not men who are struggling with the ability to be able to attract a woman to get into a relationship. Because they don't have- Seems to me there's only one person doing the struggling here. Have the skill to attract multiple women. Or perhaps they don't see the value in it like you do. They have the skills to attract the women that they like and they choose one and then they're satisfied. And a lot of times- Or not. So use that as virtue signaling. I would never do such a thing. Well actually bro, you can't. Again, this is just another example of a potential cop-out. I can certainly agree with the sentiment that plenty of people who engage in virtue signaling often have poor character traits and usually are disingenuous. I'm sure all the women in relationships are thrilled to listen to this. Oh, the man I'm with is forced to be with me. It's not like he has a choice. I'm better at sex with women I care about. With my girlfriend or like my wife, sex would be great. With the other girls, it can still be good but I know that I don't really put in that much effort because it's almost like I'm masturbating with someone. Again, I'm not saying that these guys can't engage in this behavior. The way they describe it, it doesn't sound like they even enjoy doing it. Why don't you- It kind of sounds like you are, bro. Why don't you stick with having sex with your wife and your girlfriend if you enjoy that? Because evidently, it has very little to do with sex. My friends would always try to encourage me to hook up with girls that were onto me but I wasn't really into it. It made me feel weird, like there was something wrong. And now- God, I feel for Justin. I have to stop this. I feel for Justin in this situation. It's like being a stranger in a strange land, isn't it, Jay? I'm at a point in my life where I feel like I'm only having sex with multiple women so I'm not weird. I'm quote-unquote normal. And this is what I take issue with a lot of this content is promoting an idea to men that this is how you need to be. And wanting to be in a monogamous relationship with a woman. That it's been forced upon you by our society and culture and you don't really have a choice and it goes against your innate nature. And you're less of a man if you don't have lots of girls. And here's an example of a guy who went and pursued it because of the influence of other men who told him that that's what he had to do. It doesn't give me any gratification. I know in the back of my mind that I just simply don't enjoy this. Everything he is describing is exactly how I felt when I used to do it. Being with one woman is just so peaceful. Telling young men that they were born this way and that they should feel this way. It can really, not do damage, but just sort of make you second guess things about yourself. Am I normal? Am I weird? Is there something off about me? Everyone else around me is saying that I have to feel this way or I have to do these things. But yet I don't feel the courage to do those things. Remember what old mate said before? And I think all men have the proclivity to want to sleep with other women. And yet sitting across from him is a man admitting that he has the proclivities to not want to engage in this behavior. However you wish to engage in relationships with women, it should have no bearing on your manliness. Multiple soulmates. I do genuinely believe that we have multiple soulmates in our lifetime. However, some people don't actually find all their soulmates. They end up with one person and no matter what, they make it work. And I rate that in some ways. You know, they stay together for the kids, but I believe everything has a sell-by date. So I'll give you my best. I'll be in it for three years. I might be in it for five. I'm going to give you my best. Like I'm going to try. So you don't believe in forever love? No, I don't believe in forever love because I've been burned and I've also been on the other side of that. And I just know that the grass is always greener. And the truth is if you can just water the grass where you are, it will last longer. And I have to tell myself that every day. I just feel that if you can try and do forever, that's the best way because you'll try and get to 10 years. But when it starts to turn off, when the passion goes, try and reignite it. Try and reignite it three, four times. But when you've tried for three years and all you do is argue in front of the kids, that's not worth it. Get out. So there is a moment when it's like, you know, the word soulmate just becomes like not right for you anymore. What is your major malfunction? You meet your soulmate. Uh-huh. He's 10 out of 10. Okay. What can he do to ruin that? So pretty much nothing except trip and fall in front of me. If he trips and falls in front of you, it's over. Oh, my gosh. The amount of pressure. I was one time in New York with this guy that I was madly in love with. And he did look down at his phone. He wasn't paying attention. He wasn't on point. And he like tripped and fell. And you know when someone tries to not fall and they kind of like fall forever? Forever, dude. It went on forever. And I just instantly fell out of love with him. It was just the way he. And then, you know what? And then he like looked back like to blame the sidewalk. Like and then we had to spend all this time looking for the thing he tripped on. And it was just like, dude, it's just get your shit together. Divorced at 21. Second marriage. Married at 25. Divorced at 28. Third engagement. Engaged at 29. Ended it at 30. Marriage is not a sanctimonious thing. It is paperwork. It's something. It's a commitment you make to someone. But if you feel like you're not getting anything from that commitment and you're trying, you gotta go. You gotta go. I feel really bad for her actually because of her view of love is take, take, take, take, take. Leave, leave, leave, leave, leave. She doesn't have love in her life. Love is about give. Love is about suffer with. Love is about pouring out yourself. Love is about sacrifice. Love is about trust and vulnerability. Love is about staying. Love is a choice. It's not an emotion. That's what makes marriage so amazing and special and beautiful. And yeah, hard, but beautiful. Don't take marriage advice from people who can't stay married. His income to be. I feel like this is gonna sound bad. I feel like 300,000. I would have to say 127. Probably 150 to a quarter of a million a year. $500,000. Is that bad? 150 maybe to 250,000 a year. It would be comfortable for sure. I was just having this conversation with my friend and she was like, you have to manifest a husband, girl. Ideally, my husband's needs could be looking like 650,000. So you said you want 500K, but what do you want? Tell these bitches to go to hell. 60K, 70K. It is $45,000. Oh my God. Really? Yeah. I think it's 250,000. It's 52,000. What? No, it's not. Damn, America. Thank you very much. Can I be in charge for once? Thank you very much. Can I be in charge? Yeah, back in, back in, back in. Yes, I decided I was going to bite the bullet and actually I had to make a trip down to Reno anyway. So I figured, hey, what the hell? I'll go do a makeup class. I apologize for not getting on it yesterday. I was not aware that there were Internet and power issues in the place that I was staying. I'm still staying, by the way, in Lake Tahoe. Very nice place. I won't tell you exactly where, but it's in the Tahoe Keys. And I was, I was under the impression that the Internet was going, well, you know, that power would not be a problem in such a high rent district of the luxurious, beautiful Lake Tahoe. However, unfortunately, it was a perfect storm of shit yesterday. So I apologize for not getting on, getting on it on my regular time. I was, I was hoping to do it from the, from the balcony, from our, my nice little over, overlooking the, the lagoon. And my, my, my jet skis are in the water right now. And just decided I was going to come down here and do it anyways, because I had some business I had to take care of. But fortunately, it's only about an hour, hour 20. So I figured out what the hell, I'll just go do the show here. So here we are once again. And it is a very timely show. As you can see from my beautiful banner that I actually, I went to a lot of trouble to prep for this show. Rolled around one o'clock and the power is still not on. I'm like, oh, God damn it. But yeah, I, I, I spent quite a bit of time working on stuff. Yeah. So anyways, I am in lovely Lake Tahoe for the rest of this month, more or less. I'm going to see if I can do some live stream stuff with Mike Sartain, if he's willing to do so. Speaking of which, before we get started, I have to also make a big, big announcement. And I usually save these things for like later on in the show, but I got to do it here from the get go. Because we just have confirmed we have John Zirka. We have Troy Francis. And we have Adam Sosnick all on the same Access Vegas show on Thursday. We worked it out. So we got Troy Francis. We've got Adam Sosnick. Not Adam. I made that mistake too. Adam Sosnick is coming in and we have John Zirka. And we're going to have anywhere between six to seven, maybe eight beautiful women from our Access Vegas girls. And I have to say right up front that having John Zirka on the show adds an element of chaos that we have to deal with. do preplanned for and anybody making the claim that we are in any way trying to ambush poor six foot five John Zirka professional wrestler. What's that surprise? Well, as a goal, you are gravely, gravely mistaken. But it is always it's fun when john is around. And so we decided we're gonna they happen to be in in Vegas for something for some occasion. And I like I said, it's the perfect trifecta, I guess. So we've got Zirka, we've got Troy Francis from rule zero, as you guys probably already know. And we have Adam Sosnick from Valuetainment is going to be on as well. So we will be doing that on Thursday, that will be at 8pm Pacific, that'll be 11pm Eastern Time. And who knows what we're going to talk about? I'm still if you guys have ideas for for for questions or for topics, I am all ears at this point, because it's it's like a buffet of, of like, personalities for this one, I will say. So we've got that going on. Yes, that's I was gonna say, and yeah, get the saltiest. And we trust me, we're way ahead of you, brother. We will have CJ Sparks, she's already confirmed. So like, we have to, we always think, we gotta get Zirka on, who do we want to have on that's going to be able to go toe to toe with Zirka? Like, who's going to be a good conversation back and forth? Because we can put women on there that are very kind of like, you know, well, you know, subdued and everything else. And it doesn't doesn't make for a good show. And they kind of just sit there and kind of, you know, look, twiddle their thumbs and play with their phones. But if we got a CJ Sparks on there, she's already on the list. We've got a few other girls on the shortlist right now to one of them will most likely be Trish Fox, Trish, Tiffany Fox from, from the last show, she's coming in, I know that she'll be there. I have having Lana on the show might be fun. If you saw Lana last time we were on, Lana is a regular at, at Sticky Paws, and she's got her own show, she wants me to be on it, I may do her show either Wednesday or Friday. I've pro live kind of stretched out my stay a little bit so that I will be there on Friday. So we've got some of the things that are going on. And so yeah, that's going to be good. It'll be highly entertaining for the next say Wednesday, Thursday and Friday for sure. So something you're not going to want to miss. And that's, that's the big announcement. I will also be in Vegas next Thursday as well. So we're going to do back to back weeks on access Vegas. So because I believe I was at a Mike has a I think it's either swimsuit USA or it's he's got a swimsuit thing or he's got a babes and toy line that's coming up towards the end of August. And so therefore, we have to kind of schedule around our mics, Mike schedule. So that's how we're working it. Also, the other big announcement is we have access now like exclusive access to debris Z studio, which is the one you have seen me do some quick hit videos for it's the one where Mike and Zirka went and did their flat earth debates. And it's the one where we had our talk and we've been using it quite a bit now. Now we have like, we've locked it in, we have exclusive access to it. So that will be, you'll probably see be seeing a lot more of myself, Mike, probably Glenn, Lawrence, and a few other people. And Miguel from dollar cost crypto will be doing shows from there as well. So have this access a wonderful place to write really close to the strip and it overlooks the when you when it's dark, and you can see like the skyline everything overlooks a strip. It's absolutely fantastic location. So I'm happy to say we have that confirmed. And that's we have it now. So that's what we got going on. Now. Here's the bigger news at red one studios. Yes, thank you, Glenn Lawrence. That'll be read that but that would be the the southern command center. Red one studios. This is the northern command center here in Reno and the southern command center is in LA in Las Vegas. So yeah, most definitely. Rage Quit Kiko. I if I could get her I would I'll tell you what's funny is like I'm a little hesitant to to sort of farm out girls that we have on access Vegas. I think one of the strengths of access Vegas is that we have access to like the most beautiful women on planet Earth and you guys can fight me on that all you want. But compared to other podcasts, I would definitely say our girls can can more than match the the let's say the physical attributes of anybody else's. So as a result of that, we get a lot of requests to poach our girls. And the answer is no. No. How about no. How about no, you don't wrong about wrong. So we will be most definitely getting the most feistiest girls that we can find for the Zirka Sosnick Troy Francis. Multitalent Manosphere extravaganza. I don't even know what to really call. Oh, man. Okay, so here's a deal. You don't want to see flat Earth. Flat Earth is boring. This is boring. Do you really want to see that again? No, I don't think so. Do I have anything else going on here? And just just clear these out of here. Amar, thank you for that. Let's see. There are two choices right public. I saw that guy in in the clips. I got another one of his that I'm going to show later on. Thanks, Glenn Lawrence for your $10 contribution, which will just end up coming back to you anyways. But yeah, the the there's a lot I'm going to clarify terms. I'm going to see if I can sort of till the fields here and fertilize the ground for today's show. Today's show is going to be about how red pill women's marriage advice is garbage. And by red pill women, I would also throw into that category. The let's say the cuttlefish the sneaky fuckers who would for all intents and purposes are red pill women as it is. The game you got you get you get good you start sleeping with all these women that have boyfriends and stop trusting women covered this before how to avoid this when learning game thanks in advance. Always respect your work. I will come back to that. I'll keep you I'll keep you in the bullpen there. Hang on one second. Put that there you go. You know, I mean, it's, that's the obvious one, right? pearls, the obvious one, but there's some there's a lot like I used to Lila rose at the end there to lightless. There's a growing if you haven't noticed this already, I'm sure most of you probably have. There's a growing ground swell, there's a growing movement of anti red pill reactors right now. And if you haven't seen my, my interview with Flaco on no jumper, I was by the way, I was responding to his questions, everything that's on that video, if you haven't seen it, go check it out. It's finally out now what's five weeks later, you can go have and have a look at that when I was responding to Brittany Venti on last week's show, I have a sneaking suspicion that it was probably because I think I might have mentioned her in passing in that, in that interview. I also mentioned Lauren Southern. I also mentioned destiny. I also mentioned MTR. And I stand by pretty much everything that I've said. As a matter of fact, I thought was interesting is that the people who I said were reactors in that, in that interview, decided to do reaction videos of exactly there's no way you win that one. Because it's like if you're, if you're bread and butter is, is doing reaction videos, and I call you out for being a reactor. And your only response is to do another reaction video. I don't know what else to tell you, man. Ah, from Mexico. Oh, buenos. Buenos tardes. Israel Barragan. Is that? Oh, senor Tomasi. Yes. Como esta usted? Oh, yeah, I know nothing. Let's see Zerka and Waller in the sand. I was I would love to do that. I would I you know, we have talked about that as well. We might we might be able to do that. And yeah, that's another thing is, there's a lot of people. I've got some other video for you later on of Tristan, Tristan Tate, who I thought it was interesting. Because the reason I use that clip of Tristan, and then I put it back to back, I plan these out, by the way, but the reason I put that one back to back with Justin Waller is, you've got Justin Waller talking about, you know, how like guys are only as loyal as their options, right? Guys, guys, natural proclivity is to want to bang a lot of women, right? And I thought it was also kind of ironic, because it was that same Aussie guy who was and I have no idea who this guy is. But again, part of this groundswell of anti red pill reaction clips, these 45 second second, you know, too long didn't read clips. And again, all it does is make really quick hit points that have nothing to do with the actual like, when I look at the video, when I, by the way, I saw the Jubilee thing, I've seen a lot of the stuff that people make clips out of, I go and I watch this shit. And it's interesting to me to see how people try to market themselves in sort of like, I'm going to punch you in the face kind of context. So for instance, like when I'm looking at that guy, what's it? What the heck is his name? Markle? Mark and Murphy or something that Mac and Mac and Murphy, when I see his stuff, all it is is just YouTube shorts, and of like longer interviews. But it's like, oh, women don't actually hit the wall, flash, roll Tomasi's face, like from like an ancient ass video when I was on like you are here with like Sidney Watson and Elijah Schaefer. Bam, those crazy red pill guys, a picture of Myron. You know, at the very least, say my fucking name, you know, at least like throw me a bone here, man, say my name, I have the balls to fucking to to to come out. Okay, this is good. Would you like me to opine to this, Mr. Smith? I will be happy to opine to this. Lauren Southern was inventies comments under the video dissing you she's very well aware of your work and what what goes on the sphere. I won't be surprised if she Yeah, trust me. Lauren Southern is very aware of me. Right? I'm going to I'm going to throw out a date. So if if Lauren Southern is watching this, she'll know that I know that she knows that I know. Because right now when people say, Oh, Rollo, how come you don't show us the medical records of her of her? What was it? Her? Was it her? Excuse me, her ultrasound, her fetal monitoring ultrasound from about this time last month, what time tomorrow tomorrow will be the anniversary. As a matter of fact, it was August 8 2022. When she decided to go and get a fetal monitoring. Yeah, MRI, ultrasound. And I'm gonna I'm gonna throw one more date out there. Lauren, March 24 2023. See if you can guess what that is. I know, I know that I know and you know that I know. So, like, yeah, I think what's interesting is the silence is fucking deafening. People come at me and say, well, you need to show this problem, show the proof, blah, blah, blah, blah. I can't. Because if I do that, I get I will definitely get suspension for doing that, whether it's Twitter, or it's Instagram, or it's in any social media platform. If I'm revealing actual medical records, that is like if that is the definition of doxing. So and I'm not going to do that. So I again, like I said, I'm happy to show you the that documentation in person, in print in person, no problem. But once again, and I made mention of this on Flacco show on no jumper as well. But March 24 2023. You know that I know. So you might want to start addressing that Lauren pretty soon. And Brittany Venti, I have more dirt on you than just the Mason stuff, too. So but I'm choosing to the better part of valor here. So I'm just kind of backing up off of this. See where it goes. But I think it's fascinating that people want to hit me for that shit. But then nobody has questions. You don't have any questions for Lauren words, words, words of questions. No, let's talk about that. Hmm. Yeah, she doesn't want to open her mouth for a lot of for various reasons. Much respect Rola. I'm interested in the dog tags. You guys like that? I had so much response to that. I'm going to do dog tags. I'll do Rolos roughnecks. Let's see. I'm asking one for our sister companies if they could facilitate it. They manufacture customer Yeah, please result hit me up and let me know how to do it's not even like I could probably find some place to actually do the dog tags. It's like fulfillment. Finding like I don't know that like T spring or any of these other places actually do like you know, this style of like necklace and, and dog tags. But if I could find somebody who could also do fulfillment, I would be happy to do that. So um, no, we do not. Thank you. Um, so my daughter got married on Thursday. And I had a lot of people asking me questions about that. And I decided that I was going to do today's show on marriage advice. And do I don't give advice. I just throw out statistics and analysis and everything else. But as a influencer, people can't help but take it as advice. So I'm going to dig into that a little bit today are pods given women, the game, giving women pods, podcasts, giving women the game, RP, gal chameleons. Um, no, I think what it is, is it's a convenient, convenient grift, for sure. And like I said, most of the most of the women here, there's like a cycle, I think. When women come into this space, the only the only pat myself on the back, the only woman that I can think of right now who hasn't followed this template, and maybe I'm just give her a little bit more time and she will is Torsha. Most women when they come into this space, they're really gung ho about it. How can roll? How can you don't have a book called the rational female? Because there's a book called the rational male. And it covers all the stuff I would cover in the rational female. How do you think about that? Well, we need something for ladies, I actually wrote a an essay I can, maybe I'll read it today. I have an essay that I wrote, I think it was in 2020. Maybe 2021. It was called an essay for women."}
