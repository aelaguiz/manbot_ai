Jeez. Today's gonna be a really good day. We're getting back to nuts and bolts today. I've got a lot of, I've got a lot of instruments, almost like a red pill potpourri once again. I feel like I have to go around the floor. It's gonna be some action, though. It's fine, I'm gonna start doing my Wednesday shows. Anyways, live from Reno, Nevada, this is The Brash Homo. This is from my secret bunker, middle of the Nevada desert. Fallout shelter. Don't worry, I'm well-supplied. Well-supplied. All my satellite uplinks are here. Oh, God. I apologize for doing this to you so early in the show, but looks like I'm gonna have to. You guys make me do this, so I'm probably gonna have to do this. One of the things I see problematic in the so-called manosphere online, it's because all the men who are unsuccessful are clattering on about what's wrong with women. It's like, by definition, there's nothing wrong with women, right? If you're not adapting yourself to women, it's not the women's problem. Yeah, right. Exactly. It's your problem. And that's by definition. And it's the same thing in relationship to your relationship to the world. It's that if your sacrifices aren't being rewarded, the right question to ask is, how am I prideful and blind? Not, how is the world constituted in an ill-gotten manner? It's all your fault. Very important to note that if you are an emotionally unavailable man, and trust me, most likely, if you are an emotionally unavailable man, I'm not gonna be able to admit to this, but if you're an emotionally unavailable man, you cannot create safety for the woman that you're with. Why? You're not there for her. So you're not trustworthy. Also, it will end in a woman feeling alone in her relationship. You will be signaling to that woman by being emotionally available that you are unsafe and it is an absolute guarantee that relationship will end. Well, I'm a whore! Term one-night-stand sequential relationship types. Okay, who are they? Psychopathic, narcissistic, Machiavellian, and sadistic. Old one-night-stand people? The definition of a psychopath is someone who uses someone for short-term gratification. So it's definitional. And then you might say, well, I'm not... No, I'm not really sure that's the definition of psychopath. I mean, call me crazy. It's been a little while since I've seen the DSM, but I don't think that's actually the definition, Jordan. Like that, I just like sex. It's like, yeah, but if you practice that for five years, you're not going to become what you practice. Your boyfriend or husband stops being attracted to other women. He has... He's gay. He's dying. I don't get mad when my boyfriend like... Today, he's on a radio show and I was listening to his show yesterday. But he was talking about that... You remember the World Cup to Iran? Like that really hot girl? Do I remember? I think about it every day. Yeah, yeah. He mentioned something about her and I was like... They were just reading tweets that they liked, and it was some tweet about her, like we'll miss her. And I could tell that he was like turned on by her. And he didn't say it, but he was like... I could just tell, like he sympathized with the tweet. And I was just like... And it made me like so jealous because she looks nothing like me. And I could tell that he like was definitely probably like zoomed in on a picture of her at one point. But man, it made me like so horny for him. I was just like I miss you so much. I don't know. I like when I see him... But you've always kind of been like that, right? But it's like the threat. Like I'm going to lose him to that. So I got to like... Ah, yes. And it makes me... I always just get mad when women are like... He's attracted to women. I saw him looking at a girl. It's like if your boyfriend or husband stops being attracted to other women, he has... He's gay. He's dying. Flawless victory. What do you say about body count? The testament of your body count is more your rejection rate than how many people you slept with. Let's take somebody like you, for example, who's got a big name on social media, looks great, access to loads of women through the nightclub. Now, if you're... She's addressing Chris Williamson just for information. Your body count is, let's say, if it's 10, but you've had hundreds of girls throwing themselves at you, yours is actually still low. Whereas if another guy who has no access to women but finally gets one or two girls to sleep with him, on paper, it might be less. But his rejection rate is so low. So really look at how many people your partner is rejecting rather than just their body count. Because on paper, a really unattractive man who has nothing going for him, his body count is going to be low. It doesn't mean he's a decent man. It's just that he didn't have the opportunity. Similarly, women that are not that nice to be around, not that kind, not that pretty, not that attractive, hers is going to be low. It doesn't mean she's virtuous. It's just that she didn't have access. It's the ones that have access but choose to be selective. That's what you should be looking at, is their selectivity. Your mental health isn't dependent on you. That's not the right way to think about it. I don't think you can be mentally healthy in the absence of a long-term stable relationship. You have to be married. So you have to establish a relationship with someone that integrates sexuality that's there for the long run. Because there for the long run is the same as sane. Does he seem more angry to you? Like everything is like, get that furrowed brow. Grrrr. There for tomorrow. There for the next minute. That's not sanity. That's impulsiveness. That's aimlessness. They're the same thing. Um, I disagree. If you want to find a man, you better downgrade your look. And I was like, what? Right? He's like, when I look at you, I think, what a gorgeous woman, but I can't have her because she's too expensive. And I was like, uh, yeah, that's the point. How dare you? I'm not about to go downgrade my look so I can get someone who's cheap or who can't afford me. Right? I upgraded my look even more after he gave me this advice. Because I'm like, uh, no, thank you. I'm not trying to downgrade my look so someone can afford me easily. I'm trying to find the guy that can afford me. Right? That can afford to be in the same room with me. Because I'm going up. Okay? So that's how it really works. The woman next to the man defines his status in society in subtle ways, often subconscious. Exactly. So if you are doing 50-50 with your man, and you are, you know, giving him that, you're building him up while building yourself down. Like it absolutely makes no sense. Well, I'm a whore. Pray about your stupidity. Here's a prayer that'll work for sure. You want to see if prayer works? Here's one. This will work. Sit on the edge of your bed. Ask yourself, what bloody stupid thing do I continue to do that's making my life more miserable than it has to be, and everyone else's life around me, that I could give up, that I would give up? You'll get an answer. It won't be when you want. That's how you'll know it's true. But if you act on it, then your life will improve. And that's a proper prayer. She's not a Christian! I want you to feel the way that they feel, but at the beginning we made it clear that that ain't what we on. The person who fell in love is definitely at fault. And the reason is... We gon' keep it real up here today. We gon' keep it real up here today. Because at the end of the day, people enjoy lying to themselves to keep somebody that I really like, and I knew I liked right from the top of the relationship, close to me. And that's the problem. You knew that if I kept it to you and said, you know what, I really like you, and I might fall for you, that that was gonna push you away. Because that ain't what you wanted. So what am I gon' say? I'm gon' say, okay, you don't want a relationship? I don't either. And then hoping that's gon' keep you close to me and hoping that eventually you gon' develop the same feelings I got. And then when that person who stand on their word that they said at the top of their relationship, I don't want to be with you. You catching feelings has nothing to do with that person being right or wrong. You lying to yourself. And, and, and... And, and, and... And, and, and... And, and, and... And, and, and... And, and, and... And, and, and... What gives you joy? You know, um, I think, I think, for me it was, uh, I've been trying to work it out. You know what I mean? Like, you know, we all, because, you know, we, one thing I definitely learned that everything I thought made you happy made you happy for a minute. Tell me about it. You know what I mean? Tell me about it. So I read something a while back, I actually have it in, when you came into the kitchen, it's written there, it's cause I need to, it says, it says that happiness is not a future event. Do you know what I mean? Wow. Yeah, no, that's beautiful. It's like, it's one of those things that everything that we're doing here, that we live as humans, is to be present, and enjoy this right now, and be happy about what's this. Easier said than done, because we always think, like, the platinum record, when the dream we had is gonna do it, and then you still got issues, you got problems in personal, it doesn't change personal life, it doesn't change anything. Let me look at what happened in any band, the greatest bands in the world, the Van Halens, everybody, everybody, Zep, you could still all live your dreams, but you think, those things aren't the things that, those are, those are things that you enjoy, but happiness has to be, you know, you have to just... You have to be. You have to. You have to be blessed with whatever we're doing now. That's why I'm asking you guys. I'm looking, I'm still looking. I ask everybody. You're not gonna find it. You're not gonna find it. Yes, I am. It's being present. You're already happy, man. It's right here. How could you be happier than being sitting with us right now? That's a little overrated. I'm happy. All right, all right, all right. There you go. Here's your quote for today. Thank you, Nuno. Thank you. Thank you for agreeing with me, Nuno. God, I love that guy. Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. Here we go. Right now. Howdy. Hi there. How you doing? Pat Campbell. Gotta remember those days. Anybody remember those days? No, you don't. Of course you don't. You just started following me yesterday, didn't you? Oh, man. What a, what a, what a, what a week it has been. I want to get back to some old school stuff today. Yeah, Arthur C. Clark, the, would you call him a futurist? I guess I would call him, call him a futurist. Just kind of rushed into the studio today. Sorry about that. I would, I would call him a futurist. I certainly, science fiction author, Arthur C. Clark. The reason I use that today is because it's going to be kind of pertinent to what we're going to get into today. I want to talk about emotions. And I think that a lot of, a lot of the criticism that, well, one of the criticisms, there's so many different criticisms. Everybody's like disingenuous to begin with when it comes to like, you know, well, those red pill guys, they don't talk about emotion. They don't talk about emotions. They think you should just be a robot. No, no, we don't. Actually, if you read any of my books, you would know. Yeah, hookers and blow. Thank you. Yes. Yeah, there you go. I'm going to, I'm going to put that on there. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Where'd that go? Hookers and blow, hookers and blow. Thank you. Yep. You always get that on there. Yeah, I know. I know. Well, see, here's the thing is, I already explained why I use so many Jordan Peterson clips today, because he's kind of getting a little, you know, hostile in his old age, I guess. And I'm wondering if it's like, if it's not playing to an audience at this point, but I'm going to dig into, I have another video that with, with Jordan and Chris Williamson today. And I'll dig into that because it's pertinent to what we're talking about. Actually, the thing that sort of like set me off on today's topic is actually it was whole math of all people. Whole math was, I was been, you know, sort of sifting through some of his videos, which by the way, please go subscribe to whole math. I think he's great. I'm really, I think I might try to get him on this show. I definitely want to get the, the new guy was at the naked developer or something like that. I think I used one of his clips recently. He was talking about how the algorithm works for dating apps. He just reached out to me on Instagram. I'm going to see if I can set something up maybe for a midweek interview with him. I also would like to, I'm trying to get ahold of a whole math. I don't think it would be that difficult. I just go through Mike because I know Mike's interviewed him before. So I'll probably be doing that later this week. I'm going to start doing a little bit more material because I am house bound because of my greyhound, which is actually, Ned is actually doing much better. Thank you very much. Got to give you the, the Ned update first. But I wanted to talk about instinct, emotion and reason. This is a, a concept that I sort of was developing as far back as,   2017,  I think I wrote a series of essays on The Rational Man, my blog at the time. And they turned into a kind of a, an abridged version of all of those sort of condensed version, I guess, of all those essays. And they showed up in my, my fourth book, Religion. And I really don't know if I did justice to it because it's such a, it's a much broader, concept, I think, than most people want to give it credit. And so there's, there was like two, two instances this week that really sort of set me off on that, on this path. And one of them was reading a, a tweet by Chris Williams, of all people talking once again about vulnerability, that old chestnut gets to get reheated again. And so that sort of set me off on this. And then I was wondering how many people are really aware of the triune brain theory. And so I wanted to get into that a little bit because I had no idea, by the way, I wrote an essay. I'm going to read a little bit of it to you today, instinct, emotion and reason. And this was, this was kind of an extension of what I was doing in psychology at the time when I was writing this stuff. And it occurred to me that there are really three different processes that human beings use when they're processing and sort of interpreting information. Through our ears, our eyes, our nose, our mouth, you know, the senses. And that really breaks down into instinct, emotion and reason. I, this was before I even had heard of the triune brain theory because triune brain theory was something that was sort of like put to the side or was like really kind of like ignored. Triune brain theory has been around really since I think the early seventies. And we didn't, I don't think we had enough, I don't think we had enough real understanding of like neurosciences and we certainly hadn't plotted the human genome by that point, obviously. And I think we have a better understanding of how the brain works, I'm not saying it's complete obviously, but I think we have a better understanding of it and it seems to me that we need to really kind of revisit triune brain theory, theory, whatever it is. Because it kind of, I was kind of surprised, I surprised myself, I surprised myself because I had no idea what triune brain theory was when I was writing Instinct, Emotion and Reason. I was attempting at that time to sort of sort out the way that women process sort of their surroundings and their environments and you know, through the filters of Instinct, Emotion and Reason, whereas men on the other hand, it's usually Instinct, Reason and then Emotion. But we can also see how that process sort of gets, let's just say sidetracked a bit. And another reason I started wanting to sort of reheat this topic a little bit was because I think a lot of guys will run into these practical problems with some woman that they're involved with and that woman ends up becoming very emotional or we tend to think of women sort of as hysterical or histrionic or they tend to be ruled by their emotions, they tend to be ruled by like drama. I want a woman with no drama, good fucking luck. Drama and indignation are simply part of the female dynamic and how you deal with that or how you don't deal with that is really, well it's kind of up to you I guess, but it's something that you're going to have to at least untangle for yourself at some point as a man. So I wanted to get into that a little bit more today. There's a lot of, I mean, I could probably do another like four hour show on just like this, just this topic. But when I was writing the title to today's show, you know, How to Control Emotional Women, right? Well, first you have to understand the difference between Instinct, Emotion and Reason and how women process that emotion. So the first kind of article of business that we need to get into here is understanding how our minds process like the outside world, like external stimuli, right? I'm going to use my, I'm going to put the big brain hat on today. And usually it's of course through the five senses, right? Sight, sound, touch, taste, you know, all the good ones. And that's how we kind of interpret our surroundings. So that really what happens is at that point it sort of goes through the instinctual side of things because that's the most immediate side. How do we process that information? Then it goes through the emotional and then hopefully it makes it to the rational or perhaps it goes to the rational and then it goes to the emotional just depending on how we're looking at it. So I'm going to, I've got a few things I wanted to dig into here. Let me see if I can throw this up on the screen real quick. I hope I got this right, didn't I? Yeah, I did. There it goes. So the same brain theory, just to, you know, just sort of hit the ground running here. The lizard brain, I'm sure you've heard me and several other, by the way, I'm not the first one to coin this term, but people will talk about the lizard brain or they'll talk about the hind brain. This is the most basic base part of our understanding, 1960, there you go. So it's as far back as 1960. Now remember, I have to, just a full disclosure here because some people are going to take me to take me to the carpet on this. I'm going to just get this out of the way to begin with. A lot of people think, oh, that theory's been debunked. Well, yeah, back in the mid 60s, back in the early 70s when we didn't have access to information that we do in 2023. And I can understand why it was unpopular at that time, because this gives people a clear physical manifestation of how we process things, how we deal with emotions, how we deal with our reason, our gray matter versus our limbic system. So if you look at the lizard brain right there, of course, that's the most rudimentary side of our understanding. So you got brain and stem and cerebellum, okay, that's fight or flight, that's autopilot. I think to a degree, it would also be sort of like your autonomous nervous system on top of that. Obviously, like right now, I'm not thinking about breathing, but if I were, I can control my breathing. If I have to start monologuing for you, I'm not going to worry about it. The breathing apparatus has moved to the periphery. And I think that's important to bear in mind because part of triune brain theory is predicated, I think, on peripheral awareness and understanding our surroundings. You've got to remember that there's so many things going on right now. Let's just use where I'm at right now as my example, okay? I can see my monitor right here, I can see the camera right here, I've got a secondary monitor going over here, I'm looking at lighting effects, I've got my sound, I've got my board right over here, I've got my mic here, hopefully I don't knock into it, right? But I'm still talking and I'm still sort of delivering this, my conscious, my cognitive awareness is really basically on what I'm speaking about, but my peripheral awareness, I can see where my soundboard is, I can see where the input is, I can see where my stream deck is. Those guys are back! There you go, sorry, I hit the wrong one. So I've got peripheral awareness of my surroundings so I can allow that into my sort of cognitive process as I'm delivering the show. And people just do this naturally, I mean, this is like a no-brainer. People like, literally, it's a no-brainer. People don't understand that there's certain things that we're really good at multitasking to the point where we have to push things off to the periphery so that our peripheral vision can see what's going on, but we're still focusing on what we're doing whereas things are going on around us. So that concept is pushed off, the peripheral awareness is pushed off into the instinctual side of the lizard brain. So we've got fight, flight, autopilot. Now this is also, there's more complex behaviors that are associated with the instinctual side. So for instance, I've used this example before, if I were to like say, throw something at me, I would instinctively flinch, right? Because it's like self-preservation, right? You want to fight or flight, you want to get out of the way, you want to, ew. Our revulsion responses, for example, like, have you ever been, I know I've done this but have you ever been with a group of guys or you're out partying or something like that and somebody has too much to drink and they throw up and then you feel the need to like sort of throw it because you smell it and you're like, ugh, and you kind of get that. That's a revulsion response that is an instinctual response. Now evolutionary theory says that that's the reason for that response, that revulsion response is due to the fact that if somebody is throwing up in our ancestral past, it probably meant that that person ingested something poisonous or a pathogen or there's something around them that forced them to throw up and the possibility that you also ingested that is pretty high. So therefore, it triggers sort of this autonomous need to yak. That's an instinct. Okay, that's an instinctual response to the lizard brain, the hindbrain. And then there's other parts of that that were, you know, again, instinctually pushed off to the periphery. Were certain events or certain circumstances to happen in your environment, you would trigger other instinctual responses as a result of that because it's more important for you to, you know, draw breath to, you know, to eat, to get, you know, to want to hunt food, to want to eat things. There's the instinctual side of things. So that's how we interpret our surroundings through the instincts. Now, the next part of this is, and again, this is sort of the preamble to all this. So bear with me. This is a mammal brain or the limbic brain. This is emotions, memories and habits. Okay, so these are, this is sort of the midbrain area. I want to say this is the cerebellum, I'm pretty sure. Again, I'm not a neuroscientist, but this is sort of the midbrain area and this is where emotions are born. So one of the, again, the second reason, I guess, that I wanted to cover today's topic is because I've been reading through, once again, going back through the book, Positive Evolutionary Psychology. And again, it goes back to the happiness thing. That's why I included Nuno Bettencourt at the end of my videos today, because he gets it. I love how he like instinctually gets it. He like, I mean, maybe he read it in some pithy little, you know, motivational thing, but he gets the idea that happiness is not a destination. Happiness is not a goal state. It's not something that is a sustainable place to be. It is not a ultimate outcome. It is a proximate outcome. I love how he just sort of instinctually figures out that happiness is in the doing. And that's going to be very important because when we're talking about controlling women's emotions or we talk about controlling our own emotions, it's important to understand exactly what emotions are. And emotions are born, of course, in that mid section right there. So we make our decisions, make emotional decisions. Honestly, I think probably we can update this from 1960, right? I think our rational minds, our gray matter, our reasonable minds can also make good decisions for you. And I'm going to also give you a very recent example of this. And it really kind of makes me choke up a little bit, but I'll tell you why in a second. So when we're looking at emotions, problem that we have with emotions today is I think we, in some ways, glorify them and deify them. We turn them into these spiritual events. We think that emotion is something that is sort of outside of us rather than inside of us. And emotion is something that I can, if you go and you shoot up a bunch of trend, you get roid rage and you get angry and frustrated. You have basically used a chemical to change your emotional state. If you drink a lot of tequila and your clothes fall off, you've just changed your emotional. Congratulations. You've just changed your emotional state. There are ways we can change our emotional state. You can go from happy that you can go from heaven to hell in a blink of an eye because of some situational condition that that triggers that going from, you know, it could be fight or flight. You know, the instinct. Again, remember, instincts feeds into emotion. Emotion, of course, feeds into into rationality and reason. So when someone says that they're governed by their emotions or when the red pill, those red pill guys think that women are just this bundle of emotions. Or my all time favorite, the rational male. Do you know how rational most men are? That's why I named the book The Rational Male. I love that response and piss people off. The rest, give me that with this rational male stuff. He doesn't know anything about anything that triggering that response. That's exactly what I wanted the cover of the book to do successfully for over 10 years now. That's what I was hoping for. It's triggering an emotional response, usually with women. But it's the it's this this scoffing and thinking that if I say the rational male, people think I get this all the time. Hell, I just got this from from from Marquette on Satan Center. That is a rational male. My brand, a registered trademark. Pretty much. That's that's basically what it is. Or I would get introduced. I think even even Adam Sosnick has introduced me as Rolla Tomasi, the rational male. Oh, all right. I'll own it, I guess. That's never been like my my point has never been to sort of like, say, I'm the rational male and this is how I'm I'm Mr. Spock and fascinating behavior. Raise my eyebrow a little bit. That's never been my motive, let's just say. But what does it trigger up when you when you say men are rational, especially when you're talking to like the average female, these I don't care what generation from boomers all the way up to Gen Z right now or Gen Y or whatever the hell the next one is. You say the rational male, it triggers women, especially women. And then, of course, you know, more feminized, you know, male feminists, right, allies, allies. They'll say they'll pretty much say the same thing. Oh, well, men are emotional, too, don't you know? Gosh, you know, most wars are started by men, like as if that was the reason why. You know what? I'm feeling really depressed. I'm going to start a war today. Fuck it. And more wars are start for wars are started for our resource grabs mostly. They're very practical. They're very pragmatic. If anything, starting a war is is is some of the most practical, pragmatic things that you can do when it comes to like resource acquisition. Remember what I said? Powerful men, territory, resources and access to beautiful women. When you think about it, that's war can can be a very, you know, pragmatic response. I'm not saying it's right, but I'm just saying that seems like it's the most it's the shortest distance between A and B. So when I love it, when women tend to think or tend to put tend to put men into the same emotional class as themselves. And I I'm going to once I finish up the rest of this, try and brain theory thing here, just to give you sort of a preview. Most women will think that most men are exactly like them when it comes to relating when it comes to emotional accessibility. He's not emotionally available. Yeah. He's a dude. That's why we're not built the same. We don't have the same hardware installed. We don't have the same like OS installed in our brains either. But we're still pretending as if we do and men are stunted or retarded or they are. And I mean that in a clinical sense or are in some way there's something very, very wrong with men because they don't emote and they don't interpret and they don't they don't feel the same way that women do for and are triggered by the same emotional stimuli that women are triggered by as well. And so women think that men are very blundering, stupid cavemen. And we're really not. We just lack the hardware. I'm going to point that out in spades to you guys today here in just a moment. So we go back to this. The limbic system, of course."}
