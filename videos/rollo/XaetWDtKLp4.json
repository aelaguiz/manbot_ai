I only have one rule. Everyone fights, no one quits. You don't do your job, I'll shoot you. You get me? We get you, sir! Welcome to the Roughnecks. Rock Cats Roughnecks. Better late than never, right? Sorry I had a lot of video to sit through. There we go. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry. Eventually, I get around to it. My glasses session, you are correct. What do you think the Redfields get strong? What do you think we never talk about? I got some good news for you if you like this song. Javonni Sanders and I are working on it right now. Talked to him this morning as a matter of fact. Thank you. Massaging. Oh boy. Speaking of massaging. Apologize in advance because I'm dead certain this stream is going to bog them like all of them do on stream these days and not just with my stream. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry about that, guys. Sorry. Bye. So crazy the things that men will say when their egos are bruised, typically for me when they take my content too personally. Recently, I've gotten feedback that my content can be viewed as toxic femininity, that I need to be careful about the rhetoric that I use. They could make my boys feel like their very existence on this earth is flawed and that it's wrongful and it's an inconvenience. And that because I'm teaching them to be a good human and a good partner, they will not only hate me, but they're going to hate all women. It's a little ironic because girls are too often, and this is not exclusive to culture, raised to believe that we are flawed, that our sole purpose is to end up with a man who will validate our entire existence. Work your entire life to build a career, but you're worthless until you're married. At which point you should really put your career dreams aside because, you know, you need to create a family. And by the way, the heavy lifting is going to be on you. So stop being selfish. Oh yeah. And can you please get your act together and put yourself together? Because you look like a mess. And all that being said, many of us don't hate all men, don't resent men, still choose men to be our partners and share our lives with. I wouldn't worry so much about my sons resenting me or all women. I'm going to put my snarkiness aside because it makes me sad that seeking equality is so threatening for some men. And that when I choose to do the only thing that I have in my power, which is to start change in my home with my boys and gaslighting my sons. I've decided to move into another direction. That's how you feel. I got to respect it. And that's all you have to say. That's how I feel. I'm going to respect it. That's all you have to say. Let's just let it go. You ain't trying to fight for nothing. You seem like you've already made it about me already making a decision. You don't have a decision. I wanted you to say something. You're not saying it's not time to listen. It's time to talk. All of the things you say, you want to be there. You're here for me. You're all about the future and everything. You didn't even fight for a second. What does that say about you? Women are more likely to be attracted to men who show dark triad traits. Narcissistic, Machiavellian and psychopathic. People who have those traits are characterized by the mimicry of competence. And so what women want in men more than anything else is competent generosity. We hooked up with a blood diamonds dealer in South Africa. And then we took his private jet to like a guerrilla reserve in Uganda where we exchanged diamonds for cash and then we flew home. A guy who spent 10 years in prison for murder. And he got out early on good behavior. But yeah, I dated a hardcore convicted felon. He had a tattoo in the middle of his forehead. What did he sell? Blue and choppy? It was white and choppy. The fact that women would choose that 50,000 years ago, it made sense to couple up with a man who could do massive amounts of violence on your behalf. There were predators and there were other tribes trying to kill you, kill your men and steal the women. If you look through the anthropological record, men have axe wounds, thin crushed skulls and broken ribs. Women's skeletons were pristine. Nobody ever hurt the women. Having the biggest, strongest guy on your side made sense. Now in 2023, you can be 5'9 and buy a Glock. You don't need to be the biggest, strongest guy. And if you look at recon Marines, Navy SEALs and the best MMA fighters, almost all of them are under six feet tall. What is your major mouthwash system? A lot of those women that can't access their softer side, that fierce independence is a trauma response in most cases, right? They feel like they have to be only that way, only strong. Like they can't access both because of where they've come from. And I tend to think that people that have less judgment and have been on both sides of things can access being softer and that empathy a whole lot more than the people that are still currently not healed. It requires wisdom, okay? That's a trait that I never hear people talk about. But if you want to be feminine, you need to have wisdom, okay? That means you're wise and you can make good judgments. You're not just defaulting to whatever some dude says. You're able to say, yes, this is good. Yes, no, this doesn't really feel good or authentic to myself and then make an informed decision from there. And you use that wisdom to therefore say, this is a time to embrace more strength. This is a time to fall back and be more gentle. It's the wisdom that I think puts you on that continuum of when to use or present with more strength or more gentleness. And to be in flow, right? Yes. Because I think that another trait that's very commonly associated with masculinity is linear, right? It's linear and flow is not linear. For me, romantic chemistry is incredibly volatile. It's not based on any barometers of like, oh, he's in school. He has this career or anything. So it could just be random dude off the street. 100%. I am not hypergamous at all. If you are so hypergamous, you won't have sex with a guy until the guy is the guy that you're looking for. Of course, and then if I had had sex with guys and then they made less than me and then you'd say, oh, because we broke up, it proves that none of those interactions counted, right? I think the fact that you are a virgin right now just proves the point that you're hypergamous, like to a very high degree. Dude, this guy is such a loser, bro. Look at him. The fact that I'm abstinent means that I'm waiting for someone richer than me. No, no, hypergamy doesn't mean women are bad. When did I say bad? When did I even imply that? Hypergamy is just an algorithm. It's an evolutionary adaptation that women have. It's not a negative or positive thing. It's fine. I'm not sure if it's an evolutionary adaptation. I think the reason women have historically been hypergamous is because they were barred from higher education. So obviously the average man was going to earn more than them. But by 2050, we're going to see a total reversal of hypergamy. Hypergamy existed before there was money. Hypergamy has nothing to do with money. I'm using the current definition of hypergamy, which is that women date someone with a superior sociological or monetary background. These guys are so dumb. I mean, yeah. Well, whatever. She's great. Go check her out. Yeah, she's great. Boy, wait till I show you how great she is here, Ethan. ...between insecure and boundaries. Because here's the thing. A lot of men, they'll say, No, I'm not being insecure. I'm just setting boundaries. But you are being insecure. Because here's the difference between insecure and boundaries. A secure man will see what you have to offer. Like, read the menu and decide if he will stay or leave. Exactly. An insecure man will say, You need to do this. You need to do this. Rather than just saying, You are who you are. I'm going to have to leave. You're not right for me. You're not right for me. There we go. Much better. I have to put that little tag in there because I know I'm going to get copyright strikes for half of those. See, this is the hard work I do for you on every one of these goddamn shows, man. Let me tell you something. How are we doing? Apologize about being late. I have to have a new process that I have to follow before I do a show these days. And it requires me to pick up a 73-pound greyhound and take him in the backyard so he can take a piss and a shit before I do the show. Because if I don't, he's sitting there waiting for about three, four hours. So, yeah. Got to do things according to the book here. Just pointing that out. That's doing good. Thank you very much. I appreciate you guys for helping me out with anything. By the way, he's in the awkward stage right now where he wants to do more than he thinks he can. So, I have to really, really keep an eye on him because this is where he slipped the first time. So, got to be careful of that. Anyways, let's see. What else do we got going on? Do you like the Ethan Klein show? The Ethan Klein... Who am I to this motherfucker? Where is this all coming from? And by the way, the reason I showed this last one, I'm going to come back to that one with Farrah because this is a work of art. I'm going to show you just how much of a work of art this is because it's everything that's... I'm dead-ass certain that... These are the response videos to these things. This is the new hotness, I guess, because I've seen the... Maybe I'm wrong in this. I could be wrong, but I see Candace Owens' reaction videos, right? And it's not... All she's doing is just kind of like... And she doesn't say a goddamn thing, but the video's going, so it's like there's these wordless reaction like real. You see most of these on TikTok or they'll be on Instagram, and I guess it's sort of like a new way of doing things. So, they say like, oh, Ben Shapiro responds to Rolo Tomasi. He has nothing to do with me whatsoever, and I could put my own video on the top frame and it doesn't say a goddamn thing, and it works. Welcome to the hacknet, to the... To the grift, my friends. Yeah, so I thought that was pretty funny, especially Ethan Klein, who's coming out of the... And by the way, it's like I got DJ Akademiks coming out. What the... What did I do? I didn't fucking say a goddamn thing. And then... I mean, maybe I'm just living rent-free in the dude's head. And then I got Marquette... What was his last name? From Saint and Center, who was calling me out to do a debate. I'm like, dude, you could just ask me and I'll do it. I'm friends with the guy. I like the dude. I like Marquette. Peace to the saints, my friends. I actually watch his show occasionally when I can if it's something that I'm interested in. Like, if he's talking about something that is within my wheelhouse, I make a point to watch. I know he's in Vegas too. I've been wanting to do a show with Marquette for a while. And so, he wants to do... I didn't have to sell it this way, I guess, but he wants to do a show kind of similar to what I'm doing today, which is going to be sort of... Oh, The Red Pill never talks about these things. Well, I think maybe your impression of what The Red Pill is is probably limited in scope. And I'm trying to be as polite as I possibly can because I consider Marquette a friend. And so, he wants to do a show with me. I think he wants to do it on December 9th, if memory serves. So, watch out for that. I'm happy to do that. I just did a show with Creatrix, also Brandy. I can't remember her last name, but I just did it on her show. God damn it. I'm so bad with show names these days. I'm lousy with show names. But I did a really good show with them and what was it, Ryan? Somebody give me the name of that damn show. I just did it. Yeah, I know. And I realize this, but let me also explain something else to you, Weaponry Fitness. The other thing is, not to take anything away from MLD, but he's not going to defend The Red Pill as well as I think I can. And amongst the topics he wanted to talk about was who started The Red Pill, which really is not even me if you think about it. Although a lot of people want to point back to my book or they want to point back before that. You know what? I'll go find that. Hang on one second because it's too good to let that one go. Hang on a sec. I'm going to find you the link. I was not prepared to throw this one out there really quickly, but it is, where did I do it? I want to say it was I love how I can type in like Rolo Tomasi in the search engine and it's like nothing. Oh here, here's how you find Rolo's daughter. You know this actually might make for some really brilliant content to actually go and see if I can figure out God damn it. Hang on. It's in my history. Hang on. Where'd it go? Where'd it go? There it is. Let's see. Apologize in advance for this, but it's too good to let you guys not in on this really good show that I did with them. It was Creatrix and Jesus. Yeah, it was anyways, I'll dig up that. I'll dig up. I don't want to waste time, but I'll dig it up, but it was a really good show and a lot of the topics that we talked about on that panel show, I was going to want to get into probably with Marquette, but obviously with myself here today as well. What's that? The Latin chick. Funny you should say that. I have that the Latin chick, you mean the lawyer, porn lawyer, porn lawyer, OnlyFans lawyer, Jasmine Jafar. You know what's funny is if you look at Jasmine Jafar's look and you look at this chick, Right here that I like of her owning Rolo Tony Brown. For me, romantic chemistry is incredibly volatile. It's not OK, by the way, when I let me just I'm going to explain this like on the fly here really quickly. Jasmine Jafar aims for this look, too. It's the Mia Khalifa look is what it is. And later on in that show, the funniest line. And, you know, I got it. I got to give it to Brian from whatever podcast halfway through the show. He's like, are those prescription lenses? Because she didn't have lenses in those glasses. They were just for look. The Mia Khalifa, Mia Khalifa, I guess, has sort of popularized this. I don't watch me, a Khalifa porn is not really my my groove, but like apparently this, you know, wearing some glasses makes you sort of like gives you that kind of nerdy appeal, I guess, in porn. And maybe this is a OnlyFans thing. And people told me afterwards that that that this is Farrah, by the way, she's she's one of Destiny's Angels is, you know, Charlie's Angels, Destiny's Angels. She's she was also being fed information on her phone from Destiny during the show. So as admitted, by the way, I can show you the videos where they admitted where he admitted to this. So which is which proved him as a liar, by the way, because I know I nailed his ass to the wall, you know, talking to asking him about the what was it? The super chat at the end of this show. And by the way, this is going all the way back to me. This goes, I think it was at the beginning of May that me and Justin Waller and Mike Sartain were on the whatever podcast. And it was it was a good show. It was fun. I'm happy to say it wasn't a seven hour show like poor Andrew Wilson was forced to endure. But she's one of Destiny's Angels. So is Jasmine Jafar, by the way, if she's wearing if she's wearing these style glasses, she's probably one of Destiny's Girls. Not so erudite, who was also on whatever podcast with Andrew Wilson just two days ago, three days ago. And by the way, that Bravo, Andrew, seven hours. Holy shit, dude, I don't know if I could endure how I couldn't even endure four hours on Fresh and Fit. My God. But yeah, I just want to say I meant, yeah, I'm going to I'll display your if you see what do we what should we call it at today? Let's do it at the ten dollar level, ten dollars and up. Well, I'll I'll read out. I want to do you guys proper on this one. But this is Farah. And I think what's interesting is the funny thing about this is this entire clip has been so hacked. And I'm going to show you where the hacking took place. I'm almost like I could almost create a new YouTube channel taking hacked videos and showing you like doing reactions to hacked videos and showing you the full video. And what you're not getting in it now, that probably wouldn't fit the, you know, the forty five second one minute, you know, time limit for most of these things. But the thing is, is it's it's it's interesting to me that like you see like like Ethan, like why? Like fucking cares, dude, and by the way, even client, if you're watching this and I'm sure you will, because you apparently I'm living rent free in your head as well. Invitation still on the table, bro. And when I come to Vegas, me and my room would be we would love to have that debate that we've been waiting for forever. Anytime you're ready, my friend, I'm not going to give you a respectful debate. I'll give you a respectful talk. I will I will most definitely do a whole lot better than Pearl did on your show. You want us out there? Fine. Anytime, man. You know where to find it. Clearly, clearly, you know where to find us. So anytime you're ready, bro, come on. Las Vegas, your place, mine, wherever you want to go. Good to go. Let's get let's get Myron involved that that that that offer still on the table. I'm sure my room would love to take you up on that, too. Is that going to happen? Probably not, but I'd be happy to knock your dick in the dirt, especially over shit like this, because that's all it is. This is just content, just free content. And they're kind of going back in time here. Ethan Klein from H3H3. Yeah, I know who. I don't understand how this dude has an audience, to be quite honest with you. I don't think there's any educational value to his show. I don't really think there's that much like entertainment value to his show, other than the fact that he wants to. Yeah, it was. Yeah, you are correct, sir. You are correct. I have a new Pearl. Here's my Pearl sound drop. Have you ever had a dream that you had, you could do, you could do so much, you could do anything. That's a new Pearl drop, except you mentioned Pearl. You're going to get that, OK? Thank you, Big Mo, for for dropping that one on me. That was great. Yeah, it's it's whenever I hear Pearl trying to explain something like when people call her on something like Ethan Klein did, like on that interview. Yeah, that was this was the response. Have you ever had a dream that you had that? Yeah, it's I don't even want to call it filibustering. It's just like you got to fill space filibustering. At least you have like a point and you kind of like put it back on somebody. Anyways, I'm going to show you guys the the actual full video of this, just the just this one section. So, you know, where this is getting cut up, because even Klein actually isn't the first one to do this, this style of reaction. You notice how it's like on the top, it's him and on the bottom, it's the clip. That's what I'm talking about. This is the new hotness right now to look for this. Now, you're going to see a lot of other content creators pick up on this because what they're doing is they're taking like one. They're taking really a hacked clip. It's like it's like what is it subletting the clip? It's it's a it's a subcontracting. The clip is what it is, is you've got a you've got a clip and then you put your shit on top of it and then you turn that into your own reel. God damn, man. Like I said, it's a it's a work of art, really. Of course, he does. So I'm going to show you the rest of this, because I also have I don't I'm this close to actually showing you guys the actual. What I have on Farah, I don't know if I should, because, you know, afterwards, I kind of like almost felt sorry for her afterwards, but I'll I can tell you this and Brian Brian from whatever podcast just asked me this, he said, did Farah hook up with Justin Waller after the show? I can't say that they did and I can't say that they didn't, but I do know that she slid into his DMs and I have proof of that absolute 100 percent confirmed proof. So there's your hypergamy right there. I'm not hypergamous. Hi, Justin. When are you going to be in Miami next? And you know what? She won't refute that because she knows I have it. Yeah, I thought this was funny, but so I'm not based on I'm going to I'm going to rip through this real quick, but I mean, we'll come back to that. I don't really need to jump into that just right off the off the rip here. But yeah, she she was she wanted to get with Wall, by the way, the morning after that show, she was like, I'm going to be in Miami. So that show was on May 7th. And I think May 8th was when she she slid into his DMs, wondering when he was going to be in Miami, if they could like link up or something like that. I don't know if they ever did. I can either confirm or deny those rumors. But I do have the I do have the messages, the screencaps of the messages. So that was pretty funny. All right. I I asked this question on Twitter right before the show started today. And I want to do my my audience proper here because I had some people who are asking me a question about the point of today's shows. I wanted to do a few things here. One of the things is I wanted to get into, I guess I hate to call it myth busting because it's not really myth busting. But I constantly see this criticism of guys who are guys, women as well, who want to claim that they know so much about the red pill that it hasn't covered whatever it is that they're talking about. And I have to kind of give you a little bit of build up here before I kind of launch into this as usual. I got to give you the preamble and give you the preview here. So let me set this up for you. Whenever somebody says, oh, those red pill guys say X. Right. I'm like, I was thinking to myself, you know, that's actually a really good opportunity to give some sort of like nutritional value to this show and really just sort of like settle, settle things out. Right. At least make a make a college try at it. Right. At least make an effort to to clarify a few things. I'm going to I'm going to dig into hypergamy today because I see that getting brutalized. I see people making memes about like, oh, a sort of mating versus hyper. Let me tell you something about a sort of mating, a sort of mating as a a theory of mating strategies was put to bed in 2007, 2008. And the reason I know that is because when I was in the so swap forums during those times, we hash that thing out. We hash the difference between hypergamy versus a sort of mating. I'm going to dig into that a little bit because I think a lot of people think, ha, gotcha. No, no, dude, I we've been talking about this for a long time and that sort of led me to another thread stream of consciousness here that led me to another thread. Thank you for it. Yeah, I was going to say that was actually a pretty good real zero. Sorry, you got me all over the place, Robert. But so when I was thinking about this, I'm like, you know, that kind of leads into the miss miscommunication of the conflation or whatever. There's always these assertions that the red pill hasn't thought of these things, hasn't thought of this. What about marriage? What about relationships? What about what about a sort of meeting like like you're you're you're hitting on things we covered, like in some cases, almost 18, 20 years ago. And the reason why you think that's novel and I got you is because you don't realize that the red pill is like 20 plus years old or at least the inception of it was about 20 years ago. Because people's impression right now of like what is like intersexual dynamics and what are these guys talking about? Well, why do they say what they say? That's why I'm writing the Maxim's book right now, because people think that a lot of these like little snappy jingoism that the red pill uses, you know, like, you know, women break rules for alphas and they make rules for betas. Like that's a that's a jingoism. That's kind of like a saying, like a quotable kind of thing that we have. It's a maxim is what it is. Or if I say, you know, women have boyfriends and girlfriends, if you're not fucking her, you're your her girlfriend. Why does they say that sounds outrageous? Why would Rollo say something like that? Well, I can sit here and explain it to you in great detail and your eyes are going to glaze over and you're not going to really care. You're not going to give two shits about it. So, oh, Jesus Christ, we already got one. OK, hang on. And that dude, you're out. Wait, wait. If I ban you, you get one of these. Well, I could give you that bitch. Actually, it's this one population. So when when I see these guys who say that, oh, the red pill hasn't covered this, they haven't covered that, dude, you don't know enough about the red pill. You only have no more friends. You don't know enough about the red pill to make that call. You don't know enough about it to actually speak knowledgeably on those on such things. Right. But then I also have to balance that out. Of a mountain coffee, I have to balance that out. With being comprehensive and being concise and nobody's got time, you know, ain't nobody ain't nobody got ain't nobody got time for it, but you got time to read anymore. They certainly don't read unless I'm doing something on substack. I've dedicated I have a dedicated like following on my substack. And if you want to follow me on substack for all my writing right now, the link is actually the third one down in the description right now. But that's where that's where I do a lot of my sort of hashing things out for the shows, as well as my books and everything. I'm really getting, of course, I have so much downtime right now because of Ned that I'm back into writing once more. But the the great greater misconception is this is in so in, you know, ambiguously talking about those red pill guys, they make presumptions. And this is not me looking at this is not me looking for like credit or accolades or anything. That just I want to clarify things here, looking for ambiguous reasons or looking for some way, whether it's for content or it's just for just a sort of a firm, you know, deeply held ego invested beliefs, whatever it is. OK, I mean, I can understand that part, but let's at least clarify it so you know what you're fucking talking about instead of talking out your ass, because most of these people are talking out their ass. And then it doesn't help when you've got like and I don't know who did that, who did this clip here, you know, like, oh, he's in school, he has this career or anything. So it could just be random dude off the street. One hundred percent. I am not hypergamous at all. You are so hyper. You see that jump cut right there. There's a whole other section in between that. And so it's like I said, it's artfully done to sort of break up the conversation to make it look like, oh, she owned him. And the only reason I even knew about this, by the way, was because Lana, who I miss, who I stupidly went on her show to talk, you know, talk to her about this kind of stuff. Lana laughing with Lana, go look it up if you want. She was she she brought this to my attention at first and she's like, oh, man, Rolo got owned, Mike got owned. They're just looking for any thread, any like moment, any chink in the armor, right? Any any way in. And then so when you see something like this and you don't know the entire exchange that was happening between myself and fair at that time and you don't know what happened afterwards, you come off with this. Oh, look, he got owned. It's Rolo, Tony Brown. Who the fuck am I to you, man? But I when I see this, it's like it drives me fucking nuts because I know the conversation that went on. And then I also know how old this clip is. This clip is from like May, the beginning of May of this year. And so we're going to go back and reheat this. Well, of course we are, because it looks like one of it looks like one of Destiny's Girls got the best of me or got the best of Mike or got the best of Justin. No, it's just very creative. Clipping is what it is. And I'll show you why. Yeah. Did you see that? Is that laughing, laughing a lot of rolling with Rolo? It should have been."}
