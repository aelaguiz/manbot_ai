At first we were worried about are we going to be able to get girls to come on this, and now I have to cancel girls every week, but you guys were awesome, I'm really glad that all of you were able to show up this week. And I gotta say, all of them showed up here in studio before this guy did. Yes, I was doing a little Jonah Hill research because of all the abuse that he was causing people. I had to look that up before I came here. Introduce our guest. First off, she is a model, a fitness coach. You can see her on the pages of Playboy and FHM. It is Jodi Teahart. Jodi, how you doing? Good, thank you for having me here. Good to finally have Jodi here. You live in Las Vegas, right? I do. Beautiful, awesome. She's an actress, she's a writer, she's a podcaster. It is Jen Garcia. How's it going, Jen? Really good, really good. Nice, nice. She's a model, she's a fitness influencer. It is Stephanie. How's it going, Stephanie? I'm good, how are you? Nice, all right, here we go. Let's keep it going. She is a former Playboy model, she's an influencer, and she is part of the Cocktail Servers Hall of Fame. This is Jessie Preston. How's it going, Jessie? Hey. Hey, Jessie. Congratulations for getting your boobs taken out. That's a good job there. I feel so much better, I feel lighter. She's gone completely, completely natural. I look real flat, Jessie. She went super flat. I remember she used to have boobs back in the day. I feel like something's missing now. Something, exactly, yeah. Empty now. She works 1,000 feet down in a mine right now. Working in a coal mine. She can deadlift 370 pounds. It's Ashley. How's it doing, Ashley? Doing good. There she is. Good to have her right there. He is an entrepreneur. He retired in 2006. He is a single-action pistol competitor. That's where you shoot these targets while riding on a horse. And he is a worldwide published photographer. Please welcome Barry Nadel, The Weekend Cowboy himself. How's it going, Barry? Good to have you, man. And then finally, she sells real estate, and she is a sex therapist, because those two things go together. It is Christina Rizanova. How's it going, Christina? Good. How are you? Nice. Beautiful. All right. We're glad to have everybody on here. I'm going to let you go with the opening volley. I said this before on Threads and Twitter. We're going to have a debate. So here's the debate. I believe Jonah Hill did nothing wrong. You guys are all familiar with Jonah Hill and what's going on right now. Hold on, let me finish. I'm going to make a mistake, because this is what we're going to debate. I believe he did nothing wrong. And I believe what Sarah Brady did was not only was she 100% wrong. I'm going to show you how she did further socioeconomic damage to the entire world. I think what she did was horrific. And I'm going to go, because there's details I promise you guys don't even know, especially the breakup text messages that she had. What she did was so fucking insidious. But I'm going to leave it up to where we read it all. The other thing is the number of people who have had an opinion on this who have not read the text messages is shocking to me. And whenever I see the reaction videos from therapists online, they never read the messages. And there's a reason why. Go ahead. And the reason why they are so shocked by it is because they're using therapist language in all of this. Well, they're saying he's using it. Yeah, he is. He's using therapist language. And of course, you know, I think he's trying to resolve this problem sort of like in a logical, sensible way and using this language to do so. And I just did about a 40 minute podcast. I was doing some shorts today and Glenn said, hey, why don't we do something on the Jonah Hill thing? So we start talking about this. And from my initial understanding, I know I have not seen the text or I have not seen what you're going to reveal to us today. But my initial read on this is that they're kind of both in the wrong. So I'm not saying like he's 100 percent right. She's wrong. I think the way he handled it was wrong. Is he in the right for doing, you know, trying to set boundaries? That's the thing is, in our communities, in the sort of the manosphere red pill communities, guys want to jump on automatically and say, look, he's trying to here's a guy who's trying to man up. He's trying to set boundaries and everything. And she's not, you know, she's not acting accordingly. And then, of course, then the opposite side of it is a women's therapist seem to think that this guy is like horribly misogynistic, horribly manipulative, very possessive, like very controlling, maybe even codependent. You know, I mean, throw out as many like, you know, therapist adjectives as you can possibly apply to him. But so there's that side. And you're probably right. They haven't read or they have they're not in full possession of the facts of what was what's been going on. Now, to put this in proper context, remember that a lot of this happened a year ago. This is a long time in the past. OK, and now suddenly these are being leaked because Jonah Hill is with a new woman right now and they just had a baby. So I just want to point this out. She leaked them right after his fiance had a baby. I'm going to say this for the second time, because I'm sure most of you didn't know that these these things were magically leaked right after they had a baby. And I'm sure you guys probably think the breakup was acrimonious. And I'm going to show you that it wasn't. She was actually very happy when they broke up and they had no contact since then. And then all of a sudden he has a baby with someone else. And all of a sudden these things need to be leaked. I am. I'm sorry. I have no excuse for this. But anyway, keep going. So my my initial read on this and I'll you know, I'll just read the super chat. Thanks. Real quick. I'll take care of this one. Toph says Rolo, do you think and thanks for the $20 super chat. Rolo, do you think that Jonah Hill's the whole Jonah Hill situation is an example of the importance of demonstrate? Do not explicate. Absolutely. I saw exactly what I got into in my show earlier this morning. Also, do you believe that he was establishing boundaries or just giving ultimatums? Is there a difference? I think that the way he handled it, I don't think he was trying to establish boundaries. I think what he was doing was he has we talked about this in the green room yesterday. I think he's got fat guy syndrome is what he's got. And I'm not I'm all I'm just being honest here. OK, you got to remember, Jonah Hill has always struggled with his weight in recent months. He's trimmed down a bit, but he still looks like the dude from the Big Lebowski. Let's just be honest, OK? Also, and I don't care if he's a, you know, Oscar nominated actor. I don't care how much money he makes. I know that he rubs elbows with guys like Leonardo DiCaprio. Leonardo DiCaprio. I got it. He's not an A-list celebrity, but he's an A-list celebrity. He's OK. I mean, what has he done? But besides Superbad and like Wolf of Wall Street. Can you name anything that he's done? It's the one with the people. The Netflix movie. The one with the people. Yeah. So, yeah. He did a racial movie. My read on this whole thing is this guy. Now, remember, his his wife or his or his wife, his girlfriend, Sarah Brady, she is a surf instructor. OK, she's in good shape. She deals with guys who look like Matthew McConaughey and Point Break. OK, so if she's out, you know, and that's her business. And I'm not saying she's right or wrong in doing it. That's what she does. That's what she does. However, he's, you know, has a real problem with her being with these guys and showing her ass off on Instagram and everything else that goes along with this. So when. Hey, what do you guys need to turn your phone all the way? Yeah. Somebody needs to put their phone off. Phone to zero volume. We got that right. Keep going. Yeah. So anyways, the the long and the short of it is fine. I I'm I'm my initial read on this is this is that the guy's kind of got this sort of insecurity about his body weight and how he looks. And he's going out with, you know, Sarah, who actually is a surfer. And she looks like she's in pretty swimmers body. And she also does modeling for for Surf magazine. So there's a sort of a glamour aspect of it as well. So she gets endorsements. And so, I mean, she had a career before all this and he knew what he was getting into. Let's just, you know, full disclosure here. But I think that a lot of this was sort of a buildup over the over the time that they were together. And, you know, he's saying, hey, I don't want you to, you know, show your ass off to these guys. If you're with me, you're with me. You're not with them. It's it comes back to what I always say about like how men can be in the closed, closed on his end and open on her end, meaning that she's still advertising herself. And sometimes women have to advertise themselves because that's what they do for a living. So advertising sexuality, being sexy all the time. There's probably not a woman at this table that has. I've seen all your Instagrams. Thank you very much. Did all this right here. So I know that that it's having a guy who is sort of has a problem with that. That conversation is difficult to have, especially when a guy who's clingy, he's kind of a little bit more blue pill and beta about everything. And especially the guy who's struggling with his weight constantly. So if you're being run down by really good looking guys, by, you know, like I said, point point break, guys, you know, that's that's going to that's going to wear down on a guy who hasn't really sort of gone all the way with his his maturity. Yeah. I do care that he is a or a minus list celebrity. And I'll tell you why, because we wouldn't give a fuck about this if he wasn't. We wouldn't be talking about this and she wouldn't be trying to grab clout off this if she wasn't. Also, if she was a he and he was a she and she was trying to proclaim boundaries on him, this would not be an issue. And those therapists saying that these are not boundaries. This is controlling. I guarantee you every one of the therapists that we're going to show you here in a little bit. If we flip the script, they would not say that these are boundaries because women absolutely. And I don't disagree with this, have the right to have preferences as boundaries. The the problem is that men seem to not be allowed to have that right as well. So here's the thing. If we are in a situation and wait, you know what? Let's do this. I'm going to read the message. I put it on that thing that I gave you. I just added it to the very top, the actual text. And we're going to go through some text. So raise your hand if you have not read the text. You guys don't know. That's fine. That's great. I love this. I love this. And you guys, I'll let you read these. I've got the links. These are from these are from Jonah Hill. Ready? And the one it says, let's just go to them. It goes literally just saying hello to leave the combo. I love how your therapist thinks I suck. I literally am one of the best boyfriends on earth. OK, that's what he's saying. And then it goes here. This is, by the way, how do we know about this? She posted this on an IG story and she screenshot one after another. All right. She says plain and simple. This is what Jonah says to her. He goes, if you need surfing with men, if you need surfing with men. By the way, he did not say I can't have you or don't do this or you stupid bitch stop doing this. He did not say that. He said, if you need, trust me, nobody wants you to read these messages. If you need surfing with men, boundary list relationships with friends, with men. Again, I have a girlfriend who was a bartender and she's currently a bikini model. I have no problem with her in a bikini. I understand. She understands that's what the business is and that is her business. OK, to model, to post pictures of yourself in bathing suits. Now, when she surfs, that is not the bathing suit he's talking about. She does not surf in a bikini. That's not what she's doing. She's taking thirst trap photos as if she is single. And again, there's nothing wrong, ladies, if you want to do that. There's nothing wrong with you want to do that if you have an OnlyFans. There's nothing wrong if you want to do that and you have an OnlyFans and you and your husband fuck on OnlyFans. There's nothing wrong with that. The problem is the two of you are in a relationship together and you're both allowed to express boundaries. Was she doing that before? I don't know if she was doing this before specifically, but my point is this. Ladies, have you ever been in a relationship with a guy and he changed? Has that ever happened? Yeah. You've been in a relationship with a change, right? He's a narcissist, but that's your fault that he changed, right? Is that your fault? Is it my fault? Is it your fault he changed?  Oh, wait a second. Jody, is that your fault that he changed? No. Ashley, was it your fault that he changed? You should. You're saying you shouldn't be held accountable for him changing. Is that correct? Correct. Jesse, is it your fault that he changed? OK, so it's not. Before you continue, ladies, did he actually change or was he always like that and it just took time to find out that he was really always like that? No, right, but he may have given you a facade initially to say whatever, the lover, whatever the fuck. I'm not even saying it's true or not true. My point is when ladies say that men changed, they don't feel that they are accountable for the change. But for some reason in this case, we're all saying he knew what he was getting into. We don't know that. We don't know that he wasn't going around gripping other girls. And I have a hard time believing that initially when she's going to date this A-list celebrity, that she's going around flirting with other men. I think after a while, when she understood how far she could push the boundaries, she started to test him. And that's essentially what happened. That is not his fault, which is why I'm sticking with what I said initially. None of this is his fault. Going to the next thing. Posting pictures of yourself in a bathing suit to post sexual pictures. Friendships with women who are in unstable places from your wild recent past beyond getting a lunch or coffee or something respectful. He doesn't have a problem with them being friends with him. It's just in a situation where if you have friends, I don't know if you guys have ever lived in L.A. There's people who do some fucking coke out there. They get crazy as shit. And, like, real talk. Let me tell you something. Fellas, ladies, you can tell me if I'm wrong here. If I have a girlfriend and I don't want her hanging around girls that I know sleep with other dudes for money, does that make me bad? Am I controlling? No. Okay. One more time. Friendships with women who are in unstable places from your wild recent past beyond getting a lunch or coffee with someone respectful. Listen. At no point does he say, you're a hoe. At no point does he say, I hate you. Know what he says. I want you to read this because no one else will read this for you. You don't get to dictate what I do with my friends, though. Right, but then we can break up. I understand what you're saying. Because I'm going to a bar with my girlfriend. But you can go to a bar with your friends. But my point is if your friend is doing something. No, he's dictating to her. You can go to coffee with your hoe friends, but nothing more than that. That's the boundary that's crossed. But what if he didn't want you? What if you didn't want your man hanging out with his ex? Do you remember how you guys have talked so many times about some girls are delusional about what they want and their demands in men? He's allowed 100% to be delusional in what he wants. There you go. But you cannot sit there and dictate to someone a year into a relationship now what they can wear, what they can do. You can't do that. But he's not. And she has the option to leave. This is what's so insidious about this. The first line is, if you need. He's not dictating shit. He's putting it on her. He's saying if you need to put accountability on her. So he washes his hands. If you need to be a hoe, then be a hoe. That's not what. So Jessie, Jessie, if you and I were dating and you had a guy friend who maybe he used to flirt with you. And whenever he comes around, he just has this commonality thing where he just grabs your ass every time he does it. Or he hugs you and it's a little too long and he gets some side boob. And I said, hey, I don't feel comfortable with you doing this. When you're with these guy friends, I would appreciate if they would not grab your ass. He's axed. He's axed. Right. But that's just as. I love how you think. You're making up a scenario. You have no idea that that's actually the situation. Neither do you and that's my point. It was women But he was also talking about guys he said I understand the guy bullet but the other one was about Okay. Hold on. Do you see? This is my point. Do you see how we're all coming up with different reasons why he could be right or wrong? This is their motherfucking relationship and we're posting these things after he had a baby with someone else. Yeah, she's 100 in the wrong. Yeah Oh, yeah girls make sure you're talking into the mic ready. So let's keep let's keep going this he goes So the first part is if you need and then it was xxxxx and it goes I am not the right partner for you Not move your shit out of my place. I am not the right partner for you guys You know what an ultimatum is an ultimatum is a threat usually one that you can't carry out Do you know what happened after this? He broke up with her. This is not an ultimatum He it was an if then statement in programming. That's what this was. This is absolutely stating a boundary This is not threatening and this is certainly not this is not controlling The only thing I would say is he should have done it earlier. Thank you, correct. I agree with that, too Again again while we're saying that we don't know that we're not one that he didn't and two we don't know that you changed She might be choosing the parts It was already Something it may it may have been or may not have been you know about one of my relationships I had when she flipped 180 degrees. It was crazy. It just just happened She might be choosing the parts that are gonna make her point By the way, by the way, yeah, yeah, we don't know this. We don't know if he warned her in different ways Yeah long before that. Yes And then she went off the rails And now he's ready to break up with her But the thing that gets me is the is they're going out with your hoe friends Like if you have to party with the people from your past and if you have to do anything more than a coffee It's disrespectful that aspect of it is like beautiful then let's break up Then let's break up. I want to go out with someone But the thing is we're all we're life liberty and pursuit of happiness. Let's just break up then let's just break up What if we're not even doing anything wrong with our hoe friends? Huh? I live in las vegas, too. I live in las vegas, too There's no way I I when you and I are on stage at some nightclub There's girls around there who probably had sex for money and we're not gonna just like fucking shun them Yeah, we're the sober ones. I'm not saying this is right for me My girlfriend can post whatever she wants in bikinis because she's a bikini model. I met her as a bikini model I knew that and if she changed and started letting men touch her I would write her a message similar to this Whether or not She stated or did he change or not because jonah hill's not going to talk about this which is the smartest thing to do Yeah, the point is whether or not he changed or not. They broke up amicably Okay, and there was no acrimony acrimony between the two of them and then he had a baby with someone else And then she posted this that's my point, I just feel like there's not enough information We're not we're not halfway done you have a problem with the timing. Oh ready? So so yeah, I have a problem with the time the timing of this the timing of this I got a greater problem than this and it's more to your point, but okay, here we go. Here we go. Ready? I am I am not I am not the right partners for you if these things bring you to a place of happiness I support it goddamn. What an asshole. Can you believe he said that? If these things bring you to a place of happiness I support it. What a manipulative fuck Can you believe she had to date this multi-millionaire? A-list celebrity who asked her to not flirt with other men. What a piece of shit reading it in a clear mind I think she's reading it and also delivering it back to us and a manipulative five five hundred percent wrong then she's five hundred percent I'm saying i'm saying I think she's interpreting it as him being good. She's even she's even more wrong then. Yeah, because she posted I'm, just saying right here. Let's keep going. That's what i'm saying because one more time. I love this I'm gonna make it all read it in five different ways I'm gonna i'm gonna make it i'm gonna make a t-shirt for this ready if this If these things bring you to a place of happiness, I support it. I'm gonna get a t-shirt that says that okay All right, and they're ready. Here we go. Listen, listen to the threats here and there will be no hard feelings Oh my god, what a fucking asshole look at look at all this He's just digging a hole for himself. You know what you know that you know what the therapist say that's passive That's so passive aggressive She's probably reading it which we don't know still again watch when when we play these later notice how what I just read Never gets read. Do you think that he anticipated? I'm a celebrity this might get out. Let me be as If you if you're telling me First off first off first off i'm gonna say outlandish things to her first off first off First off you say you the conjecture that he would do that. He they went to therapists together In fact, she starts complaining and one of the therapists we're going to show Starts complaining about their therapist saying their therapist is toxic because their therapist advised him to do the shit He's actually doing the therapist even agreed. You didn't know that. Did you this is so one-sided? It's unbelievable Let's keep going the very fact that you're in therapy with your girlfriend, bro, dude, that's last stop before Seriously Stop, it's it's like at that point. This should have been just I love this If these things bring you to a place of happiness, I support it and there will be no hard feelings there are These are my boundaries for a romantic partnership. These are my boundaries. How dare you say these are boundaries You're trying to control her jodi If we're married and I say I would appreciate if your ex-boyfriend didn't like kiss you on the neck, whatever Am I trying to control you? That's not what's being said No, no, no, no, stop stop Here's the thing the point what you're saying is because you have you guys clearly see that you guys clearly see that's disrespectful You're saying yeah, but if I say the same if I use the same language If I use the same language for this it's controlling But if I were to if I were to copy and paste and put when this guy touches you on the butt all of a sudden That's not controlling. That's a boundary. No, I know all of them are boundaries You not fucking other men while we're in a relationship is a boundary It's not controlling and me deciding that I don't want my girlfriend to go hang out with certain groups of people She has every right to break up with me Like it says here life liberty in the pursuit of happiness that it says in the preamble of the constitution i'm, not like not not agreeing with you what i'm saying is your Your examples are very like extreme. No, no I'm, sorry That's my fault My examples are extreme to show so in sometimes in when you do programming you can take a piece of text and then put it In for another piece of text i'm saying let's run the same program But let's switch out the text and keep everything the same and all of a sudden this thing that was controlling becomes a boundary like that But it's not it's the same thing. I agree with your boundary I agree with what you're saying. I agree with all of them about I agree with him setting his boundary But when you start to talk about your example your example sounds so extreme I'm using i'm sorry I'm using hyperbole to show the if then so if we were to take if we were to switch x with y the variable All of a sudden just this change of words makes one goes from one thing from a boundary to control it So it was controlling but now when I say I don't want a man to grab your butt now It's a boundary because that's rational but then what happens when it's not rational What happens when it comes to a point where like she wants to go have sex with other men? And she's made it clear that that's what makes her happy And you should respect that boundary and you telling her to not have sex with other men because I guarantee you these therapists that are You're about to see would absolutely say that shit. No, you should respect her. You should respect her control You're just trying to control her I think like what we would as women would think that he's talking about if we were against him would be more of the example of When you're done surfing and you get off the board and you go and you start giving high fives to dudes I don't like when you do that There's there's photos there's photos of them like she's competing and she's like hugging one of the other competitors. I understand that That's the issue. There is some context We've lost there as well as a woman We think that as a controlling man if he says I don't like when you give high fives to dudes Because they're congratulating you on doing a good job That's like to us. We're like, what's a high five? No audio, hey, we have no the microphone's not working here Let me uh while they fix that let me explain something to you about boundaries because I was talking about I've harped on this for for a very long time Boundaries mean nothing unless there is some sort of consequence. Thank you those. Okay, there's so that but that's controlling though, dude That's controlling. It's not controlling. Why are you controlling people? Here's the thing so I i'm going to use another extreme example. The guys have hit me up all the time They'll say rollo my girlfriend or my wife. Whatever she wants. She comes to me She says hey, I want to go and have a girl's weekend out in vegas So I want to go have a girl's night out. I want to go and and do these things Is that okay with you? Are you okay with that? And really that's really more in a relationship sense. That's a shit test Okay, it's not about the permission. It's not about whether or not you're okay with it or not It's the fact that she wants to go in the first place So what I tell guys is say yeah say yeah, sure have fun. You go go out with your girlfriends That's what you want to do. Sure. Go ahead, honey. I support that right? She comes back all her shits on the sidewalk and all the locks in the door I think that there are I think in the modern day age a lot of women and sometimes men don't understand what a real boundary is because I have to admit for me too Before I started to like understand podcasts and red pill and all that stuff and what a feminist is which i'm not a feminist But you know like all that stuff. I didn't realize I really was pushing my Ex-boyfriend's boundaries and I thought he was being controlling or insecure and I would call him that and I was really thinking to myself Like man, like I really do need to look at what i'm doing because Okay, so a woman's brain is i'll give you an example. I go out somewhere This is a real true life example me and my girlfriend sitting at the bar. She knows a celebrity, right? Wiz Khalifa, so she's like, oh my god, that's like my really good friend We go to his hotel and i'm like a little uncomfortable. I don't like to be a groupie I'm sitting next to him. There's a picture taken. I look like i'm fucking him. I'm not doing a damn thing but immediately It doesn't matter the whole world will think i'm having such a great point. Uh, jody, uh, katrina You guys are out one time. All right, and you just go out to dinner Whatever and you're walking out of katana and you happen to be walking next to drake and someone takes a picture on tmz Who believes you didn't fuck him exactly? No, i'm being serious who believes you didn't Fuck him If you make a post the next day swearing, I didn't even come there with him. I had no idea when he was there 95 percent of people will still assume you had sex the very fact that you put that on there means you did So then there's an argument between you two and you're trying to explain like I just went for my friend I only came for like two hours and I left because I felt uncomfortable. It doesn't matter I'm in my head my female brain i'm like, but I didn't do anything wrong Why are we even fighting about this? It's not that big because you didn't do anything wrong. You're right. You just embarrass them That's the problem exactly which again, I never understood until well See my my my point is this is when when we're talking about boundaries I don't want to be with a woman who I have to explain those boundaries in the first fucking place I want you to know me and be so into me and have such genuine desire for me that you're like, you know what? I don't really want to go to this girl's night out I think it would be a much better idea to stay at home and fuck my husband fuck my boyfriend Whatever because that's i'm i'm really into him. He's the guy for me, man. He's the one who's the one who was baby As soon as a girl chooses that they always think like i'm losing my independence But they don't understand being dependent on a man is not a negative thing It's actually what you're supposed to do because when you're in a relationship, you're slightly dependent on each other Of course, you know, so you're dependent on her to bring something Uh to what she brings to the table you're dependent on him to protect you and give you safety And I think that at this modern day of age being dependent is looked at as this negative Thing like oh my god, actually i'll take it one further because we're gonna talk about adam 22 later If he was fine with her fucking other dudes, I wouldn't care. That's not my point I don't give a shit about any of that The thing is you both we are both in a contract with each other When the contract has statements and stipulations in the contract if we both agree to those contracts, they are boundaries But as soon as you don't like the stipulations, then i'm controlling you No, then you can leave and he gave her the easiest Smoothest pathway to leave in several times says if that's what makes you happy. I support it That's the thing when he says the correct words because he's a man trying to put assert his boundaries He's being manipulative. What if he's just trying to assert his boundaries? Even if his boundaries are unreasonable If his value if this was an islamic man who wanted her to wear her to wear hijab Several christian women would be like get the fuck out of my face I'm, not gonna do that and you have the right to leave 100 he has the right to have his boundaries and nothing that he said in that screenshot was outlandish Was it abuse was it except for if you need to be friends with the hoes and stuff? That's the only part that I was like what the fuck what I do I'm, not i'm not in charge of what my friends do in their personal life Was that hold on real quick was that was that abuse? Have you guys heard abuse? Oh, oh get ready for this one. Get ready for the fucking dynamite. Go ahead You know, michael, there's a lot of guys that are too insecure. Yes to break up with a woman themselves What they want to do is lay it out. So the woman breaks up with him. Yeah, and that's what they're hoping. Yep I just feel like another ford will happen is they'll say that but then Disrespect follows and that's when the narcissism or the or the abuse sure verbal because they don't want to break up I was I was on this show when zirka was here and adam was here and I was explaining the differences between like Adam lines adam lies He was I was explaining the difference in how because this really comes back to how we form relationships right now The race the relationship that jonah hill thought he had with this girl's closed on his end and closed on her end But it's not the most common arrangement is closed on his end Thinking that it's closed on her end, but it's open on her end because we live in the age of social media instagram tinder Only fans you name it. So the Availability the advertising of that availability online right now opens it up so that she can advertise her availability or sexuality to guys Now whether that's their career or not is kind of immaterial to this The guy thinks that she's going to have closed on her end and closed on his end The problem is is it's actually always going to be open on her end because she always is going to be able to well She has the out of saying well you're being manipulative You uh, you're you're turning me into a monster because I can't talk to my friends What what are you saying? Why are you being so judgmental? I didn't go fuck that guy. I just hugged Let's do this real quick. Uh, because you two are married, uh, jesse and jody, uh, you both not to each other. Yeah, but We can imagine we can imagine Maybe not all of lgbt but l for sure l i'm down with l l is good I support l I will do I will wear that l flag day and night I will be out there the by the way, do you know there's a polygyny flag? It is it's pink with blue in the middle and pink. There is a I'm gonna be putting the polygyny flag in my Open man. Yeah, it's it's a man"}
