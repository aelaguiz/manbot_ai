Hi there. How are you? My name is Pat Campbell, radio talk show host from Tulsa, Oklahoma. And of course, I'm joined today by Rolo Tomasi, The Rational Male. This is Red Pill 101. Y'all ready for this? Live from Reno, Nevada, the biggest little city in the world. Or so I've been told. Today, we're going to talk about what is a real man, and this is going to be a memorial show for my fallen hero, Pat Campbell. 20th place here. October 20th was his anniversary. Pat Campbell still lives on, on The Rational Male. Today, and then as now, we're still talking about the same old shit, because nobody ever learns. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, thank y'all. Thank y'all very much. You're too kind. You're too kind. Yes. Well, we got to start off with this, this young man, since he knows something that we can't. I can't shake the red pillars awake so that they can understand one, you're never going to experience the depths of life giving, joyful, transparent, vulnerable intimacy with a spouse when you're just dating. I get where they're coming from. But what is devastatingly sad to me on this is they say it because they've never actually seen a healthy marriage. If you had, you wouldn't be making your argument. So one, you guys don't know what you're missing. And number two, you red pill guys will die alone. Red pill guys, ready to die alone. Y'all ready to die alone? Come on, you apes. You want to live forever. Well, the Morgan Stanley or JP Morgan Chase, one of them two, that put out that report of single women are basically the economic engine for the next, next century. And y'all don't think they're going to keep that going? Of course they're going to keep it going. Y'all don't think they're going to stop single women from being single? No. I mean, they said in the report, they said in the report, they should do everything in their power. Companies should do everything in their power to keep this demographic growing. Yeah. Dang. So the corporations are after us, man. Because I mean, they want to make women worker bees. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. They already spend more money than a family household. Women single women spend more money for household than the entire family. So I mean, yeah, of course they're going to want you to stay and this is this is a part of it. Yeah, yeah. Let's put Thank you very much. Can I be in charge? Late 20s early to mid 30s still doesn't have a woman still doesn't have children on the horizon is a very selfish and self indulgent human being and he is just going to vote for socialists to take care of him from womb to tomb rather than being a grown man who carries his own responsibilities for his family. Usually it's the rich husband who, you know, wife's at home just laundering out of the pool and she's fucking the pool boy. OK, I mean, every porn movie starts that way, right? But it's primarily because the pool boy represents the the peak as far as like Alpha Fox is concerned, as far as the the the husband or the rich guy who has provisioning protection and parental investment. He represents long term security to that woman, whereas the but for lack of a better word, the pool boy, right, the guy who's the hot guy that she is aroused by, she still wants to fuck that guy, although we want to say that, well, the guy who's got all this money, we're going to say, well, you know, relatively speaking, if that guy is is rich and he can provide for long term security, logically, he would be the one to choose. But yet we still see her cheating with the pool boy. So what happens is you've got Alpha Fox and Beta Bucks. And so usually what happens is like, would women love to have both of those together? Yes, of course they would. They would like to have the complete package. You'll hear women say that all the time. But I think this is just me spitballing here. But like it right now, I think in particularly because women have entered into the workforce, because they have educations, because they have basically become the men that they wanted to marry, they don't need men anymore. They want men. Who do they want? They want the rock, the bartender. They want the pool boy because he represents the hot, the hot, fun sex, the short term, you know, sexual genetic benefits guy. They don't need it because they can take care of that shit for themselves. I guess what I'm not understanding. And this is what I and I don't know if it's what it feels like. Let me just define it really just really quickly, because everybody's going to like lose their shit on this. But like whenever we talk about like Alpha, Beta, whatever, if you want to get into socio sexual hierarchies and say Delta, Gamma, whatever. I only you ever use Alpha and Beta because it just distills these things down to placeholder terms. Oh, those guys are back. Fire away. OK, if you have a place and only one place in your heart for one woman or you want to have one woman in your heart, I think you said, why don't you just commit to one? And she used to be faithful to her. I'm just not wired that way. I spent my whole 20s trying to fix myself. So you have self-control. You work out, you do business. You can possess your own, your own power and direct it the way you want to direct it. It's just not how I am. It's not how I am. You think that might be a limited mindset? I think it's none of your business, but I don't want you to think I'm triggered by you. I'm not. I saw somebody say that. I think that's interesting. I think you're annoying, but I'm not triggered. You know what I'm saying? No, you are. You're annoying in like this goody two shoes type way, and that's fine. I'm going to live my life on my terms unapologetically, like truly. So you can ask me this 85 different ways. At the end of the day, I'm going to walk out of here the same man. Harvey, about his soon to be ex-wife, I guess, who was getting after it with the bodyguard and getting after it with the chef. Here you have a woman who is married to a guy who has everything, right? He's got money, he's got status, he's got fame and everything else. And the one thing he doesn't have is he doesn't have that alpha gravitas that like maybe the bodyguard had or the, so you're, it's always going to be, you're going to the pool boy. There's a reason why we have that trope or that archetype of she's a rich, you know, bored housewife and there's the pool boy. And that's how movies start, right? The reason why we have that, the reason why that seems believable is because it's not that that she's looking for a longterm partner in Chad Thundercock or Brock the bartender. It's that I was drunk. He was cute. And one thing led to another. And it's not necessarily because maybe she's bored because she's got with a guy who ostensibly anyways has everything she needs for her longterm security. So you have to remember that in, when we're looking at dual mating strategy, we're looking at alpha and beta books. I'm just saying that as, as a, a, a blanket statement here. Okay. How that shakes out really kind of depends on the context and the society and everything else. But the fact of the matter is, is women have short term sex and they have longterm sex. That's in evolution of desire right there. So so short term sex, what's that? What is that about? Well, alpha, right? The guy, he was hot. It's arousal. It's, it's lust. It's you know, hormones. It's being in the right place at the right time. Not necessarily being so much funny as in like he's available and it was of opportunity basically as well. Every time a man's being nice to you, all he's doing is offering dick. My husband is a man. He's alpha, he's caring and he'll kick your if you mess with his family. I love your love story. We've been married 28 years, but you're allowed to other people. It's about what it does for us. It's hot. I'll call him from set. If I'm gone too long, I'll call girlfriends to make sure that I don't come home to a grumpy man. Nobody wants to go home to a sexually frustrated man. So you let him girls and then you'll come home and jump in. Oh, hell yeah. You don't do that for your husband. Yes, I do. Wow. You want to call him? All of these people talk about relationships is so sad. It's like, oh yeah, like women are out here dating for resources and men are looking for the youngest, freshest, lowest body count woman. And that's like all they have to say about relationships. They're not saying what's healthy and what's not healthy. They're just describing what it is. Women have gone for men with more resources and men have gone for women that are younger and more. It would have been dead. Yeah. But because women couldn't work. So of course they went up to resources because they're going to work. If you think of like people that are in happy, healthy relationships, are you thinking of like God, like she found a guy and it's just so cool because he gives her so many resources and it's so cool that he's like 48 and she's 22. You might not like think of it like that, but it's true. They literally just described Mike Sartain and Kylie. Description. I disagree. I think the most successful relationships require like a higher level engagement. It requires more work. There are more things that go into building a healthy relationship between two people than just resources on one side and youth on the other. Like that relationship isn't going to last for more than like six months. Yeah. Like yours. Find a man who you're going to reach for when the wolves are at the door. All right. Let me explain. And we will get to after. And to the men, we've talked about this a lot, that the incels, right? The involuntary celibates, the professionally outraged over alimony and child support payment crowd. Sorry, I'm not on board with you. I understand equality. I understand people being upset with feminists and how far they've reached, but this men's rights crowd that sometimes just goes too far the other way. You know what? You need to learn to be the person that your woman's going to want when wolves are at the door. Now why is that? Women, you need to have higher expectations from your men, period, which is not something that feminism has taught. Feminism has let men off the hook and men, you need to have higher expectations of yourself after the men's rights people out there. The advocates, when they're talking about custody laws, I understand where they're coming from. I understand where you're coming from. I see you. And if you expect me to change my tune on marriage, right, this is something that speaking to marriage in general, um, Oh, Steven, no one expects you to change your tune on marriage. I want to be really clear, it's been unbelievably painful. And again, there's just necessarily incomplete information out there, um, as it relates to marriage. Um, I get that there are some people out there who become bitter, who become anti-marriage and I see that in the men's rights groups out there. Let me be really clear about something. My opinions haven't changed. I believe that a child needs a mother and a father in their house, ideally to raise them. That's incredibly important. I believe that marriage is the bedrock of society. It's the foundation of American society before state governance, before federal governance, you need self-governance. with a strong nuclear family. I still believe that. And I believe that we need to fight to preserve that in this country. Now, with all that being, I think you're fighting to preserve is not backpedaling too far and said, I may never get married again. What do you do with people like me? God, God forbid. And I know that there are a lot of men out there who love women, who are scared. And I'm so genuinely so sorry, ever dismissive. I hear you. I was wrong. I don't know what experiences that you have been through because you'll probably find other people. You are not alone. And you have someone who will be an advocate as it relates to strong families going forward in this country, specifically as it relates to laws and people who have had to go through this system for years. You do not need to be. We often say, Hey, you know, you shouldn't be shamed publicly. You should not be shamed because something didn't work out in a choice that wasn't yours. So I apologize, really do. And if we ever get another question on life advice from a young man who was successful, who saved up some money and wants to try his hand at love, but he's concerned about being fleeced. You're never going to hear me be dismissive or spout talking points that I think are culturally sort of ingrained in the church that aren't necessarily biblical. So apologies as to some other apology, accepted Captain Crowder. Today we're going to talk about real men, like a real man, real man of genius. It's going to be today's topic. My friends, how are we doing today? Oh, my goodness. Yeah, that's the contrition. Finally, vindication. It's all about healing. It's all about healing and love. I'm sorry. Apology accepted. Captain Crowder. Oh, man. Yeah. You know what? You're right. Say my name. That calls for one of those. Goddamn right. Thank you. Thank you very much. Well, you know, I have to I have to follow my own medicine. Sorry. Not flexing. I can flex on you whenever I want. I have to follow my own protocol. I have to apologize for apologizing for not apologizing. I welcome brother Steven Crowder had had Myron and Fresh on what, two weeks ago, something like that. And I watched the whole damn thing. And I really wish it would have been a little bit more Myron and Fresh and a little less Crowder. I realize he's the host of the show. I get that. I kind of wanted to hear a little bit more from them, because at least I think what's funny is like Crowder kind of, you know, that scene, which which movie was it in when like it was Thor? No, it was a Thor. Yeah. Where Loki is like in prison. And it's a meme now. It's like, you must be real desperate to come to me. Actually, I need I need a sound drop for for Loki, because it's like, Steven, you must be real desperate to come to me, to come to us. I also see I also see Tim Pool's sort of coming around a little bit. I think I hate to say, but I think Tim Pool's kind of hedging his bet. He's hedging his bets because I think he knows that that the the red pill material is still going to be around and it's still going to be viable. They just have to follow up on the culture war narrative. And they have to honestly believe in this will when we get to the month of December and we do our year end show for for rule zero, you'll see that what I'm going to talk about is going to be mostly this culture war narrative that everybody has pivoted and more or less, I would say, by by New Year's, maybe in the first couple of weeks, January, you will see, quote unquote, red pill guys or people so concerned with the red pill in these in cells and these MIG towels and these these MRAs. And let's what what what else is trending? Let's go look. You know, what's what else is a hashtag in cell black pill? Hey, that's one. Let's throw that on there, too. All that that was. Oh meat and potatoes. It was such a such a hot item such a hot commodity. You're going to see you're going to see a lot of those guys who are sort of leaning towards the towards the culture war narrative because that's going to be what's going to sell t-shirts and and and baseball caps and logo to peril right up until about what the first Tuesday of November of 2024 and yeah, we're going to have a literal war narrative and we're going to have a literal culture war narrative and if you thought 2020 was something hold my beer you thought the 2020 election cycle was 2020 is saying hold my bear 2024 sand hold my beer right now. So be ready for that. It is coming. It's I'm not a big guy when it comes to cycles, but I do know that when it comes to recurring events when it comes to recurring things such as like an election or something like that just that our process happens to be a cycle at this once we'll call it election cycle, but it seems like there have to escalate every year. There has to be something that is this global world crisis and they usually start it right around this time October surprise. Remember guess where nobody ever do you remember the October surprise? How many at like my aging myself right now by device by even mentioning October surprise? There's always an October surprise of some sort will be another one soon. I'm pretty sure yeah, so by the way, if you are a marketeer or a profiteer, you can take that to the bank. I'm just I'm actually giving you free financial advice right now put put a logo put culture woke have somebody sent me a shirt. Thank you very much for like I get like people send me like just gifts and shit like that. One of them was a shirt. This is a based that's all it says on their based and then I'll tell you what's funny. I haven't worn it in a while to probably wear it. Maybe I'll wear it to Vegas this week, but I have the based t-shirt and then one of the words that was on the FBI on the FBI watch word list for like incels or for like red pill or those red pill, you know radicals, you know was based. So I'm like, hmm. I wonder if I want to wear this to through TSA. So I have that maybe I'll just wear it just for shits and giggles anyways, but who knows? So anyways today I wanted to get to a couple of things. I'm seeing this today. By the way, is this the show is dedicated to the memory of Pat Campbell who is no longer with us and I really really wish she was I miss there's a there's a few deaths and there's a few people who I really sorely dearly miss and Pat is one of those guys. Pat was a mentor to me. If you are unfamiliar if you've joined my my my if you join my viewership in the last oh, I don't know two or three years. You probably might not even know who Pat is Pat was my mentor. He was the I put him in the intro today. Pat had a unique way of bringing me on and then it was funny because my show and he was bringing me on my show. That's Pat though. When I when I was when I first met Pat, I didn't really meet him face to face. Hey, there we go. Wait, there's no need to go to hell. Thank you. Thank you. Big Mo. I appreciate that Pat will always be with us as long as this show is running Pat Campbell's memory still lives on and his his skills his talents his his gifts. I would say our poor example at me, but nonetheless, he was my mentor and the reason why I still do this show. And by the way, I don't think people really understand this. I do this show at 1 p.m. Pacific 4 p.m. Eastern every Sunday every Sunday. Okay, there's a reason for that because Pat was a dyed-in-the-wool devout Catholic his entire life. He had I believe he left six or seven children behind. I'm not even sure how many kids he had Pat is the Irish Catholic. He's the Irish version of the Catholicism and he he could only ever do the show at 1 p.m. Pacific 4 p.m. Eastern every Sunday because what he would do is he would go off to Mass or whatever he had to do and he would race back to his house and then he would like clear everybody out of his of his one like little den that he had in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and he would close the door and we would do the show and we don't you want you want to know how long I go for now like four hours like there's no way Pat Pat will be like that. I'm out in a way we went for I think the longest show he did might have been two hours, but we would average anywhere between an hour and 90 minutes and that was it and that was that was Pat man Pat was in and out. No nonsense, man. He just we just get it in get it done and we were out go go back and barbecue or whatever the hell you do on a Sunday. When I met Pat, I met him over the phone and Pat came up to me. He I don't know how he even found out about me. Somebody had passed in my book. I know that I think was a son actually his one of his sons was in the military and had read the rational mail and pass it on to his dad and then Pat read it and he was he was hooked from from like the first chapter and Pat hit me up and it was oh, I know what it was. It was in November of 2017. Pat says hey back able back able here. Talk show Tulsa 580 W. Whatever it is. I forget the color. It's changed hands since then by the way, so don't go looking for archives because I don't know where they are, but he had to trust your radio show and it was syndicated more or less. I think I don't know. I don't know how many how many states or how many how many stations he was on but he was on an am talk radio show and he was I think he was probably the most the number one show talk show anyways in Tulsa, Oklahoma at that time and I says you're back able here. Roll Tomasi. Love your work. You're coming on my show. It's going to be it's going to be what is it 9 9 a.m. Central Time or something like that, which would have been about like seven or six. I can't remember which which was anyways. I was getting up pretty damn early and he's like, you know, I'm like bounce kind of early man. I'm gonna have to get up and he's like he's like he would not take no for an answer. It was just implied in the way he was talking right? He was just like you're going to be on my show and here's what we're going to talk about. Love your work. I wanted to I want to ask you why women lie or what is it about? What makes a real man or why is it? Why are met? Why are young men? So pussies pussified today or something? I don't know and it was just like you he has that voice and that kind of like command presence that you just don't say no to Pat and it turns out that a lot of the people that I met as Memorial service two years ago. That's how he met them got them on the show and they were regulars as well. That's how I met dr. Everett Piper from what was he forget he religious college at Liberty Liberty University of something like that. Anyways, he he was a regular and he would come on right before me or right after me and he will always want to say something like about what I had said or what I was going to say and then I became really good friends with dr. Piper and I found out that like later on that Everett had been like a propositioned by by Pat Campbell the same way. It's like, you know, this Pat Campbell ever you're going to be on a show. It's going to be nine. He was just like didn't say can you be on the show? He's not inviting you. He's like you're just going to be on the show and and so I I really hit it off with Pat and Pat told me how to to sort of embrace my announcers voice to actually be somewhat animated to get rid of the likes and the us and the alums and I which I still do today, but I'd say less. So and now I'm going to be really super hyperconscious of this throughout the rest of the show, but he he left a lasting Impression on me and not only did I learn a lot from him just public speaking wise or like presenting myself. Why I attribute a lot of where I'm at today like from being a public presenter, which by the way, I'm going to do in Vegas this week. Not only just speaking live but being able to be comfortable in front of a camera. So I can actually look to the camera and pretend it's like you and doing access Vegas doing real zero going on other people's podcasts, whatever it is. I'm far more comfortable as a result of my training, but my education my mentorship my apprenticeship, I guess with with Pat Campbell and that's something I'll forever be grateful for so big up. So if you have a 40 pour one out for Pat today, just to let you know, this is the second anniversary of his death. He died on October 20th 2021. So there you have it. Anyways, you like my bandana today's military day man. It's military appreciation day. See I got my Vortec. Where is it? My Vortec shirt on you guys see did you guys check out my go check out my Twitter and look at the look at the critter. I gunned down. It's on my Instagram too. I tell you what's funny is that nobody has a sense of humor what at what point did like in Twitter history did like we collectively lose our sense of humor like like, okay, this is a put on like is it a generational thing? Because like I was I do this every year by the way, I'm trying to update and refresh the picture a little bit, but like I go hunting face huggers every every October right around Halloween time. Yeah, so anyways, so you might get a laugh out of that. But I think what's funny is like people say you cannot put anything online and not be taken absolutely 100% literally they'll always be someone who will they be there to ask you to explain the joke or they never seen the movie like that for real. Dude. Is that Peru? My favorite one was this and I really had to repost this the guys guys like that's not a real face hugger. That's a plastic molded one made in China. That's not a real face hugger. I'm like time you got me man. I just couldn't find any real ones to to try to trick you with that. I didn't actually shoot. Come on, man. You see this is why autism. Thank you very much. This is why it's important that if you especially if you have a son, but also if you have a daughter too, but especially I have a son. I think there should be a list of movies that are like a prerequisite for like US citizenship. Like if you're coming for if you want to be a naturalized citizen like Troy Francis if you because I know you want to get I know you want to get I know why to you want to get into the United States right now. Okay. Here's what you have to do. You got to watch The Godfather. You got to watch Jaws. You got to watch Close Encounter Star with the for only the first one from 1977. What else is there? What else would be a top gun? You got to see that I'm trying to think of like Commando Predator. Yes. Thank you. Those are those are given I'm like thinking of things like outside of the norm. I think that there should be at the very least a minimum of 25 movies that you have to watch so you will understand the reference like a few good men, right? You have to you have to understand those things. You have to have watched those movie Casino with Joe Pesci. You have to see that otherwise no entry to the United States stay out immigration if they haven't seen these 25 movies then until they did Dirty Harry good good the bad and the ugly would that be one trying to think like what are Americana movies Exorcist? Yes Die Hard most definitely and if you don't watch Die Hard at Christmastime, you are a very disturbed. Worthless individual office in a gentleman. Titanic. I would only if it I don't know that maybe this is a bad a bad day Big Lebowski for sure. Kelly Sears. Yeah, you know what else I wear Eagles dare. I think that should be there should definitely be on their fast times at Richmond High. I would think so the first alien for sure. Nightmare on Elm Street the first one maybe what is it? Friday the 13th only the first one don't watch anything else Carlitos way. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, I could see that Scarface. Absolutely Rambo the first one. Yeah, American Psycho maybe Great Escape. Yes, the Butch Cassidy and Sundance kid. Yeah, that one for sure American Graffiti. Okay, I'll give that to you. Pulp Fiction. Yeah, it's too quotable. I think yeah, I think that definitely needs to be on there. What else would be American Pie? Okay, stripes. Yes. Ghostbusters. I don't know. Is that too campy? Fight Club? Yeah, Friday. Yes. God, you guys come with some good ones Rathacon and that should be by the way Rathacon should be the only one you there's some other good Star Trek to like if it had Kirk in it. Yes, Indiana Jones for sure. What else? Gosh, everybody it coming up with some good porkies. God damn. Mrs. Doubtfire. Mrs. Doubtfire only if you're Red Pill aware and only if you can watch it as a whore as the horror movie. It was intended to be. Oh, no, you come out and play. No, you're thinking of the Warriors Warriors was good. There's some really good Conan the Barbarian. Yeah, you got to get it out of the realm of fantasy and stuff too because I mean, there's a lot of good ones, but I'm trying to think like some other really like the big chill. Would that be one? Freddy Krueger cool hand Luke. Yeah, the Goonies you I would say Goonies only so that you can appreciate things like Stranger Things later on. I don't think people have a full like I'm Generation X. I am not a fucking boomer. So shut your fucking your your zoomer mouth. I'm going to go all cappy on you about that American History X. Yeah, Iron Eagle. Okay, TV shows too. I'm thinking like some TV shows that should be required why like 18, right? Well, whatever else but anyways, I think there's some like sort of there's certain there's certain movies that I think we should we would probably do very well Gran Torino. By the way, my relationship with with Aaron Clary was ruined by watching. Apocalypse now full metal jacket for sure. There's so many of them. We'd have to it's almost tough to like to to boil it down to 25 because I mean you got to figure out which which one is which which is good the egg MacGyver. The fall guy just because it's got Heather Thomas in it that that should be mash. Yeah, mash was good Independence team. Okay, Miami Vice the sting for sure."}
