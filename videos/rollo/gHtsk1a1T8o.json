Sexton. You guys are going to love this one. We are live from Lake Tahoe, California. Finally, the audio is working. So here we go. I only have one clip. We only need one clip for this show. Only one. And I apologize. It's one from last week. For better. For better. For worse. For worse. For richer. For richer. For poor. For poorer. For richer. For poorer. We hit that snag about 20 times in counseling. Brill made it very clear to Jonathan you cannot be broke. In sickness. In sickness. And in health. And in health. To love. To love. Cherish. Cherish. And to obey. We didn't talk about that one in counseling. We did talk about that in counseling. Yes, we did. So you want me to repeat that again? You want to just keep going? I think we can keep going. All right. All right, I have James Sexton. It's been a long time coming, my friend. That's on my bucket list. I've been a huge fan for a lot of years. And I got to tell you, back in 2013 when Rational Mail came out, I was already working as a divorce lawyer. I read it, and I was like, oh, preach. It's been a crazy couple of weeks. I'm really gratified by how the video blew up on Softwood Underbelly. But this is the first live appearance I've done, first question and answer. There was only one place I was going to do it, only one person I was going to do it with, and that was you. So I'm psyched to be here. Me too, man, because you hit me up, and you said, hey, man, I got in touch with you about two or three years ago. And I felt so bad. I'm like, oh, did I not get the email? Did I not respond to this guy or whatever? And it might have been in the Rule Zero days when I think Rich Cooper was probably my go-to guy when it came to divorce and stuff like that. But yeah. I didn't take it personally. Coincidentally, I was doing the Steve Harvey show a lot at the time. I did 13 episodes. That's ironic now. But I did 13 episodes of Steve's show, and my book had done well. And I was doing a lot of media, and I was like, man, I got to get on with him. This really was where I wanted to be, because your point of view and your perspective was very informative of my book and of my perspective, and very infused in my professional life as well. And I just sent a random email. And I was like, there's no way it's just going to end up in his spam, because I got the word sex in my last name, so I end up in everybody's spam. So I'm really glad it happened, though, man. Last night, I'm sitting there, and I'm watching on my iPad, because I've been a subscriber for a long time to Rational Mail. And all of a sudden, you're on there talking about my video, and you said, man, we got to get this guy on. And I'm yelling at my iPad, going, I'm right here. I'm trying to get on. I know. I know. Well, I'll tell you what's funny is I saw that, and I started getting clips. Maybe they were the TikTok clips from that. And all my Instagram followers say, you got to get this guy on. You got to talk to this guy. You got to check out this video. And it was all of an hour on Soft White Underbelly. And I think for the last couple of shows that I've been doing, I've been using clips that you've been talking about. I think I riffed on it a little bit more than normal on last Sunday. And I'm like, I wonder if I could get this guy. And then you reached out to me. And I was like, oh, man, I wonder if he's read the book. And then, of course, we just- I read all the books. I read all the books. I read all four of the books. Oh, you did? Okay. Oh, yeah. Every one of them. No, and what's funny is you were riffing on it. And I thought, there's a lot of people have commented on it. I got a lot of offers. I'm actually flying out next week to do Lex Fridman's show. And I'm doing some other bigger things, which is very exciting for me. But the truth is, I've been waiting for this. This is what I was waiting for. And so when I saw you- It's amazing. It really was. And when I saw you talking about it, and you spent a good amount of time, and then you were only 20 minutes into the video. So I was like, wow, I got 40 minutes of you talking about 20 minutes of my video. So I'm very happy, man. I'm very- I really wanted to talk about Steve Harvey and his situation right now, but I don't know that it is necessarily for real yet. I have too many people telling me it's been faked, or it's just rumors. And God forbid I should in any way traffic in rumors. I would find it hard to believe, I have to tell you, because I was on Steve's show, 13 episodes, and I worked with him. And I have to tell you, definitely his affection for that woman is through the roof. He's very, very into her. And by all accounts I ever saw, she was very into him. So I found this very surprising when I heard it. And I would not be surprised if it turns out that this is just a hit piece or something like that. Yeah. That's what I was a little- I had to be real- I'm extra cautious these days. But one thing I do know is, are you familiar with Logan Paul situation? Oh, yeah. Well, actually- Well, maybe we can get into that. So Dylan Dannis and I trained together for many years at Marcello Garcia Academy in New York City, where I trained. I'm a brown belt under Marcello for about seven years now. I'm a lifetime brown belt. But Dylan and I trained together for many years, and I knew him for a long time. And he's a character, always has been. He got kicked out of the gym at one point many years ago, and then he was out on his own. But I've been watching this with great interest, as the body count just keeps getting higher on this girl. Ratchet up. You know, it's just, I got to tell you, I'm hoping Logan Paul watches my video on Soft White Underbelly. I'm just hoping I get a call from this guy, because even- you know, listen, man, you got to protect that stolen crypto Zoom money. You want to give her half of that. Yeah, that's funny. So I've been watching with interest the Logan Paul situation, not the least of which because I know that Mike Sartain is pretty familiar with him. And so I've been looking at this and watching the whole thing go down. And I think the number one thing that everybody keeps asking is like, is he going to get a prenup? Is he going to get a prenup? And I think that was one of the topics that you were hitting on Soft White Underbelly, about getting a prenup. I know there's going to be a lot of questions. And by the way, if you guys throw in your super chats, I'll definitely read every single one of them today. But I wanted to first touch on the prenup situation. I think quite- okay, so here's my take on this. I don't know that this is like the way that this is really going down. But are you familiar with what happened with Adam22 and Nina the Poet and all that stuff? I mean, I haven't watched the video, but I saw the preview of it. And I feel like I got the plot pretty good. I knew it had a happy ending for everyone but him. Content purposes only, right? Yeah. So anyways, what I saw happening with Adam22 was really what I call engagement media. And these guys are really kind of coming up with new ways of engaging people on a meta scale right now. So Adam22 goes- I mean, he's already got a very large platform on No Jumper. So he goes out there, makes this announcement, and it sounds like it's legit. It sounds like he's really upset or something. He has Destiny on the show, who's a notorious cuck himself. So he's asking him, hey, well, how do you feel when your wife goes and bangs somebody else? And that kind of- wife goes and bangs somebody else. And then, of course, it escalates and he gets in a fight with- what's his name? I forget. Jason. Jason Love, I think that's his name. And it just escalates. And it's kind of like reality TV, but everybody gets to play a part in it. I kind of see the same elements from what Adam was doing, like business-wise and sort of like wag the dog- tail wags the dog, wag the dog-wise with Logan Paul. Because everyone knows this girl's reputation. Everyone on planet Earth knows. Even Adam Sosnick from Soscast, he has never had sex with Nina. It's funny how they're both named Nina too. But he knows four of his friends, and he said he has the pictures. I talked to him right after that clip of his buddies who have dated Nina Agdal. So she's notoriously high, high body count. So what does that do? It allows people to sort of like talk about body count. I think of all the sub texts, the subplots that go along with that. So they know that people will hit on the body count thing. They'll hit on the, is this really marriage? Is it really love? And it's like, he has this big production of him like proposing to her on a beach somewhere in, I guess, Hawaii or something like that, and making this big production out of this. And then it proceeds to go on an interview to sort of defend her honor kind of thing. And everybody's saying, doesn't he see that she's damaged goods, that she's been around the block a few times. And of course he plays the dutiful beta. Now I'm wondering how much of that is just bullshit. And I'm wondering how much of that is like, maybe he is, but that's the thing. Me asking that question is the grift. That's the scale. Is it real? Is it not? Yeah. And what I'll say is that you can say what you want about Logan Paul. I mean, listen, he's been excellent at what it is that he does, right. Which is creating content that people talk about. And it's like Andy Warhol said, don't look at the comments, whether they're good or bad, just measure it in inches. How much are people talking about you? But I think at the end of the day, the one thing that ties Logan Paul together with the multimillionaires I represent, because look, I represented celebrities and celebrities, they have a slightly different angle. They're not the wealthiest clients. The wealthiest clients I have are the people in finance and in real estate. Those are the people that could, they could buy 10, 20 celebrities networks because they don't have to put on the lifestyle and show the lifestyle that celebrities do. Celebrities have a lot of show money. Whereas people in finance and real estate, they actually kind of, you know, it's like, like, like they say that, you know, wealth whispers, you know, real wealth whispers. So the truth is, I think that I've seen guys who are brilliant, like quant guys at Goldman worth hundreds of millions of dollars in their forties, who fall for women who anyone on the street could say to you, this is not a person to tie in with, there are 7.3 billion people on the planet. And almost any of them would be a better choice than this girl. And these guys just do not see it. And these are brilliant, brilliant men. These are men who are surgeons. These are men who are captains of finance, CEOs of huge companies to make Logan Paul look like a like a flea. And they are hypnotized, they are completely ready to just go no, no, she doesn't want a prenup. And this is true love. And there's nothing that I need to worry about. And these are people who make pragmatic big business decisions that affect hundreds of thousands of people that change the S&P 500 when they make a decision. And that's a decision they're making is going no, no, I don't want to upset her. And you know, we don't need a prenup. So like the fact that Logan Paul, who's a kid, basically, you know, I'm not trying to say he's not a grown man. I don't know him. I've never met him. But he's young, you know, he's a little older than my son. So the truth is, like, you know, I'm not surprised that someone makes an unbelievably bad decision potentially. But listen, he's got every reason to have a prenup. And if he has a prenup, marry, marry, you're all married. You're all you want, man, marry as many people as you want. If you got a prenup, you got a prenup, don't get married 50 times. Well, it's nothing more fun than getting married. I forget the the interview he was on. But I think he was asked if he had a prenup. And he was like, No, I don't like he was like, offended by the by the Yeah, the problem I have with that is I can't tell you how many people who have written their prenup, who I see in the press talking about it, they don't have a prenup. I've got a half a dozen people that of course they do. But here's the thing, no one you don't file your prenup anywhere. Your lawyer has it. The other lawyer has it and the two of you have it and that's it. It doesn't get filed anywhere. So so all these people that say, Oh, I don't have a prenup. I'd never have a prenup. Course they have a prenup. Are you kidding me? They're just not going to put it on Instagram. Like here we are signing the prenup. Like they don't do that because they want to say, Oh, no, we wouldn't. But what it does is it creates in people this mindset that well, he didn't have a prenup and she didn't have a prenup. So why should we have a prenup? It's like they had a prenup. They just don't want to tell you that they had a prenup. Their relationship isn't that good. So don't worry that your relationship isn't as good as their relationship. Yeah, yeah, I thought that was funny. Do you think? Do you think that Jeff Bezos has a prenup for but between him and Lauren Sanchez? I would bet both my nuts for that. There's no way he doesn't listen. He gave away billions with a B. There is no way that man not have a prenup. You know, listen, almost every person I know who has been married and then got divorced and decides to get remarried. And as I said in the other interview, 80, 84% of people are remarried within five years of their divorce. And so it's staggering how many people just do it again. But but so many of them do it with a prenup the next time. You know, I want to talk stats with you too, because I've I catch a lot of heat, and one of the things I quoted you from the Soft White Underbelly interview, by the way, go watch the whole thing, I didn't want to step on their toes because I thought it was a really great show, but you mentioned that the divorce rate right now is at 56%. Yeah, 56% is the latest percentage in terms of the average, right? And so in SKUs, where you hear this differing perspective other than the fact that people lie with statistics all the time, is that the percentages for second marriages, third marriages, fourth marriages, obviously are much, much higher. So what ends up happening is there's a lot of percentages that get broiled into that divorce rate, right? So when someone says, well, what's the marriage failure rate? What you're really saying is, okay, what's the average divorce rate among first, second, third, fourth, fifth, the full, whereas the divorce rate with first marriages is slightly lower than 56%. Now, again, I think this is a stupid statistic to talk about, because that to me is just how many, you know, look at it like how many people does the disease kill? Okay, well, that's how many it kills. But how many does it cripple? How many does it make incredible? Because I don't think anybody looks at marriage like, oh, man, I want to get married. And then it's just going to suck. But like, it's an endurance event where I'm just going to hold on. And then hopefully, I can be miserable and stay miserable, like the marriage satisfaction rate is what people should be looking at, like how many people who are married for extended period of time say, you know what, I'm really glad I'm married. Like if right now, I could press a button and be happily divorced from this person, I know that they'd be okay. And I'd be okay financially, and our kids would be okay. But we just wouldn't be married to each other anymore. How many people will push that button? And if you would push that button, don't be married. Don't get married, because marriage satisfaction is what's important. But think about it. If 56% of marriages end in divorce, and on top of that, 10-20% of people who are married stay married for the kids, because they don't want to give away some other stuff, or go through the process, or they can't afford to get divorced, because getting divorced is so unbelievably expensive. Why would you sign on for that? And beyond it, why would you assume that people will sign on for it? Why would you say, oh, yeah, if you don't do this, you must be afraid of commitment, you must be a sociopath if you don't want to engage in this specific kind of legal status. That's crazy. It's absolutely crazy, and devoid of any rationality. One of these days, maybe when you come out to ... By the way, you're still coming out to Vegas at some point. We're going to work it out. Absolutely. We can do a lot. We can actually do something a little more formal. There's your announcement. But I would love to have Aaron Clary, my friend Aaron. I don't know if you're familiar with Aaron. He's part of Rule Zero. He would be a really good guy. He's an economist, so he's written a really great book called The Menu, and The Menu breaks down in dollars and cents and numbers, just like the price of getting married, the price of getting a divorce, all of the economic aspects of it, because he's a numbers guy. But part of that, and I keep stealing his line all the time, mercilessly, but Aaron said we live in a post marriage society right now. We just don't know it yet. We're still trying to do marriage in the 20th century sort of sense. It's interesting because one of the things you commented on on my video was about what I called the BPL analysis, which is in law school how you learn to analyze negligence and how you learn to define what's called an inherently negligent activity. So there are some activities that are so dangerous that it's what's called negligence per se, which means just engaging in it is negligent, and the way that you determine that is what's called a BPL analysis, and I said in the video that it's an equation, which is the burden of not doing a thing greater than the probability of harm and the severity of harm. So when I was in law school, I was already very interested in this subject. I wanted to be a divorce lawyer, and I wrote an analysis of it using essentially the BPL analysis, which is meant for if your car is designed without a seatbelt, all right, what's the cost? What's the burden of putting in a seatbelt versus the probability of car accidents and the severity of harm caused by car accidents, and that's how seatbelts got in every single car, right? So what I tried to do is I tried to say, all right, what are you giving up if you don't get married? What's the burden of not getting married? So I actually did an analysis where I said, all right, think about it. What are you doing when you get married? Well, you got someone to talk to. So someone to talk to, and when you're first married, you got lots to talk about, but probably after 20, 30 years of marriage, all you want to talk about is like, what do you want to have for dinner? What do you want to watch on Netflix? So what would we have to pay someone to reproduce that? All right, sex. When you first get married, you probably have lots of sex, and it's high-quality sex, but over the years, you might have less and less, and then eventually, you have very limited amounts of sex. So let's see what it would cost to have a sex worker do that for us, and I basically tried to say, okay, versus what does it cost you to potentially get divorced? What is the harm that's caused by getting divorced? And essentially, I argued that because of the probability of divorce, marriage is an inherently negligent activity like owning a lion or having a trampoline next to a toxic waste dump, and the interesting thing is the BPL analysis was created by a Supreme Court justice named Learned Hand. That was his name, Learned Hand, and interestingly enough, he is one of the only Supreme Court justices who never married, so the name of the paper was Would There Be a Ring on a Learned Hand? And I talked about the negligence of marriage, and I got to tell you, this is something that I think if we look at things rationally, pragmatically, like this is what you've urged in your work that I, from day one of reading your work, was always very drawn to, which is this is not against love, this is not against pair bonds, this is not misogyny, this is not misandry, this is not that there is no romance in the world, that sex and love and all those things don't mean anything. Those are some of the best things in the world, but the question is, is do we just let that irrationality and total lack of pragmatism, do we let that control, or do we let our rational minds, because I don't think rational and romance are totally at ends with each other. I think that you can have a romantic relationship, a great sexual relationship, a great partnership with someone, and be pragmatic, and be practical, and still have that wonderful connection. Yeah. Well, you probably read my fourth book, which was Religion. There's a big fat chapter in the middle of it called Marriage, a base debate. Great chapter. And I started off by recounting my interactions and my debates with Dr. Everett Piper on Pat Campbell's show back in the day, and of course, I take the anti-marriage side. By the way, and I have a great marriage. I just celebrated 27 years, and I'm probably one of the 2% or 3% that we're talking about here. Yeah. You won the lottery. You won the lottery. But here's the other thing is, I understand female nature, I understand my own nature as a man, I understand the confluence of them together, so I'm like, I'm better off as a husband because I'm red pill. And I think that really kind of blows people's minds, because they think that I can't be red pill because I'm married, or I can't be married because I'm red pill, vice versa. But the thing that Dr. Everett Piper and I talked about was the difference between a covenant marriage and a contractual marriage, a contractual marriage being in how we do it now, right? You have to go down to the courthouse, sign off on the papers and everything, and the state's involved and everything else goes along with that. Whereas like my friend, Abu American, Muslim, has three or four, I think maybe he's up to four wives now, but it's a covenant marriage, meaning like it's just before the eyes of God and his wife and his wives and his families and stuff like that. There's no contract, no government's not involved in that. And it was interesting to listen to this guy who is all normatively a evangelical pastor who is very pro-marriage, right? And he's arguing for the fact that we need the state involved because women need protections in it and all this other stuff. But I thought it was interesting because then there's those two, it's almost two different wants. It's the want for a, to be married, to have that pair bonding, to have that socially enforced monogamy. But then there's also the fact that we have to bring the state in and then the state turns it into a contract. It's basically- Well, a hundred percent. And your point about covenant marriage, look, one of your criticisms, if you want to call it that, of my interview was saying that, you know, I talk about how marriage is rooted in things like land ownership. And the truth is, look, when you talk about covenant marriage, well, that is of course like that. Who knows what the history of that is? That's probably almost prehistoric. I mean, in terms of people saying we're going to have some spiritual significance or theological significance to our pair bond, I'm sure that, and creation of a family and birth and offspring, I'm sure that there's been before there was a state to grant a legal status of marriage on people, there was marriage as a concept. But that's the problem is we're not talking about, and when you say, and I totally agree, there was a time in the United States, and I'm sure in other countries, where women's role, when women weren't allowed to own land, when women weren't allowed to have bank accounts, you know, there was a time where women certainly did need those kinds of protections that marriage afforded. But just like always in this country, we solved dandruff with decapitation. You know, we said, well, women are not protected, so let's create a system that is so unbelievably one sided in terms of the promises men make in a marriage are legally enforceable after the marriage and after divorce. But the promises that the majority of women make in a marriage, which are, you know, love and respect and affection and sex, none of them are legally enforceable. No one in the state can force that person to do, no one can force that. But all the things you promised, protection, financial security, care for the children, covering the cost of caring for the children, for the medical expenses, all of those things are all enforceable by the full power of the state. That is a contract of adhesion. That's what you call that in law school. It is a unconscionable contract. And it is what's an adhesion contract is a contract where the two people are not in equal bargaining positions. And so when one end of the contract is enforceable, and the other side is not, that's a contract of adhesion. That's not a fair contract. And that's what modern marriage is. So adhesion or cohesion, adhesion, adhesion. I got to look at it. I won't. I like to like, like, because I became really familiar with all these legal term terminologies when I was writing that chapter in religion. And then, of course, I was talking about, and I mentioned this in the last in the last video, the coverture laws that existed back in, like, say, the 1700s, 1800s, really up to the 20. Well, yeah, the 19th, the 20th centuries anyways. And the coverture laws were, you know, women actually could own land. They could own money. They could inherit it. Yes, they could own their father's businesses and things like that. They actually did have a lot more rights than most modern feminists who don't do their homework would understand. But that was because of the coverture laws during that time, which meant that you could have all that. But you once you got married to your husband, your husband was legally responsible for you and legally responsible for the children. So if your if your children became criminals, you had to be the one to be responsible for the key. You were the one that was the father. Right. Same thing for women. And so ergo. And I mean, I made this this comparison here. Maybe you agree with this or not. But the back in the back when the coverture laws were working kind of in men's favor, it was more women had more power and had more had could own land, had more control over their own lives and their own properties and stuff like that outside of marriage than inside of marriage. Whereas today, men have more power outside of marriage than inside of marriage. Because if you were just saying the full state, the full power of the state, like you can't out for the state. I'm sorry. But Blackville, Doomer, McTowers, you got a point. I'll give you a point. OK, but the I made that that sort of like contrast between those two, the coverture laws of like the eighteen hundreds versus, you know, where we are right now in the 21st century. Yeah. And it's an excellent point. But I think fundamentally, you know, look, I understand the desire to marry. I think that as I've said before, marriage is like the lottery. You're probably not going to win. But if you win, what you win is so good that I understand people's desire to buy a ticket and try. But I also think and that's what I mostly talk about in that interview is that I just think people have to be able to talk to each other about what their expectations are of each other, of the nature of that relationship. I mean, if you can't have that practical, pragmatic discussion, I just think you have absolutely no business getting married. I mean, listen, I call it job security, like go ahead, get married as many times as you want to. Like we're here and we'll do your divorce and and love is grand and divorce is a hundred grand. But, you know, I just don't I don't understand why when a simple couple of thousand dollars prenup and a couple of uncomfortable conversations with a person that theoretically you like more than the other 7.3 billion people in the world, why why I should be out of business. This is all I should be doing all day is writing prenuptial agreements and making a very modest income because we make almost there is no lawyer who ever said, man, I got rich from writing prenups. Prenups are like a low profit business item for divorce lawyers. It is not something that we litigation is where we make our money. And so many of these divorces and in litigation, I don't think enough people really realize I've used this before. This is the decline and this just goes up to 2020. This is the decline in marriage rates in the United States from the just from 1990 to 2020. So when you put it in black and white terms like that, you know, then you can also look at, like, say, the fertility slump, which is right here from which, by the way, starts right around 1971, which is right after no fault divorce is instituted in California. And then all these other states are following suit. And then this is the one I actually wanted to show you right here, which is first marriages ended annually per 1000 married couples, date and duration of the marriage. This is where I get I I jump into and by this is only like 2009 data. There's more than this now from from from the more recent census data. And again, marriage satisfaction is really what matters. And you're not going to, by the way, you're not necessarily going to get."}
