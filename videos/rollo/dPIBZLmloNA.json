I'm in a very strange place today. Class is in session. This is a live one. You guys can call in. DreamYard link is at the top. We're going to talk about Zerka. We're going to talk about Adam. We're going to talk about Kat. We'll talk about Jonah Hill. Who else should we talk about, Glenn? Producer Glenn's in the house. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. You can take the overlay off now. There you go. This is all new. All new. All new. Look where I am. Are you going to talk about what happened at AXIS Vegas? Oh my God. Thank you very much. Can you talk about what happened at AXIS Vegas? I sound like I'm talking dumb. You sound like I'm talking dumb. See here's the great part about ... Did you get the echo cancellation? I'm doing it right now. All right. Thank you. Look. I already have people coming in. Already. All right. All right. So today's going to be a little bit different. I can only go for how long? Until three, right? Yeah. Yeah. I got two hours a day. I'm in Las Vegas. I was supposed to be back in Reno, actually Friday, but I changed my plans because I have to do ... I have to moderate a debate tomorrow, or no, tonight, or right after this. Tonight. Right after this. Yeah. Right after this. I can't even believe I'm saying ... I can't believe these words are actually coming out of my mouth, but I have to moderate a debate between John Zyrka and Mike Sartain about whether or not the earth, it is a flat. I have to, in some way, make it sound like some sort of sense or some sort of logic to all of this. Hey, real quick, Rolo, I just want to say to everybody in the chat, if you want to come on cam, you want to ask a question, you need to show your face. Yeah. Yeah. You have to show your face. If you're not showing your face, I will not bring you up. That's one rule. You have to show your face. I feel like ... By the way, this is ... Where are we at? What's the name of this place? It's in downtown Vegas. I don't know if you want to give away the location. Jade Studios. How's that? Yeah. We'll call it Jade Studios today. It's the OnlyFans. It's your first OnlyFans. By the way, this is an OnlyFans. Is this? This is an OnlyFans studio. This is your first- I finally joined OnlyFans and go, look, you can buy feet pictures. Would you like me to sell you my feet pictures? They're like, no. Get out of here. Yep. Yeah. K-Dawg, if you want to come up, you better bring your face on camera or I'm going to boost you. You can put your face on camera and we'll have you come in. I have my ... I've got earbuds in so I can hear you guys. Anyways, I wanted to get into a couple of things today before we even get started with anyone else. We're just going to launch right in. Sorry. I have no videos prepared, although I don't really think I have to because I think probably pretty much everybody in the chat has already seen Access Vegas from Thursday night. We were talking about that pretty much the whole week. Of course, as predicted, everyone thought that we were attacking Zerkaa and everyone thought it was a setup and everybody thought that the whole point of us having John on there was to just run him. Of course, everyone wants to think that it was a big setup. It wasn't a big setup. Trust me. Wait. John wanted to be on. We said, hey, let's do this. That's really basically all it came down to. What's funny to me is everybody wants to turn this into a bloodsport. It's always bread and circuses and that's really what YouTube and really the Manosphere has sort of become in the last 18 months or six months, somewhere around there. It sort of has been building up to this. I'm wondering if it's even possible to have a constructive conversation without people in the chat or people afterwards on social media thinking that, oh, he won and he lost. It's all red versus blue. It's all team sport versus team sport. There's simply no way to have a constructive. Maybe that's just what we have to accept. We have to accept that people are expecting a bloodsport. Yeah. Okay. Hey, Christ is king. You go. You go, king. That's your slogan? All right. You don't mean a goddamn word of it, but you go, man. I thought what was interesting when we were talking about the whole thing that went down with the girl, Cat, or it was Alley Cat on that show. Before we even get started, maybe this will save you guys some time when you're coming in with questions. By the way, we're taking live feeds, so if you want to jump in, you can. If you want to ask a question just on Super Chats, that's fine, too. Just be interesting. Maybe I saved you guys some time here. A lot of people didn't know that the PUA, Adam, was in a thruple. He's in a thruple with, oddly enough, his wife's name was Eve, right? Yeah. Yeah, Eve. Adam and Eve. I think that's a stage name. Yeah, probably. They're in a thruple, but they didn't mention during the course of the show who they were in a thruple with. Well, had you known this, you might not have been owned. So a lot of people thought that me and Mike didn't go hard enough, or we didn't tell Alley to go fuck her feelings, or any of this kind of stuff. Well, there was a reason for that, because Alley Cat is the other partner in that thruple, and that was really what was going down. So let's clear the air here before everybody starts losing their fucking minds, okay? The reason why she said she felt like she was feeling unsafe, or she was in a hostile environment or something like that, people want to say, oh, she's a snowflake. Get her. Get her, Zorka. Get her. Well, it wasn't necessarily Zorka. It was Adam, who was sitting right next to her, who was, I guess, not living up to her standards of protection, whatever it was. He wasn't doing enough to sort of defend her from Zorka. So that's really what that whole thing was about. Oh, how come Myron, or not Myron, people wanted Myron, how come Mike and Rolo didn't, like, boot her off? How come they didn't Frank Castle her? Get her out of there, right? Or they think that we were simping, or they were white-knighting, or whatever else. And I'm going to talk about protection here in just a minute, but I was watching what was happening here, and I think during the course of the show, I was expecting her to say that she was part of the throuple, right? That they were going to reveal that throughout the course of the conversation, but it never came up. And yes, I have seen the video where they're saying, stop touching me, like that, under the table, fooling around. He wasn't trying to get with her. Adam was already with her. The reason why they were doing this is because she was pissed. She was pissed off at Adam. None of this safety stuff. I don't know if maybe Zyrka reminded her of an abusive boyfriend or a father or something like that. Who knows? Because I don't know their personal thing. I don't even know they were in a throuple until later on. But that was the whole part that people just simply don't understand, that they've gone public with this since. There's a video out right now, and you can find it. So whoever is in the back right now, I'm asking you what is your question in the private chat. I'm betting you guys before we bring them on. So answer the private chat, El Cid, what is your question? I put it in the private chat. I need to know what you guys want to talk about before you guys come on. We're not going to have anybody show any body parts or anything. So answer the questions in the private chat before you come on. See, this is why I don't, if people go, how come he doesn't have people on there? He doesn't want anybody to debate him or this. Yeah, because what happens is then these dudes come on and I get a nudity strike because you're like, surprise, sucker. No, don't do that, especially not here. So just clarifying things and clearing the air here. I'm going to get to, I will get to questions here. We probably have a couple of super chat. I have to do this, I have to check, I'm monitoring the chat, I'm monitoring the chat. So the whole thing that went down with Zorka and kitty cat, that whole thing was really a big misunderstanding because Zorka did not know that she was the other person in the throuple. So I thought it was funny because what happens is, and this is predictable, is that there's this army, this legion, this brigade of ortho bros, right? I guess that's what you're calling yourselves now, ortho bros who follow Zorka, they follow Nick, you know who, Sneeko, probably Destiny too, I'm sure probably in that group. And it's like, excuse me, let's see, you should just do like C-I-K, right, crisis, you should do that. That should be your like, your hand signals, right? But the show was actually a very good show. I thought it was entertaining and it was good. Was it Taylor, the feminist, who was right next door to Zorka, sorry, this is what I get for like having like protein shakes before I come on. That whole exchange, I thought that was pretty good. I don't know if you guys saw the last one, but Access Vegas, we're now monetized, thank you very much. We got our mission accomplished, we got the 4,000 watch hours as of last night, or as of Thursday night. So thank you for that. We're going to start streaming direct to Access Vegas, probably going forward, probably by next Thursday, we'll probably just do things on Access Vegas, and then we'll take our respective archives and put them on our channels, because we're trying to grow that channel right now. I would also, I dare say, and Glenn, tell me if I'm wrong about this, I dare say that Access Vegas is now the premier channel for this kind of content in Las Vegas, if not the West Coast. Oh, yeah, this is the mega hub. Yeah, I mean, people are going to say, well, what about whatever podcast? Whatever podcast? You know, I like Brian. And by the way, Mike and I will be on whatever podcast on the 25th of July, so we're going out there. That whole week is going to be a whirlwind for us, because we've got Bikini Contest, we've got the Babes in Toyland, and we've got one more event, and it slips my mind right now, but we're going to be moving around Southern California and then back into Vegas. So we're moving, we're doing a lot of stuff, and get on the train now, if you want to get on the train now. We've got Sharp coming on. We've got Sharp on the 20th, also, you're going to be debating Sergio from Purple Pill on the 20th. Again, it's my better judgment, I'll be debating Sergio and the Purple Pill podcast, whatever a debate. Don't we have Mike Rasheed coming on the 13th? Mike Rasheed coming on July 13th, which is next Thursday. I don't know if it's 100% confirmed, but I think we're like 80% confirmed. But we do have Sharp from No Jumper, who I'll be talking about No Jumper today, too. So if you have questions about that, I'm more than happy to answer those. Our first question is about Kat and Adam. So let me bring them up. Yeah, throw that up. Can you guys hear? Can they hear you? I don't know. Chat, can you hear me? Put one in the chat if you can hear Glenn. If you can't, then I'll repeat it. Throw one in the chat if you guys can hear me. Put one in the chat if you can hear Glenn Lawrence over here. Okay, we got one. We got one. All right, cool. Good enough. We're going to bring up El Cid. Here we go. Okay. Hey, what's up, El Cid? How are you? I'm all good, but this is me calling you from Cape Town, South Africa, just to let you know how popular you are. Thank you. My question is... Yeah, you're welcome. Thanks. My question is, so was Adam bringing his girls a bad idea at the end of the day? Because he did seem like he was rate-billed, but he was trying to keep it down low. So here's my take on the whole Adam22 thing, and thanks for this question. I talked to Domo, who was the girl with the red hair on Access Vegas on the last show, and Domo is in the business. She's a porn star. She's been into porn for probably a good 10 years by now, so she knows Adam. She knows the... What's the guy's name? It's Jason something or other, the porn star actor that was with Lena the Plug. It's Domo's opinion, and I guess mine kind of too, is that this whole thing is really just sort of a buildup. It's almost like a proof of concept, I think, because it straddles the line between reality TV-type stuff, as far as social media goes, and building up this porn movie between Lena and Jason whatever his name is, the black guy who was digging her out in the movie. It comes out on the 13th. It comes out on the day that we have Mike Rashid in for Access Vegas, so we'll be talking about that. And by the way, DJ Academics is doing a watch party for the premiere of this porn movie. So many people are on board with this, and it can't not be calculated at this time. So you have to look at the timeline of what happened. I was in Burbank at No Jumper doing Flocko's show, which still has... I don't know. Where the hell... It hasn't been released yet, which is funny to me, because Adam, 22, goes on with Destiny, and I don't know who else was on that show, but he goes on with Destiny to go and have this conversation about how he felt uncomfortable. terrible about allowing Alina to be with a guy solo because I mean, she's a porn star, but she's only done porn with Adam and other women. This is her first solo with another guy. And so now everybody says he's a cock, blah, blah, blah. And I think it was funny that the first person that he goes to have a show with to talk about this with is destiny. So if that's not a setup, I don't know what is, but that kind of seems sus. When I was there, and Glenn was there with me, we I happen to be there. JOHN MLD was there. So he go was there. And destiny was there in the morning. So all of us happen to be there at the same on the same day. I don't know. So after that, then you have these this kind of timed release, like a day after a day after that is when they do. They do another like clip where he's interviewing his wife and saying, How was it for you? And she's saying, Oh, I'm I was kind of sore. He has such a big dick, blah, blah, blah. And of course, that just builds the hype up that much more. And everybody on Twitter is talking about it. Everybody on Instagram is talking about it. And it's just meant to go but they're like, they're like manufacturing virality for this whole thing. So I mean, admire the hustle. Bravo. I mean, you I see what the you know, sort of the method behind the madness of this. And so the reason why you're even asking me this right now, was he wrong to do that role? Is he jealous? Well, like people asking me like all these really kind of cerebral questions. The very fact that we're having like you, this will be the question you would ask me right now. It means that his marketing is working. Because what happens is now he's talking to her and then what was the other one? Oh, he said, Oh, then Jason, the male actor puts out his own videos saying, Well, Adam was actually the guy who was behind the camera, shooting the black video of Lena, the plug getting turned out by this by Jason. I wish I knew his last name. Hold on. I think I think Elsa's question is about Adam bringing on. Cat. The cat. He's Oh, Adam. Adam. 22. Once. No, no, no, no, no, no. Lion. Damn it. Okay, but it's fine. That's okay. I was gonna talk about that. Anyways, I was gonna talk about that. Rolling like that. If I was like, wait a minute, Adam, I'm talking about I look at like, Oh, okay, there's two Adams was Adam 22. And then there's Adam, the guy who's Adam Lyons. Okay, so you get a so you get a double bonus. Okay, so you double both. So was he wrong to bring a cat? Is that what you're asking me? Was he wrong to bring? Yes. Cat. No, to bring his wife, the cat girl. No, because they they're, they're already in a throuple. They're already a thing, right? My question, and I kind of I kind of like walk my ass into this one was like, I asked cat I because remember the section of that show where I was saying, you know, is it open on your end and open on his end? Or how does your because I asked her about her like non traditional like relationship. And no, I was kind of hoping there would be some sort of redirect from cat over to Adam so that they could sort of explain that they were, they were in a throuple, but that never happened. The conversation never happened. So apparently they were like, not comfortable talking about it. But now everybody is and so they had to issue another video after the fact to, to explain what had actually happened. So it was just a big clusterfuck and a big misunderstanding. But of course, everybody sort of takes the takes it the way that they predictably takes it the way that they think that it ought to have gone right. They thought that Zerkaa was hot or she was hot for Zerkaa. It wasn't that had nothing to do with that. It was a fact that there was a thing already going on between Adam Eve and, and her. Was he wrong in doing that? Or was was that a bad idea? Um, I don't know. Not necessarily. I think if there was a bad idea, it was like not being upfront with it from the beginning. If if they would have said it would say there's a lot of confusion if it would just if they just said, Hey, look, we're all together in this trouble. I think sorry, my question is wrong. I think it was not a bad idea. It just happened that Zerkaa was there. And because Zerkaa was just rambling, rambling and going on and he went on a full momentum. Yeah. Okay. Let me explain. Let me explain. I mean, so people have been asking me all week long. What's your read on Zerkaa? Right? It's probably pretty much the same read I've had of him since like he was on Fresh and Fit. And like I'm from what I've known for the last like, what, two months now. Um, I called I was wrong about something. I said that John Zerkaa was the Andrew Dice Clay of the red pill, right? He wants to soon becoming that right? Which I guess is an accurate, an accurate description, but I got it. I came up with another one. John Zerkaa is the cocaine bear of the red pill right now. I mean, he is just a loose cannon when he gets rolling. And I like him well enough. And I think that when he gets pressed on things, he kind of like filibusters it just amplify the volume a little bit more. He's a really great guy. He's funny. He's funny as hell. He's great to you know, great to hang out with. But I think that there's sort of that. It's almost like professional wrestling. I don't know. There's a concept called kayfabe, right? It's like never let down the character net never give away the kayfabe. So it's kind of like, you don't know if you're dealing with the professional wrestler or you're dealing with the actual guy all the time. And maybe that's part of the appeal is you don't know, is he for real? Is he not for real? Yeah. And I think that's, that's kind of what gets going. I think when we do the, the flat earth debate, you'll definitely see that come out. But I like him a lot. He's got a lot of potential. Oh, yeah. He's got a lot of potential. You know, when he talks about Sigmund Freud. The very question, like, the reason why we're having this conversation, like, is he for real? Is he not? That's the appeal, right? Go ahead. What do you say? No, I was gonna say he's actually not for real, because then he will ramble some random thing about Sigmund Freud. I'm like, shut up. You just read a paragraph. And because a lot of people, yeah, a lot because a lot of people actually don't know the stuff that he talks about. But if you've studied psychology, you said so when he talks about Sigmund Freud, you can see like, this guy's just talking shit. Like as a joke. Yes. Yeah. It's like, okay, so as like, I have a degree, I have a Bachelor of Fine Arts, and I have a degree in behavioral psychology. Okay. And even just with those degrees, it's like, I still have to stay on top for certainly for evolutionary psychology, sociology, anthropology, all the things that are associated with like, what I would call the red pill, right? And even I have a hard time staying up on current things, right? So to ask john circa, to not only have this functional awareness of what the red pill is, plus all of the fundamentals, underlying fundamentals, that's a tall order, like even destiny, who's like, you know, semi intellectual guy, asking him to be like to be everything to everyone is really, again, it's a tall order. So I get it. But I also understand the entertainment appeal. And it was fun. It was actually a lot of fun to have them on there. And even in the after, afterwards, it's not even so much circa, it's the it's the followers. When I look at like Nick Fuentes, or look at sneaker, or I look at destiny, or even and circa right now, it's not even so much the characters that are those personalities, it's the people that follow them. So they might like we know what's going on behind the scenes. And I know what they're like, because we go out and have, you know, have food or dinner or whatever, or we're having, you know, laughs afterwards. But everybody on the chat is taking it like it's like the end of the world. Like it's definitely serious. I can't believe that, that they would the rollo and Mike are snakes. Like, for what man we have on here. We had it's a win win. But yeah, there's a reason. Yeah. That was a whole different story. Yeah, well, you know, I'm just gonna say I did watch Nick Fuentes for a bit. I didn't watch the whole damn thing. I thought the the interview with him was was interesting. But the I've the why they brought him on the panel show afterwards, I was a big train wreck. But the what I would like to know, here's what I would like to see happen. Not a not a debate between myself and Nick or anyone else. And Nick, you know, I want to see him debate Dan Carlin from hardcore history. Because I will tell you right now the shit that was coming out of Nick's mouth, Dan Carlin would correct him in like half a second. And he would have a hold of you would have a whole different opinion of Nick Fuentes. If you got Dan Carlin from hardcore history to tell him dude, you are you are gravely mistaken about 90% of the shit that you're talking about with respect to like, you know, you know, Stalin and the World War Two and just the stuff that was coming out of his mouth. But again, it's basically what I expect, because he's there for effect. He's he's auditioning for the role of Richard Spencer for the upcoming election cycle. So anyways, I'm gonna let you go. We got some other people coming in. So thanks for your question, my friend. Thanks a lot, Bruno. Thank you. You got it anytime. Right now I'm gonna piss. Now I just pissed off half this half the chat. Yeah, Dan Carlin is great. If you don't know if you let's move on to the Is there anybody else? Up? Okay, so you got that? Hey, when you when you put them on, make sure you go to the the other one at the full but like the isolated ones. It's like the second from the right or second. Yeah, second one. Cool. I've never I've never had a producer before. By the way, Glenn Lawrence in the house. Bravo. Thank you for being my producer today. Um, no problem. Yeah, this this whole studio like it's this white couch you ever see Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Remember the little kid that gets sent into TV land? That's what this whole studio reminds me of like, I gotta digitize me and send me like the Oompa Loompas are gonna send me into like, to digital TV land or something. All right. Do you want I'll get get let's do any more super chats. I saw a couple come in. I didn't know. I've only got I've got an hour and a half left. Super chat. So let's do super chats first. All right. Here we go. The first one is from back health. One on one dollar 99 super chat. Rollo, how do you stay in shape? Would you like to know my workout plan or my nutrition plan? nutrition plan is real easy. My nutrition plan. Here's here's the role Tomasi diet, caffeine and stress. That's what I and I eat hate on my cheat days. That's my my nutrition plan. No, I just go to the gym. I work out. I'm as Rollo on TRT. Yes, I made that announcement on in January on access Vegas. He had been watching. I roll could shoulder press 185. Yeah, I was working out. So so Glenn and I have been in the gym. We've done a few Instagram at powerhouse. By the way, big a big ups to powerhouse in Las Vegas with Iris. What's your last name? What's Iris's last name? Ryan. Iris Ryan. For sure. Oh, yeah. And he he day. They both Oh, yeah, our house big a big ups to those guys. Good. Shout out to them. Hi, it isn't it? Hi. That is a key day. He's a Japanese. Okay. Anyway, a great that that's a real gym. And it's really close to where we live, too. So no, the reason why I'm a little bit more jack these days is what one is I started doing TRT, but that's you don't just get TRT and magically muscle sprout out of your body. I also when I moved red one studios to to Reno Nevada, that the new studio I am within like walking distance to my gym now. So I got no excuse. So what I do is I get up in the morning, I run Ned and, and we go, then I'm done. I go right to the gym, I can walk over there. I work out and I have I'm much more regular at the gym, I guess. So that's probably why I second question is comes from the smoking Patriot 499. Did you see Tim pulls episode with john doll, Lauren Chen, and destiny on masculinity? Yeah, it seems like they didn't want to invite anyone from the red pill. Of course not. Because because they don't want that conversation. I mean, how many of this is what the 10th time 100th time I've said this, I'm never going to go on to pull just trust me, that's not that I'm never going to get never going to get the call. Joe Rogan's another one I people kept asking me like after after I did no jumper with Flacco, then people would say, Oh, man, you're going on Joe Rogan neck. I'm like, I'm still waiting for that Joe Rogan call. I don't think that's ever going to happen. Quite honestly, Joe calls you, you don't call Joe Rogan. So when people go, how can we haven't set something up? Well, because he calls you. But yeah, I did see that I saw the episode once again. But also what was the title of that episode? Wasn't it like the culture war? Yeah. The culture war, somebody needs to like put a registered trademark little, you know, our little circle are on that thing. Because that's going to be very marketable in the next 18 months. That is the new pivot. When I was on rule zero, on December 31, for the end of the year show for last year's end of the year show, I said this, I said by August, and it's next month, you won't recognize the man of spirit. Hell, you don't recognize it now. So when I see this, once again, a blue haired, cuck certified bisexual, cuckold, male, as he has male parts, is the leading authority on the red pill, the leading authority. He's the one he's the go to guy, I guess what he was on with Lex Friedman. He's been on with Chris Williamson. He's been on with God knows whoever else. The reason there's a reason they have him on because they get the pushback that they want. They get the negative. You know, well, you know, technically, thanks to Zerka. Zerka says, you know, destiny's gay. He's homosexual. Yeah, he is. I mean, technically speaking, he's either you suck dick or you don't suck dick. All right, moving on. But here's so yes, I did see that. Pay attention to the culture war narrative because that's going to be the topic du jour for probably the next certainly six to eight months. You want to know why Myron and Fresh are having on Nick Fuentes, Scott Ritter and political pundits because they see that they they're making the move. They see where the money is. They know that's going on. They'll still have the girls for sure. I'm moving on. Next question. Sterling wheel said $22 says I can't watch access Vegas those shows, but I appreciate all the work you do. I am one of the men you have saved from permanence. Permanent what? Permanence. Permanence. I'm trying to read that. Yeah. I think it means like, from Yeah, self deletion. Yes, thank you. I appreciate you."}
