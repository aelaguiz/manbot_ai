Yes, it absolutely could be. We live in an age right now where Adam 22 goes off and wants to like whore out his wife to, you know, she's going to go do the movie anyways, but it's a long con and it's engagement media and the way that a big meta scale con like that goes, how that proceeds is usually you've got an event and that event has to be promoted and hyped up and everything has to sort of, you know, build up to that one climactic, sorry, pun intended, that climactic moment, right? You could say the same thing about Logan Paul. I've made the case with Logan Paul and his fiance and the fight that went on with Dylan. So, yeah, I thought that was interesting. Thank you very much for throwing that one out, reminding me of that. I thought it was interesting when you have Adam 22 essentially saying, I'm going to allow my wife to go and fuck a guy in a porn movie, even though they basically have a show where they interview women and then have sex with them right then and there. You know, that's a podcast for you, I guess at No Jumper or wherever they do it. And so what happens is other people start talking about it. It's long con, C-O-N, not con. But we're going to have this thing. We're going to build up this hype. It's almost like Wag the Dog kind of thing. If you ever saw that movie way back in the day, it's the people who are involved in the events are the ones who are creating the hype and creating the controversy about that event. And really, that's kind of, I think, a meta-scale engagement media. And I was on Lana's show. I was on like Laughing with Lana. And one of the things that she brought up, and I agree with her on this, is that if you're looking at engagement media right now, what I'm doing with you guys right now, I'm looking at the I got another. If I ever look this way, it's because I got another monitor here so I can monitor the chat. But it's it's engagement media. And I learned this doing Dr. Phil's show. Dr. Phil's show, the reason why it's canceled is because no one cares about it. You cannot engage in it. You can't feel like you can't put in a super chat. By the way, I'll be answering super chats today, too. Thank you very much. I think I'm going to go ten dollars and up. I'll make it easy on you guys. Twenty dollars gets you a Ned shout out, but ten dollars and up is what I'll go for. Anyways, that said, being able to talk to you guys, being able to have you guys sort of throw it like, say, for instance, like this, I can throw this up on the screen. That's engagement media. OK. Engagement media, it means that you're breaking down that sort of fourth wall from between the talking head, which is me right now and you guys. So you guys get to decide where you want to if you guys want to chime in. For for example, people monetizing their lives publicly and then saying they talk about the private matters is one of the worst grifts ever. Oh, yeah. You mean like Hunter Avalon? So, yes, the the idea is this, is that really the commercial television is a dinosaur. It's dying right now because it's too controlled. There's no way that anyone can have sort of any kind of say in the narrative, in the discussion, in the course of discussion. Whereas right now, you guys in the chat right now can alter the course of this show if you really wanted to with the give me a high enough super chat. I will definitely read it and maybe we can start talking about that. But that's that's the idea. And I think that's one of the appeals of, say, like live stream media right now. It's engagement media, but it's not the only engagement media. OK. Only fans is also an engagement media, because if you have enough sense and you have enough paypigs and you have enough, you know, tips and whatever, I don't have only fans. I haven't started my my foot fetish, you know, my foot porn only fans yet. All of everybody's encouraging me to do it. No, I'm not going to do that. I'm not serious. But that's a form of engagement media. The people who are watching the girls are engaging with them and they at least get the sense that if they paid enough money or if they paid enough attention or that guy who was just I think it was Myron and Fresh were talking about this guy who paid like a shit ton of money for some celebrity only fans. Girl, I can't remember. I don't keep up. I'm Aaron Clary in that in that in that instance. I don't keep up with that stuff. But the fact of the matter is, is the only reason that that makes the news is because that's engagement media. That's isolated to just one channel like my channel, Tim Pool's channel, Myron and Fresh, whatever podcast, Access Vegas. That's all those are all isolated and separate. The thing is that the genius in, say, something like in, say, something like Adam 22's rigging of his wife's first porn movie was it was a springboard into the to the reality TV show kind of thing that they're doing right now where you got like God, no, it's like The Bachelorette. But instead of getting the rose and getting the date at the end, it's like, who gets to bang my wife? Which, by the way, Bravo. I mean, I got it. You got to respect the hustle in that. I don't think it's the greatest thing in the world. I'm not endorsing this, but I got to admire the pitch that you want to know who is a consummate marketeer. Adam 22. Bravo, my friend. But it's a it's it's a meta engagement media. What they would. So what do I mean by that? It means that it's not just his channel that is tossing this stuff out there. It's everybody else is talking about. Everyone was talking. Hell, I talked about it on the Green Room with Domo when that was going down. Porn star, team Domo, team Domo. But I mean, we talked about it on AXS Fascia. We still talk about it now and then. But everyone wanted to get in on it. Even Andrew Tate talked about it on Tucker Carlson. And you can't pay for that kind of exposure. So once you start once you get the ball rolling, other people's engagement media takes over. It does all the heavy lifting for you. So that was then, of course, what the Jesus Christ, they really come on now. As much as I love you for calling Pearl a hack, you do not get to impersonate me. I will personally ban you. But the the the whole the stick, like the meta grift, meta grift, I want to call it a grift, but the meta engagement media you have, you have people coming out of the woodwork on the TradCon side. You had you had a lot of people like even on Daily Wire talking about, oh, I can't believe that anyone would allow their wife to get fucked on on camera and then have a problem with it. Right. Of course, who's the first interview that Adam 22 has with like when he suddenly starts to having a problem with with another man banging his wife? Well, he just happened to have destiny in on the in on that particular day. So the world's like most notorious cuckold happens to be in studio. I know because I was there, too. I was in that same fucking day. So and, you know, who else was there? Sneaker was there, as well as John MLD was was there on the set. All of us on the same day. It was it was eerily coincidental just to put a, you know, not to say put it too lightly. So that didn't seem to me as if it was something that wasn't planned. And so then there was the buildup and then there was like the controversy. He was like going back and forth with Jason. Love was the guy that banged his wife. And really what it comes down to is everyone started talking about it and everybody started using their engagement and me to me a couple. I started talking about it, too. I will I admit and they start talking about it. And the event happened. Everybody hell, even DJ academics had a watch party for that for the movie. Right. I mean, that's where it got up to. And really, I'm kind of concerned. I hate I hate to even have to think about this. But like I said, I'm giving you the preamble to the destiny situation right now that I have to worry about that or have to be concerned about that, because destiny is a guy who will go to great lengths to try to find some way to manufacture. If he can't find dirt on you, he will manufacture dirt on you. And anybody who's worked with him or anybody who knows him is sort of behind the scenes will tell you exactly the same thing, because usually they're in collusion with those guys. He has I'll give him this. He has an army of Sparks. His is his Reddit. And by the way, yes, I under I get your alerts for the four destinies with DCC, DGG, something like that. I get the alerts for your Reddit. Thanks. Thanks, guys. You can stop sending them now. But when I when I see stuff like that and I see what just sort of this it's you know, people want to say, oh, the red pill is a cult of personality or it's a micro cult or something like that. I'm not even close to the level of dedication, the Spurge like autistic level of dedication that Destiny's followers have. And I think they're really kind of struggling with this and twisting in the wind with trying to sort of I don't know, maybe it's cognitive dissonance or something, but they're really trying to struggle with the fact that he's not he's not what he said he was, at least in this in this sense. Right. And I'm watching these guys just sort of have this internal conversation with themselves. I'm almost more fascinated by his followers than I am with Destiny. Like at least I can predict what Destiny's going to talk about. Right. But his followers are the ones that I really have to. I really have to wring my hands over, but I really I really have to keep an eye on because it's like, what are these guys going to do is what at what point do people go? You know what? Maybe this is maybe he's really full of shit. I'm going to talk about the situation if you don't know about that. Oh, yeah. Don't don't worry. Don't worry. Jack Murphy's name will be brought up in this podcast today. So I'm going to get into Destiny. I'm also going to get into what happened with Hunter Avalon just briefly. I really wanted to go into a little bit more depth than that, but it would require me showing the video of the the self deletion by shotgun. And I am not going to put that on YouTube because I know I will get banned for something like that. That's definitely a violence violation. And I'm not going to put that up. I can't even show fight that I got. I got a was an 18. I got an 18 and up strike for putting up the Zerka fight with HHS Tiki Taki. Not only did I get the violence, I had to be 18 and up, but not only did I get that, but I also got copyright hits from every from the guys who owned that video. It was almost immediate when I put that you would think that they would want some sort of like publicity, engagement media. But nope. So when when Zerka goes head to head with HHS Tiki Taki, you only get to see it one place. I mean, you know what, guys, here's a better idea. Next time you pull some bullshit like some staged ass bullshit like that, put it on like pay per view. Really? You'll make more money that way. You won't have to you won't have to run down all the copyright strikes that you're going to have to. So but anyways, the the thing with Hunter Avalon just briefly, because I see Tories in the in the chat right now, Hunter Avalon, if you don't know who Hunter Avalon is, he's another one of these Twitch kids who just started coming up this year. I really didn't even know he was until like some I think it was twenty twenty two. He was on with Jedediah Bila and he started coming after me on Jedediah Bila show. Who am I to this motherfucker? Right. And so I looked him up and checked him out and I go, oh, OK, it's another Twitch kid. It's another sneaker. It's another what's his name? Jack Donahue or something like that. Is that what his name is? That guy. It's like these guys who either get banned off of Twitch or they see all their friends on Twitch coming over to YouTube, the YouTube space, and then they want to try to pull some shit as well. So when I when I see this kind of stuff, I kind of roll my eyes a little bit. But with with Hunter Avalon, there was a time he wanted to debate me and I was like, what's the debate, man? Simply didn't get it. Got divorced. Black dude ended up cheating on or cheating with his wife on on Hunter. And that boy, that really blew shit up back then. And apparently between the divorce and a couple of days ago, Hunter had Hunter picked up a new girlfriend. And apparently from the video that I can see, I'm still sussing this out again. I kind of maybe I'm being a bit premature with this. But from what I could see is there was a an ex lover, an ex boyfriend that was involved, like the new girlfriend had an old boyfriend who just simply couldn't live without her. And I mean, that literally couldn't live without her. And apparently shot through with a shotgun shot through the door. Was it through the door or something? Anyways, all I saw was like she got clipped on her on her like right or right shin. And there was a lot of there was a lot of blood involved. That's another reason I'm not putting it on my on my show. But but then the guy self deleted with the shotgun right after that. And so that's kind of a kind of a big deal. Clear. I mean, there's a lot of there's a lot of red pill lessons. You want some you want some let's see some nutritional value in this. I mean, that's simply red meat, literally red meat for for a show. But the guy I mean, it's another shining example of why you need to kill the beta or the beta kills you before it kills you. Right. And so you've got Hunter Avalon, who is a walking example of like so many different red pill lessons, and yet is completely oblivious to and is completely anti red pill. And I mean, I'm wondering if he hasn't changed his his his opinion these days. Oh, it's big on the chat. He is in the chat. Here you go. Tell these bitches to go to hell. I already use that one. So so that's the Hunter Avalon. That's the breakdown of that. I want to also talk about the new DHS slash Homeland Security Department of Homeland Security. Apparently, I'm a very bad man. I am a I'm a dangerous man. I'm a say my name. Yes, they won't see my name because I'm on the DHS like no fly list now or whatever it is. That's sort of, you know, as funny as I thought I was going to do today's show about that. I was just going to exclusively have it just be nothing but the the the connection between the DHS and all these NGOs that are trying to paint the manosphere and the incel sphere or the red pill sphere or whatever the fuck we're calling it right now as being as dangerous as organizations like ISIS. And there's a lot of skullduggery. There's a word for you going on behind the scenes with all of this. And I was brought this was brought to my attention, as I said."}
