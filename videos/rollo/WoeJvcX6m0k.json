Hold on. Thank you. Arguments an intellectual process. Contradiction is just the automatic game-saying Of anything the other person says. Welcome everybody here today. I don't think I've ever had this many people on a panel show for my show. We've got round two coming up. Welcome to Interrational Mail Live from Reno, Nevada. New York City. Las Vegas, Nevada. I don't know where Andrew's from. And Toronto, Canada? Ontario? Wherever Ryan is from. One of those French, gay, Canadian places. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. French, gay, Canadian places. We're going to save the West today. You guys ready to save the West? Oh yeah! Before we get started, we have to have one. Only one video today. Just the one. It's too good not to. For better. For better. For worse. For worse. For richer. For richer. For poor. For poor. We hit that snag about 20 times in counseling. Real clear to Jonathan, you cannot be broke. In sickness. In sickness. And in health. And in health. To love. To love. Cherish. Cherish. And to obey. We didn't talk about that one in counseling. We did talk about that in counseling. Yes we did. So you want me to repeat that again or you want to just keep going? I think we can keep going. Alright. There you go. Oh man, look who I got today. You can unmute yourselves. Please feel free. Sorry James, I know I use that on your show. The reason I like to use that as an intro for shows like this is because it's meant to be comedy, I get it, but it's also kind of endemic of what really marriage has become these days. It's sort of a one-sided, almost like a Steve Harvey kind of yuck it up type situation at this point. And I think I made this point when we were talking, James, was the fact that that's funny at all is simply because we have such a gynocentric perspective when it comes to marriage today. And that's kind of what I wanted to jump off with today. I've got Ryan Stone who is in Ontario or Toronto or Wichita. Toronto. Yeah. We don't do syllables up here. You don't do it? Toronto. Toronto? Yes. I got Michael Captain. My Captain, my Captain. Michael Sartain is in the house. He's in Las Vegas. The proprietor of Men of Action, which by the way, if you want to join, use my link. I got James Sexton who is hot off of his interview with Lex Friedman. I want to ask you a little bit about that and see how that went for you. Glenn Lawrence, he was with us on Rule Zero yesterday. I've got him today. And I've also got Andrew Wilson, my new best friend, Andrew Wilson here today. And I know Andrew is simulcasting today. So I just wanted a big shout out to your audience because I usually, whenever you're on with like Destiny or you're on with some other show, I'm always watching yours instead of the other one that's going on. It's much more interesting because all of your little asides where you like mute the, where you mute the, the, the mic, and then you kind of like talk about stuff. And by the way, you still owe me 10 bucks for a toxic masculinity. That's what that was. You owe you 10 bucks. It's true. That's what that was. Andrew, I didn't understand what you were doing. We're sitting there talking to Destiny and then he would just mute himself and start talking. I was like, is his wife in there? Is he yelling at somebody? Like what was going on? I didn't know that's what you're doing. That's genius. Genius. That was funny. I was making fun of you guys. Yeah. I'm sure. I'm sure. Yeah. But it was entertaining as hell. I was, I will say, but it was good. All right, guys, I wanted to get into this today because I felt like we didn't get enough of it last yesterday and Mike, you weren't with us, but we were doing rule zero yesterday and I was, I wanted to launch in here because I was in locking horns recently with guys like Michael Knowles, Matt Walsh, who by the way is invited to, I sent him the, the StreamYard link to this show. So if you, if he or his handlers allow it, he might even actually show up. Can you imagine? Please, please, Matt. I'm begging you. We will be talking to legal right now. He's not allowed to do this shit. Are you kidding me? I'm sure. Three lawyers and his handler has got to make sure that he's got to make sure Ben Shapiro's cool with it. Like he can't just come on here. If Matt comes play the promo. Oh yeah. Yeah. That's all I got to say. Most definitely. I, you know, it's like, I'll tell you of all those guys, Matt's the, Matt's probably the one I would want to talk to the most. No, Michael Knowles just seems sort of like he just hits it and quits it kind of thing. He just like, whatever. If it's a slow news cycle, he'll go, yeah. And those Red Hill guys suck. And then he knows he's going to get like, I'm going to go. Okay. Or else it's who was, Oh, Jeremy boring. Was actually that Jeremy boring. The other, the other half of Ben Shapiro on a daily wire. I didn't even think he was a thing. I didn't even know he was he was actually a personality. I thought he was just more of like a silent partner and all that. But I guess he's I guess he's actually somebody as far as like a personality or whatever, but I'm seeing a lot of this come from the sort of trad con side of the, of the spectrum now. And the reason why I wanted to get into this now is because I wanted to sort of be able to sort of have had this conversation before we're having it like full scale in the 2024 election cycle, because I will tell you right now that a lot of the stuff that we're going to get into today, you will hear repeated endlessly by a traditional conservative. Well, I guess. Was it a Steven Crowder called it big con. So I'm pretty sure big con, these are going to be the themes for big con going forward into the 2024 election cycle, how that plays out. I don't know. But as I was saying before, when we were doing the end of the year show last year for rule zero, I mentioned this, I said, you know, you're not going to be able to recognize the manosphere of the red pill by August. And if anything, I think I was probably premature with that. I was a little late on that because it seemed like by about June or July, everybody wanted to abandon the red pill and especially the people who had made it their bread and butter for the last year, 18 months. And so now, now it's cool to hate on the red pill, which of course follows suit because it's exactly what happened in 2016. And it's exactly the same thing that happened in 2020. So it's nothing that I'm not prepared for, but I want to sort of get out ahead of this and I want to have a good, a good discussion here, because I think that this is going to be, I don't even think it's so much a clash of ideologies as it is a clash of, you know, fact versus fact versus fact. And that's why I wanted to have, I want to kind of start off with James here. I wanted to get into the first versus some of the stats here. One of them was the, the rate of divorce. And we talked about this yesterday. And so if you can just fill us in on some of this stuff, because I, the reason why I'm asking this first is I was again talking or sort of locking horns with Matt Walsh here and he didn't want to to, I guess it was, maybe it was Pearl who said something like this. I can't remember, but he was basically responding to somebody who said that the failure rate of marriage was 75% and I don't think that that's accurate. So yeah. So for us, so I think numbers are important and I think you know, I enjoyed yesterday's conversation on, on a real zero a lot and I especially enjoyed talking to Andrew to the point where I actually tweeted after the show yesterday saying how much I enjoy a debate with someone who knows what the hell they're talking about. And it's obvious that he does know what he's talking about and that he's done some research. So I figured in anticipation of today though, like all good lawyers that I would do a little research and I would get the most current numbers I could possibly give. So I think it might be nice to start off with some statistics and then we can kind of put them wherever we want to put them. But all of these are easy to find online, CDC, whatever your opinions are, the CDC in terms of the compilation of statistics from the Bureau of Vital Statistics. This is from August of 2023 and I want to just throw some concepts and some numbers out at you. Cause look, you know we're always being told it's a Ben Shapiro favorite thing to say, you know, facts don't care about your feelings. Well, you know, the feelings don't care, you know, feelings don't care about facts either. You know, so the truth is I understand there's a lot of feelings involved in marriage things. Everybody's caught up on the idea of like, you know, I think people like these straw men, you know, we were talking Rolo about, about how this pops up around every election cycle. You know, of course these kinds of straw men arguments come up around every election cycle. You know, why do politicians on the state level love talking about how they're hard on drunk drivers? Cause is there a big pro DWI group out there somewhere like mothers for drunk driving? You know, everyone's, you know, why do we have such oppressive and unbelievably vicious anti-domestic violence legislation out there on the books that's catching tons and tons of men in the net? Again, you know, I can tell you intimate partner abuse, domestic violence, those are real things, but that's not why we have so many laws in the books that are anti-domestic violence. It's cause there's no pro domestic violence lobby out there. So it's very safe for any politician, whichever side of the aisle they're on getting up and saying, I am against domestic violence. Well, Lottie fucking dies. There are a lot of people out there going, I'm pro domestic violence. It's a ridiculous argument. So it's the same thing. Now, what is this year's flavor? This year's flavor is I am for happy marriages. Well, who the fuck is against happy marriages? Is there a group of people out there saying I'm against happy marriages? Cause if you want to try to put that on the red pill, like that, that shoe just isn't going to fit. It's not like anyone in this community is saying, Oh yeah, we think marriages suck and marriage as a technology is awful. And even if you're happily married, you should get unhappy and get divorced. That's a ridiculous argument. It's a straw man. So I think we should really be looking at facts. So let me throw a couple of statistics out here, a couple of facts, and then we can all figure out what to do with those. Because, you know, I love people who say they love America, but hate Americans. And I love people who say that, you know, they care about, you know, marriage satisfaction or the divorce rate, but all they want to do is just create barriers to getting out of unhappy marriages. They don't want to talk about the underlying causes for divorce. So let's talk about statistically what those causes are. And then anybody, particularly trad com people that are saying, Hey, we're really trying to support marriages. We want to end divorce. Cool. Instead of creating bigger barriers to divorce and making my job more lucrative as a divorce lawyer, maybe you can do some of these things that will shore up helping people's marriages. So let's look at some statistics. So in terms of divorce rates, yeah. Divorce rates. People say 73% are in the seventies. Yes. Third marriages. If you're married three times, third time is not a charm. 73% divorce rate for third marriages, 67% divorce rate for second marriages, 52% divorce rate for first marriages. Now this is the statistics as of 2021, because it takes the year for them to compile the statistics. So in 2023, you get the numbers that reflected the year of 2021, not 2022. So when you average it out, that's where you get this number of 56% marriages and in divorce is that they're averaging out, but they're not giving the same weight to all three of those things, but it's 52% for first marriages, 67% for second marriages, 73% for third marriages, 40% of new marriages include a partner who is remarrying. So the majority of marriages, 60% are first marriages for both partners, but as many as 20% of unions are one person who's been married before. So again, remember some of these statistics are a little tricky when you look at the divorce rate, because you're talking about people who've been married multiple times.  Only 6% of divorced couples remarry each other. So I guess once you've seen the movie, you don't want to see it again. But interestingly enough, 72% of reuniting couples who remarry each other after divorcing each other, stay married, which is really weird. Okay. This is a really interesting statistic. I'm going to be really interested to hear everybody's perspective on this. Having friends who are divorced dramatically increases your risk of divorce. Okay. Yeah. So couples who have friends who divorce have a 75% increase in their own marriage risk. Okay. And even couples with two degrees of separation. Well, because of this, there's a lot of sociologists that say that divorce is a social contagion of sorts. So I thought that was very, very interesting. And just a couple other stats I want to throw out there. Couples who live together before marriage are more likely to divorce. Okay. And that's something that Christian conservatives and other religious individuals who say many trad cons who are of a religious perspective, even if someone's not religious, they might say,  look,  the biblical covenants that say people shouldn't be married or living together before they're married or having premarital sex. There's actually some statistical evidence to support the fact that parties who are a total of 57% of couples who did not cohabitate prior to marriage had a union that lasted 20 or more years compared to 46% who lived together before tying the knots. That's a 10% difference. That's significant. This is something I saw yesterday after the conversation with Andrew that I thought was really, really interesting because it's something where Andrew and I were in agreement. And that is over 70% of couples report not understanding the realities or stages of marriage. Okay. So this is people who are divorcing. 72% of them reported, and it's self-reporting obviously. Okay. That one or both of them didn't fully understand the commitment involved in marriage before they got married. And that goes to Andrew's point yesterday that I very much agreed with about how there maybe should be better barriers to entry into the covenant of marriage. Maybe this is something that you shouldn't be able to do for 20 bucks with Elvis marrying you. Nevada, by the way, highest divorce rate in the United States. Now, here's something that I don't think you're going to hear out of all of these politicians while they continue to have their hands in your pockets. Divorce rates are much higher among couples below the poverty line. Living below the poverty level, we all know, causes tremendous stress on people. 46% of adults ages 18 to 55 who live below the poverty level have divorced. So that's a fairly significant number compared to 12%. So that's a pretty huge number. And then also income. The divorce rate decreases as income increases to a point. So couples, as their income increases, the divorce rate tends to decrease. Once you have an income of around $200,000 as a combined household income, you stay at about 30%. Once it hits $600,000 of income, it drops to 25%. But once it exceeds that, it goes back up to 30%. So the idea is you should be rich, but not really rich. Like you should have a good amount of money and definitely don't be poor. Because being poor would be bad. Again, so these are some questions about what are these things we can solve for if we're really that concerned about saving marriage. The median first age of first marriages is increasing. In 2022, the median age of marriage was 32 for men, 30 for women. So let's just tie that in with the biological. Yeah, I know that Rola is going to have a blast tying that in with the biological reality of when people have babies. But to put that in perspective, in 2012, okay, 2012, so we're going because these are 2022 statistics. Let's go back 10 years. The average age for a woman was 26. And for a man, it was 28. So look at that jump in 10 years. Look at how much that's changed. And then the average age of people who divorce 46 for men, 44 for women. Couples who marry, this is a great one, before age 32 have the lowest divorce rates. But it has to be from 20 to 32. If you marry under the age of or at the age of 20, that's a higher divorce rate. Once you pass 32, the divorce rates increase by 5% per year until the age that they marry. So those are just some statistics. I mean, listen, there's a bunch more that I got for you guys in terms of educational levels. Obviously, the divorce rate for people with an education of high school or less is 39% for men, 37 for women. Whereas if you have a college education, 26% for men. So 26 versus 39. And 37 for women versus 30. So the trope that some people have in their minds that an educated woman is going to be more likely to divorce, that's actually not true. The lower the education level for women and for men, the higher the likelihood of divorce. That's a very interesting statistic. And then I wanted to end on, because I know we have some religious people on the panel today. And I have a tremendous respect for religion. But the religion with the lowest divorce population is Hindu. So if we're very much pro-marriage, we need to get people out there. We need to evangelize for the Hindus. Because unfortunately, the highest divorce population is evangelical Protestants. So the evangelical Protestants, they're way far behind the Hindus. Only 5% of Hindus report divorce. So we've got, as compared to 14% of evangelical Protestants getting divorced. But they are still doing better, by the way, than those who are unaffiliated or not religious. That's 11%, 11%. So being religious does increase your chances of remaining married, particularly if you're Hindu. Now, let me throw in a couple of caveats here, first of all. Because I also want to be able to separate this by socioeconomic level, also ethnicity and stuff like that as well. Because some of my stats are showing that, you know, if you are, which one is it? It's, let's see, among race and Hispanic or of Hispanic origins, ever married Asian women and men had the lowest proportion of ever divorced. So there is going to be a cultural, ethnic variation in all of this as well, too. Not just by religion. And the other thing is, what's the... Maybe I just don't have these stats available. But what is the most numerous religion on planet Earth? Is it Hindu or is it... Christianity is the largest religion on Earth. 1.3 billion or something like that? Yeah. So I was just wondering, because when I hear something like, well, it's more Hindus stay married rather than, say, Christians or whatever. I got to also take that with a grain of salt, because you got to remember the displacement or the dispersion. I think he was kind of being funny. Also, they lead the world in domestic abuse by far. He's talking about arranged marriages. Like, there's no way... We're not going to do that. And the majority of this country is Protestant, right? If you choose a religion, we're... Well, I think what I've said before is we're interested... I don't think we should just be interested in the divorce rate. I mean, look, I think divorce statistics are interesting, but I'm more interested in the marriage satisfaction rate. You know, if Andrew... And I'm not picking on you, Andrew. But if Andrew, as a married person, says to me, yes, I've been married and I've stayed married, I don't consider that a victory. But if Andrew says to me, as I believe he would, you know, I'm married and I like being married. And look, I don't like it all the time. There's nothing anyone likes all the time. But I really think my life is better because I'm married. And I really think that my life would be... Again, you're speculating, but you're saying, you know what, I feel like my life is richer for the fact that I made this choice and that I entered into this status with another person. Then you got my interest. Because that's not just about making marriage into an endurance competition that, you know, you win if you manage to stay married, even if you're absolutely miserable. I'm much more interested in what can be done to support people's marriages, to make people happy to be married. Not just that they'll hang in there and survive it. I don't think we should want... We shouldn't aspire to being on life support. I think we should aspire to having vibrant, healthy lives. So that's where I think our focus should probably be. I think really what we're going to get into today is really sort of like, what are the stats? What's the reality of it? And then like sort of what you do about it. So like what's... I know we got into like is and ought and all that good stuff yesterday on rule zero. But I think that perhaps like, you know, understanding like the nature of what we're dealing with here first, that should be what is informing, like what should we do about it? What are the best practices as a result of this? But Andrew, did you have something to say to any of this? I do. So I won't take as much time, I'm sorry. But if you can give me a little bit of time to respond to some of those points. Let me start with something which was said yesterday, which I want to correct as well. I do agree with you that facts don't care about your feelings, I suppose. But I disagree with you that feelings don't care about facts. That seems silly to me. But kind of moving into this, we were talking about no fault divorces yesterday and Rolo had brought up an argument and I guess it's his own correlatory data, which shows that... You got it here. Yeah, there you go. Divorce rate and contraceptive use. But that seems to be nothing more to me than a correlation after looking into it myself. So the first argument which came from the lawyer of the panel was, don't you think that we should see a higher rate of divorce then when a no fault divorce is introduced like in New York? And the answer to that question is yes. I'm showing currently on my screen the stats for this. It is clear that the figure that almost immediately following no fault implementation, the divorce rate begins to undergo large increases in the specifics, which include no fault coefficients, takes on higher divorce rates than the specification which restricts the effects of no fault laws. It shot up through the roof. That's one. The second thing I can kind of use to demonstrate this is that you are tracking this data going back to when contraception first was introduced, which was actually 10 years prior to no fault divorce. However, we have here an abstract from Mexico because Mexico introduced no fault divorce between 2008, 2017. This is what, 40 years past contraception. And you see a 27% increase in their divorce rates almost immediately. We also have a study which comes in. This is Horowitz. And I can give you the highlights of this study as well. But he's looking at four different studies which were analyzed by him. For certain, they found the effects of no fault divorce caused massive increases across the board for divorce rates due to expediency. Another thing that our lawyer friend brings up, he says, wait a second, what about poor people getting divorced? Well, yeah, wouldn't you want to have some kind of financial barrier perhaps? Now, what could I say to back that up? This Horowitz study says, as the theory predicted, no fault laws are empirically found to have a high significant positive effects on divorce rates. Further, not only these laws found to be significant in the short run, but also the long run. It goes on to clarify that if you have a financial barrier in the way of the divorce, you end up seeing far less divorces. And then it gives justifications for why that is. So I actually dispute this data by Rolo, and I would like to get into kind of the no fault. He says marriage satisfaction, but I think that that's only one part of it. So I'd love to respond to that. I think, Andrew, that you're, and while I appreciate the reliance on the numbers in terms of the numbers of divorces that are entered, okay? So when you say the divorce rate, you're not talking about the number of people that file divorce actions. You're talking about the entry of judgment of divorces. That's what finalizes a divorce, okay? So of course, I think literally every state, particularly California in 69 when they passed it, when Reagan passed it, who, by the way, was a conservative. I don't know if you guys recall. But he did it for the same reason most states did it, which is to move through a backlog, okay? There's a tremendous backlog. The divorce process is a protracted process from a paperwork standpoint. Now, again, if you think, and this is not a logic I understand when applied to any number of things. Like there are not a lot of heroin addicts out there going, you know, I want to use heroin. Oh, shit, wait, it's illegal. Ah, I guess I'm not going to do that. The fact that it takes a lot of paperwork to get divorced, more or less paperwork, is not going to be something that's going to cause people to continue to have happy marriage, is it? That's incorrect. Is the goal, hang on, I think you can demonstrate numbers. Can you just do one point at a time? Well, Andrew, I can, but here's the problem. You're still just spitting numbers, right? Well, if you make a point. Devoid of, Andrew, I'm sorry, I thought I was speaking. If you want to. You were, and then I was. Okay, you want to just keep talking? I just want to do one point at a time so we can get through it. Otherwise, we end up with a gishgash. Because you just scattershot at about 15 that are all. I was responding to 15 of your points. Wow, man, you just, is it that hard for you to let someone get a sentence in there? You're just used to shooting fish in a barrel. Is that what you do? Like, because, see, I used to doing this in court. And the way it works in court is there's a court reporter and one person shuts the fuck up. And then when they're done, the other person starts talking. So that's called a debate. See, look, you're doing it again, my friend. You're doing it again. At some point, you have to stop talking, though. Buddy, if you think you're going to stonewall over me, you're just making yourself look foolish. It's steamroll, not stonewall. That would be the opposite of steamroll. Okay, thank, well, you've really proved your point, Andrew. You got me on that one, man. Absolutely. Like, this is what you do. Like, I've watched your game, man. It's not impressive to anybody. Look, there you go again. Look, I want to have a respectful conversation with you because until you prove you're not worthy. Okay, keep going, man. Can we just do one point at a time? Why do you evade? Just let's do one point at a time. We'll have a constructive debate then. The guy who's interrupted me 15 times is saying I'm trying to evade. You're scalloped, dude. I'm trying to keep you on point. I'm trying to keep you on point. That's it. Okay, you let me know when you're finished, man. Okay, let me set a timer. Let's actually physically see how long you talk. I love debate rules. Let's do it. We'll do point and counterpoint. Ready? Go ahead. What time do you want? What time frame do you want to pick? How about one minute? Can you do it in one minute? Can you make a point in one minute? Well, I think you can obfuscate the facts in one minute, which seems to be what you like to do. What you like to do is just throw some numbers out there like you said something and then step back and go, well, you see, 42%. There it is right there. As if it means anything. 40 seconds. It doesn't. Oh, did you start the timer for us already, Andrew? Is this how you have to do it, man? I'm just hoping you'll make a point at some point so that I can actually respond to the point. Why don't we... Okay, so I'll tell you what. You pick the topic because you want us to go one at a time. You pick the topic. You set the preposition and then I'll respond. Okay, we'll do your rule. Whatever rule set you want, my friend, I am ready to roll. Whatever rule set you pick. All right, let's let Glenn do the time. Go for it. Okay, so this is easy. I just want to start with the kind of the claim that you made for no-fault divorce. You said you can't understand in your mind why this would ever cause anybody to have a more productive divorce or a marriage or more satisfaction in their marriage, things like this. However, what I can demonstrate using this Horowitz study when this was focused on, your exact point, what they state emphatically in this study is very clear. Those barrier to entries make and force the couples who are inside the relationship to begin some kind of reconciliation process while the paperwork is slowed down. So actually, there's a huge benefit to it. There you go. Whole point made with time left on the clock. Can you respond to that? Okay, how in the Horowitz study, okay, does one measure marriage satisfaction while waiting for a pending divorce? Because I have to tell you, man, I love when people throw studies out like this and go, well, this study demonstrated that people are much, much happier when they do X, Y, and Z. What in fuck's name are you talking about, man? What was the gauge for happiness? Was it self-report by both parties, one party? Which was it? And you're the one who threw this study out there. So back this thing up."}
