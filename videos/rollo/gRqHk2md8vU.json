I finally got it right. I thought it was last week. Thanks so much. Sorry, I'll explain to you why we gotta do this early today. Yeah. Alright, live. This is live. Alive. We are live, live, live, live, live from my secret bunker deep in the Nevada high desert somewhere about Reno, Nevada. Nevada, not Nevada. Yes, the grand poobah. The dad you never had is in the house. So let's get down to business. Kids out there that do have a good sex life with your husband, will you? Never have to ask him to be present as a dad or a husband. Never have to worry about him saying no to watching the babies. He makes me feel like he wants to be a dad, like he wants to have a family, like he wants to be a husband. Washes all the dishes every single night. He's an incredible cleaner and we split household responsibilities pretty evenly. He will actually leave his boys night out early to come home just to make sure that he can kiss his girls goodnight. He never makes me feel crazy. Actually listens to me and validates my emotions and my insane anxieties. He knows how to put his phone down and look me in the eyes and listen when I need to talk about something. He knows how to communicate when he's upset so he doesn't just let it build and fester. I am 100% confident that there is no place he would rather be than with me and his babies. He encourages me to have hobbies outside of the house. He encourages me in my career, whether it's engineering, makeup, whatever. He's the first one to grab the baby and change a dirty diaper. We'll wake up in the middle of the night with me, no questions asked. Never have to ask him to do anything twice. Knows how to do his own laundry. He is so smart. Makes an effort to get to know my friends and my family. I could bang this man every single day. First boyfriend? Um, like my very first boyfriend? When you had the child? Oh yeah, he's in here. Why did you guys like? Um, I'm gonna be honest with you. Um, I, I, I got love for him. He's a great guy. We had great chemistry, but the love faded away. Um. What do you mean it faded? What do you mean it faded away? I get bored and I get. Okay, so, so here, here we go. I said that I get bored. Here we go. Here we go. So you don't want a nice guy cause he was a good guy, right? He's a great guy. See what I'm saying? He's a very judgmental person that I couldn't stand. He judges everything and that's what I was like. But other than that, he was, he's a great father. He's a great everything, but. He's a great dad. So you just couldn't do it? No, I checked out. Once I checked out, that's it. There's no coming back. Depends on the wisdom of the woman, obviously. But, well, it does because, you know, you can. Narcissists can fool naive women. That's why narcissists propagate, by the way. And we know this because narcissistic psychopaths. Young women are more likely to fall for narcissistic psychopaths. And the reason for that is they can't tell them from competent men. Because narcissistic psychopaths imitate competence. And that's their niche. And so they have a confidence that isn't justified by their ability. But the women check out the confidence as a marker of ability. And the falsely confident can fool them. Especially if they're young and naive. Yeah, because they get so much smarter with age. The counter is pretty much what you said. Well, what do you want somebody to be like your slave? Do you want them to need you? Do you want it to be some sort of form of codependency? No, that's not what it is. It's complementarity. Your weaknesses as a man are made up for the strengths of that woman and vice versa. Your strengths as a man make up for her weaknesses. Red Pillars won't answer this. How the fuck? Yeah, you'd be wrong. Are you going to base so much of your ideologies and advice to men around divorce? And unjust financial destruction of men in divorce. While simultaneously drilling into women's heads. Men don't care about women's careers, education, income. When those are the specific factors that contribute to the financial determinations in divorce. Here's some advice. Here's some real advice. Lay off the DMT. Including alimony, child support, etc. Your spouse's income, career, and education directly impact how much financial destruction men may or may not face in the event of a divorce. But since you guys don't care about your spouse's career, income, or education, I guess you're fine with paying her the maximum amount of alimony and child support, right? Otherwise, you'd probably care. I got a better idea. How about we adjust the divorce laws? Maybe that would be a good place to start. I tell my daughter a lot about this. My daughter runs my companies. My daughter didn't know much about business when she started. And she was pretty sick, too. And she didn't know a lot. And so it was easy for people who thought they knew a lot about business to pull the wool over her eyes. But Michaela has the ability to ask stupid questions. And we've talked about that a lot. It's like, you only have to ask a stupid question once if you're alert. You ask a stupid question. And if you're in a crowd and you ask a stupid question, 80% of the people in the crowd have the same question. They're just too cowardly to ask. But you ask, and then someone actually tells you. You never have to ask that question again. You're no longer stupid. So if you ask enough stupid questions because you're honest, well, then you're not stupid anymore. The wisdom of Jordan Peterson. I'm a big fan of Dr. Marty Hazelton. I've been using her work since the very earliest days. Also a student of Dr. David Buss. And so she's got a book called Hormonal, and it's basically the ovulatory shift. Because what we're talking about here is ovulatory shift. So when we talk about the dual mating strategy, ovulatory shift proposes that when a woman is in her proliferative stage, when she's in the ovulatory stage, she's looking for a guy with more masculine features. She's looking for the guy who's going to slit throats. When the egg has already dropped and she's already past the ovulatory phase, she gets into what's called the luteal phase. In the luteal phase, that's when she's looking for comfort. She gets into what Dr. Marty Hazelton has said is a sort of a nesting. What it translates to is when a woman does get pregnant, she goes through. I want to say it's the first trimester or maybe the second trimester. She goes through what's called the nesting phase, where she wants to get the baby crib and everything else. But if you think of this in a shortened version throughout a 28-day cycle, that nesting period is right around where the luteal phase is. That's when she starts calling up her telephone friends, guys with more female features. She wants her girlfriends to come and hang out with her. She's feeling bad because she fucked the guy in the club when she was in her proliferative phase. She goes through the post-menstrual syndrome where she gets really bitchy. The theory behind that is that the reason she gets bitchy is because she's pushing away all the beta males or all the more feminized, the comfort guys, away so that she can go back into that cycle once again. So that she hopefully can reproduce in the next path, in the next cycle. So how does that relate to the dualistic mating strategy? The proliferative phase is what I would colloquially term as the alpha phase. And then you've got the beta phase, which is right after the egg drops and whether she's pregnant or she's not. Now, people are going to say, well, what about hormonal birth control? We can talk about that later on. But as far as the dual mating strategy is concerned, that's the micro-biological side of alpha fucks and beta bucks. So when we're talking about these things, I know the criticisms of this, but I want to point out also that in Dr. Marty Hazleton's work, the idea where they go and they ask, well, are you attracted to these guys? Is it the guy with the chiseled jawline and everything? And then women are saying yes and no. The thing is, is that women don't seek extra pairs if they're already in what is termed as a satisfying relationship. So that's where you get these incels who just throw caution to the wind and say, oh, I'm doomed. It's hypergamy and it's like a straight jack and she's just going to want to fuck Chad when she's in her proliferative phase. And the juice ain't worth the squeeze. No matter what she's going to cheat. Bullshit, because there's too much. There's too many variables right there, whether she can or she can't. But the most important one is this, is that in those studies, when Dr. Marty Hazleton was going through this, the women who stated that they were in a satisfying relationship, they wanted to fuck more, but they wanted to fuck the guy that they were with. Again, remember, there we go. Now, what's there? Why? Okay, welcome. Hi, guys. Welcome to the show. Welcome to the Father's Day edition. I haven't done a Father's Day edition in a long time. I don't think I did one last year. Was I? Maybe I wasn't. I don't think I did. I used to do. I used to do Father's Day editions of this show with Pat Campbell. And man, I'll tell you, man, those are those got pretty intense back in the day. Aren't you guys sick of destiny? Yeah. Yeah. Kind of am. Kind of am. But, you know, kind of like a veneer of the war team shows up every now and then. No, actually, I'm not sick of destiny. I'm actually kind of sick of some other people right now. But this is not a get sick at anybody show today. Yeah, I was going to. Yeah. By the way, Arturo. Yeah, we got that coming up. That's on tap today, too. I'm going to this is going to be a much more abbreviated show today. And I know I always say that, but it kind of has to be because I was going to just do a pre record and just do a premiere for you guys today. But this is a live show. So don't let anybody tell you it's not. So, yes, you feel free to super chat. Do whatever you want. But I will be immediately after the show. I'll be jumping in my car with my dogs and I'm heading off to Lake Tahoe to actually do a little writing up in the up at the lake and sort of get back to to that and sort of power down for a little bit because I got a lot of stuff. Coming up in the next, geez, the next month, I guess. Robert Kiyosaki will be joining us on the 28th in in Las Vegas, beautiful Las Vegas, Nevada. We have a special show, a special edition of Access Vegas. That's coming up. And I will be doing I'll be doing some Q&A today, too. If you guys want to. That's sort of I think that that is in in the offing today since I am doing the Father's Day show here today. Have you guys seen any other Father's Day takes today? I already seen Rob Henderson, one of Rob Henderson's tweets soon to be Dr. Robert Henderson, Rob Henderson. I think one of his his hot takes today. And I don't know. Again, I really hate that. I have to, like, put this out as like sort of an asterisk or a caveat here. But I have to sort of second guess people's tweets these days. As you know, one of the reasons I put Jordan Peterson talking about how his daughter asks stupid questions and she's running his brands right now and running his show. I don't think enough people really realize that. So when you think you're getting some hot take from Jordan Peterson, you're actually getting it from Michaela. Just she sock puppets him just so you know. But again, it's the it's the idea that that, you know, whenever we come around to Father's Day, that it's an excuse or it's an occasion. It's opportunity to tell guys to do better, do better. What do you got here? To what extent does the sisterhood of realism subsume of the loyalty of women for their male relatives? It depends on that male relative, quite honestly. I would also argue that the the sisterhood is far more endemic today and especially in Western societies than it has ever been before, simply because we have unfettered hypergamy, which we're going to talk about today, too, because everybody wants to. I guess we have to go back to the frickin woodshed. I guess we have to go back and do remedial red pill one on one one more time, because I'll tell you right now, if I was to go and do a very long Twitter thread about what hypergamy is and what it isn't and what dual mating strategy is and what it isn't and what my take on was a mate switching mate shifting hypothesis is, I can go and throw that one out. So I'm blue in the face and it won't make any fucking difference. And I'll tell you why, because people don't care. They don't want to sit here and get a long ass dissertation about how they don't want to see how the sausage is made. They just want the sausage. Right. They don't want to know how you came to the conclusions that you did. They just want to have a nice, spicy hot take. And then they throw it out there and they're done. So the reason why I'm throwing that one that one shot at the end there with with me, that was when I was on Fresh and Fit. And that's when I was there with Sneeko and Destiny together. And so, yeah, they just want sauce. Yeah, you're probably. That was too good. Let's put that up there. That was too good. Yeah, you're right. It's they want Caesar Flickerman. Go look up Caesar Flickerman. If you haven't seen if you haven't seen Hunger Games, you don't know who Caesar Flickerman is. Just just saying. But yeah. So, oh, boy, we got we already got another troll in here already, man. Gosh, you know what? Instead of like like spamming my chat, like just fucking come at me. And if you want to you want to be on the show, you want to come come to Vegas. I'll be happy to talk to you. Oh, OK. Bye bye, bitch. Wait on. There you go. Yeah, she did. Farah did take that. Take the red pill. Sort of. We'll talk about that a little bit later, too. And Tori Torshaw did a show on that last night, which, you know, Torshaw will be dangerous if she could ever do a stream on time, if she would ever show up on time, like she would actually not. She would be dangerous. Yeah, yeah, I'm going to have plenty of new haters in the chats. I'm going to have plenty of new haters for this one today, for sure. Thank you. Does he is it worshiping? Are you sure about that? Are you sure it's worshiping? Is it bowing down? Is that what it is? I'll tell you what's funny is like when people want to talk about like, oh, you got you. You just want the little head thing for the big head. Did I do you think that I haven't already written dozens of essays about that and articles about that? You don't care. You don't care to know nobody cares to know that's why I have to do this kind of shit. You want why does roller do five-hour podcasts? Well, because it takes that long to actually explain some of this shit. So when I'm talking about let's just say notables at this point when I'm talking about guys and who have a spicy hot tick on the red pill right now. I'm the one that has to go clean up their mess. And yes, I did see the the I guess if was it a rage quit. Do you think was rage quit that that Pearl did with h3h3 with Ethan Klein? I don't know if it was a rage quit so much as it like I think it's funny is like it's like it's like a semi rage quit like people want to say like when when MLD walked off Sosnick show. Well, he had a hard out. He had to get out of there. But I bought it still looks bad either way and when Pearl bailed on Ethan Klein still look pretty bad. So I would do that in this. I would do that in a hot second, man. I would absolutely do that in a hot second. If she can range that actually I could probably arrange that I would do that. So I kind of have to to refute some bullshit all that. I feel like I have I'm always on the fucking defense. I'm always on the back foot with these guys, right? Because all it is is just like one spicy hot take after the next and the reason I threw that last that last clip out there is because I don't think a lot of people really realize particular people who are unfamiliar with the situation. They don't realize that I've already had these conversations. We've already had these. I mean how there was like 35,000 people like live views for that show freshman fit. And so I'm still having to deal with the bullshit of like these one liners. I'm still having to deal with the bullshit of trying to explain what hypergamy is or it isn't and I'm just then I get to the point where I'm like, you know what I'm dealing with somebody who's just basically disingenuous. They have no interest in being in debating because like I was I got into a long thread with with a long Twitter thread, I guess and my bad. I probably shouldn't have done this but I got into a very long thread about hypergamy and dual mating strategy versus makeshifting hypotheses and I will tell you right now just for the record. Yeah, here's some fatherly advice for my sons. Don't get into those debates on Twitter. Twitter is not the place to have those debates. Certainly not any place to sort of to do any real deep thinking. I think Twitter is good for advertising Advertainment. It's a new word. I came up with Advertainment advertising and entertainment's Advertainment. That's all Twitter is and now we're going to have like video now. We got Tucker Carlson on on on Twitter. I'm also seeing that they're trying to monetize like responses. You can respond to certain people if you pay if you have a blue check and you can pay it, you know enough money to do so again, who's the real grifter Elon Musk man Bravo and I or whoever his team is right now is doing that, you know coming up with this stuff. I was we were talking about this on on rule zero yesterday and I just say just Elon learn the lesson of periscope for you before you go with before you go with the video side of things, but I was just want to point out that one tactic and I didn't even I you know, I didn't really realize I've it's been done on me before but I never really like confronted it like face on but I was I was having one main thread of discussion like a debate back and forth with with destiny and destiny. I said, well show me one study one research one one data set of the dual mating strategy or what I explained basically on fresh and fit because his his fronting was like, well, I came up with all these studies and he had no answer to it. It's like bullshit bullshit. You know, it's bullshit because I'm throwing it out there right there in that clip. But again, this is a discussion that takes a long time to have and P and you know, ain't nobody got time for that. Nobody wants to nobody nobody wants to sit around and fuck around right? Okay, dude. Okay. Now, let's you know, I'm just going to keep you around just for now just for shits and giggles. But so when I have those conversations and I'm like, okay when I'm doing this I'm trying to sift through probably, you know, dozens of just shit posts on top of everything else like oh, you didn't tell me what a high volume at it's in that fucking same show. You didn't say what a high-value man is toast toast toast toast. You you need to catch up. That was last month's like schlock this month schlock is something different and I wanted to point out that you know, having those conversations on Twitter is like it's like it's just a dead end. It's just a dead end. And when I have so let me just I'm going to see if I can complete this thought here. So he asked me he says, you know, like what would give me one one study? I gave him 15 because if you go to my blog the rational mail.com and you look on the sidebar where I have suggested reading people ask me about like books to read and stuff like that, you know, give me a 10 list. It's already there. It's been there for like over 10 years, but on that list on my blog roll there my links to people who I you know, I admire who I think are worthy of you know, a click one of those is dr. Marty Hazleton who I explained in that video. Dr. Marty Hazel Marty Hazleton is one of the is I would I would argue one of the premier evolutionary psychologist when it comes to intersexual Dynamics. It is I don't say I'm not going to say she single-handedly did this because she has like her own sort of like colleagues and stuff that help her along with this with the research. But so when I have to listen to uneducated idiots say, well, that stuff's been debunked. Okay, what's been debunked because you're talking about a body of work. That's like 25 plus years. And people say well, you know without that then that's the that's the length and the breadth of the of the red pill. No. No, it's not. It's absolutely not when I want to talk about the dualistic mating strategy when I talk about that I'm talking about alpha fucks and beta bucks, but when someone else is talking about that they tend to all you know, if it's like the Jordan Peterson's of Chris Williamson's the the certainly the David bus is they only want to focus on one side of it and usually that's the beta buck side because that's the only side that they can really relate with that's the only side that has some sort of actionable like a plan of action for them because if we only focus on the beta bucks parental investment provisioning and protection if you only focus on that then men have a lot of things to do. They've got a lot of catching up to do you better do better fathers. You're not you're not living up to to what our entitlements are and those entitlements are parental investment protection and provisioning for women. That's what the that's what the exclusively focus on and the to the to the complete disc disc inclusion, whatever, you know exclusion of alpha fucks any time there is an unflattering truth about female nature. They never want to talk about it. If you go and you want to you want to know why Myron and Fred you want to know why fresh and fit is such a popular show because they're willing to talk about that stuff because I'm willing to talk about this stuff because if you want if you're guys if you are an influencer and you want to be a successful podcast purple pill podcast Brian, whatever don't shy away from the alpha fuck side of hypergamy that will make or break your show. You want to know the difference between a trad con show and like a you know, a mainstream like red pill show is that they're not afraid to talk about the alpha fuck side and hold women accountable and holding women accountable is just this sort of catchphrase for pointing out unflattering truths about women's innate evolved nature. They don't want to talk about that and they never will because that doesn't sell but that because that that leaves a bad taste in people's mouths. They don't like that. So if you stay on top of that if you accept and you embrace the dualistic nature of women's mating preferences and there's a difference I'm going to get into that as well because that was another conversation. I had the difference between there's a distinction. Let's just say between a woman's mating preferences and her mating strategies. Okay, how are she going to affect those are through the best effect? How is she going to best affect those preferences with an adaptive mating strategy? That's the difference and we're just putting fucking hairs and it just pisses me off so much is like it's a it's a curb this fucking high. I had the same conversation with Adam and Sitch. They didn't want to call it hypergamy because hypergamy is whatever is in the you know, the dictionary definition. It's whatever we find on Wikipedia, even though dr. Jordan Peterson uses the same expanded definition that I've been using for 22 years now. So either we're going to accept an expanded definition or we're going to have to come up with some new word for it dualistic mating strategy do this and so I'm having this conversation and of course what happens is whenever whenever people are arguing with you or debating with you in bad faith particularly on Twitter what they will do is they will take whatever piece of that Twitter thread and they will go and they'll retweet that one and they'll say oh what an idiot. He doesn't know this blah blah blah taking it completely out of literally taking it out of the context of the main thread putting it into another thread in the hopes that people will back him up because they're not in the other thread and I'm watching this happen like three and four times as I'm like sticking to one side and trying to have this like ongoing conversation. Meanwhile, you have all these bad faith actors who want to start a new thread because they know that that's going to well, it's just driving engagement and all that says to me is you're not about the material. You're not about the debate. You're not you don't want to have a real conversation. You just want fucking engagement. And if that's where it's at them, fuck it. I don't care. I don't owe you a fucking debate. I don't know anybody a fucking debate especially when you're all brand and you're all about the engagement been doing this for 20 some odd years. I care about this shit. I've been doing it for forever. And that's another thing that gets me is like I got a lot of guys will say well, I think it was a every every now and then Alex from date cycle like chime in and say well the red pill is silent on this. It's never said anything about this and I'm like, dude, I you know, send him links to like four or five different articles. I've written over the past like, you know, 12 years on the blog, right? No, no, dude. We've talked about this. This is old news. Welcome. They're not talking about it now because it's already been done. We've done this forever. So when if you are going to because this is this is something that's been really and I realized this as early as like New Year's Eve of last year. I knew this was going to happen because you know, we're in the election cycle and people are pivoting to other topics and they want to go into the culture war stuff, but they got a they got to find some way to make a clean exit. Let's just say from the Manusphere. So they got to have some reason why they're leaving the Manusphere. Like you've got Andrew Tate saying like all those red pill guys blah blah blah who who and I and I love you Tate and I love Andrew and I love Tristan. Don't get me wrong, but they're doing the same thing. Everybody else does those red pill guys. Who who are you talking about? Is it me? Is it Ryan? Is it the guys in rule zero? Is it hell? Is it Myron and fresh? Is it you know, Brian from whatever place he part of that? I don't know. Is he red pill adjacent or is he actually part of the red pill? Like I am not red pill adjacent. I am in the red. I am the father of the red pill, right? I'm by the way that just so by the way, so what's that? Where are we at? We're at 30 minutes and nobody's going to see this anyway. So I'm sure there's going to be people are going to see this title of this video and they're going to look at the thumbnail and then go roll. Oh, it's got a big head and a big ego, dude. It's Father's Day. Take take the fucking joke. It's it's a fucking joke. Yeah, I'm a father and I'm in the red pill. Wow, amazing. So watch how many like people in chat right now people in the comment when you get into the comics when you see the comments later on you're going to see so many people who do like didn't get it like, oh man roll thinks you boy. I would hate to be as arrogant as him. Okay, bro. Okay, dude, let me tell you something if you're going to come in using my fucking my AV you're out the door my friend. Thank you. There you go. All right. So I mean getting back to the point here is there's I essentially linked about 15 different studies that have to do with ovulatory shift, which is the foundation the basis anyways of the dual mating preferences of women. Because now apparently that we have to separate make the distinction between those two. And Harry, you know what? I think I might even just do this just for shits and giggles hang on because apparently people are too stupid to do this on their own and they don't want to they're stupid. They're intellectually lethargic. So allow allow Daddy Rolo Papa Rolo. He's got Uncle Rolo. Whoever you want to however you want to call me. He's going to share his screen with you today children. And we're going to go to my site, which is the rational mail.com. And yes, I haven't it's been a while since I updated. I've been focusing primarily on on sub stack mostly but I do have some stuff. I got up. I'm going to update here. So let's let's scroll down a little bit. Shall we children? Oh, look, here's some advertising. He's selling books. Oh my goodness. Oh categories. Look at all these categories of things that you could just hey, what's what's Rolo have to say about hypergamy? Oh my goodness. There's a whole category dedicated to hypergamy. Maybe we ought to have a look at that. Hmm love Rolo says that women can't love with men. No, well, how about you go and you just click right here? There's so much stuff this it's a it's a cornucopia of"}
