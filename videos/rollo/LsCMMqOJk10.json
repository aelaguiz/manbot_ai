Oi, oi, oi. Oi, oi, oi. Yep, live from Reno, Nevada. My mistake, sorry. That's next week. This is The Rational Bill. You guys ever hear me say there's no such thing as a quality woman? You can get into that today too. I'm gonna debunk Richard Bunker's, get into some hard science today. Oh, and this cute chick, Brett Cooper, will feature on today's show. Brett, my little girl. We've got to do some red-pilling of Brett today. Against my better judgment. All the dogs are in the studio today. Well, the two dogs, anyways. So, you have to bear with me. It's gonna be a dog Sunday. Just like my wife after she divorced me. Next! Hello. Hello there. Looks like you have a PhD in engineering. That's right. And career-focused. I try my best. Technically competent and also easy to work with, making you a huge asset to any engineering firm you work with in the U.S. That's the hope. But you're also pretty f***ing hot. What? Only fans, girl. Excuse me? How dare you? That's a waste of my talent. You'll make $100,000 a month. Yes, daddy! 5K of that is coming from me. Lord knows I hate my wife. Alright, make sure you check in with HR on the way out. Next! Hi, really nice to meet you. Let's see here. Productive worker? Yeah, my parents taught me to work hard. Always honest? Yeah, it's the best policy, man. Never complains and stays out of company politics. Call me Grateful McGee. What do you want? Low-paying job for a huge faceless corporation. What? And fired in the first round of layoffs. And no severance package. And mandatory colonoscopy by an unlicensed medical professional. And security's coming. You should leave now. Alright. Wow. Can I ask a question? Yeah. Why do we look at sex in such a negative light? Like, why can't we just embrace that, you know, two people are coming together and making fucking magic and having a good-ass time for the most part? Because when a man wants to commit to a woman and have a serious relationship, he looks at these two. But why, like, why? Like, why can't we change that narrative? We can't. Times have changed. How about this? You know what? No, no, no. How about this? Let's change the narrative. I want you to go out and start dating ugly guys that are short and don't make money. And then we're going to start telling, you know, guys to accept hoes. Let's do it. What do you think? I mean, I've been giving chances to the dudes that don't always look the greatest, don't make all the money. I look for potential. Oh, why doesn't it work out? What do you mean? Why doesn't it work out with these guys that you try to give a chance? I just haven't found my person. Okay, let me give you the real answer. It's never going to change because you're biologically hardwired to look for certain things. Men are always going to want girls that aren't touched. Women are always going to want men that have status and money. So... I'm on the verge of getting my real estate license. Is that what everyone does when their dreams are crushed? I feel like that's like the only... That's the only way out. I don't want to do that. Can you even picture me selling houses? Hi, welcome in. Here's the kitchen. Here's the bathroom. Do you like it? Do you want to buy it? This is my entire job. It's just doing that and then there's other stuff that's boring. I'm sorry. No offense to you guys, but that sounds so boring. Might make a million on... You're trading a million for 45 to 70 years of loneliness. A million is a house. It's not worth it. Dude, there's a lot of life to live. She gave up a three-year marriage to go to Miami. A three-year marriage from Miami. She said, well, he didn't let me go to Miami. Did you say men? She threw away a three-year marriage. Sir, you're making her cry. Oh, shit. I'm sorry. We've just been through a lot and I don't know what else to do. All right, well, I guess... I'm gonna burn in hell. The truth hurts. Women can't handle the truth. They really can't, bro. Opportunists and men are idealists, then men technically love more. Even a guy that doesn't know you, that doesn't have any type of allegiance to you, will still show you some level of chivalry or damn near being a simp without you doing anything for it. So that's the man that's gonna put me and my family first? No, I'm not saying that. What I'm saying is that since... Okay, let me ask you this. Who appreciates being simped on more, men or women? I think men. If you get something all the time, it has no value. Okay? The reason why the woman needs to care more is because we're already operating from a deficit as a man. You're already getting simps hitting you up. You're already getting opportunities. You're already getting guys willing to spend money on you, protect and provide for you for nothing more. Hold on. But the point is that women don't appreciate chivalry anymore, which is why I said chivalry is dead. So you've had a one-night stand. However, you're making a man wait. I'm not making anyone wait right now, but yeah. Right. But you said you have a three-month rule. So you find a guy and he knows this information. Why would you make him wait? I mean, I said it to see if... But then you don't make these one-night stands wait. I think that's where it doesn't make sense. Is she looking for a relationship with that one-night stand? Or does she just want to hook up first? There is a big difference with pursuing a relationship with somebody and just wanting to hook up with somebody. But I don't like how we compartmentalize how we treat sex. Like, okay, if you don't want anything from the guy and you just want casual sex, oh, just fuck him right away. Whereas the guy who you actually value and he values you and he wants a relationship with you, make him wait? I think you honestly should have the same standard across the board. Guilty! Guilty! Guilty! Guilty! I tell my daughter a lot about this. My daughter runs my companies. My daughter didn't know much about business when she started and she was pretty sick too and she didn't know a lot. And so it was easy for people who thought they knew a lot about business to pull the wool over her eyes. But Michaela has the ability to ask stupid questions and we've talked about that a lot. It's like, you only have to ask a stupid question once if you're alert. You ask a stupid question and if you're in a crowd and you ask a stupid question, 80% of the people in the crowd have the same question. They're just too cowardly to ask. But you ask and then someone actually tells you. You never have to ask that question again. You're no longer stupid. So if you ask enough stupid questions because you're honest, well then you're not stupid anymore. Tell these bitches to go to hell. Oh man, sorry. I cut myself shaving again today. My bad. I'm like, oh man, I hope that doesn't show up. Oh shit. Life lesson learned today. Don't try to learn how to use a straight razor like half an hour before you do a show. Oh my God. Yeah, I actually have three collectible straight razors right now. How's it going? How's it going? Yes, we're going to jump right into it today because everybody gets all bent out of shape when I don't start right away. So, but before we do, I have to make a couple of quick announcements here. I will be on No Jumper tomorrow at 4 p.m. Pacific. I guess that's 7 p.m. Eastern time. I don't know that it's a live show. It might be recorded, but if it is not, that's the time to go look. So No Jumper tomorrow, 4 p.m. Pacific, 7 p.m. Eastern. I'll be there. Then I will be in Las Vegas on Wednesday. Well, I'll be there Tuesday, but like on Wednesday, we have Robert Kiyosaki is coming in myself. Robert Kiyosaki, my good friend, Ken McElroy will also be in attendance and myself with Mike Sartain. And we're going to have three lovely ladies with us as well. You've probably seen a few of them before, I think on Access Vegas. And we're going to be talking about the difference between like wealth and being rich and being wealthy. It'll be a more of a sort of an economics version of the red pill, I guess. We're going to do half of it from his private jet. Yeah. And then we're also going to be doing the other half in Sticky Paws. And it will be a recorded show. So we have to do a recording. It can't be live. He's very, very, they're very controlled when it comes to what they put out there and probably rightly so. So that's the Rich Dad, Poor Dad Network, Rich Dad, Poor Dad organization. And we'll be doing that on Wednesday. I will have my good friend, Glenn Lawrence will be with me on both of those, both those appearances, I guess, in Burbank, California, as well as Las Vegas. And then, of course, on Thursday, we will also have Access Vegas, our regularly scheduled show. That's coming up. That will be 8 p.m. Pacific, 11 p.m. Eastern time on Thursday, this coming Thursday, which is the 29th. So we'll be doing that. And then I am right back to Reno, Nevada once again, so that I can go take care of some business because I have to still get my goddamn Camaro, my bitching Camaro, registered in the state of Nevada. The saga continues. If you don't know what that saga is, I'll be happy to tell you personally sometime because it's not fit for this show. I will swear way too much about the Nevada DMV. So that's coming up soon. Let's see. Gosh, I've already got a lot of people up and in. Thank you very much. You know,  I've got a new monitor. So if you see me looking this way, I've got a new monitor here that I have exclusively set for the chat so I can see all you guys and monitor the chat as I go along. Should we just start with this? Let's go back to this real quick. Don't worry about who those two girls are on the side. Actually, they're the same girl. And no, they're not Brett. They're the same chick. And it's kind of an inside joke. But the girl who is the conservative, you know, patriot is also the thought. And she's the Thotiana. And I wanted to dig in today, get into some stuff with Brett Cooper. I think probably that's the best place to start. Today's going to be a little bit data heavy. I've got a lot of statistics and I got a lot of just empirical truth or empirical data to share with you guys today. So if it's a little bit on the graph heavy side today, there's a method to my madness here. I'm going to pull out some of these videos here real quick so I can make some room for some other videos. Stream art only allows you to have 10 active videos in the archive here. So I'm going to pull some of these out. Did you guys like that one? The reason why I showed you, actually, let me throw this one in again. This one was really good. Next. Hello. That's right. I try my best. That's the hope. What? Excuse me? How dare you? That's a waste of my talent. Yes, daddy. 5k of that is coming for me. That was a pretty funny one. I threw that on there because it's kind of pertinent to the discussion we're going to have with with Brett Cooper. She's not actually joining us today. Just so you guys know, I'm not actually having her on the show. I would like she's more than welcome to come to Vegas. You can come to Reno. She can I'll be happy to do anything remote with her. I think she actually has some. There's some hope for Brett. I think maybe after today, there'll be a little bit more hope for Brett. So I've got I've got that on tap. I want to kind of dig into this. Like people were saying you have to respond to this. You have to don't tell me I have to do things. Please like like if you're going to DM me, like especially if you're coming into my DMS for the first time, like don't you have to do this? I have to do goddamn thing. But I thought on this case, I kind of took it with a grain of salt because I was looking at what she was talking about. And I kind of I don't know of all the little kind of trad thoughts that are out there right now. Brett at least gives me a little glimmer of hope in some ways. And in some ways she's just she's she's kind of like the bratty like youngest sister of Ben Shapiro. She has the Ben Shapiro look. She's got the like that kind of like she smelled something sour or something like something bad in the in the refrigerator every now and then. So I'm going to yeah, you can DM me. You can DM me anytime you'd like in my in my Instagram. What we got here high roll for the straight razor. Try practicing with a balloon. Oh, yeah, right. Yeah.  I tell you the thing is, is like some right handed. So like when you're trying to do the left handed thing, they tell you, oh, you just use your left hand. I'm like, get the fuck out of here with this thing. No. So anyways, I'm going to be showing you a bit of information today. But before we do that, I think maybe it'd be best to just like dig into this video here. Where's my clip? My good girl. Okay, here she is. This is this comes from. In fact, let me just open it real quick and I'll go to the comment section. This is my good friend. My good friend. Oh, Brett, you're so perky. You're so bubbly. I love it when I see. Should I wear? I should really have to wear pink. I am not wearing pink tomorrow. Sorry. Not it. Not it. Not for. Should I wear pink? What for? You mean for what? For no jumper? Do I have to? Is that a thing? I didn't know that was a thing. Yeah, I know. I know. I realize that. And a lot of people were saying the same thing. They're saying, oh, man, it's a trap. It's a trap. And MLD is there too, by the way. So MLD will be. I don't. We won't be on the same show. I don't think but like MLD is also in Burbank right now as well Funny how that worked out I've come to the conclusion that like if I'm not if I'm gonna go excuse me if I'm gonna go on a if I'm gonna go on a show I Have to be I've been prepared for pretty much anything So either I'm there as a representative for like you guys for the Manosphere for the red pill fuck me To me it's like Wearing glasses, I can't wear contacts because I have like yeah prisms in my glasses so I can never really do that But anyways, yeah, I'm prepared for Doug. Yeah, trust me. Thank you for the thanks for the heads up I know a lot of people were telling me I shouldn't do it. I thought it was interesting because primarily because Like Adams known who I have who I am for a long time people have dropped my name on his show several times I know that Ethan Klein knows who I clearly knows who I am I know a lot of people who like the guys and um, what's it on? What's his name Adam Adam, I can't remember the dude's name flagrant on flagrant to those guys I don't know. I forget their names, but the guys on flagrant to they know my name as well. Why now? Why now? Why am I being called in to hey? Hey, we'd really love to have you on the show right now and I will tell you exactly why now because they see the man is that they think they become an impression of the the The outlook right now is that the man is fear is like sort of falling apart the seams right now Hi, how's it going surge? My buddy Steve introduced me to the rational male. I wish I would have been introduced years ago I don't why don't you narrate your books on audible? well, simply because it's a lot of work it's a lot of time and the There are people who do it better than I would I people have asked me that like how can we do it? Well, if you would like to wait for a very long time for me to do that I don't think people really realize that there's a lot of there's a lot of Complexities, let's just say when it comes to audible You have to be very specific audible has very specific standards for their audio And it's not like I couldn't do that. I could I could read my book I could do all that stuff but the problem then comes down to like how long do you want to wait for the audible? I would much rather have a professional doing it do it pay for a professional have that be have somebody who has a really good Conversational tone. I have had Sam Bada read my books my first three books I've had my friend Trey Not Trey little but this other guy Trey who's read my that my books for the last two which have been Religion and players handbook. I like a conversational tone I listen to a lot of audible books myself And so I kind of got a feel for what I want to listen to and I want a conversational tone I want so I don't want it to be like delivered to you like in this kind of semi robotic voice I like it when when people are like actually relating my work like in a conversational tone So that's why could I do that? Yeah, I could but you can also listen to me here getting it to giving it giving out Information for you guys for a bud light. There you go Yeah, no bud lights in this in this place Now, why am I why am I digging into this today? Our good friend Brett Cooper here has gone the listen the Tommy Lahren route and is Up in her feels about how guys aren't just living up aren't living them aren't living the dream They're not living up to the standards that women put out for them guys. How come you guys aren't living up? Why is it that the lost boys generation which has been around? Oh gosh, I don't know since 2012 How old is like she's like, I think she's 21 22 right now. So she was like 10 years old when was it when Hannah Rosen wrote that the the end of men and the all the single ladies by What's her name? Not not not the not the song but Kate something or other. I can't remember name She wrote she wrote a book called spinster I think as well But when all of this started when Milo Yiannopoulos wrote the it wasn't the lost boys It was the dropout generation, which was in 2014 when he used to write for Breitbart. It's the same narrative It's the same thing that's been going on for for more than a decade right now And I think she was probably in middle school if that maybe 12 years old when when all this started so now it's suddenly an imperative now, it's suddenly a a big deal and If you go back if you even rewind the tape all the way back to like say 1970 it's still that you want to know where it started. That's where it started So we're gonna dig into some of the the reasons why guys aren't in the workforce today I covered a bit of this when I did the The episode on Tommy Lahren talking about nilfs. I think is what it was called NILF. So it's like not no income Well living with family, I think is what it was And so you'll understand a little bit more when I let her let her riff here a little bit. I'm Brett Cooper We're gonna talk about young people today specifically young men My mom sent me a text last night that actually inspired this episode. So you all have heard a thank. Thanks mom she sent me a Facebook post that she saw and it just sent me on a Google research spiral and I'm actually very excited to talk about this not because it's a positive thing But because I think it is important topic before we okay Never ever say I am very excited to tell you this. I'm Excited to let you know about this new information that salesmanship. Stop it. Do not say that Especially if you're a salesperson if you're like, by the way, if you're going to do like ad drops in your podcast Don't start with hi. I'm Rolla Tomasi and I'm excited to tell you this new informant. No, you're not you're not excited whatsoever You'd like to be hyped up and you like people to be really well, what are you about to say? You're not excited. Stop it Just like deliver the information, right? If you want people to not be turned off to you as a salesperson adopt a conversational tone, right?

Alrighty, so this is the post she sent me It is actually an ad and it is for a home builder in Boise where she lives And they said we have a select number of next-gen homes available in the Treasure Valley area That's Boise these plans offer an attached private suite Complete with a private entrance living area wet bar bedroom and a full bathroom and its own garage So if you guys have spent any time on Zillow or if you have been in people's houses You know that sometimes people might have a little like attached Apartment and those are usually called in-law suites or you know, your parents will come move in with you You know something, you know the extra room for family or in this economy people are renting them out Okay, so let's stop right there because I have owned an x-gen house myself here in Reno, Nevada I own it because or I did own it I've I've since moved on and we as you know, I'm in the new red one studios here But I have previously owned a home. That is a quote-unquote next-gen home. Now. What is the next-gen home? well, apparently according to Brett who's about to Explain all this to us in in great detail that the reason why home builders are building these houses is to accommodate these nilfs these no income living with family dudes and In some ways I understand the sort of consternation the sudden concern trolling of the traditional Conservatives right now and men ain't living up and they they're fat and they're lazy and they're jerking off and they're you know smoking weed and You've heard me explain this But now we're gonna go and we're gonna relate this to home building now there's a lot of reasons why home and and trust me, I have at least a Peripheral knowledge of real estate here but there's one reason why they started building these homes and it wasn't because of what's currently now the Hot topic of guys, you know wanting to move into mom and dad's house or staying in mom and dad's house And so they go, you know what? It doesn't look like juniors gonna leave anytime soon Why don't we go buy a next-gen place so we don't have to deal with his bullshit and he can just have his own Slob house on one wing of the house over here, and we'll just have our own little separate life over here Their home builders aren't doing that You know why they're doing this is because of a lot well a lot of different reasons You could rent it out if you wanted to but if you're gonna own a single-family home Do you really want to rent it out if you can't afford it in the first place? It's better than remember the average home prices today are like through the frickin roof If you're gonna go and buy that house in the first place or if you're going to be say a real estate investor and You're going to eventually rent that house out. Anyways, now you have the attached Nilf house or the the next-gen It's basically an apartment that's attached to a single-family house, right? Why are they doing this? Well, the main reason for this is because more and more boomers are fading away and They've got to have some sort of home or some sort of place for grandma and grandpa and usually grandma to live out the Remainder of her life, so it's better It's it's cheaper in some ways to have to keep grandma in the next-gen house next door Let's attach to your home Then it really is to put her in an assisted living facility because as and I can speak from experience It is very bloody expensive especially if it's if it's a Assisted living facility that is in any way worth its salt that you would feel like comfortable leaving leaving your mom There it's much more affordable as much you can keep a better eye on them You could it's it's really a convenience is what it was for. That's why it was next-gen now Is it possible that junior is still living in that that next-gen side? Is it is it possible that mom and dad are enabling junior to sort of live to 30 and 40 in the next-gen unit? Certainly, but is that why it's being built? I highly doubt it There's a lot of different reasons for and you got to understand that home ownership is at all-time low right now People don't buy homes. They rent homes. They rent them from Blackrock They rent them from investors whose names you can't pronounce because they live in the Silicon Valley or in the Bay Area They own those places and they rent them out and that the the business model Anyways is to simply have a rental agency take care of all that stuff for you And you just collect a fat check and their agency collects a fat check well it's much easier to do that if you have a If you have grandma and grandpa that need to come and live with you because they can't afford they can't survive on a fixed income It's much better and much more convenient to have them in that next-gen house assuming you can afford it assuming you can like put the Rent up assuming they can afford it themselves Because it's a lot easier for sharing those costs. That's where the next-gen came from It did not come from the lost boys generate to accommodate the loss because everything is very expensive, but now Because so many young people are moving home Builders are making and designing homes for this next-gen. It's okay They've been doing this for over a decade dear. They've been doing this for a very long time. It's not Specifically for and I would I would say it's particularly in wherever it is in, Idaho Probably not there either kids have a place to live when they apparently inevitably move back in with their parents Like just that alone now, here's the other thing that gets me on this whole this whole shtick is the presumption is that it's the guys that are moving and She's about to get into the the nuts and bolts of you know Guys being out of work not being in the workforce and all this all these great stats Which we'll we'll talk about little by little However, the presumption is this is that home builders with this in mind say, you know what all these lazy fucks I want to live with mom and dad so we better build some next-gen homes so that they can be they can be Accommodated with so they can they can be the eco Camorra's of the United States living in the next-gen unit. That's attached to your house No, but also understand that it's one thing for a Kid for a for a guy right for a male for a boy for a you know, a young man to be living at home That's one dynamic. That's shameful. That guy should be living up to his performance potential He should want to get out of the house. He should want to have a car He should want to have all these responsibility. He should want to do this and we will wag a finger at those guys when we look at the rate of Enrollment and graduation for women How many women are how many young women who have gone through they've got taken out a student loan Well, I mean, maybe this is a maybe it's a better question for Erin Clary But how many women have gone through this and have had to move back in with their with their parents? Why is it shameful for a young man? To be living at home with his with his parents and it is not shameful for a young woman to be doing so She's focusing on her career she's trying to get a job she is Looking to I think there's this misconception that women have this great sense of responsibility How many females are moving back in with mom and dad after college? We we already know the college enrollment for men is something somewhere around like 40% College graduation is another statistic that they never want to throw out there. They'll say well, you know, what is it 6040? I think across the nation right now 60% of college enrollment is women 40% as men We never look at the graduation rate who drops out men actually drop out quite a bit more than women do so what does that leave women with that leaves them as the but they hold the lion's share of Personal debt, let's just say student debt and so it's far more likely for women to want to go home and live with mom and dad and There's no stigma attached to that there is for boys because boys have what do we call the burden of performance? And they're not living up if they're living in the next-gen unit next to mom and dad upsetting There's obviously a market for it, but it's just upsetting But obviously this is a needed thing because Gen Zers living at home is well documented But especially men and I want to focus on men today because as I was doing this research and reading about these next-gen homes You know going on this research spiral almost everything was about young men. And so we're gonna focus on them. So here's an article You know, I gets me is this is and I'll let her finish in just a second But what gets me about this whole thing is whenever anyone in the red pill throws out some stats about women The first thing out of anyone's mouth men or women male or female the first thing out of their mouth is well men do it, too"}
