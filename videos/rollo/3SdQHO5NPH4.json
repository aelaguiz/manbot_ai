I watched Barbie last night because because I wanted to be able to better judge Because I wanted to review it and I went into this thing thinking because my girlfriend hated it that that I was going to hate It and there were some moments that are funny like I'm not going to lie like I really thought will Ferrell was actually funny I think Margot Robbie's a fantastic actress, but there were some parts of the movie that actually frightened me like legitimately frightened me I was wondering what do you think about it? I know you did It's not I did an entire show on it, and I I got I got a bootleg copy of it So I was why I would not pay for this Yes, thank you very much. No. I mean the I broke it down. It's a hate to actually have to To do reviews on movies stuff like like this because it always sounds like I'm getting like way too involved while you were taking this Seriously, and it's like well I am but I'm also have to look at it from like sort of a Cultural narrative on top of everything well. It's kind of your job. Isn't it? I mean, it's a little bit Yes, yes, it is yeah, it is and I was just gonna say I am I I I thought it was I think some people are trying to read more into it than it actually then actually was there The entirety of it was really sort of this statement on I want to say like the the war of the sexes more or less And you've got like I don't know who a spoiler. I'm gonna spoil Barbie for you right now. Sorry So I you know the fact was it was Ryan Gosling right yeah He's placed Ken so you've got like the Kens and the Barbies And it's the entire movie is is more or less premised on On just sort of this battle of the sexes, and it just all it does is play up You know just cultural stereotypes and really I think kind of encourages more adversarialness between you know men and women as a result of that Well, I'll go over there. I'll actually I'll actually read something to you here in just a second okay ladies Who were watching movie who did what did you what do you think about it Ashley? I thought it was good, but yeah there So did you hear that whole thing that was going on lately there were young girls are breaking up with their boyfriends because yeah Yes They're breaking up with their boyfriends because of the Barbie movie. Yeah, what were the reasons why well the patriarchy And then like like women need to be like more like single and separated and then the men need to find themselves Because they don't know themselves and they define themselves based off a Barbie and the whole Ordeal because that because that was Ken's fault right Ken wasn't created to be like it's Ken's fault that he has to find himself Yeah, I thought it was entertaining yes, and I thought it, but at the same time will Ferrell was really fun Yeah, I think there was definitely a lot of funny parts, but it was ridiculous and the fans that went to go see it We're just outrageous like my my whole like I went to the actual movies to go see it Yeah, I went by myself and like I had like People like dressed up in all pink all the boyfriends were there all their With the guys just in pink That's how I can get laid now It's called virtue signaling pity sex Bar they had like a Barbie drink Uh-huh and the guy was telling me that they were selling out of alcohol because of this Barbie drink and everybody was in there With this crazy Barbie drink. It's incredibly. It's been incredibly commercially successful hasn't because he's tapped into what Michaels Talking about which is basically Capitalizing effectively on this war between the sexes right well. It's a it's capitalizing on a movie. That's anti-capitalist, but it's capitalism You guys understand like that, that's how there's so many levels of irony Did you see what they did when it comes to like how they promoted it? They did it They promoted it so well on tik-tok that they got guys to go and make tik-toks About them wearing pink and going to go see Barbie to make it socially acceptable for men at our age to go see Barbie yeah, they did all these tik-toks with like young black guys, and these like white guys are dressed up in all like Pink with pink Barbie backpacks, and they're like yeah, I'm a barbie boy and a barbie boy. That's awesome We're right-headed book of revelations Whatever the fuck that's where we're going Any other guys? I'm sure some of you have a pot maybe have a positive for you does anybody don't want you to feel afraid to like it Did anybody see the movie and you enjoyed it like I'm trying to be as positive, but I tried to be as positive Can I can I read you my daughter go ahead my daughter the reason I even did this stupid video I'm almost ashamed. I gotta get you know take a shower after this kind of so but my daughter said don't see the Barbie movie I'm like okay now I'm gonna see the Barbie movie because you just said don't see it. She says do not see the Barbie movie I was crying afterwards because of how bad a stupid woke-ass society ruined it It was so incredibly over-the-top in-your-face woke man-hating like there was absolutely this is all like one run-up Sentence here like there was absolutely no denying It was man-hating literally in the movie the Barbie plan is to emotionally manipulate men to turn them against each other So women can take over like the word like word for word. They said exactly that they said they tried to book They tried to blind you to with the bright colors and the aesthetics so that you think it's innocent Yeah, also the opening scene of the little girls smashing baby dolls heads And they call the pregnant Barbie weird I hope all I hope all the woke people stop populating since they since they Want to stop motherhood there isn't there's not any plot And there's no point where where they make the Barbie suicidal worst movie ever I'm just so angry because it was it's not what Barbie really is because she used to have Barbies You know when she was a kid right? I says, and I want to throw away all my Barbie. It's Like What do you think Adam well, I went with the lovely Sydney Sydney yes of the two of us I was like we got to go see the Barbie movie. Yeah, she's like literally looks like Barbie you met her last night. Yeah, okay But I wanted to get it for the cultural narrative that is going on here There was so much meta stuff going on in here like there's so many layers to it for me It's it's sort of indicative of where we're at right now. Is that the politicization of everything kovat vaccine this politics that Politicization and for me the biggest takeaway and you guys can chime in is I think they said the word Patriarchy like a dozen times maybe more so if you didn't know what the fucking patriarchy was before this You're googling after the movie and for me the whole thing with the with the Patriarchy and women talk about there's no guys like it's the patriarchy bro. It's It is the epitome of victim mentality yes now today in society you're winning if you're a victim Oh, I'm the trans victim. I'm the gay victim. I'm the black victim. I'm the I'm the Illegal alien victim okay, whatever what I call it I'm gonna victimize you The Problem is you're just encouraging victimhood and the problem America today is you're not encouraging actual leaders and heroes We've neglected the hero-making machine men who have built the roads or built companies or built America are looked at as The patriarchy how dare you build this amazing country and then the mothers? Embargo the women There were two anyone come here not from their mother's vagina hold it there were two instances in the movie The point is no the the ultimate irony the ultimate irony is it was a set on a movie It was a movie set built by men sitting there to denigrate man That was the ultimate irony and it was also produced by Warner Brothers that was also run by men now Here's the thing I'm gonna bring up a couple of things And I'm not so first off if they had just stick stuck with parody I would have been fine with all of it as long as it was funny. I don't give a fuck It's like it's not like if you watch idiocracy if you watch idiocracy all stupid people should be offended by that movie But they're not because they don't think it's talking about them and the movies funny Even though there's a lot of dumb people who should watch idiocracy and be like wait. That's me. I'm that stupid right so the thing Is with this movie if they they started funny, and I was like as long as they stay funny I'm cool with this and there's this point in the middle Do you remember where that the mother starts giving that speech about we're blamed for? And I was looking at Rollo's like man that Ukraine war man, that's the women's fault It's the men fucking dying in you The movie the movie what it does is it's funny funny funny funny funny And then there's these like two or three points where the laugh track stops, and then here here comes here comes progressive Narrative and it's like that wasn't cool because you were funny And you're marketing to kids and now you go completely serious And now we're full-on progressive narrative, and then we go back to funny, but funny is always making fun of Ryan Gosling That's what funny is now. I will give Some kudos they do make fun of Irrationality and emotions with women so that's fine as long as they make fun of themselves a little bit I was fine with that and like I said like Margot Robbie is a fucking national treasure She's a fantastic actress But in this movie like there was certain points where they're like yelling at her and you can kind of see like the juxtaposition I enjoyed the part where she meets the teenage girl and teenage girls like no you're the fucking problem And she's like no. I'm just trying to help you I enjoyed that because that's actually the real part, but the feminists don't see it that was actually real life But they don't grasp that part anyway go up, but what were you saying? We're America Ferrera, please yeah, so it's her daughter that hated Barbie. Yes. She's like you're the reason That's wrong with fluid and feminism basically so I'll try to read it fast cuz really quick she goes It's literally impossible to be a woman you have you are so beautiful and you're so smart and it kills me that you don't Think you're good enough like we have to always be extraordinary always somehow. We're always doing it wrong ladies Take note you have to always be extraordinary all right If you don't know we don't love you at your worst we don't deserve you at your best You know this you have to be thin but not too thin you can never say what you that you want to be thin You have to say you want to be healthy, but you have to be thin You have to have money, but you can't ask for money because that's crass you have to be a boss But you can't be mean you have to lead, but you can't squash other people's ideas You're supposed to love being a mother But you don't want to talk about your kids all the damn time You have to be a career woman always say that you're looking out for other people you have to answer for men's bad behavior Which is insane, which why do you have to answer for man's better every but? I can explain that but if you point that out you're accused of complaining Sounds like that you're supposed to stay pretty for men But not so pretty that you tempt too much for that you could threaten other women because you're supposed to be part of the sister A lot of this stuff comes from other women though. That's the fucking ridiculous thing a lot of these strictures. This isn't men This is other women Two more cent our but always stand out and be grateful never forget that the system is rigged hello The system is rigged okay, so we find a way to acknowledge, but also be grateful You have to never get old never be rude never show off never be selfish never fall down never fall Never show fear never get online. Here's the coup de grace. It's just too damn hard It's too contradictory nobody gives you a medal or says Thank you what and it turns out in fact that not only are you heard everything wrong, but you're also everything is your fault I'm just so tired victim mentality here. Hello guys I'm just so tired of watching myself and every other single woman here Tie yourself to not so that people will like us and all of that is also true for a doll just representing women, okay? So I just want to point this out for those of you didn't see the movie all the funny stops When that starts great and she does she goes through that whole tirade and that tirade is now a Special set of words that she uses to deconstruct the patriarchy out of these women's mind so basically they're all being hypnotized So you wanting to do things for your husband like for instance give him a back massage or bring him a beer you would only Do that according to this movie because of a patriarchy you could never want to do that because you want to make your man That's impossible And in order in order to dehypnotize you she makes that statement and the women go. Oh my god. What am I doing here? I'm a Supreme Court justice. They do that several times now. I'm gonna bring up this okay? So the first thing is it throughout the entire movie Masculinity is overextended. It's overexaggerated, and it's always seen as a cope for insecurity meaning every single function of masculinity in the movie Like so for instance if you were to take Ryan Gosling. He's a really good-looking guy in the movie He's a fucking jack. You got like He's definitely on he's taking something right he's jacked in this movie trend and when he does and he does so the whole time He's popular. He's funny. There's all these things going on, but all of it every his popularity his absence Every single thing he does is a cope for his personal insecurities and in some cases they hint to this closet homosexuality That's the only thing there's literally no other reason meaning his his masculinity souls and serves absolutely no purpose other than a cope and a hiding mechanism for the true femininity that he should feel in order to cope in order to to to love Barbie to Garner acceptance for Barbie does make sense okay? What do you think was the the the biggest point where he was the biggest? Simp okay at the end when he's like tries to kiss her and like it's very like it just sits like this okay? So here's the thing waiting waiting Yeah, no, so here's a second. This is the part personally that offended me the most ready so so Barbie even admits that she goes. I'm sorry. I took you for granted. Do you guys remember this yeah? So now a man just consider if you guys have a brother or a son she he's he's dating He's dating a woman who is clearly Disrespecting and putting him in the friendzone like oh, you're my you're my boyfriend But we don't have sex just totally disrespecting him and God forbid this man chooses to set a boundary And go change himself he so basically you can't respect a man unless you're having sex with him No, no in this case in this case, but here's the thing she shouldn't say that's my boyfriend No, I shouldn't say that's my boyfriend, but also she shouldn't say that's my he even wanted to hang out with her And she's like no it's girls By the way Kirsten Kirsten when you watch the movie she had right she admits that she's wrong for this They're like a very small apology at the very end, but my point is what's additionally so a woman has now Disrespected her boyfriend, and he chooses to make changes in his life, and that is additionally because of insecurity No, that is exactly what every move man watching this should do if you are in a situation where somebody is crossing your boundaries You should leave the situation and it's not out of insecurity. It's out of your own Necessity for self-worth your own self-worth so Ken now obviously he acts ridiculous in the show He's like dancing and doing all this crazy shit But him deciding to leave Barbie and go on his own to do his own journey. That was not the wrong answer It was the right answer Yeah But that he was made fun of and criticized and in the end he was this little stupid boy for trying to do this whole Thing where he he goes off and he tries to take over the world he goes yeah patriarchy, bro By the way, he's the way he said patriarchy made me laugh a couple times. He goes yo patriarchy's great patriarchy's great It was it was pretty funny For the first time Men-run Actually run the world what's happening here? Yeah It seems like it's a cultural tool to undercut masculinity in or any guy's ability to have autonomy for himself Kissing you grab the mic and get closer to you real quick. Can you show that way? Because if anything you do if anything if anything you do gets gets put down to okay. Well, this is just a cope This is just you being insecure then it means that the guy has no autonomy The reason though is so massively popular is because women generally speaking by the tickets women sort of control the expenditure, right? I mean, they They played mostly women They played a cultural cultural blind here, but I don't I don't believe that this is I don't believe that this is Ideologically driven. I think that they made the movie to make a bucket load of cash for sure I knew it was it was in line with design. Okay, so listen, go ahead. What were you saying? Yeah, it's just why is it so popular Kirsten? Transformers popular because it's real is it because it's real It's but it's popular because it's in line with the cultural fashion Which is to denigrate men at the expense of women and so a lot of people buy into that a lot of women Good Jen, go ahead. Okay, you said that victims of women winning if you're a victim you're winning. I've never seen men be more victims Yeah The past couple years no one disagrees with you I agree with you are whining and crying and bellyaching online about women Hold on and you said if you had a son or a boyfriend or whatever I would slap my son in the back of the head if he was this involved in Barbie What do you mean? I would slap no man should be this involved in a movie. That's agreed He didn't see the movie It's satire about fucking toys. Okay, so here's Here's a problem What do you mean you'd be you'd you'd get upset with your son if he saw the movie or if he was playing with Barbies Those are two separate things. I would be upset if he was this emotional over a movie about Satire I'm not emotional. I said I sell Wilson. Will Ferrell was funny. I didn't How about this you're a podcaster right? Yes, I am. Hey guys you ever see the movie Barbie. Yeah. All right What are your thoughts? No, I don't want to talk about it Exaggerating baby, you're exaggerating Look look I come It's a bit of a copious Where my father would walk in and he wouldn't get into the affairs of women these new men these modern men It's big dick syndrome. Yes Land the plane here. I don't recognize this masculinity Oh, it's just a movie it's just Do you have an issue with the whole idea of if you have children that them being Gender reaffirming care where they're being suggested to go and have surgery and change their gender when they're like nine or eight years old You have an issue with that. That is crazy. So so so trying to indoctrinate young kids is crazy. Yes It's a movie little girls are breaking up with their boyfriends There's no you a man hater, you know, I don't know you sound like you're making We're not on tape this is video, but don't miss quote me I hate simps. I hate punks. I hate men that are that are neck-deep in women's issues like you're sitting next to me With Masculine men what I'm seeing today what I'm saying what I'm seeing today is ten years ago If you would have told me that men would be bitching moaning and crying about Barbie. I'd be like, no, that's never gonna happen Go deeper you're smart We're not talking about we like playing with dolls we're talking about cultural narratives and what's happening in America The reason why this cultural narrative you're being biased the reason why this cultural narrative seems to tickle your butthole is because it's women No, it's not Jet at no point did I ever complain about women acting empowered in this movie? My issue was that men are treated like fucking farm animals in this fucking movie for kids Can I drop that was my issue? Let me drop one Let me drop one more thing here, too Because I stand fucking vindicated at the end of this movie because they use the word superfluous in this Dr. Phil look it up in the fucking dictionary that we're talking shit about men now. It's a huge thing To your point also isn't Yeah, I know that is 100% of kids move the more 40 Let me direct traffic here for one second. Okay. Have you seen the movie? I Would shut my fucking mouth I Reason why I made a big deal out of the word superfluous because timeout everyone to be quiet when I was on dr Phil I mentioned that I said hey look you're being true. I'm just on the second show. Actually. I said you're superfluous You are actually an embodiment of what I was saying when I got into that part It was exactly what was what they were talking about in the Barbie movie. We have made men superfluous They're nice to have around but we don't need them Every last time every sit on your show on what on whatever podcast on this show on fresh and fit I hear the same damn thing. I don't need a man, but I want a man that movie was the narrative of that movie The theme of that movie is they're nice to have around but we don't actually need them Men are superfluous But now you're talking about reality, that is the reality we want you, but we don't need you anymore CJ go ahead go CJ. I was just saying I need a man. I don't Know Thank you, so anyone in the chat, but also I want to bring up to you like I want to be a mom someday What if I have a son? I don't want my son being like listening to all of this and being treated like now Why do you want to be a mom CJ? Let's see? Why do you want to be a mom I just do I had a mom Girl, I would like to be a mom. I haven't really thought about it that much. I don't feel like it's I'm gonna be 38 in So, what do you mean? You haven't thought about being a mom? You're 38. Of course, you've okay So I have thought about being a mom.
