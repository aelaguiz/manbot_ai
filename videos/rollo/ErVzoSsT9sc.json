Am I hosting this? I don't care. No, this is all casual. Here's what we do, guys. We're going to have a casual discussion for those of you who are interested in this. So this is the first time Sergio has met Rollo. Obviously, I've been on both shows. Rollo and I do a show together, and I'm from Dallas, so I see Sergio all the time. So I'm going to moderate this when they start throwing lobs at each other and then hopefully keep them from fighting. Yes. So that's the thing here. I've been given a list of topics that we're going to discuss while we're doing this, and I'm probably going to read some things off the different chats. So we're going to go ahead and do this now. So the first thing that we want to talk about \u2013 actually, Sergio, this is what I want to know. Can we make sure the audio is good? So can you guys hit a 1 in the chat? Yeah, hit a 1 in the chat if you guys can hear us okay. So here's the thing. Also, we can just listen to it on here. I'm going to turn it up real quick and see if I can hear it. So the thing is \u2013 yeah, it doesn't look like we're on live. The audio is bad. Oh, you can't hear us? Maybe it's coming from the camera mics or \u2013 Oh, take off echo cancellation on mine. Maybe it's coming from the camera mics. There we go. So, yeah, we do have a little echo, I think. Okay, you got it. All right, beautiful. So here's \u2013 Oh, no, it's wrong mics. It might \u2013 like he said, wrong mics. It might be camera mics. Go to the settings again. It should not be camera mics. I would just check it really quick. It's definitely not using the mic. Yeah, it's defaulting to the microphone. Oh, no, it's wrong mics. It might \u2013 like he says, wrong mics. It might be camera mics. Go to the settings again. I would just check it really quick. It's definitely not using the mic. It's defaulting to the microphone. One, two. Are we good there? Sometimes it just shows 150 with those. How about that? All right, how about now? Even worse, actually. One, two. Are we good there? Sometimes it just shows 150 with those. Hold on one second. Oh, yeah, we're getting this. Hold on. Here we go. I'm going to ask you. Hello, hello, hello, hello. That's not even touching me. Hey, guys, I think that did it. Huh? Yeah, where are you? Hello, hello, hello, hello. Hello, hello, hello. It says nothing popping up on the screen. Yeah, that did it. All right, guys, let's go. Let's go. Let's go. We're good. All right, guys, sorry about that. You guys should be able to hear me fine. We're in the new studio. Yeah, they did it. All right, guys, let's go. Let's go. Let's go. We're good. All right, guys, sorry about that. Beautiful. All right, we're going to go ahead and start with this. Thank you guys for giving us some audio input there. So here's the first thing. Sergio, my question to you has, and I guess to you also, is, like, I don't, when I talk to the two of you, I don't really see any dissension, but apparently, you know, you've had an issue with some of the things he said, and I've just been confused. I've been confused by, like, what exactly the issue is. So can you describe? Yeah, we definitely 1,000% agree on way more than we disagree on. Like, I'm definitely pinching sort of the things that, like, the little tiny things that we're differences in. But I would say that for 90% of stuff, I would actually say you're my biggest inspiration by far on my show. Everything that I say is literally a quote from you, maybe changed a little bit or used just a little bit. Otherwise, like, I would say I agree with you on damn near everything. It's just these little things that I'm a little bit disagreeing with. I just want to see your opinion on it, because I've read your book. I didn't read all of them. I just was able to read the first one. But I've read, you know, Evolutionary Desire. I've read Mark Higginson's book. I've read God's Size. I was trying to see where you're coming from. I learned a lot. I still have trouble with the audio. You're the only live mic right now. Me? You're the only live mic right now. So does it work for a second depending on one of the cameras? No, it only worked for me. Do you want to test these ones? Are you still hearing them? What do you mean? No, it only works for me. Is it good? Is it audible? Give me a 1 in the chat if you hear me better now. They can only hear me. And I'm mic 5, by the way. Yeah, can you hear mic 5? They can only hear me. 1, 2, 1, 2. Yeah, here's mic 5. Go ahead. 1, 2. Me? 1, 2. Yeah, it's good. They don't hear me. Nothing? Nothing. Okay. I'm up here. What the heck, man? The mic is not working on Sergio. It's still doing audio. I'm up now, Sergio. Mic test 1, 2. I'm going to hold you. Mic test 1, 2. Mic test 1, 2. Mic test 1, 2. Can I look at it? I'm not really aware of what you said. Mic test 1, 2. Hello, hello, hello. Hello, hello, hello. Mic test 1, 2. What should they sign up for? Mic test 1, 2. Mic test 1, 2. Mic test 1, 2. Mic test 1, 2. Mic test 1, 2. Mic test 1, 2. Hello, hello, hello. Hello, hello, hello. Hello, hello, hello. Mic test 1, 2. Where is Mic test 1, 2? Mic test... Check, check, check. What's my number? It looks like I'm number 2. Mic is number 2. Okay. No, he's coming through. The other one's on. The other one's on. So... Check, check, check. Check is that the answer? It looks like I'm number 2. Mic test 1, 2. Testing 1, 2. Mic test 1, 2. Testing 1, 2. Check, check, check. Hello, hello, hello. It looks like I'm number 2. Are you... No. You guys do not have audio. Hello, hello, hello. Hi. What's my number? Yeah. The only... Guys, there's a solution here. There's only one solution, and we put the one mic in the middle, and we just talk into it. You guys do not have audio. Hi. So... Yeah. The only... Guys, there's a solution here. There's only one solution, and we put the one mic in the middle, and we just talk into it. The game is... Everything is being run now. We always have to do that. Yeah. Let me run the... No, no. I want to see the board. Oh, this one. Yeah. Let me see the board. We have a power here. So, excuse me, guys. 100, alright. 100. Alright cool, can you just put the camera on me and I'm going to talk to everybody while we wait for you guys to fix this up. Alright cool, can you just put the camera on me and I'm going to talk to everybody while we wait for you guys to fix this up. Alright, we'll just share the mic. Put the mic in the middle. Alright, maybe this will work for us. Thanks for everybody. Alright, we're good? Alright, we're good. This is not going to be great audio. We'd actually be better off using the inboard microphone. The camera mic's are even better. Like, to switch between the setting control, which one sounds the best, might be the best idea? I'm listening to the sound. They can hear now, very low. Yeah. I'll just turn up the mic. No, it won't matter. They're going to hear me three times louder than them. It's directional. It's directional. Better? Hello? No. Oh, you know what you could do? You could use that shotgun mic. Guys, this is good enough. Ready? Let's go. Ready, guys? We're going to go ahead and start this thing up. Okay? Alright. If it's just unbearable, then let us know. We're just going to talk loud. Alright? We're going to share one mic. You see the mic right there in the middle? Because we're in an OnlyFans studio. Here we go. So, go ahead, Sergio. What are the things that you... So, here we go, guys. The thing is, I have done shows with both of them. I've done maybe four shows with them and 50 shows with them, and I don't know what the disagreement is. So, could you go... I know you said the majority of your influence comes from Roll-Up. Could you go over what your disagreements are? Why is it that you guys get... Throw shade in the chat. Why are we here? Yeah. So, it almost always comes down to just a difference in opinion based off of my own life experiences, which obviously you've studied everything to... It's not your life experience. It's based off of science. It's based off of the books that you've read. You've put it all together. And probably some social... Or your own personal experience, too, you know? So, just a lot... But to understand me a little bit more, I was the type where I had my first business when I was 21. I was... I got kicked out of my house at 18. A lot of where I got to where I got today was because of nothing but myself. I didn't have family helping me. It was a lot of me on my own with girls, with everything. I've had multiple serious relationships with multiple very beautiful women, you know, living with them, all that type of stuff. And so, my experiences just show me that some of the things that, like you say, just don't always align. Just like how when Michael and you first started talking, he kind of... I don't know if he changed your mind on preselection, but he probably might have been like, you know, look at this. Look what I'm able to do with this preselection and see how you can be friends with women and just certain men can be able to do that, you know? So, it kind of goes back to those things, but just a wide range of six or seven different things. There's some topics I've just never heard you... I've watched every single show that you do. There's not one thing that I miss. I watch all of your shows. So, I'd like to think I know everything about you. So, these questions are things that I have not learned about you yet. But for the most part, like I said before... Let's see if I can educate you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. For the most part, like I said, I agree with you on 90% of things. Like, literally, I would not have a show if it wasn't for you. Everything that I teach, everything that I do, I wouldn't be able to do without you. So, at the end of the day, you know, it's not that much of a difference. It's very minuscule. Hey, turn the gain on the mic all the way up. Yeah, I have it all the way up. Okay, they're still saying it's not loud enough. I'll talk from my diaphragm more, guys. My bad. Say it with your chest. Yeah, I'll say it with my chest. Sorry, y'all. But no, just to start off, like the first thing is obviously the biggest thing that I do on my show is I teach women. I have a feeling that a lot of people in the Red Pill space like to gate-keep Red Pill from women. So, I want to know what your opinion was on the gate-keeping of Red Pill to just men and if you think that Red Pill is good for men and women. Yeah, well, I've already said this. I've been on several podcasts and I've actually written essays on this. People have asked me this. I get this from, like, a lot of people who are part of, like, say, Robert Kiyosaki's algorithm. And so, the women who have a problem with me, they're usually coming at me from a position of ignorance. But the first thing that they ask me is, how come you don't have a rational female? How come you don't have the female equivalent of the Red Pill? How come you don't have the Pink Pill? How come you don't have something like that? And my answer is always the same. It's read the rational male. You will learn more about human nature. You'll learn more about your own nature. And the problem is, is that when you are explaining unflattering truths to women, when it comes to objective empirical stats, when you're relating that to women, women don't want to hear that. It doesn't taste good. So, primarily, when we talk about how women tend to be, like, I hate this right now because people will say that women are more emotional than men or men are more, like, more rational than women. But the fact of the matter is, is that it's not a 50-50 thing. It's not a blank slate. So, women tend to prioritize emotion before they prioritize reason. Men tend to prioritize reason before they prioritize emotion. Now, people will say, well, I know some guy and he's such a pussy. And I know some guy and he just flies off the handle and he's emotional. He gets angry and he gets crazy or whatever. I can't believe it. The rational male, like, that's what they'll say, right? And then, when I'm in the midst of those conversations, I have to say, look, you're still subscribing to something like a blank slate ideology, well, really it is an ideology, but a mentality of the blank slate. And so, when people say, Rolo, how come you don't do anything for women? How come the red pill's not for women? How come it's not the rational female? Because if you write the rational male, therefore you are required by law, you're obligated to balance things out in the force and do your next book the rational female. And you know what? If I was out for a lot of money, I probably would have done that by now because so many people have asked me for that. But what happens is, when you put women into the mix, whenever you bring women into the red pill, and trust me, I've been doing this for 20 some odd years, in every single instance, women are on board with it, they love it, so long as it's a sandbox that they can play in. It's like gamer girls. When gamer girls want to go into the game stores, they want to go and play these games. Like, hey, can girls play too? And the question isn't about whether they can play or not, it's like, why am I obligated as a guy to balance things out for women? I get this all the time when I'm on Access Vegas or I'm doing a crushing fit or I'm doing something else, is it's always, what's good for the goose is good for the gander. So if you go and you say something that is an unflattering truth about women, you have to, in a gynocentric social order, you have to explain something that is bad for men too. So if it's bad for women, well, ooh, ooh, men do it too, and they're worse, and let me tell you why, and how come you don't talk about that? And the reason why I don't get into female issues specifically is because I am talking about one sex at that time. I am not trying to balance the force. I'm not trying to say, well, it's okay, we're all going to go away from this conversation and we're going to have a good taste in our mouth at the end of it. Because when you deliver information of any kind, not even just this, any kind, you have to tell people how to feel about it. Because if you don't tell them how to feel about it, they will insert their own feelings into that. So what happens is you get these women who will come into the Red Pill space or they'll want the rational female or something, and then after a while, they start to sanitize it. They water it down, they sugar it up. And you're talking about the speakers. More or less, yeah. But the... Not the women that are base women, like normal women. Well, what's a normal woman? That's the other question. I get that question. Well, I just mean NPCs. Just like all the... Obviously, we'll say Pearl is somebody that talks about this stuff, but she's an influencer. But I'm saying like normal women, okay? Because I agree with you. The way I see it is there's a huge issue with just words today. We have the manosphere, but we don't talk a femosphere. Where I think that there's a manosphere. I've actually used that term before. I just don't hear it a lot, though. And the thing, I would say Pearl is a part of the femosphere. She doesn't... She has said multiple times on our show. Pearl is part of the hackosphere, is what she says. Yeah, but the thing is, she's trying to give women advice now. So I'd say anybody that's trying to give men advice is in the manosphere. Anybody that's trying to give women advice is in the femosphere, but she's also entertainment, which is... Pearl is not just trying to give women advice. She's trying to pretend that she is an authority on things that she is in no way ever going to be an authority on. And is trying to really... I mean, hell, I just saw her twice on Pierce Morgan, and they list her as the female Andrew Tate. Who is she giving advice to, if that's how they're building it? I don't see her as an authority. I still see her, though, as an... She says all the time, I'm an entertainer, and I believe that. She is an entertainer. That's full entertainment, but she started the women thing. She started the wifey thing, the wife school, and that's because she wants to help women. Is she still a woman? From what I know, she is. But is there... Are there classes? Are people getting together? Are they actually doing something? So she's not teaching people how to cook. She has a woman who's a cook, who's a really good cook, who's a wife, teach the class on how to cook. Great. You see what I'm saying? So it's called wife school. It's called outsourcing, is what it is. Yeah, yeah. Awesome. Yeah, but the biggest thing is, I just want to take away from it, though, is that... She got some cheap labor from Nigeria. I'm sorry. I'm not supposed to say that. All I said we do, we just got canceled off the show. No, but the... Nigerian food. The biggest thing, though, is just like, Red Pill is this, and then Manosphere is this, and then Femosphere is this. And to me, Red Pill, because it's just the truth, because Red Pill is just the truth of reality, that should be for men. Like, can it not be for men and women? Can we not... Now, don't get me wrong. We have complete... I teach this on my show all the time. We have two completely different dating strategies, but why can't they learn the Red Pill also? They do. They should. Buy a book. Read it. Learn it. So why do I have to make a specific product to cater to women if... I don't want you to. I don't want you to do that. I'm not saying that. My obligation is to object to truth and empirical data. If that's the way it is, and God knows I've written, well, the fourth book, The Blank Slate. If I'm going to say The Blank Slate is bullshit, if I'm going to say The Ghost in the Machine is bullshit, if I'm going to say The Naturalistic Fallacy is bullshit, and then I'm still expected to play along with people who subscribe to those mentalities by writing a book to cater to them, really, what does that make me? Does that make me a hack? Does that make me somebody who's pandering to their... I don't think you need to write a book. I think what you may be saying is that there is this different reality from a female's point of view, and he's saying there isn't. It's just one reality. Does that make sense? No, no, no. It is one reality, and what I'm saying is they can... What I think is in Red Pill, the men can benefit a lot from Red Pill knowledge. The reason why we teach men Red Pill is because their life can get better, and all I'm simply saying is if I teach women Red Pill, their life can get better, too. Now we understand on a general basis they're more emotional, so they're not going to accept it. I understand my percentage of women that actually take it in is going to be very low. We're talking maybe 5% to 10%, but I don't care about those numbers. Just like how on Fresh N' Fit, there's still a ton of incels. There's still a ton of losers, dorks that watch that fucking show. If they have 20,000 people watching, there might be 50% to 75% that are fucking losers, and only some of them are getting their life good, going to the gym, making money, doing all that type of shit. I don't think I'm going to change every woman, just like how Fresh N' Fit's not going to change every man. It's the whole point of just trying to change a woman, or just trying to teach them Red Pill. I get shamed for this like crazy, and I know why, because if girls listen to what I say, and I tell them to keep their lights closed and shit, that's going to make it to where these guys that watch all the Red Pill shit will get even less pussy than they're already getting if they're incel. I understand why they all fucking hate me. I understand why all Red Pill guys fucking hate me, because if women learn these facts too, it fucks the game up, just like how a guy learning game and Red Pill, he's able to take advantage of certain women if he feels like. If he so chose to use the tool belt like that, and the women, they're scared of women being able to do this. Even a long time ago, you said, you were on your stream, you were like, I like what Sergio's doing, he's undervalued, or you said something along those terms, and it's just like, I want to know, you go on a lot of shows to help the men, help men, help men, go on Fresh N' Fit, because that's going to help blow them up, go on Sauce Cast, that's going to help blow them up and help men, go on whatever, that's going to help blow them up and help men at the end of the day. I want you to come on my show, because I want you to help me help women. And I see that your words and everything in your book, everything Dr. David Buss, all these other people talk about, Marty Hazleton, these women need to hear these things. I need to tell these women, go read Marty Hazleton's book so you can understand your hormones. There's nothing wrong with somebody pushing this, but I get tons of shame for it. And I'm not saying that it's you, I'm not saying it's Michael, but it's the whole community that we represent. You mean shame for trying to teach women? Yes, a lot of people do not want a guy teaching women this stuff. No, so the thing is, I don't think it's, maybe it's not shame for trying to teach women, it's almost like trying to teach, like, wow, I was about to say something, get me in fucking deep trouble. You're trying to program, you know, you're trying to, like, they don't accept the programming language. Like, you're trying to put one kind of programming language into a machine that doesn't accept the programming language. But what if 10% accept it? Because I just don't, like, if 10%, if 10%, if 10% accept it, then the issue would be this. Fresh and Fit would have a reunion show every six months of all the girls who've changed their lives. Well, they don't care about, it's all about how you say the things, like, it's all about how you say it. And if I can say it to where I have a way better percentage return, because I've watched their show, and I know they're girls that really love the show and go on there all the time. Some of them have cried. Fucking shout out to Xena. Like, some girls have literally gone on that show and like, been like, y'all really changed my life. Yeah, have another meltdown. That's some great content, Xena. But like, the thing is, like, basically when I saw that, I was like, man, that is an example of exactly all that I do. Everything that I do is to try to do what happened to Xena and try to help them. And the reason why I do all this, Rolo, is because at the end of the day, we're trying to help men. And if we help women, it also helps men too. Let me touch on a couple of points that you said here. So one is, you want to help women. First thing is, you have to understand that, listen, my wheelhouse, my direct mission is not to help men. It is to help men with the tools so that they can make themselves better men, okay? So what I do, and whenever I do this, and I know I get myself into a lot of trouble for saying this, but when I start the introductions of my books all the time, I'm not in the business of helping men become better men. I'm in the business of equipping men so that they can become better men or use those tools however they see fit, okay? That's why people hate me so much, because I don't give them prescriptions. I don't give them 12 rules for life. I don't give them some easy-to-follow, step-by-step guide to go from being a shit-stained zero to an alpha chat at a 10, right? I don't do that because that's disingenuous. So if anybody is selling you on some sort of template for a successful life, tell them to go fuck themselves. That's number one. And I've heard you say this a hundred times, man. So that's number one. Number two is this, is that in telling people objective facts and objective data, just by doing that, people think that because you're saying the things that you are, that you're trying to convince them to be something, to do something. You cannot go, I'm just doing this show right now. Everyone will say, you're an influencer. You have a responsibility. You should be telling these guys the things that fit into my ideological post office box here. Because if you're not, then you're part of the enemy. Now we go from being objective truth to being moralistic truth, to being ideological, to being philosophical. And that's why every time I correct these sons of bitches when they say, well, the red pill philosophy is X. The red pill ideology is this. These guys believe this. And every time I hear that on any show that I'm on, I stop them dead in their tracks. I go, let's just stop right now. Because the only way that people who have a believer's mindset can interpret data is through the filter of their beliefs. So remember what I said about how you can't tell people just straight up raw data without telling them how to feel about that data? These are people who are going to say that you're telling me this raw data. You're giving me these facts, this empirical knowledge, because you want me to think in a certain way. You want me to behave in a certain way. You want to tell me, just by presenting that information, that is now an emotional appeal to them because they don't know how else to interpret it. So that's the way it works. Oh, wow. There's a fresh one on the wall. But no, so there's the prescription. We always talk about... Well, before... Let me finish this up real quickly here. So you also said something else, and maybe this is what you're going to get to. When you're saying, I want to help women, what that is is that's giving them a prescription. If it's based on the stuff that we've been talking about... If it's based off the science, then it's on prescription, right? Well, no, it's not necessarily... No, it is a prescription. If I were to do the same thing, and I were to say, okay, well, here's what happens in our ancestral past 100,000 years ago. This is why the machine hasn't changed, yada, yada, yada. Just by saying that, it sounds like I'm giving a prescription. My intent is not to give people a prescription because there's no paint-by-numbers for your life. Okay? It's a blank canvas, and you get to put whatever it is that you want on there. I'm going to provide you with the paints, and the paintbrushes, and the easel, and all the tools that you need to paint the picture that is your life. But other people want to have a paint-by-number. So they want to have all these little lines drawn out, and you put yellow at number 12, and you put green at number 8, and you put red, and all this stuff. And at the end of it, you get this lovely picture of cherry blossoms or some shit, right? That you painted, but you didn't paint it. You just colored it in. You just filled it in. And so, I'm not the guy that's going to give you the fill it in. I'm not going to give you the paint-by-numbers. If that's what you need, if you're a sheep in search of a shepherd, there's plenty of shepherds out there. There's plenty of gurus who really want to turn a buck on it and sort of be your self-help. I mean, if you look at social media for women, social media for women right now is basically self-help. You want to know why it's the largest section in Barnes & Noble for, you know, if you're going to buy a book in psychology, the largest section is self-help. It's because everybody wants to have somebody tell them or give them permission to do the shit that they already want to fucking do. So that's number one. Now, number two is this, is when you do that, let's just say you're going to take a completely objective approach to telling women, here's how women's nature actually is. That is fucking offensive. I went on Dr. Phil and the one last parting shot that Robin McGraw, his wife, had to say was, I don't think anyone can know what women's real nature is. They're just this enigmatic mystery that and how dare any man try to presume that he could ever understand the fantastic force of the nature that is women's feminine mystique and any guy that's telling you that is just full of shit because we're all special snowflakes and everybody's different, right? So that right there, they got to get that parting shot in there because they have to clean up the mess that I've created when I went on that show by saying, here's women's nature. Here's how it is. And you guys don't have any counter argument to that except for an emotional appeal after that. And that's what you will run into when you try to create sort of this self-help program for women. Here's how you come and be a red pill woman, right? What you're going to run into eventually is you're going to speak some sort of unflattering truth about women's nature and initially, they'll accept it or they'll reject it out of hand depending on like how resistant they happen to be to it. But the problem is it comes back to why I always tell guys never to talk about the red "}
