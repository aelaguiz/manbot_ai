I mean, they've gone through, you know, they've matured into other sort of venues and stuff like that. Some of which I can sort of get behind some of them. I understand why people have a problem with them, but they're still friends still loyal still love them like brothers. So the long and the short of it is is that we're getting the point where they're so popular right now, or they're so well known and Myron's personality is so well known that they want a piece of Myron. And I'm sorry fresh. They could give two shits about fresh fresh is good cop. Myron's bad cop. So they always want a piece of bad cop and and so we're always running sort of it's almost like whenever we have a girl who's been on one of those shows they have to come back and let go. I want to tell you what I couldn't say when I was on there with Myron and fresh and here's what that guy's an asshole. Yeah. Yeah, that's kind of how the show runs. So now it's like it's okay. So is Myron in the room? Is he with us now? No, he's not. But so anyways, Jesse Preston was once and again, I got nothing against Jesse. I love her like a sister. She's really great. We've had her on the show. God knows how many times but she is a very let's just say dominant personality. I think that's probably the nicest way to put it and I think I don't know if it's happening right now, but I do know that Torsha is going to be doing a show from Red One Studios of a Southern Command Center in Las Vegas. She'll be using our studio in Vegas and I believe she's going to have Jesse on and she might have Kylie. Mike's Kylie McGaha McGaha McGaha. I don't know how to pronounce your last name Kylie. Sorry, but Mike's girlfriend Kylie. So we'll be on there. I don't know when they're going to get underway. I do know that they're supposed to be doing something today. Hopefully she's up. Hopefully Tori you've scheduled it after this show. But anyways, would you like me to I'll be happy. You know, it's funny. I'll tell you something. You want to know something town drunk. I was actually considering that this show because five minutes before I was about to go on like I oh, I should also explain something to you guys. I the show still technically starts at one o'clock Pacific 4 p.m. Eastern. However, I've been pushing it five minutes out and the reason for that is because the new YouTube rules, I guess for advertising is they will start even live streams. They'll start with like a like a one minute a one minute ad or maybe like one minute ad and then one skippable ad. I don't know exactly how it works, but so I've been pushing it out five minutes just to sort of compensate for that. So people don't like come in and they go. Well, I got to get now. We got to rewind and go back to where Rolo started the show. So I'm kind of trying to compensate for that. So I'm probably not doing a good job of it, but that's why I put the timer and like the one minute timer before the show and that's also why I've been pushing things out. Just so you guys know what I'm doing here. So Torsh has gone rogue. Do you think she's gone rogue? I don't think she's gone rogue. I think Tori is following exactly the same progression that every red pill girl, every red pill woman, every woman who wants to get in the red pill space and go, you know what? I got something to contribute to the Manosphere and they do for about a year, maybe 18 months, maybe two years. So Tori is a different animal, I think, but I think she's getting to the, I remember Tori and I love Tori, like again, like a sister, like a sister wife. But the thing about Tori is this, is that she's been the one consistent, she's been consistent in that. She will like look up my old material. She's read all five of my books, which is more than I can say for a lot of the guys that I still work with today. She will go through my catalog of essays that aren't even in any books and she'll hit me up occasionally from time to time and have questions about like some like really obscure essay I wrote back in like 2014 or something. So her interest is definitely there. So when people say, well, Rola, why do you even bother with this 304? I'm like, well, she's not 304. She's actually very, very intelligent. But the thing is, and this is just the way I've seen this progress. And by the way, Pearl's probably about four months, maybe three months away from the same thing. But what happens is women will get into the red pill space and then they will realize that they can't keep up with it. And then they'll start to get a bad taste in their mouth. And so like Allie, for example, for Real Femme Sapien, she was gung-ho. She was, I love Rolo. I love these guys. These are girls. I want to be, I think, you know what? We need a woman's perspective in the red pill space. We need a woman's perspective in the manosphere. No, no, we don't. That's actually kind of the whole reason. That's kind of the whole, the whole shtick. I guess. But you know, again, sometimes occasionally somebody will come in. So some female will come in, a woman will come in and maybe have a different take. Maybe I have a different spin, but it doesn't really last that long. And usually what happens is then they start going and say, you know what? Men, men are pigs, men are dogs. They'll go right back to where they were before. And usually that happens when they hit the epiphany phase when they hit about 29, 28, 29. Or they have a kid or something changes in their lives. By the way, the best thing, like I love it when my haters, my longtime haters suddenly get married and suddenly have children. Great because I know bye-bye. See ya so long sucker because usually that's either they don't realize. I think what's funny is like a lot of the people who get into sort of like the trad conosphere or they think that oh, yeah, you know what? We need to have more babies. We need to up the fertility rates and we need to, you know, homeschool our kids and go to Orthodox Christian churches and what you know, they're very big on that and then they put their money where their mouth is and they actually do that and then they find that they can no longer actually keep up in this space anymore. I'm fortunate in that. I came into it when I did. I was a father when I did I was already married when I did and so therefore it's like I'm I got nothing but you know, clear road ahead of me, but a lot of people don't realize the amount of responsibility and accountability and liability and whatever ability that goes into being a father and being a husband and paying the bills and keeping the lights on and keeping the baby fed and the dogs fed and everything else that goes along with it. So, you know, hey, I'm you want to if you want that lifestyle, I highly encourage it. Please do because especially if you're one of my longtime haters, I'm glad you've decided to sort of settle down with the little lady. Absolutely, and I will I will I'll be the first one to send you a wedding present. I'll go to the baby shower and give you some give you give you the what the diaper genie. I'll give you a diaper genie for your baby shower, please. Bye. See you later. But anyways, so anyway, the conversation on access Vegas at one point we got into narcissism, which I thought was interesting because I had already hit on narcissism on Jamie Lynn, which by the way, I used one of Jamie Lynn's clips in this in this today's episode, but it was about narcissism. And then I remember I recall that was it a Mike had talked about, you know, hey, if women really hated narcissists as much as they say they do all they got to do is stop fucking narcissists. That's all they got to do. Stop rewarding narcissists. Well, you don't know they're narcissists until you start living with them and they moved in in their six or eight months. It was like something tells me that the signs were already there, but you just didn't want to see them because the dick was that good or it could be that women are actually attracted to dark triad personality traits and guys and one of those is narcissism. Was it Machiavellianism narcissism and psychopathy? That's that the end part of that is narcissism and women are very attracted to narcissistic men. You know why because they are more important. They are more self-important than women than they would make women important. Remember when I say that, you know, you probably heard me I've written this in several books. I've said this before as a women don't want a man to cheat, but they love a man who could cheat. That's the narcissistic guy. That's the guy who's like, you know, I could cheat if I wanted to but I love you. Okay. Well fine. It's it's a it's a value exchange and narcissism is valuable to women. Now our good friend Jordan Peterson will say well, that's only naive younger women. It's only it's only it's only women the age of like, oh, I don't know 23 when Michaela decided she was going to go but hang out with Andrew Tate in Romania. Would you say that Andrew is a narcissist? I don't know. I think so. Probably certainly has let's just say he has those cues. Would you say Andrew Tate is a let's see a dark triad personality I think probably a lot of people would say I'm sure that his haters would definitely say that but that is also those are every last one of those traits is an attraction cue for women. Don't believe me. Just go look at Fifty Shades of Grey. Why did Fifty Shades of Grey sell 65 million units from March of 20? I think it's 2012 until the end of that year and then it was the most downloaded trailer when the movie was being produced. I think it was 2014 came out after that and you got to remember that that Fifty Shades of Grey was a self-published book. It didn't go to Random House or Penguin or Harlequin Romances. It was self-published. You know what that means? I'll tell you what that means because I'm in the same business, right? You know what that means? That means that word of mouth actually made that book what it what it is not what it was then certainly what it is now people have kind of followed up on that formula. But why because the main character had dark triad personality traits tender swindler dark triad personality traits and one of those is narcissism and that's where I'm going to start a kind of lead off with today. What is it that makes narcissists so attractive? So we talked about this on the show and one of the first things that was I think it's interesting is it's almost like a rationale if you had a bad relationship as a woman and you want to find some reason outside of yourself that things went sideways with that guy call him a narcissist. That's really all you have to do is call him a narcissist. Oh, I didn't realize he was until I told we were six months in or eight months in or a year in. No, you just seems like it is and I thought it was interesting because when I was looking at I'll replay the clip here in a second. But when when Jamie Lynn was talking about like, well, you know, just because a woman puts all these sexy pictures of herself up on Instagram that doesn't make her a narcissist and she is correct. Everybody wants attention and that's what I tried to explain during the show. At what point does attention-seeking crossover into actual narcissism into a personality disorder? Oh, geez. Thank you guy. There we go. Thank you very much. You get to go priority. Everybody hates it. You know, there's no way I'm not going to keep doing that on access. Big I'm not blackmail, but I have to say when girls say Myron is an asshole. What they're really saying is how dare he call me out and told me accountable and be uncompromising about it. Abso-fucking-lutely. Oh gosh. Thank you. And yeah, I didn't see the other one. Thank you. Oh, geez. Oh, holy Mary. Women hold hold men at two uncompromising standards when there are total cons. You can say con. Can you not write that about it? When they do Myron is just throwing it back at them. Women can dish it out, but they can't but they can't take it. No. No, they can't actually. Thank you for those those very expensive super chats. I have much appreciated all will go to Ned's medical fund. I'll quick update on Ned in a moment. But yeah, just to sort of follow up on that. I I got I got called out about my sort of friendship with Myron when I was on what was her? I said dumb bitches name Lana's show laughing with Lana. And this is a this is like probably two months ago three months ago. Of course, it's just basically there for you know, buzz clips. I understand. I understand the marketing appeal. I don't want to have anything to do with her anymore. But the the beginning of that conversation was well, what do you like Myron so much? I'm like well because he's because of exactly what you said he's uncompromising and people think that Myron is an asshole. And I understand why people get that impression of him, especially people who like there's there's two there's really three kinds, but there's really two kinds of people who call Myron an asshole. The first one is the girls who just like can't believe that a guy is looking them dead ass in the eye with no without blinking and saying here's why you're you are the way you are and here's why God here's why things are going to be really tough for you in the future because you've decided these are the decisions that you've made and here's what the likely outcome of those decisions are and that's the problem that I think that a lot of women have is that they don't like to be judged and they think that when Myron is telling them statistically speaking if you keep doing what you're doing, this is going to be the consequences of your actions assuming anybody holds you to them, right? But these are this is the likely outcome single mothers. How come they hate single mothers so much? We don't hate single mother. I don't hate single mothers whatsoever. I don't have anything like judgmentally against them, but I will tell you that men have a natural innate proclivity to be hesitant. It's what's called sexual revulsion and women have a far greater threshold for sexual revulsion than guys do obviously, but there's a reason why we're I don't to my knowledge. I don't think that I'm thinking about Rich Cooper, but maybe Rich Cooper said something like this, but to my knowledge, I don't think anybody in the sphere has said hey, you know, don't don't bang single mothers. In fact, a lot of guys are saying hey, please do go ahead go for it. Don't marry them. Don't invest in them in the long term. But if you want to have one in rotation by all means, but it's not a that doesn't come from a place of hatred. It doesn't come from a place of of, you know, oh these girls wouldn't fuck you before when you were in high school and now they will and now you just you know, suddenly you won't be, you know compromising anymore. And the fact of the matter is it has nothing to do with that. I told you the story about the single."}
