Live studio audience. No. That's incredible. Not quite. No, we do not have a live studio audience. Thank you guys. This is my favorite day of the week. We come out here. We've done four weeks in a row. We've done four weeks off. Yeah. But we are excited to have you guys all here for Access Vegas. I'm going to go ahead and introduce our guest this week. This is, she is from Miami. She's a high ticket sales. She's a salesperson. She's also a social commentary and debates on her channel. This is Miss Amy Dangerfield. You already have fans in the live chat, Amy. You already have fans waiting for you. She is an adult actress from Miami. What did you say? A mattress actress? Mattress actress. What does that mean? I don't understand what that means. She's Tiffany Fox. Yeah. Adult. Adult. You mean like you don't do kids stories. I don't understand what adult means. I don't tell kids stories, no. You don't? Okay. That's nice. All right. There we go. And then also she is a bartender, a model, a singer. And I mean, can I mention the fact that you escaped a fucking cult when you were growing up? Okay, go ahead. This is Miss Rose Fisher. How you doing, Rose? Fantastic. She is a fashion model, a real estate enthusiast from Tampa, Florida. She's also a swimsuit USA world finalist, Miss Maya Allegra. How you doing, Maya? Finalist. There you go. Finalist. And she is Miss Australia. I just found this out just a couple of minutes ago. She's a personal trainer, a model, and an aspiring actor. This is Miss Gemma Antonious. Gemma, you should do Swimsuit USA. Actually, Amy, you should do Swimsuit USA also. Actually, Rose, you should do Swimsuit USA 100%. I just got off the phone with the CEO of Swimsuit USA. She is a model, an influencer, and she's designing her own gym line. This is Steffi Louise. How you doing, Steffi? What's going on there? She's also Nick Fuentes' best friend, apparently, from what I understand. It's already started. Yes. He is the hip-hop illusionist, and he has one of the coolest podcast studios that also looks like an OnlyFans recording studio. Yes. That's right. It is Jibrizy. It's where I'm doing my feet porn right now. Yeah, it's exactly that. Selling pictures of my feet. That was a crazy thing. From your suit. Let's interview, then have sex on OnlyFans. Her name is spelled anal, but it's spelled anal. It's spelled anal, but it's spelled anal. It's spelled anal, but it's spelled anal. It's spelled anal, but it's spelled anal. It's spelled anal, but it's spelled anal. It's spelled anal, but it's spelled anal. Shout out to Jedediah Bila. We miss her. Where's Jedediah? Anyway, did you have any opening things? First off, this is a little housekeeping. We had a gentleman who's going to be a guest. He's going to be a guest on at some future show. Yeah, we were going to have ... Sharp was supposed to show up today, but unfortunately he couldn't join us today, so he's got some other prior engagements. We will have Sharp from No Jumper Podcast. He's coming back on the 10th of August, at least. That's our tentative date for him, so he will be coming back. He had to bug out, but we got Jibrizy on tap, so he showed up at the right time. I just told you to come and hang out. Look, I'm here to kick it, man, whatever, but if y'all need me to yell at the girls, I can do that. This is a regular thing I do every day, so yeah. So that's the story with Sharp right now, and yes, I'm still wondering where the interview I did with Flacco is now a month later, but I'm sure it'll be around sooner or later. Damn. Are you out for a whole month? No, no. I went to No Jumper the end of June, the beginning of July, and then, of course, Adam22 had his, well, let's just say his marketing efforts began right about that time. So yeah, I don't know when. People keep asking me. Wait, what are Adam22's marketing efforts? What do you mean by that? What on earth could those be? I'm going to say this one more time, one more time. Before a large African-American man had sex with his wife, do you think Elon Musk knew who he was? Probably not. I guarantee you Elon Musk knows who he is now. He knows now. In fact, he's the most trending person on Twitter. So again, I'm going to ask this to all the guys in the chat. You are married to a woman. In exchange for her having sex with one guy, you get to have 300 threesomes with other women and get paid $5 million. Would you take that trade-off? No. Put a one in the chat if you would take the trade-off. Put a two in the chat if you would not take the trade-off, all right? That's a different way to look at it. You understand what I'm saying? Also, you're probably the most famous dude on the internet right now, but your middle name is now Cuck. So that's the bar. You're the most famous guy. I tell you, I've been noticing all these memes lately about how do you get clout, right? Well, you whore your wife out, apparently. That's how it works. So if it's not Destiny or Sneako or friggin' Adam22, I mean, they all got one thing in common, right? That was lower than a low blow. Below the belt. I'm not the one that made the meme. I just work here, man. I'm genuinely wondering why is it that so many guys are just coming out as Cucks? Is it just me or is it becoming an increasingly more of a trend? We got into that last week as like, where are we going with marriage? We could talk about that a little bit today, too. We got some other things on the tab, but yeah, honestly, I think it's sort of like how we're redefining marriage at this point and just like, we're still- Yeah, the way to redefine marriage is like, introduce a big black guy to the fucking marriage. That's like the whole marriage. It's modern marriage, right? Like the whole fucking marriage. Modern day marriage. The chat is all on two. They all say two, and I'm with you. I would say two also. The point is, one of the things, I wanted to see it from both sides, and I can't see it from both sides. I just can't. I just don't. I told you up until the very end. I thought it was a joke. I legitimately thought that that video was going to come out on our OnlyFans, and people were going to subscribe, and it was like, gotcha, bitch, and it was just the two of them sitting on the bed with fucking Jason Love, be like, ain't nobody touching my wife. That's what I thought was going to happen. Gotcha, bitch. That's what I thought was going to happen. But that is not what happened, so they went through with it, and specifically went through Lana, Lena, the plug. What's interesting is the stuff that's happening in the aftermath, and I know we have a few people here on the panel who have been in the business. We had Domo on here last week. I was going to say, you're making eye contact with me. I know. Okay. Well, we will go around the table and find out who has OnlyFans and who does not. Oh, God. Okay. How many? I guess I think it's about 80% of the girls here. 80%? No, no. Actually, we- You want to guess? We can guess. About 50% or less. 50% or less? Yeah. Is that average for the show? So here's the reason why, Jibrizy. We have a lot of girls here, and it's just not viable when you're making $240,000 a year as a cocktail server to also do OnlyFans, so a lot of girls here don't do OnlyFans. I'm telling you. I promise you. Now, some of them do. I could have sworn I read some articles where a dentist even started OnlyFans. Oh, for sure. I read an essay that in Miami, that is the OnlyFans capital of, well, certainly the United States if not the world. They broke it down by percentage of the population in the Miami area right there, and apparently it's like one in eight people on OnlyFans in Miami. Hilarious. Wow. That's hilarious. Wow. You know what? Let me ask. Sam Bhatta, if you can find that article for me, I'll read it on air, but it was recently what the percentage of OnlyFans creators are, and the highest concentration in the United States is in Miami right now. You know, I want to say something real quick. I always thought this was crazy. All right. Miami. Uh-huh. Miami is predominantly like a Hispanic culture, right? Latin culture. Yeah. Yeah. Right? And then you got the passport bros, and they always want to go to like Colombia or Brazil. Right. I know. Why don't they go to Miami? Right? And I'll be sitting here, bro, I grew up around like straight Latinas and everything, bro. Every single one of them, because I come from Chicago, right? I was in like the suburb part, and what's nuts is that is the most overly sexualized culture on the face. It's about Latin American girls. Latin culture. Yeah, bro. It's like, it's never like competing with the US. All right. Look to your left. What's there? Oh, is she? What is she? What would you call it? Respect me, by the way. What I'm saying is this. I know where she at. What is she? I am Puerto Rican and Mexican. Oh, okay. Great. I'm also human. Why'd y'all put me next to a person that's going to cut me? What I'm saying is this, right? It's nuts because I'm like- It also doubles up as a knife. Damn. Respect somebody. She grabbed that bogus ass lipstick. Anyway. But anyway. What's up? What's up? What's up? What's up? What's up? What's up? What's up? What's up? What's up? What's up? All right. You know what's up? Everything. Any way. What I'm saying is this, okay? It's nuts because Miami is literally the easiest place to get laid. I promise you. You think so? Yes. Yes. Do you think it's the easiest place to get laid? I don't- I don't- Bro, it's the easiest place to get laid. I really don't go outside that much. I think she's- No audio. Stay indoors. Guys. No audio on Amy. Yeah. I heard that. No microphone. Bring her back up. Bring her back up. Yeah. It's so funny because I always saw Miami as being the business capital. That's where a lot of people who are in- The business for selling pussy. I mean, I just thought that there were a lot of entrepreneurs there. There are a lot of people who are in finance, right? Brickle is the financial district. That was my perception of it when I moved there. Come to find out that now everyone's perception is it's just- We have a lot of people from Florida here. You're there. I know Tiffany's from there. You're a Floridian. Well, actually, I'm originally from Los Angeles. Well, I know. But you live in Miami. I live in Miami. Yeah. I'll convene you for work, right? So I would argue that you're saying the easiest place to get laid. I would argue that Austin, Texas is easier. Nashville, Tennessee is easier. I would argue that Las Vegas is easier and that Scottsdale is easier. No. Miami is really easy. Scottsdale made the list. Go to Brickle. Go to Brickle. No, no. I'm not saying it's not easy in Brickle. It's very easy in Brickle. It's easy. But my point is that it's a bit more transactional there than any of the cities that I just named. The difference between here and there is that we have pretty girls that come visit here with the express intent of cheating on their boyfriend. You don't do that in Brickle. We have 44- What are you talking about? Girls don't cheat on their boyfriends in Miami. No, no, no. I'm not saying that. I'm saying we have 44 million visitors every year. There's more people who visit the city than Paris and Dubai combined. It's like a revolving door. Yes. That's what I'm saying. And so because of that, it's a little bit different here. I'm not saying it's not easy in Brickle. Obviously it is. But we also don't have the situation where you're talking to a girl and she's going to go out with you, but she left you because the dude had the yacht. We don't have the yacht thing here. You know what I'm saying? That's also an issue. We do have the table thing. That is kind of a big deal. Here's like the momentary horror though. You know what I mean? Like Miami's where the whores are. Okay. Like that's where they go. That's where they want to live. Like when they want to go whore out, like they go to Miami. It's pretty easy to be a whore in Miami. That's crazy that that's really the full-blown perception. I'm like, I thought they would come here. I would have assumed Vegas as well. The whores are in Vegas. I would have assumed Vegas more so. Bro, they advertise them on the trucks here. What? Are you saying Miami is where the whores are? They drive them on trucks out here. I know. And there's the what happens in Vegas. Hot babes to your door. No. You know what I'm saying? You have business cards here. I know. So are you selling pussy or just getting it? Yeah, but see. I'm saying getting it. But prostitution is legal in Vegas too. No, it's not. Oh, no, it's what? No, it's legal in Nevada. In Nevada. In Nevada. Sorry, I'm thinking like, I'm thinking up now. I'm thinking that the moonlight wedding. Stripping is legal. Up where I live in Nevada, it's legal. Bro, but like when you think about, okay, a chick who comes from the south, and she's like, I'm going to get her. She's like, I'm going to get her. She's like, I'm going to get her. She's like, I'm going to get her. She's like, I'm going to get her. the passport for the passport. Bros. Yeah. Those guys are looking for women who don't have the traditional idea of what American women, the mindset of American women. I would contend that some of them are and most of them just want cheap sex. I think most of them are going there. Because here's what happens. So you have an arbitrage situation where you have a guy who is like middle class in the United States, but in Venezuela or Colombia, he's like upper, upper, upper middle class. He's in the top 1% of wage earners. He goes down there and he's having sex with the top 1% of like most physically attractive women in that country. But he's paying for it less than he would pay in Las Vegas. To me, that's what passport. I know a lot of passport bros about to get angry at me, but that's what passport bros are to me. According to the study, Miami has the most OnlyFans creators per capita of any large city in the nation with 1,110 accounts per 100,000 residents. I'll bet you Los Angeles County has more, but Los Angeles County also has 18 million people. Yeah. I was going to say per capita. Yeah. I have a friend who, I don't think he's like, I mean, incredibly hot and everything is nice, but he went to Russia, found a wife. She's gorgeous, like super hot girl. But he was in Russia. He was like a baller. He was like top of the top. Oh, I also have to point this out. Las Vegas came in second place with 670 OnlyFans creators per capita. No, no. Don't shame my city. Who didn't know that? Who didn't know those things? That is not shame to our city. That is proud. That's proud? Entrepreneurs? Yes. Proud of us ladies. I think they migrated from Los Angeles to here because of the condom law passed in Los Angeles. Wait, you said condom law? It's the condom law. And also there was a law passed where everyone had to become incorporated. What's a condom law? First of all, what's a condom? I have never heard. Okay. You know what a condom is, right? You know what a law is, right? Okay. Break it down. It's a condom law. It's a condom law. Meaning you have to put a jimmy hat on before you stick it in her poo pot. Yeah, tarp your load. Wait, wait. I'm sorry. Hold on. You need to provide context. She's talking about porn. She's talking about porn. In California, there were certain instances. They never passed that law, by the way. I don't believe. Yes, they did. They passed it, but no one follows it. Okay. The law specifically was in order. You're going to bust it. The first amendment allowed you to create pornography because it was freedom of expression. So if it wasn't, then it would be freedom of expression. Okay. The first amendment was allowed you to create pornography because it was freedom of expression. Even though, so if it wasn't, then it would be prostitution. So instead they said, well, you can continue to film pornography, but our state law is going to indicate, it's going to require you to use a condom every time you have sex on camera. And so a bunch of people started moving to Vegas because Nevada does not have the same condom law. Oh shit. That's crazy. I did not know that was a thing. Oh my God. And then also- I just thought it didn't get passed. I didn't even know why they would do that. Every performer had to get incorporated in California and not like they had to go by an LLC or a C-corp or an S-corp. doesn't actually have that law for performers to do that so that's another reason why a lot of performers migrated to Nevada and Florida. Wow okay that's why things got so bad. And Nevada has no state tax. California is like 16 or 17 percent or something. I think it's 13 percent but yeah something like that. Something like that. I don't know. Florida doesn't either. Yeah. Florida has no state tax so that's why we're going to Florida and Nevada. All right guys you guys ready to film porn in Nevada? No. No. Definitely not. Number one places to be in the U.S. Florida. More work for me I'll take it. More work for me. Awesome. What do you think about all this stuff? Um well we just recently visited Miami. It was my first time in Miami and I would have to agree it's a lot of older men on yachts and sugar babies and I think that was kind of my impression of Miami. Yeah. Unless you're a sugar baby. Hey they come from Australia. Yeah. You know what's nuts? What? Every black dude knows this. Australian girls love black dudes bro. Like they love black dudes. Yeah. Bro I swear to God like when I first got out to Vegas like for the first time I can't say how many Australian girls I smashed. Bro like that shit was nuts. Like it made me want to go to Australia. I haven't been there yet. Is this true? Can you confirm this? Well here's the thing. Stop. I said yes or no. Don't do the yes or no. Yes or no. Can you confirm this? Yes. Thank you. Okay great. You can confirm this? Yes. Thank you. To all the black guys watching I just helped y'all go to Australia. I've personally never been with a black guy however. Wow that sucks. However. So my roommate. I had two American roommates in Australia actually. One of them was from East Lansing, Michigan. His name was Jamal. Black guy. That's the blackest guy I've met in my life. When I first heard him on the phone. Because it was before I met him in person. I'm like your voice is so cool. It's literally like the movies. We don't have anyone who sound like you out there. Say movies again. Movies. Movies. My accent's a little weird because I've been here for like five years. So it's kind of like a blend of both accents. I think you sound still very Australian. Thank you. The Australians disagree and they actually get mad for how my accent's kind of morphed. Wait. Hold on. Wait. Question. Question. Did Adam 22's wife inspire you to go with a black guy? What? God damn it. God damn it. You're working it. You're working on it. Jibrizy has them all written down. Snocking them down. You're not missing out on much money. I know you're. One guy in the chat says Amy Dangerfield literally saved my family from chapter 13 bankruptcy. Oh what does that mean? I don't know. Oh cute. I don't know what that means but that's pretty funny. Alright interesting. Alright so did you have any topics you wanted to go over? Well I mean we can go over some of the other ones we didn't get to on the last show. I wanted to just go back to the Margot Robey thing. Okay. Because now the Barbie movie is out. So reset for those of you who don't know. Margot Robey was picked specifically because she's older. And now I mean Margot Robey we think of her in Wolf of Wall Street. That was ten years ago. And so she doesn't look quite the same. She's still very pretty. But she doesn't look the same anymore. And they specifically picked her because she's not as attractive as she used to be. And that didn't alienate. They picked her specifically because if she was that attractive that that would alienate a certain group of female audience members if she's too hot. Do you guys remember Bella from what's that Wolf the fucking vampire shit? What was that? Twilight? Twilight. Do you remember Bella from Twilight? Do you remember how incredibly plain she was? Like she was the most neutral looking plain looking. It was Kristen Stewart. Okay do you guys remember the True Blood? Do you remember the Snooki Stackhouse? Remember her and a penguin? She's just plain. I mean straight up five. And they weren't trying to do anything. It's so sad. But why are they doing that? Because they have a mostly female audience. And so you'll notice. You guys ever watch soap operas? The women are kind of average plain looking and the dudes are just outrageously good looking. And the reason why is because you have a female audience. Yeah they're trying to relate to the normal girl. You said Margot Robey? She's pretty. Is this her right here? You need a 2023 Margot Robey. I'm not saying she's not attractive. She's still very pretty. I don't think that's why they picked her. That's why they said they picked her. Well if you look at what the movie's about. It's about she's like everything in Barbie world. They take what little girls did when they played Barbie. You never use the elevator. You just put her in her car. You lie down the roof in the trailer for the movie. And what the movie's about is she's no longer experiencing these Barbie things. Like waking up perfect and stuff. And it's because I think. I don't know if the movie comes out tomorrow. But maybe because she's been in Barbie world so long. And also Barbie's a grown woman. She's a solid seven. We have Skipper. Wait you're talking about Barbie at her peak was a solid seven. I'm looking at her like just on this thing right here. 2003. If you look at what she looks like in the movie. Solid seven. Absolutely no one is. This is not a solid seven. Bruh like let's be honest. Like this is like two chick you meet like in the Midwest. She looks like Barbie. You know what's funny is that's what people are calling Margot Robey right now. They're just saying she's a mid. No. You know what a mid is? Oh like she's average. Look at this girl and tell me she's not gorgeous. Please could y'all stop showing me face app shit. That's what she actually looks like. If you watch her in Wolf of Wall Street she looks like that. Like ten years ago. Anyway the point is when we say mid like we don't literally mean mid. And I know it's fun to just like dunk on girls all day. But like the thing is go to Walmart. Then you'll see mid. Mid weighs 185 pounds and she's five foot three. That's what mid is. Oh in America. In America yes. My point is like the problem is like when we have women who are again are they perfect tens? No. But like when you see the incredible weight problem we have in this country. And then to call women like that. Margot Robey's not mid. That's ridiculous. Okay. She's. No. Okay. Right. Right. There we go man. Yeah. You're right bro. You're right. Well you guys are aware that the original casting selection for that was actually going to be Amy Schumer. Oh God. Oh so they were going to go even closer. She would have been funnier. She was the original choice and then she actually backed out because the movie was not feminist enough. Yeah. Oh fuck her. Yeah. Well thank God for that. She would have been hilarious. I would have loved that. I love Margot for that. I think she's fine. I think so. I think so. Yeah. Yeah. I mean compared to Amy Schumer. I mean damn. So let's. I mean. Isn't that great? I hate that this is even like a freaking topic. But the reason it's a topic is because the idea is that the movie theater or the movie producers are picking her on account of the fact that she's 33 years old and she's not 23 years old. So if you look at her in Wolf of Wall Street when she was on there with Leonardo DiCaprio. She's about 20 23 I believe is when she was doing that that role. At that age I'll be like oh hell yeah. Or Harley Quinn when she was in Suicide Squad. So when you when you look at her in those roles yeah. But the thing is is that there is a tendency in Hollywood for women to have like a sort of a shelf life. So if you look at men's acting men's careers it is a slow kind of an incline and then it kind of tapers off when they hit like 60 or 70 or like Sean Connery or something like that. When they start getting dementia. George Clooney. There are very few women that are the same age as George Clooney that have the same sex appeal as George Clooney. It's like an old ugly woman to make you mad on camera. That's why. Well to be fair that's when they turn into comedians. True. Betty White. Betty White. They look funny. They look funny. Geez man. Because men don't hit menopause. That's why they stay hot. I'm a comedian. So there's this idea that there's some sort of endemic sexism in Hollywood and therefore if we cast Margot Robey at 33 in the role of Barbie. What is Barbie? She's the quintessential like California girl with big giant titties. The perfect woman. In fact right up until recent times that was an insult amongst like feminists. Oh she's just a Barbie. She's fake. She's just plastic kind of thing. That was an insult. And then they made the plus size Barbies. Yeah well yeah then they started catering to. I've never seen a plus size Barbie. I've never seen one. They made fat Barbies. They made fat Barbies. Yes there are plus size Barbies. There's some curvy Barbies. They made disabled Barbies. I'm looking for plus size Barbies. She came in a wheelchair. Plus size Barbie. I'll guarantee you. You don't want to see plus size Barbie. Has any guy ever played with a fat action figure? Unless it's a villain. Unless it's like a villain. Like the blob or something like that. Yo plus size Barbie for real bro. This is crazy. But the thing is when you're a kid you're not thinking I wish my Barbie was fat. You just look at a doll. When I was a kid too like in my head Barbie was 30. She was a full grown adult. She wasn't a young 20 something. In my mind she was like an adult. I mean she has all these careers. You're not an astronaut. Exactly. You're not a doctor. But you have people like Lizzo saying big is beautiful. And you know promoting like eating Big Macs and like you know chicken sandwiches and being like 400 pounds. But unhealthy isn't good. It's not good. I'm not saying it is good. Your quality of life is going to be shit. But listen I'm saying people like Lizzo are promoting that so that's why they're bringing like fat Barbies in. Yeah. Oh and Victoria's Secret took a hit for keeping skinny girls. To the guys. Is it just me? And ladies chime in. Have you ever heard a man like explain his like him being like being fat is okay? This is only with women. No it's a great point. Are you kidding? Dad bod. Dad bod. Dad bod. Hold that thought. Hold that thought. Men do not call other men dad bod. Okay. That is a woman thing. Number one. But men call other men fat and then fat they get insecure and then they come to us over here like I don't look like you. I'm going to go to the gym. It's wrong. But that's the difference. That's not wrong. We'll just go to the gym. Ask a woman. Here's the thing. If I go to a man and I say publicly hey bro you put on some weight. You need to lose some weight. If I say this in public. In front of my home. Let's say I work in a corporate office. I'm like hey John you've been putting on some weight. You want to take some weight off. No one's going to chastise me for saying that. HR's not going to come after me. And you know what the thing is? John is probably going to be like yeah you know what I should go to the fucking gym. And he's going to go do that. He can take that criticism. If you do the same thing to a woman it's not going to go well. You will get fired. You will get fired. People are very sensitive. But additionally to that like for men we just take accountability for our actions. If a woman does something like for instance. We had a girl when I did Adam Lyons show. It was a girl and she was sitting there talking about egalitarianism. And I was like I don't want to talk about that. you can shame a man for being fat or for being short then honestly your preference is shameable as well. Is it not? I really be mad at like women sometimes. And I'll be like listening to them talk about their whole list of shit. Same. Y'all are crazy. And I'm going to say that. I'm going to say that with all seriousness. You're a little psycho. You're a little psycho. Listen. He'll give you a laundry list. The bitch will be like 5'1\". Requesting for you to be 6'3\". And she's 5'1\". And a little chubby. And then I'm like bitch I could work with you a little bit. You'd be a little chubby maybe. Well someone like you doesn't have to. Wait a minute. Give me a second. And like what I'm saying is this right. They'll be like be 6'3\". Be super fit. Exercise every day. Don't smoke. Don't drink. We have not done the calculator. We haven't done the calculator in a while. Have you ever done the delusional calculator? Raise your hand if you guys have ever done the delusional calculator. I'm not that delusional. I know she has. My roster is fucking hideous. I can't even sit there and say my roster is so hideous. Your roster man? Yes. Damn. I like ugly guys. I'll watch. I'll watch. I'll watch. I'll watch. I'll watch. I'll watch. I'll watch. I'll watch. Oh no. See I like ugly guys because they tend to be funny. Check this out. If I ever meet a woman I do her the same way she do my ass. I'll be looking at her whole exes, and I'll be like let me see what this bitch ex looks like. Ugly nigga, ugly nigga, ugly nigga. Wait what's the calculator? Okay but she. No you're not about the fucking calculator. I'm not saying you're not. To be fair she said they weren't black. Because so. Guys that are really incredibly hot are kind of douchey. Like they kind of. Yeah. It's hot I think. And boring. Don't give me the time of day because they know. She was speaking. She was motherfucking speaking. No okay but I'm saying. Maybe stay quiet for three seconds. Good looking men act just like hot women. Stay quiet. Good looking men act just like hot women. Let's do the calculator. Let's do the calculator. One at a time. Time out. Time out real quick. Time out. Time out. Are you done with your statement? Okay Rose what did you want to say? I was just saying like for me I'm attracted to personality. Literally that's how I am. And it doesn't to me physical appearance or whatever. Shut the fuck up. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. Shut the fuck up. Please tell me. Please stop it. I don't know where that sound came from. I have no idea where the sound came from. I don't want to be around someone who makes me feel like shit. I agree but whenever I hear women say I like personality, I'm a sapiosexual I'm into vibe or good energy. The good energy always happens to be from a dude who has six pack abs just at least five eleven. Or fucking tattoo sleeves. No. Of course. It has really toxic behavior to go along with this vibe. That's what I've seen over and over again. I have a theory! I have a theory! Of course I like six pack abs of course. Six feet tall is my preference. I don't even like. But if I had the choice between the hot guy who's a douche bag and the nice. Yeah but the problem is you don't. Like you have that choice Rose. Like Rose you do. Like there's a bunch of guys that you can choose from. Yeah. And then. There is but. So here's. There's a reason I haven't. Wait. Let me throw out my theory here. Let me give you a theory. I don't know. Okay. Let's get theoretical here. Okay. Here's the deal. What you're talking about is two different things. There is what arouses a woman and what is attractive to a woman. So whenever you ask a woman. What are you looking for in a guy? They'll go. Oh he's got to be funny. He's got to love his mom. He's got to want kids. He's got to like rainbows. He's got to like puppy dogs. He's like to go to Disneyland. He's got to do all this. He's got to have a good job. He's got to be intelligent. He's got to have a good education. So there's this laundry list of things. That's for the attraction side. Now if you ask a woman. What do you find hot in a guy? Like what gets your blood going and gets you. You know tingles down there. That's a whole different. That's a whole different question. So. But if you say. Because if you ask a woman. You say. What are you looking for in a guy? They're going to default to what they find attractive. Not necessarily what they find arousing. So unless that woman is like really like. Damn I need. I need something. I guess the question is. So it's like if you ask a guy. Like for instance. If I were to ask the ladies on the panel. What is it about a guy like physically? What is it that turns you on about that guy? That's a different question than. What are you looking for in a guy? Because women will always default to. Well let's say I'm a guy. I'm a guy. I'm a guy. I'm a guy. I'm a guy. I'm a guy. I'm a guy. for me in the long term? Well it depends on the girl too. Like if you're. If you're just want to live it. Want to live it. The single life and like. If you're looking that guy is a recreational use only. I don't care. He's a douche. I mean I'm an. Fuck the. Fuck the hot guy but if I'm looking for a life partner who I'm going to. Like. Have kids with and. He's. We're going be living together. I will take. Nice. Over. No. We're not going to. No. No. He. He needs to fight for me. He needs to like keep other guys off me. All right. So. So it's a. But. Go ahead. But I'm just saying. If. If it's a toss up. Like. "}
