Live from Las Vegas, Nevada! Hey, welcome back guys, so happy to have everyone back. We have been gone for what, six weeks now? And we are finally back here for another episode of Access Vegas. Some people pay for therapy, I just host a fucking panel show, and that works out for me. So here we go guys, we'll get on with our guest here. She is from Las Vegas, Nevada. She is a sex phone operator, and she has engineered a box with seven holes in it. It is Elektra Barbie. How are you doing, Elektra? I'm good, how are you? So happy to see you here. He is the creator of the It's Complicated show on YouTube. It does a lot of man on the street stuff. It is John. How are you doing, John? Hi, how are you? Thank you for having me, Rollo and Michael. Fantastic, man, great to have you here. Good to get you here. From Canada, she is Zoe with the cool tattoos. How are you doing, Zoe? I'm great, how are you? Beautiful, beautiful. Make sure you guys talk into the microphone. Also, joining us again from Chicago, Illinois, she is a controversial podcaster and live streamer. It is Torsha. How's it going, Torsha? Good, how are you? Good, good. Sorry, I'm quiet. There we go. She's also an ASMR expert. All the way from Frog Level, Arkansas, she's a world champion bikini model and pageant model. She's also my part-time boss. It is Kylie McGehee. How are you doing, Kylie? Hey. Beautiful. Also, she's a Playboy model. She is a very spicy Latina, and she's a pro threesome giver. What is a pro? She's a pro threesome giver. It's Jessie Preston. How are you doing, Jessie? Hi. Nice, nice. She is also Penthouse Pet 2022 from Las Vegas, Nevada. It is the very lovely Amber Rose. AKA my wife. There you go. She's from Iowa. She's a fashion model and a bartender. It is Miss Monrare. How's it going? Hey. Could I get you guys to move closer to Amber real quick, because you're on the screen right there? Awesome. Very cool. So we're going to get to the whole thing. We're going to do a little bit different show this time. We have a bunch of videos to react to. We're going to let you. You wanted to start off with something first? I just want to let everybody know that I am now the sexiest man in the Red Pillosphere. Thank you, Date Cyc, for that backfiring poll. Do you think Date Cyc did this because he expected them to turn on you? Yes, absolutely. That's really interesting. By the way, Date Cyc, if you're watching this, we'd love to have you on the show. Thank you. You can come on now. You can come on anytime you want. He's going to unblock you. That's what will happen next. Beautiful. Okay, so do you want to go with some of these clips? Sure, sure. I think we should probably explain what we're doing here. We're kind of changing things up a little bit so we can sort of react to some of these things. So last time, I was going to have Ho-Math on the show, and he's done two episodes with me. And so we reacted to some of his videos on here, and they went great. You guys really liked it, so it's something we decided to do more. So what we're going to do this time on Access Vegas is instead of us just bringing up a topic like we usually do, we're just going to find a clip of that topic that probably went viral, and then we'll just turn it over to you guys and see what you want to talk about. So the first one we're going to start with, this is literally my favorite clip of Sidiya Khan. You guys know who Sidiya Khan is. She is a psychologist, and she's viral all over the Internet. Can we pull her thing up? Yep, got it. Ready to go. I was just also going to say, she's done a lot of stuff with Chris Williamson. She's been... God, I can't even remember how many people. She's not with us. She doesn't mess with the likes of us. We're the quote-unquote bottom of the barrel. Come slim it with us, please. There's only one thing that all women... Can we try this again with it on the screen? There we go. Hold on, let me back it up for you. Hang on a second. There we go. There's only one thing that all women want. People will tell you that they want money, they want someone tall. The reality of hypergamy for a woman is only by one metric. You can be shorter than us. You can be poorer than us. You can be dumber than us in all other regards. But if we can't trick you, we'll still give you some respect. But if you're richer than us, taller than us, got more degrees and more qualifications, but we can trick you and we can manipulate you and we can derive resources. We cannot see you as a body to respect. All right. There you go. There's number one. Absolutely. Very similar to this. And so Homeath has something also that he says similar to this. And I just thought it was absolutely terrific, this concept. Because what men think a lot of times, like, oh, you ladies only want a guy who's rich or only want a guy who's tall. And then you come in, some of you come in and you're like, no, I don't really care about that. So I'm curious, what do you guys think about what Sadia had to say? Jessie, you seem to have something on your face there. It's just because I feel like every time I watch these clips, I cannot relate. So I don't really have an opinion that would make sense to anybody else. Do you know what I'm saying? Like what she's saying, I can't fathom wanting to manipulate someone. Right. That's not in my wheelhouse. Yeah, but do you do understand though that your man has boundaries and you probably, right, he has a masculine quality. So that's, but you can't manipulate him if he has those boundaries. Do you understand? Right. And everybody has boundaries, a man and a woman. Right. What I'm saying is, what she's saying before is that, like, it's not, who here has seen a guy who was good looking but he opened his mouth and you just didn't find him attractive anymore because it's shit, he said. Ladies, okay, good. A bunch of you raised your hand. Guys, you've seen a guy who's rich who was trying to have sex with you and there was something wrong with him and you didn't want to hook up with him. Raise your hand if that has ever happened. Okay, cool. Right, cool. It's always exactly. Everyone. So the point is, like, what is the thing overall? And like, she's saying a man that you can't manipulate but you think it's, you don't necessarily agree with that. No, I think with the younger generations that are kind of coming out with, like, I should be able to do this and do that, they operate from a place of what can I have, what can I get from somebody else. I don't operate from a place like that. So in my personal life, I try to have an equal level ground understanding of what we both want, what we both need, and I'm only going to get from you what you want to give, not something I have to coerce out of you. Yeah, so I think that the difference is, Jessie, is like, you're not dating everyone. You're dating one person and you had to discern between all these other people to pick that one. Do you understand what I'm saying? In a non-manipulative way, though. I never manipulated. No, no, I'm not saying you did, but what her point might be is that you could tell when you met him that you couldn't manipulate him and maybe no one else could either and that's why you found him attractive. Do you understand? I never have that thought in my head. Okay, beautiful. Maybe subconsciously. Amber, what do you think about that? The concept of women liking a man that she cannot manipulate. I mean, I... Microphone. I think that she, obviously she has a point because I'm sure that a lot of females function that way, but yeah, I don't really think about how the amount that I can manipulate someone goes into a relationship. Obviously, there are women out there that use men and that's what they do. That's their forte. But in a relationship sense, I mean, I guess we would probably both have to agree that we wouldn't date someone that we felt that we could manipulate. I've dumped someone because he acted like he had no boundaries. And I'm not trying to sit here and have someone in my life that just does... I'm pretty sure he's autistic, but the point was... Welcome to the red pill. I'm not even saying it to be funny. I'm pretty sure he was autistic. He was part of a lot of autistic foundations and stuff like that. But this man just didn't have any boundaries and I don't want someone that I can walk all over and I don't want someone that will allow other people to walk all over him as well. I think we're kind of missing the point here. The point wasn't that they can or want to manipulate the man. It's that they're dating men they can't manipulate. And that's what you're saying also. The man didn't have any boundaries so you found him less attractive. Yeah. Kylie, what do you think? I mean, I think I understand her video. I think she just worded it weirdly so it comes across wrong. Yeah. So you think she did that like for effect? No, I mean, I don't know if she did it for effect or not. I just think... I mean, I hope she didn't because I wish she would have worded it differently. She's a licensed psychologist. I know what she was trying to say but the way that she worded it I feel like it came across differently. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. The word I've heard before also is like just having boundaries but not being manipulated is another way to say it. I think it punches more the way she said it. I got a take on this. Go ahead, Torsha, what do you think? Tori, what do you think? I don't know. I like a simp. I like a good simp this time of year. Yeah. I don't know. I like when they do stuff for me. I don't know. I don't know if that's manipulation if you're actually dating him. No, but I'm saying like if a guy were... Can you hear me? Yeah. If a guy were to not... How do I word it? If I'm dating him and I'm not walking all over him or whatever I don't think it would work out because he would be an asshole. I don't like assholes. Wait, so there's a middle ground between walking over your man and then him being an... You don't think there's a middle ground? No. Really? I don't think there's a middle ground. He's a complete asshole who has boundaries or... Or he's a simp. Or he's a simp. And that's it. It's very binary. That's incredible. All right. Is there like a scenario where the guy would be like incongruent? You know what I mean? Like he would be like... I hate that. Well, he would be like... You would see him as being sort of like strong and dominant and stuff but then does something that gives you the ick that like makes you like say maybe this guy isn't the dude that I thought he was. Or they're like soft in the beginning and then out of nowhere they'll turn alpha and then you're like, ew, why are you like this? Because it breaks character. Incongruent, yeah. Yeah, it breaks character. Yeah, so that's the other thing. So another way to say that, going back to boundaries, sometimes he has boundaries and then sometimes he doesn't have boundaries and that's incongruent. Well, that would be nuanced, wouldn't it? Because you want somebody that's kind of like that. I don't know. I don't know. You tell me. Yeah. I'm interested in what you want. There we go. Like I said, I like a simp. You like a simp, okay. I like somebody who does stuff for me when I ask. Nice, nice. What do you think? I think that manipulation in relationships is one of the purest forms of evil. Okay. I do not like to be manipulated and I will never manipulate my partner that I'm with. Sure. And yeah, I don't like manipulation at all. Okay. Are we understanding what she was saying differently? Yeah, I was about to say. Because the both of you keep looking at us like what we're saying has nothing to do with what you're saying. No, no, no, it's fine. It's fine because the thing is she's saying it to men. The majority of our audience is men. So I think she's saying it in a way that like captures our, because we're the ones who could possibly be manipulated. So it means more to us. I think from your standpoint, it might mean something else. You men are the only ones. No, no, no. In her statement, when we're talking about what women want. We're talking about what women want. Almost ripped this thing off. Yes. We all know that men do not manipulate women. We all understood that. That's whatsoever. That goes without saying that men don't do any manipulation whatsoever. Never. We don't do any whatsoever. Ms. Ronrare, what do you think? I kind of agree with her. Yeah? There should be no manipulating. It shouldn't even cross your mind. So I think that's the part we're missing. Yeah. Okay, one more time. I lost my mic. All right, so we don't. There we go. My mic's back. So the point is, it's like one of these things where if you have a guy with you who can fight, it doesn't mean he's supposed to fight, but he can look like he handles himself, right? You told me, Kylie and I were talking about this morning, what's more important, a guy who looks like he can bench press 300 pounds or a guy who can actually bench press 300 pounds? And she's like, I prefer a guy who looks like he can. Okay? We're not saying that you should or should not manipulate a man. What she's saying is that women find men more attractive when they know they can't manipulate him. Does that make sense? And so you guys are like, well, manipulation's bad. We all agree manipulation's bad. That's bullshit, because then girls wouldn't be dating the guys they know they can get stuff from. That's bullshit. That debunks everything. So no, but what she said was, so for sure, a woman will have sex with a guy because of different reasons, but she was talking about respect. The first beginning of the clip was talking about who does she respect, and I agree with that. Genuine desire and respect would come from a man that a woman knows she cannot manipulate. I believe that's the case. For sure, you and I know girls that are here, sugar babies, whatever, they take money from men they don't respect and have sex with them. Of course, that's not what we're talking about because they don't respect them, but we're talking about specifically respect. Anyway, Ms. Monroe, go ahead again. Well, if we're saying it like that, I guess when I think of a man that attracts me, it's not necessarily whether I can manipulate him or not. It's just I guess the boundaries thing is a thing, but also I want to get my way sometimes. I want a middle ground. It's a give. It's a take and give in all relationships. How about this? Just a way of saying it. When you do good things for him, he's going to let you get away with certain stuff, but if you aren't doing anything for him, then for instance, he might be more willing to drive 30 minutes to your house if you guys are in a consensual, monogamous, sexual relationship versus you've made him wait five dates and you don't have sex with him. Maybe he's tired of driving 30 minutes. Maybe he's set a boundary. Does that make sense? Yeah. Maybe something closer to that. Lindsay, what do you think? I don't know. I respect when a guy has a good understanding of his self and what it is that he actually wants because if he's upfront and honest and open about it from the get-go, then I am able to judge and see if we even are on the same frequency and it's up to me then to make my decision. Yes, this is what I want. This is what I'm looking for or no, that's not it. There should be no manipulation involved. It's a matter of, hey, do our energies match? If so, you want to come together. You want to help together. It's a partnership. If it's not, if they don't know, which a lot of people don't, then that's where chaos happens. Got it. I prefer peace. I was going to say, I mean, the point that the men are trying to get to, I think, is that women want a more alpha dominant. This would be one of the traits, yeah. This could be a popular trait. I think the way she's saying that, though, is that like not being able to manipulate someone would be one of those alpha traits, but another way you could say it would be to have boundaries. As long as there is still this element of you saying that I have boundaries and I cannot be manipulated, you should still be able to learn from your partner or learn from other people. Yeah. And when men hear the word alpha, they think that they heard something and made sense to them. They stick with it. No one can tell them anything. Otherwise, they're not open to learning from it. They're not open to another perspective or way of seeing things that might challenge that or change that narrative. And the thing that everybody's stuck on these days is everybody wants to be called the alphas. High value. And they all want to be high value. that they are it and they think that by repeating this rhetoric that everyone else in clips are saying that they're all sudden becoming those men but internally they don't learn they're stubborn they think of things one-sided there's no gray area to anything they lack the softness to be able to be empathetic to other people see here's here's why i think it's like that's it's more emphasized right now because too many guys have been like that for too long meaning like everybody has has decided that they're going to align themselves with their feminine they're going to be in their quote-unquote feminine energy whatever the fuck that means but they want to be they want to seem like they're more feminine identifying and have been doing that really for the last four gen really since the baby boomer generation to get in touch with we've been told this for so long man down man down and suddenly now everyone wants us to man up all of a sudden right well for four generations we've told guys to man down man down get in touch with your emotions get express yourself more get in touch with your female side you know uh you know do so what they took it too far well i think i think one of the reasons that we're sort of like seeing this is it's sort of detrimental to well society in general but like guys in general you'll hear guys they'll be like these i do this on my own podcast i i i compare uh different um different videos to other videos and those videos uh i set them off to kind of compare and contrast like the message from one to the mess to another message from another one and they tend to be like conflicting messages so you've got one one woman saying i want a guy who's like you know masculine and can kick ass and take names then you know he wants she want they want a guy who can like slit throats and change the diaper on the baby in the same day right so you've got this much like the guy that wants the virgin that's also a porn star exactly exactly so and and then honestly honestly i think that's kind of ridiculous as it is but the thing is is that we've been telling guys to be feminine and to sort of identify with the feminine for so long and everyone like for we're we're now in the fourth generation since this and so now it's a shock to the system when we say hey we want to if that's what you want then we want to take that to the nth degree we want to be but why why why can't you guys go from i make fire ah bro why can't you go from that to i make fire and have okay and then come here baby come in my arms do you want to learn how to make fire i teach you how because first of all first of all that's like that's a really a binary extreme right there second of all is this is that guys have been told that for so damn long right now that they that they played that card and they've used that card and hasn't bought them anything so not being playing the nice guy the nice guy card playing the i'm gonna be i respect women card that doesn't pay the bills when it comes to intersexual dynamics at this point and i know it's nice to have especially at different phases in in women's maturity so from the switching from the from the time you were like say 18 to about 28 years old you're wanting a guy that's much different than the guy that you're like going you know what i really want a nice guy and one really wants someone who's dependable and it's not like those assholes that i used to date back when i was 18 19 25 whatever it was and now i'm interested in a guy who has a little something else to him and that guy has to also not only be respectful but he also has to have some sort of like nice guy side to him like but that's kind of like alpha with a side of beta or a beta with a side of alpha this is what kills me about the the nice guy rhetoric you guys be a nice guy because you're a nice guy don't keep saying but i'm a nice guy why am i not getting laid why am i not getting this girl why am i not getting this so you're so you're worried about the complaining part of it the guy saying i was nice all this time and i'm not getting laid for it sounds like that guy thinks that he deserves to get laid right the problem with that is that nice guys guys will start being nice when nice gets them laid nice does not that means that they're not nice guys yeah no no hold on jesse do you understand that every single proclivity that men have only exists because women rewarded those proclivities do you understand there's no 100 like and i'm not talking about in the last 10 years i'm talking about the last 200 000 years 100 this is the chicken or the egg debate there's no for any time ladies complain oh these men are all narcissists then stop letting narcissists put their penis inside of you and stop having narcissus babies we don't know that they're narcissists at all until you're too deep in i said this the last podcast yes and you guys put those clips everywhere and the comments were disgusting the comments were oh here's another hoe that dated a narcissist and she's not responsible for anything that went wrong when you date a narcissist the problem with them being a narcissist you don't know that they're narcissists okay so just really wonderful people jesse let me let me just point out something i have some friends who've done the same thing where they've uh dated a narcissist and when other male figures or other figures that are outside the relationship are included they can clearly see the guy's a narcissist it's just the guy the woman who's having sex with him can't i just really think ladies i would just consider this if you had a a brother or a cousin or somebody a third party member come in and be like yeah he did this and this and this and listen to their advice but generally what happens i had uh was amanda uh nicole in here talking about don't get digmatized and like that's like that's the kind of situation where it's like you tell them and they don't listen anyway i just i have a feeling maybe not in your situation specifically but a lot of you ladies if you had had a third party come in and say hey what do you really think about my boyfriend you had some uh situations with him like he's rude to everyone i know i can't believe you're fucking with like you might want to listen to their opinion because they're not the ones sleeping with him so their opinion might be less biased you're talking about on people that know them no just go out with them go out like like as a couple can you have friends or as a couple does he not allow you to have friends when you're with a narcissist he doesn't even let you talk to your family okay you just gave me a clear symptom of narcissism so you can't tell me you can't tell michael that symptom came way later later okay that symptom came a year in not the first six months of love bombing and perfection where you thought this was the person you were going to die with you were going to get buried in this freaking spot and you were going to be with this person for the rest of your life the love bombing and the perfection everybody at work you know him they know him to be wonderful you just started dating him you date him for seven eight months and he's wonderful and so you're like yeah that everyone says he's wonderful and that is the mask that he wears you're a year deep yeah and all of a sudden the mask comes off and those symptoms start to come out okay okay that's not something that was shown to you and you just ignored all your friends telling you hey this is really weird hey this is really weird you're not ignoring them you're just not having to happen to you in a timely fashion so so while it only comes like i just want to add something and it only comes out to her right so everybody else he sure no that i've seen that yeah but that's a really big thing i want to make out with you right now i think all men are narcissists so yeah um so the thing is from a man's standpoint uh a lot of times from our viewpoint just understand this is how we see it uh we're watching us be super nice to girls and then not getting any attraction from it and then we pay attention to the men who are getting the girls we like and see a very stark difference and then we keep hearing women tell us that they want to date nice guys i have a i let's let's let's table the hold on let's let john will say something i want to table this okay go ahead we talked about because the reason i want to is because the one of the jamie lynn clips okay it's about narcissism just in reference to the video i just wanted to say that um the idea is that women will lose attraction and respect for men who don't pass their shit tests so what i would like to ask the women is do women consciously shit test men or is it an unconscious thing shit test define use a sentence fitness test um basically uh when a man is uh doesn't uh how many boundaries i suppose could you two move closer to amber and could you two move closer to john just for the camera go ahead answer john's question or do you guys understand well i mean so if he doesn't if as far as like a shit test right that's like a common yes no no for sure where it's basically uh the idea that um well first off i would even ask you know being in love requires you to be vulnerable would you agree with that yes absolutely 100 so how can you be vulnerable without being taken advantage of at some point are you allowed to let your guard down and truly trust your partner or are they just always going to be shit testing you and you're kind of having to kind of make sure that no boundaries are crossed in relationships when things happen i don't see them as tests i see them as something that we both get through together on the same conscious level of like this is how we would handle this if it were to arise but as far as like girls that test guys that what you mean yeah like let me see what he would do if my girlfriend hit on him or something like that yeah i don't again test his loyalty that is a form of manipulation and i don't function that way so i can't relate do you think many women function that way i've done a kind of a little test i wouldn't call it test you know what i mean but kind of like when i decided to bring a guy around my friends or my group of friends sure you know what i mean like how do you like we get wild we do crazy shit when we're out together like how do you feel how does it make you feel when you hang out with us like are you having fun or all are you having fun with my friends you know or are you sitting off in a corner somewhere not being social like either it could be okay but it just tells me you know what i mean if we again are on the same frequency can i let me let me so i don't i feel like there's more observation but it's like and that's why i said i don't really call it a test but in the same point in time like a conscious thing though is what i'm asking i don't think so i think it's i think it's completely subconscious i think that when well i mean so women will actually acknowledge it occasionally but it's usually when it's like so overt that they can't not you know acknowledge it i think i have done that so when i'm out with my husband and like my best girlfriends or whatever if he doesn't open the door for them or shut the door for them i will lose my shit see that's an act that's an act i will be really upset and i tell him we went to the beach and this girl was trying to lug this igloo cooler thing that was bigger than she was she was four foot eight and she's lugging it up these steps to get to her car and he's just standing there and i'm like he's like well i don't want you to feel like i'm overstepping boundaries like bro a woman is a woman you know respect and gentlemen is not just towards one you do know that if you're in san francisco did the same exact thing he's gonna get fucking way late for that right you're like i i understand what you're saying jesse but it's like this is something that happens whenever sometimes i deal with women is they're like i feel very strongly that men should do this and in the last relationship he was with a woman who felt the complete opposite do you understand that like if you you have to say that to him if you don't say that to him he's not gonna know i have though okay good did you you have uh do you guys see the curb your enthusiasm episode hold on we'll get you there's an episode of curb your enthusiasm where larry david like there's like he's not supposed to have the the uh the limo driver help his bags but it's this tiny little woman and so he does it she's like what are you trying to help me with my bags are you fucking chauvinist and then he she picks him up she can barely hold the bags and everyone's staring at him like bro why aren't you helping her with the fucking bags it's like that for us sometimes well so here's the by the way you know there's women out there that if you hold the door open for your girlfriend fine if you hold the door open for other women that woman will trip so you have to understand ladies just so we're clear just so we're clear just because you like a thing doesn't mean every woman likes a thing hence why i said i can't relate when you ask questions sometimes on these like and jesse i i agree jesse i agree you you do things that are very different from the from the middle of the standard deviations go ahead we're gonna we're gonna talk to lindsey first lindsey go ahead i wanted to say about that i was like you know that is one of my actual favorite silent tests like if a guy opens the door for me because that is the only way you can unlock the next achievement level where i reach over and open the door for you you know what i mean and i love that i love doing that yeah but do you love it for you yes i have so much fun with it because it is a fun little game but just i'm not usually with you know that scenario let's say we were all going together tomorrow to deadmau5 and your man was going to meet up with us you were walking through a door i mean then if he holds it for you that's a nice respectable thing to do okay what if i hold the door open for your man is that okay if i hold the door open for your man what if i smack him on the ass as he walks in is that fine i love how a shit test is just reduced to opening a fucking door i mean like there's so many other ways that women test no that was so fun though because i like opening the door for him but you only get that if you open it for me i'd like to ask a panel a question about opening up a door why okay why was holding the why has holding the door open become gender neutral when entering a building but you'll never see a woman opening up a car door for a man damn i opened the car door for my husband all the time so i don't know i can't relate i don't know i don't know but that again was taught generations ago that that was part of being a gentleman okay and and obviously some women find chivalry to be patronizing while other women expect it so as far as passing those tests i mean sometimes women will you know say hey he didn't offer to do this and so basically the man is guilty before he even knows what the woman expects out of him there's two extremes right now because we're leaving one like era of dating and entering another one we're in a traditional we left that a long time ago we haven't left it we're in a mixed bag some women still really want the traditional this and they still value that and that's how their families were and there's still younger women coming in that came from a house that didn't have those values and they don't want those things they don't they want to feel independent they want to feel like they did it themselves and the thing is that men keep trying to go for the woman that's in this bag while they're in this bag and the women keep going for the men that are in this bag while they're in this bag everyone needs to date on their level date in their era and date in their traditions that's it so what is the incentive for women to change when they can currently pick and choose the best of both worlds if we're transitioning what are we transitioning to like i just i just find someone that has the same values as you like guys want to date the hottest girls and then they're mad when those girls don't want to settle down with them cheat on them party all the time stop dating the party girl stop telling me that you're 45 years old and you want to date the 20 year old because she's you know youthful and that's what men want and we want untouched but then you're trying to lock down a 19 year old that doesn't want that part of your life all right that's not what she's looking for when she's 19 and 20 she's just graduated high school she wants a little she wants a little bit of life to be lived and then men want to hate women and say oh look at how these women just do us dirty you're dating the wrong kind of woman well that's because right now women want 20th century ideals they want 20th century quote-unquote chivalry which is bullshit to begin with it's they they want this 20th century sensibilities but they want 21st century privileges in that they want to pick and choose what it is that they want at any particular time because we were held back so significantly for so long we do zoe zoe you look like you had"}
