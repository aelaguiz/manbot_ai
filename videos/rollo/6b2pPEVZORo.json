This is your midweek show live from Reno, Nevada In the heart of Where there's still snow on the ground Yeah It's just got too out of hand I thought maybe I would do a show Just this is actually kind of an experimental show. I hate to even call it that but I'm experimenting today It's messing around with camera angles. I got a little tired of watching the Daily Wire just basically like Bastardizing Corrupt completely corrupt the Manosphere recently, so We'll start with a few things like this Oops, wait a minute. Let me I Just forget that I've got to Echo cancellation. There we go. I Say all the time in today's day and age you shouldn't be getting married until you're at least 35 That was my next question for you as a man. What do you consider getting married? So I have this is my thing that I tell guys I think 35 years old had slept with at least 50 women 100k per year. You're in shape And he's got six months to one year of savings. All right, John. I gotta get married. I've done all that Here's the republic right there so that is a recipe do you think he like does his eyebrows I mean because it doesn't seem like those are like natural eyebrows for a terrible marriage by the way guys waiting until you're 35 And have slept with 50 women that is a terrible recipe for marriage by every available data point It turns out that you are much better in terms of getting married If you get married younger if you do not have a wide variety of sexual partners all the stuff about you know Being in shape and having money and all the rest like you should try to do that generally speaking But this notion that you wait until you're 35 You've already made a bevy of mistakes that have shaped your character and made you much more rigid as a person and that you should Have had a basis of comparison in terms of sex of dozens and dozens and dozens of women No, the data do not support this and it's stupid wrong I feel all the problems of the hookup culture and the talking culture and all All the problems you're describing are because there's so much uncertainty and nobody has any idea what the hell anybody's supposed to do Because there are no standards and there are no norms We don't even see depictions of this that we can emulate and so I think you know, we're all we're all complaining here Well, i'm not about how we don't want things to be black and white But if things were a little more black and white if we had clarity on some of these issues, then you wouldn't be getting In and out burger cup duly noted marriage like brian is worried Is this woman going to take my kids and have my stuff? You should go to another country. It's much more black and white It is I know. Yeah Stop the cow human race exists feminism feminism will never be dead There's something that we're going to have to strive and work work towards. Um To make sure that there's equality So feminism is not dead in 2023 Men do not have more rights than women. We are equal on every front and contrary to popular belief There is not some gender wage pay gap. We are all paid the same amount of money Usually a discrepancy is just in the types of jobs achieved just laying the groundwork here But this idea that we have we still have to fight for equality and forever We're gonna have to be fighting against the patriot. No, we won that years ago your fight Against the patriarchy and for equality it is made up in your own head so that you can have something to be whining about constantly a tiktok storm Of viral videos about women complaining about men looking at them at the gym This apparently is like a thing it used to be that in order to be victimized and i'm sorry I'm going to laugh at this one american side. You actually had to be a victim. Shut up Now you're a victim if you go to the gym dressed in booty shorts and a bra And men give you sideways glances that apparently is like the height of victimhood I agree that women are victimized if some guy puts his hands on them when they don't want to have their hands put on them Obviously, I'll agree that women are victimized if men without regard for the woman just stare at them I just stare for prolonged periods of time, but that's not what we're talking about here What we are talking about is attractive women on tiktok who are seeking attention, which is why they are on tiktok filling themselves at the gym wearing Extraordinarily tight clothing and bare midriff and then they are surprised that men are looking at them. Occasionally. I'm not a piece of meat Now let's be real about this This is how many dates in the united states and everywhere else have started Is the idea that men and women are identical and indiscernible for all practical purposes rather than complementary? Which was the traditional understanding of sexual difference. I have to reject a couple of your premises one That college students work hard and study that was never my experience two that college is an unpleasant experience I found it to be very fun and uh three that women Were these ignorant docile uneducated creatures? Unintelligent and and basically worthless before feminism. I I think that's so absurd. It's Obviously very offensive, but it just isn't true. I think women were much better educated before feminism I'm a whore You don't teach men to protect women you get men who will victimize women and when you don't teach women That they ought to cherish men who are responsible and good All you end up doing is incentivizing bad male behavior that's interesting because you know, michael knolls and uh ben shapiro should probably Pay more attention in the staff meetings when it comes to like getting their story straight on feminism Just just saying just throwing that out there. The feminist movement was not wrong when they said men are acting like pigs Oh, really? I wonder what michael knolls would have to say about that They were wrong when they said women also ought to act like pigs and that this is a solution to our problem because the reverse We're all gonna act like pigs everybody Now what's happened is they got rid of all the traditional mores about how Sex ought to be connected with love and not to be connected with relationships. They got rid of all of that It was just a bodily function now Except except when it comes to actual sexual assault, we treat that differently than any other bodily function, obviously That that's the problem, right? So they create the standard where sex is basically a throwaway item sort of like eating and then we treat sex very differently when it comes to What we all know it is which is a deeply important and intimate part of a person's life Constructs coming from that like a high value woman is different to a high value man Why are women held to a different standard than men? So i'm assuming that you're talking about like someone's body count how many people they've slept with what clothes they wear Why is that such a focus for women and not a focus for men at all? Uh, it is a focus for men That is where I have a problem with I'm having a hard time not liking this girl. I actually kind of do but uh, Let's just keep that's this is brett cooper. By the way, if you're like who is this? That's brett cooper b-r-e-t b-r-e-t-t like brett far cooper I'm gonna get ripped for this But you know the andrew tate stuff and I think that he has a purpose in this world I think that he has had like a lot of really great moments and you know has sparked a lot of interesting conversations but I don't like the double standard with women and men like I I believe that a high value man is very similar to a high value woman and that he is respected Himself in the same way that I have I guess I can find common ground with that I don't want a guy that's walking around half naked and is like slept with half the city Oh sure, just as like a guy wouldn't want a girl and saying that like I was only cheating if a woman does it But not a man, mr. Andrew tate just lay back. It'll all be over momentarily Very creepy if a person glances at you when you wear spray-painted ass clothes This creepy old guy at the gym kept coming over and staring at me So I told my husband and he came over and worked out next to me Even after he came over he continued to stare I decided to stop working out and stare back Well, i'm a whore I attempted to do my set Then I got set up and went over and addressed him. Tell these bitches to go to hell Okay, here she goes she's gonna go over and address this guy again, you saw in this video him for a grand total of like Three seconds maybe I told him him if he's gonna work out in this corner He needed to stop staring and making me uncomfortable. You're filming yourself at the gym to do this And this has become a way of of grabbing sort of victimhood But hey one you could theoretically have separate gyms Yeah, a quick montage of some right of center media figures and podcasters sharing their criticisms. He was just being mean Oh, i was gonna say like what what he is saying is actually Oh sydney Parts of yeah the whole thing. Oh, if you don't know who jeremy is he's from the quartering. I love jeremy though I know people like I know people on the fence about jeremy. I've always liked jeremy I like jeremy when he was playing magic the gathering he was actually talking about Flipping cards and then of course vampire lord sydney is of course sydney watson I have to explain who these people are because nobody knows anymore thing is true Like it's not it's not like it's untrue. I will absolutely say yes mean. Yep. Hey, who's this guy? Come on now. Matt walsh is being mean major divide on this video is whether or not the language was A little too harsh factually. He's not wrong. No factually. Yeah I I don't look If these guys need to like delete their channel your job is to win hearts and minds I don't think this is the best way of doing it. You'll notice the connecting thread They all agree that i'm right that what I said is factually correct They think that it goes too far by saying it out loud. Well, see this is where we differ I don't think it's possible to go too far by speaking truth. The truth is the truth It is what it is. Are we going to defend it or are we going to conceal it? Are we going to embrace it? Are we going to hide from it? You can't have it both ways Well, you seem to be last one. Here we go as a group Are working together to oppress women as a group as a whole is that what the patriarchy is and the earth Is when I say the patriarchy I I what I mean is this It's beyond men it's this this internalized system of oppression of domination that That extends far beyond gender far beyond race. It's this energy of like Hierarchy the energy is you telling yourself that you're a victim so that you can complain about things and feel good about yourself That's the energy there is no the reason why you can't define it. It's just because it doesn't exist I think of the hatred of women and men being on top I can't even focus on what she's saying because of the arm movements the power Around us from within and up and down and we build it. We don't know You're distracting everybody from the fact that you're saying nothing We say to give a woman vote is like to let a monkey fly a plane very dangerous very dangerous Okay, okay enough of that Well, we're gonna talk about every single one of those today because why not welcome to the new background and i'm experimenting with Looks, I didn't mean for that to be purple. That's actually blue. But because I mixed the yellow in there blue and yellow What does that make children? I didn't realize that Thank you, and today's gonna be a stream deck day like you wouldn't believe How we all doing Oh god, I have so many irons in the fire and i'm like, you know What I think I need to relax and do a podcast for these people today Oh, man. Yeah, we're gonna we're gonna get into this and dig into some of this stuff today I'm, just gonna jump right in because uh, why not? Um, let me i've got one super chat you guys want to throw in super chats i'll take them throughout the day this is a thursday edition I Will not be going for five hours Let me stop lying. I will not be going that long. I don't really even have that much material this is like I said, you guys got lucky today because I am just really kind of uh, See if I can i'm adjusting i'm, adjusting, uh Images there look Hey, how are you? And then I also have uh, the new monitor which is right above the Camera, so if I seems like i'm looking at you i'm actually looking at the monitor right here I need to kind of lower it a little bit But then I got to move my studio my my my speakers my studio monitors out of the way too. So Yeah, i've got uh, quite the uh, quite the little podcast studio going today And i'm still just figuring things out because i'm a one-man show Oh, hey Yeah. Hey, thank you. Uh nairobi. I'm trying to I'm trying to do you guys some midweek shows, uh, even if they're just a little bit shorter Than the sunday should sunday's always going to be pod classes This is just sort of like whatever's going on that. I I feel like I need to I feel merch I feel like I need to talk about um One of the things that I see going on right now In the manosphere, uh in in particular anyways, let's see if I can screw this over here a little bit There we go much better still need to Bump things around I got to get the camera like the the lens Depth opened up a little bit more And then on top of that to really throw a monkey wrench into the whole thing Streamyard has decided that they're going to uh, give you like custom layouts, which I was fooling around with I haven't used yet, but I probably will in the future. So I I I reserve the right to change my my screen drops a little bit Um, so let's see, please be more direct. It's hard to follow. Yeah. Well, welcome to my show brother, man What would you like me to talk about? Let's be more direct. Okay, so here's this here's a problem I'm gonna go straight to the point Um, there's a lot of guys in the manosphere right now. We got no business being here They're not soundproof blankets glenn. They are actually, um, uh blackout curtains uh, what else you got ben tom ben tom linson, uh You could argue the manosphere is more popular than tradcon media currently. Yes, it is For now Okay, look here's how I wanted to start this show back in let's see it was actually December 31st of Yes, alpha wolfing you can ask you related question I was on rule zero and I was we were doing the end of the year show We usually do like a end of your wrap-up and we do predictions, which is probably something we shouldn't really do but we do predictions and Um, and then we cover the ones that we got right and the ones we got wrong. And yes, I did get one wrong Okay, i'm not right all the time, but pretty i've got a pretty good track like 99.8 Percent of the time i'm right and even when i'm wrong i'm usually wrong about the timing So, um, I think I I made a bet with john for modern life dating about camilla harris would be the president By august I think of 2022 was our 2021 I got that wrong however she was for a very brief moment the president of the united said first female president of the united states because when um, When biden had to go in for surgery and they knocked him out. She has to take over. So technically I was right In a roundabout way but uh I uh, I usually go over the predictions that we do and this year I made one kind of I don't say bold prediction because I don't really think it was all that bold to be honest with you Um, my prediction was this is that by august of this year again, uh, we will be firmly in the throes of The election cycle here in the united states the election cycle here Although it is the 2024 election cycle Uh, we will most definitely be entering into it Probably about 18 months before the actual date where we're actually casting ballots and stuff like that I remember we here in the united states. Anyways, we cast ballots on the first tuesday of november So you have to kind of knock a full month actually two full months off of that. So Uh figure it's like 16 months And then you then we cast our ballots such as it is as if you think those things actually make any difference anymore Um, I don't but uh, that's for another podcast and not this one. Um, But I will say this because I've gone through three well actually technically four but three cycles Where I have watched people bastardize the red pill for ideological political ethno-national uh culture war purposes So the most obvious one I think was probably back in 2016 because trump was a big deal back then and he was going head To head with hillary and now I if it was going to be a choice between hillary clinton and donald trump I'm going to vote for trump simply because it's hillary uh, and then I I tend to sort of be as pragmatic as I possibly can when it comes to like my Who i'm going to back as far as politics are concerned, but quite honestly, i'm not a big trump fan But i'm an even less bigger. I'm an i'm even less of a fan of hillary clinton so, uh, I think uh, you know when I say, uh, I think last year I was uh, I was watching the very limited and very controlled debates between uh, biden and uh trump and um I'm, like is this the best we can do Get down there There's some other like at least the warm of this the warm-up band I mean, is there somebody that we can actually like relate with we need 20th century candidates. I mean In some cases, you know, like chronologically um instead of 20th century candidates We need people I think it's going to be an interesting day when we get a 21st century candidate on the ballot and not a 20th century brand and One of the things I noticed over the last really like 2012 2016 Well, really technically 2020 and then of course where we're at right now Is they tend to follow cycles and then they follow cycles from within the manosphere or what is now the manosphere? It didn't you should be like such a big deal back in the in 2012 But uh, if you go back to 2016 in that election cycle, you want to know where people like tim pool came from where did um, Mike cernovich come from where did candace owens come from? Candace owens used to be called red pill black That's what her handle was on twitter before she like abandoned it and just became candace, right? and there was a time in 2016 where everyone was sort of um co-opting the red pill and co-opting the manosphere because a lot of Candidates and a lot of people thought that the manosphere ought to be ideological and you probably already know what my opinion of that is i've written several articles and essays on my own site and written Articles quite honestly for epic times and for you know, john gillian and some of these other guys who like quote me a lot um, we're The election cycle in the united states starts 18 months before the we actually like cast votes So it starts the previous year about halfway through And so with that in mind, I made the prediction back in um at the on new year on the new year's eve show of 2022 that um That we would you will see that the the people who are not about the red pill will suddenly start pivoting To social issues you will see them interviewing people like oh, I don't know. Um, michael knowles um, you'll see uh ostensibly red pill, uh manosphere and shows, uh, interviewing people like nick fuentes Or kanye west or milo yiannopoulos Uh, you're going to see people Progressively shift and pivot over from manosphere For lack of a better term red pill Subjects and topics when we're talking about intersexual dynamics to more culture war stuff social stuff Now here's the thing before you start throwing rocks at me and I know you will Both in the chat and also probably in the comments and most likely when I get clips out of this People are going to go. Well, what's wrong with the culture war? How come it's why are you so upset about the culture war? We need to fight the culture war save the west Be my guest Take that and run with it But don't call it the manosphere Take your culture war. Take your ethno-nationalism. Take your politics. Take your ideology. Take your religion. Take your uh, your ethno Whatever your your race Whatever it is Good for you. Go for it. But my son go forth and multiply. Vaya con dios Don't call it the manosphere. Don't call it red pill Well red pill just means truth. Yeah. Well, okay fine if that's the where you're gonna go with it But don't jump on shows that are ostensibly about the manosphere or ostensibly about I think what we're calling What are they calling them now? I believe it's a gen z dating shows I think is the new terminology for like for shows like say whatever podcast which I like Don't get me wrong But if you go and you learn I'll I will go and i'll dig up the the stats for that show But like when uh when brian had michael knowles On that show not too long ago about a month ago three or four weeks ago. Anyways That show beat out fresh and fit for that night And I believe it's on wednesday night. They were like they had a show that night and um and brian to his credit, uh, just milked farmed the living hell out of that, uh, The uh, the super chats there because he knew he had something going on there And I have never seen him above like double digits as far as like was he at 12 000 Maybe he was at 16 000 live views When he had michael knowles on there. Michael knowles a big deal, man He's a if you don't know who michael knowles is he's a sort of a talking. He's a muppet really He's a he's a daily wire muppet So is so is shapiro. So is matt walsh. So is candace pretty much everybody i'm i'm still the jury's still out I think i'm brett cooper, but uh Only maybe because I kind of like I think she's funny at least if she's a muppet. She's a funny one um, but if you go and you look at these guys, um, What they are trying to do what they're and and this this is what they did in the 2016 election cycle Is they are going to fuck try to find an angle into the manosphere because they know that that's where their voters are They know that that's where their vote their voting block is or that's where their new audience is going to be So I have made the prediction Back in new year's eve and i'm still sticking by it right now because I don't see any reason not to But you will not recognize the manosphere Probably by august or september of this year uh, simply because it the shows that were that used to be about uh red pill topics and by red pill, I mean Intersexual dynamics the praxeology That is the red pill that is intersexual dynamics You are i'm already seeing prominent evolutionary psychologists lean into politics and ideological ideologies right now I'm seeing guys who I have a lot of respect for and i'm not going to name names because I don't know where they're Going to go with it But I do see them leaning that way right now And I also see guys like ben shapiro who is just simply like grifting on the manosphere And that's why I wanted to get into this and that's why I said today's, you know, uh, the daily wire has become cartoons For the manosphere And people are loving that now. I want to point a few before we I start riffing on some of these things I want to point out that when Michael newell's was on whatever podcast and I do have a clip here it's like Uh, it's like your dad showed up on the show and it's like oh shit dad's here, right and dad sits down And he's pointing at the girls and say you bitches ain't living right? Jesus said you are not living right? Uh, you know the the you know, you need to y'all need to get married. Y'all need to shape up Y'all need and it's essentially like holding women accountable. It's the accountability Template that has been made very popular by fresh and fit. Um I didn't play no small part in it myself, but it's uh when when myron and I Are doing shows if we're doing access vegas where we have we have different approaches to it But what's happening right now or what I see happening right now is I see a lot of these guys who have a political Sort of agenda or political acts to grind and they're coming in on these shows and people love it. Absolutely. Love it How do I know because I look at uh playboard.co or I look at social blade and I look at the shows where Uh, you guys don't think I stay on top of my analytics. I'll trust me I do um But i'm looking at the analytics for uh, whatever podcast when When michael noels is on there And i'm looking at this and they are he's playing I mean go You can go look at it's almost a million for that. I believe it's like 900 000 views on that It's close to a million for a show. That is almost six hours long Bravo, man. I even roll it to mossy. Can't pull that guy to those guys in numbers But I looked at the uh, the super chat, uh take on that and it was close to 5600 maybe 5700. I was 56 and change And uh god knows how much money he's made off of like ad revenue and clips and everything else very profitable for brian bravo And I would never begrudge him anything like that. It's awesome but I do have to point out the fact that the reason why Having michael noels on a show like that and wagging his finger at the the bad girls from ucs from university of santa barbara I don't know. I don't know where you source those girls from but it's most likely I think I believe it's ucsp um But to go in there and be able to sort of um Wag your finger and and and be play dad for a little while or play sort of like Baptist minister for a little bit on a show like that. You will not see michael noels go on fresh and fit I mean if he does that'd be a very interesting a very interesting show, but I don't think that um, The muppets of the daily wire look at myron and fresh and say yeah, maybe we can get in on that Um, they will however go on something that looks a little bit more safe And maybe a little bit more white which is whatever podcast. So as a result you see Um amala from pregory has been on michael noels has been on Um, not to say that, you know, like sterling cooper and mld i've been on as well So i'm not going to say it's just those guys But you'll notice that a lot of the people find I would not be surprised to see matt walsh on the show I would not be surprised to see uh, and if you haven't brian you need to get him Um, I would not be surprised to see uh, ben shapiro on this show now ben will take swipes at myron and fresh From very old very old clips, by the way He'll be happy to take swipes, but that see that's the thing is they're digging into the backlog of material of myron and fresh or they're digging into the backlog of Adam, saucenick sauce cast or value tainment when myron and fresh were on there I'm surprised they haven't dug anything out of me They know better than to come at me But they're gonna go after myron and fresh because that sounds very it sounds egregious And by the way that clip this first one right here where he smells the full time In today's day and age, you shouldn't be getting married until you're at least 35. That was my next question for you That's the smell the fart clip. Okay. Now this is off the sauce cast this was from remember this is from march of 2022 This was the month after i'd been on and i'd said i introduced myron and fresh to adam and I said hey you guys You guys need to collab you guys got to do a show together Sauce went on their show. They went on his show. This is from the one time That myron and fresh were on his show now My refresh i've also been on uh pbd, but this was the time that they were on there And this is how far in the backlog of of of shows that uh, the producers at the daily wire had to go dig so he could find something that You know somebody fart myron, did you man move down Um, but uh, let me pull that out there, uh, yeah, so I mean you're digging up old material and reacting to it In fact, by the way, I didn't even know that that was a clip Until myron said we we need to respond to this at some point So like we'll probably talk about it the next time i'm out in miami I don't know when that's gonna maybe it's probably may I think at this point but um Um, yeah, and I would love to but my the first thing out of my mouth is like this is the new grift This is the new direction. This is the new pivot for these guys so It's one thing to say, you know There's a lot of guys a lot of people coming into the sphere that have been for a long time now Some of them are more popular than others. I've been here longer than everybody So I can look at this from sort of this god's eye view and go. Okay. Um, it's predictable. I see what's happening That's why I said by august you won't recognize the manasphere Because all the people who got into it who are entertainers all the people who got in and i'm not naming names Because there's plenty of them But all the people who got into this this topic this niche The manasphere red pill intersexual dynamics, you know, uh, you know get laid get paid whatever everybody who gets into this sphere By about august"}
