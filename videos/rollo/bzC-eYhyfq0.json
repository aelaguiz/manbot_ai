Now, say my name, Heisenberg, and you're goddamn right. Now, say my name, Heisenberg, and you're goddamn right. George just wished us good luck. Producer George in the house. Yes, welcome to your very special Las Vegas edition of The Rational Male, which I rarely do here, and I'm happy to do it now because there's a few bugs and things that we have to kind of work out as we go along, but I think the overall production value is much worthwhile. We're also doing a joint venture with Dollar Cost Crypto. I have with me Miguel from DCC. And I wanted to have you on for the show because this was something that's kind of a long time coming and I want to do more shows with you, as well as Aaron Clary, because we have such a resource of guys here in Vegas. And it's like, what can we do? Every time I come down here just to do Access Vegas, I meet up with you, I meet up with Charlie. Aaron's here at least until the end of May, until he goes back to wherever he's going, back to his place. And then we have Daverick from Black Ice is here. We had him on the show last Thursday, and of course, Mike's always here. This is the best venue and resource I think that we have. And then just the very fact that you and I are here in Vegas, finally, it's funny, I feel like we're kind of finally hitting on all cylinders and it's like, now what can we do with all of this? And we're heading into the summer months, so there's a lot more potential. I mean, definitely. And I mean, there's a reason we chose Las Vegas as being a hub right here, because it is a hub. It's a major, major hub. We're getting people leaving California, coming here. And it's kind of- Stay in California. Yeah. Stay in California. Texans. Right. Go to Texas. Yes. But the cool thing about Las Vegas is it's like kind of known worldwide and everyone at some- It's a hub. It's a hub. And at some point, everyone flies here at some point. Right? Yeah. So we'll end up catching, you'll catch the most randomness people and you'll get these crazy ass interviews. I mean, even when we had Myron and Fresh out here, they were like, they were kind of originally bashing Vegas and they came here and they're like, Jesus. It's not so bad. Not so bad. Yeah. I don't think people really understand the history of you and I when we came out here to Vegas. For a while, about half of last year, I was really seriously given consideration to move into Florida. Yeah. Right? Because so many people were going, if you're going to have a podcast, you got to go either to Texas, you got to go to Nashville, or you got to go to Florida. And Florida is all Miami, South Florida. And I'd lived in Florida before and I was like, okay, maybe I can make it work down there. I was in Cape Coral and Fort Myers, which is now flattened by the last hurricane that was out there. So I'm like, maybe it's, maybe that's a sign. But you and I, right around the end of July, beginning of August said, you know what? Screw it. Let's do it in Vegas. You're already here. I was in Reno. I'm like, let's go. Let's see what we can make work. And I will tell you, man, sometimes things happen for a reason because like it's been a lot easier doing this than I ever imagined it would be like just jumping in. I thought we would have to do everything by scratch. But now we've got George here as a producer. We got the whole, this beautiful studio and this is one of two and they're opening it up into a larger one soon. So there's so much, so much potential. Like when I see stuff like this, it's like a blank canvas. We're even converting the green room into another studio as well. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, and I don't think people really realize that like your involvement also with this venture, let's just say. And so Vegas is starting to become a real, a real thing. We needed a West Coast hub and we did it. Or we're doing it. We're in the process of doing it. In the most tax advantaged way possible. Yes. Exactly. And so, but you're a hundred percent right. It started, I think it was like after our Fresh and Fit show, I think with the Avengers assemble show. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We started talking about it. Gammon was there and stuff like that. Yeah. And then the CME, the Avengers, the Avengers Unite. And then from there, me, you and Waller were actually at your house or at the vacation house in Reno. Right. Right. Right. So yeah, so I do, in fact, I should probably just make this announcement. In August, I usually host sort of a, well, I've been doing it for about a week. Okay. This year I have booked a place on the keys in Tahoe for a month. So I am invited, I have a special guest. It's just like, I don't call it, I don't even know what to call it. I need a name for it. But like I, I go there and you know, being there for a week is great cause I can bring the dogs and we have the jet skis and there's so much to do in Tahoe and it's, it's kind of a high end venue I think. Right. Yeah. Yeah. And so there's a lot of things to do. I brought Jason Hartman out there last summer and it's just, and Justin Waller's been there. Sterling Cooper's come out. You've been out. I'd love to get you and Cappy out there too as well, but I got the whole month of August. I'm thinking, I'm actually thinking about doing a meetup of some kind up there for at least one of those weeks. So I'm going to invite, it's going to be invited guests, but then I might open it up to people who want to, who want to make the trip out. Cause I mean, you got to fly out to Reno, then drive up there. Right. I mean, I was doing all these funny names like the Eagles. I'm trying to think. Yeah, I know. I'm trying to come up with like brainstorm names and stuff. I really just need to have a brainstorming session with you guys. So anyways, as part of the potential that this studio has, it's like I can work with you. I can work with Aaron and I was really hoping to have Aaron Clary on this one, but he's on his way to, he's taking a trip right now. So consider today's episode, like part one of this conversation, because I really think that this we're going to be lacking something without Cappy's influence on this cause he's the economist. He's the macro economist. He's the book of numbers guy. He's the the menu guy, which also by the way, is really great crossover for what we're going to talk about today. So I want to get into the popularity of a new topic. I think, and I really think it's a good crossover between what it is you do, like the macro economic side of things, a crypto side of things, the money side of things with the game side of things. So when we talk about like the entirety of court, you know, quote unquote, the manosphere, it's money, muscles and game, right? So I consider you on the money side, first of all, but that doesn't mean you can't like lean over like you did last week, right here in this studio. And you were on fire, man. You were like a Baptist minister throwing out a holo ghosting baby. Yes. And so I was like, damn, man. And you were talking about your humble beginnings. And I'm like, Dan, that maybe that's why I get along with Miguel, because like you still, you still have a soul. Morally, you haven't lost your soul quite yet. Give it another year. But you have humble upbringings. You still remember your family. And I mean, you're from the Latin culture and everything as well. So there's, there's that aspect to it too. But like, there's also the hard work aspect too. And I think that's really was the germ of the idea for this show was there's so many people who want to jump on the bandwagon right now about the low employment numbers with men today. And I'm going to, we're going to riff a little bit on a, on a, an interview that Chris Williamson, my favorite punching bag, Chris Williamson, I don't, I mean that in the nicest possible way I do riff on a lot of his stuff, but it's only because I see a lot of, I see a lot of his stuff and the people who he does interviews with. And I'm like, I wish I was right there. So I can say, well, you know what? That's kind of bullshit. That's kind of, let me, let me see if a yes, but kind of thing. And I don't want to, I don't want to be that guy, but Is it mostly his take or would the guests he brings on to like, to like push whatever, not agenda, but what his viewpoint is. It becomes his take. I think that's a problem is you know, it won't have me on, but it'll go and have like Robert Henderson, people who I quote constantly he'll have on the show. So I think that being on there sort of as a foil would, would be probably detrimental to his brand. But in this case, it's not just Chris though. I saw Tommy Lahren mouthing off about this about a month and a half, two months ago. I've seen this on a, I think it was Dave Ramsey was talking about talking about that. You know who Dave Ramsey is? Oh yeah. So like guys who are in the quote unquote financial sphere, but I wouldn't even really put them in the financial sphere. Maybe the George Gammon would be a good guest to bring on here too and talk about this. It's almost like pop finance almost or something. Yeah. That's a good, that's a good name for it. Pop finance. Yeah. It's just the hot story and however they can spin it. And I have, I listened when I gave you the video so you could watch it last night. And so we're going to riff on it a little bit, but that's one of probably a dozen that I was watching. And most of them are anywhere between like eight minutes and like 15 minutes. This one's a little bit longer than that. So it gives us a little bit more to sink our teeth into. But in every single one of these videos, they just dance around the same issue, which is, and I'll just throw it out there. Spoiler alert. The reason why guys don't want to get into the workforce is because they got no incentive. Why would they get into them? And so we've been building up to this generation of guys who are like, they want to say, oh, they're listless. They're lazy. They, that's why I use that. By the way, that thumbnail. Thank you very much. Yeah. Was that genius? That was a masterpiece. But I mean, it's the Cheetos guy, right? It's the stereotypical guy who lives in his mom's basement. That's see, that's the whole thing is like these guys, when they're opining about this generation of guys, they, that's the caricature of the guys that they have in their heads is the guy who's just sitting on the couch, sucking down Cheetos, can't even be bothered to get up. It just like pours a Cheetos into his face kind of thing. And I just, you know, you are in the crypto sphere. And when I, when I was with you at PulseCon, for example, the guys there don't seem like the guys in the, in the thumbnail. They don't seem like that. They're not discord mods. No. So one of the things I kind of wanted to get your opinion on as well as I, I see this as sort of a generational thing, but it's also, it's an inter sexual dynamics thing too, which no one on any video I watched wanted to say they did not want to, they did not want to go there, including the guy that we're going to, we're going to riff on a little bit here today too. It's like the 800 pound gorilla in the room. It's like guys, well, guys who are married have, have, you know, they're, they go to work more. They're more incentivized to go like, yeah, because they got bills, but they got a wife. That's why, because they were, they went along to get along and they've got, they've got the wife there and everything. And if they don't, they're going to be in for a divorce because divorce is precipitated by a guy not making as much money as his, as his wife or his girlfriend or whatever. And there's something towards the tail end of the video, it's just the spoiler alert as well, but it's, it's one of the biggest bullshit thing I've ever heard. I have to say it right now. I mean, pretty much it was just saying that there's, there was a study from this woman or something at the end there that it was pretty much saying that the, the, the, the longing to make children for men and women is more of a muscle instead of an actual like innate trait or anything like that. It's, it's like, there's a reason like people could just forget to want to have kids. Yeah, yeah, exactly. What are we talking about? What gets me is this is, and, and again, it's just goes back to stats. So people keep looking at stats independent of other stats. If you're going to be a status statistician, you have to look at stats in relation to other statistics. Right. For instance, one that I'm going to give you guys today here, and I've used this on my show before is the stat where we look at hormonal birth control, the use, the rise of the use in hormonal birth control and the rise in divorce from 1965 up through the seventies. And then it declines as marriage declines as well. So I'm sick to fucking death of listening to these guys on like on Twitter talking about like, Oh, roller's all gloom and doom and it's a, you know, divorce is actually down. I'm like, yeah, because marriage has never been at a lower rate in the history of us keeping track of marriage. Of course it's down. That's two stats. If you only look at them in isolation, one seems like good news and one seems like bad news, but they are directly correlated to one another. Correlation is not causation. I got that. But sometimes there's a hell of a freaking correlation. There's a bunch of a correlation. And then on top of that, there's a big push for UBI and things like this as well. And they're talking very negatively against UBI. But then at the same time, the powers that be are pushing UBI. Yeah. On everybody else. Oh, we got into that too. Yeah. The UBI question on there is also something else. And by the way, it was, I think it was, it's not in this interview, but it was in, I think it was a Dave Ramsey one or I watched another one where they were talking about the UBI. I think it was Megyn Kelly actually had some, oh, she was talking to Mike Rowe. It was Megyn Kelly and Mike Rowe. And they were talking towards the end of the interview. Now I'm not going to show that one, obviously, because we'll get chapped for that. But the idea that UBI is what's, or the possibility of UBI is something that is, and universal basic income for people who don't know what UBI is, is it will be just a force multiplier for these guys who just don't have any, they have no motivation, they have no reason to get, they have no purpose. And I'm sick to also sick to death of people conflating meaning with purpose. So we're going to talk about that a little bit today. Thank you very much, Jordan Peterson. Right. I mean, I guess we can play the video and stuff in terms of like, because he did say he was going into a lot of that meaning. It doesn't matter the amount of wealth. It's more like people have always worked hard, no matter like, no matter what people have always had purposes, no matter how poor they've been. But it's, it's a lot of it has to do with society and sort of these carrot and sticks we have. And there isn't that many carrots anymore for men and stuff. And this is why we're getting kind of more of like, we're getting a lot of doomers or black pillars and stuff and people who are giving up. And I think I was talking to you this before even the show started about, um, that were like you and I got a lot of the guys in the red pill and stuff like that are kind of like these outliers creating outliers. Yeah. Yeah. So, and you, then that's a good pushback too, because it's something that we sort of  to put ourselves into perspective, because it's like, what part do we play in all of this as well? So especially as teachers. And I brought this up on Rule Zero several, by the way, you can be an honorary member of Rule Zero as far as I'm concerned. I will join at some point, yeah, I'll hop on there at some point. But talking with the guys in Rule Zero, right now, influencers are the teachers of today, for better or worse, okay? I'm not saying it's a good thing or a bad thing, probably more of a bad thing than a good thing, but it is what it is. So when we tell, one of the reasons I wanted Cappy here, just to sort of like give us sort of a primer to all this, is even Aaron Clary in his book, Worthless, which was the very first book that I kind of was introduced to, is it was about the rise in men and women, because this is like back like 10, 12 years ago, maybe even 15 now I think about it. It was the rise in worthless degrees and how colleges became sort of diploma mills. And it was like, you have this, the secret to success is to get a diploma, it is to get that degree. And I think what's fun, I just read about this. Shout out to DeVry. DeVry, yeah, Phoenix University. Yeah. A full sail university, which is a good place. But no, I was listening to another, well, no, I was reading, somebody sent me, they knew I was gonna do this topic, cause we believe we are, we set this out there in advance. And somebody sent me this article about this new trend or this new rise in Indian men and women getting multiple degrees, because they figure if one's not gonna work, then they got two more sort of in the kitty right there in case they, yeah, in the pocket. And I'm like, well, if you got one useless degree, what's three more? Like, whatever, where are you gonna direct yourself? But it's not so much the degrees, it's the idea that if you have them in the first place, it's going to better, you're gonna have a better way, you're gonna be more marketable or more hireable, I guess, as an employee. And this is what we teach people in the crypto space is that you have to be very counterintuitive to make money. So when everyone is talking about it, that's not when you get in. You get in when no one's talking about it, right? So when these degrees were very, very valuable, 50s, 60s, 70s, I would say up to like early 90s, even early 90s and stuff, they were very valuable because it was more of an IQ test. And most people, cause there was a lot more, there was a lot more lower to entry, like barriers or entry jobs where people could start their career and then actually grow into a very high paying job. You really didn't need college. But because there were so few college graduates at the time, you, when you had a college degree, even in English, just an English degree, you were like, wow, this guy's, he finished four years of college, he's smart, he's got at least a bachelor's. And that would put you in a position of like, wow. That's what Mike Rowe was saying when he was doing his interview with Megyn Kelly was, it's not so much, he's a smart guy. He's kind of like salt of the earth smart. He's wise. Let's just say he's wise. He's definitely wise. And I know that he's got a podcast now. Some people, I mean, love him or hate him. When he was talking to Megyn Kelly, he made a lot of sense, but at least in analyzing the problem, the only thing he wouldn't talk about is what I'm gonna talk about today, which is the real, the 800 pound gorilla in the room that none of these talking heads wants to address. He's got the contract with Disney. Oh yeah, well, and it was on Fox News or whatever Megyn Kelly's news thing is now. But now because these degrees have become like three mils basically, they're not, they're dime a dozen. I've actually heard a lot of people say like, I'd rather hire someone with just a high school diploma than someone with an actual degree. Now, obviously I'm not talking about an engineer or a doctor or a lawyer or something specific, but most degrees are bullshit basically. And I figured that out pretty early on, but I mean, there was a ton of social programming where I felt like, I felt for a long time, I said this on my stream the other day, like I felt for like two, three years, but until I was about 22 years old, I felt like a kind of a failure because this is in the immigrant community. And so you don't get a degree, you wasted- It's the American dream, right? Yeah, the American dream. You wasted your parents' effort and stuff. You are a failure. You're gonna be a ditch digger your whole life. All the sacrifices mom and dad made to get here, and now you're like throwing it away. And stuff now. And that's like a sort of a spit in their face, right? I mean, at least that's the narrative. The American dream narrative of it. Yeah, so I was watching the Mike Rowe, Megyn Kelly thing, and again, they were talking about this listless, lazy, and they never talk about, it's always the men, right? It's always dudes. It's not guys, like women are like completely, I mean, not completely, but like maybe 10% of the conversation is the ladies. And then it's all about these lazy guys sitting on the couch, eating Cheetos, living in mom's basement, jerking off to porn, ordering Uber Eats, and then of course, and I'm glad they addressed this part of it anyways, which is the idea that these guys are also sedating themselves with pornography and weed, and prescription drugs as well, statistically speaking. They quote those statistics. They don't quote other statistics, but they'll quote that statistic, which is true. And then they'll quote, if you go and you take those stats and you compare them, say, to suicide stats, which we just talked about on Rule Zero last Saturday, if you haven't, if you didn't see that one, it's kind of serious stuff. It's like heavy stuff. I think we can go from Access Vegas and have the back of this red meat show, and then like literally two days later, we're talking about male suicide. So that's the beauty. And one thing I do, I mean, I shouldn't say this, but the one reason I do like these suicide rates in terms of like the reporting on it is because I think they're very real numbers compared to, a lot of other numbers are- It's unignorable and it's great headlines. So they like saying the real number with it. There's no political reason not to say like, why are these people killing themselves, right? So the number, I feel like the numbers are very real and it's probably, we could probably look at the suicide rates and we can make us some sort of a multiple and that can actually tell us listless people. Yeah, I've been, again, doing the sort of the background for this show, looking at the idea of like STEM degrees versus like useless degrees versus going to trade school and that kind of stuff. Of course, that's what Mike Rowe's talking about. But I think the main thing that really kind of sets off the trad con set is that they can drive down the street and they can see all these help wanted, help wanted, help wanted. And it's like, yeah, but they're for delivery driver at Domino's, right? They're low wage, low- Roll low. They're there. How dare you, how dare you like demean these people and stuff, but like, this is kind of to the larger issue of the whole social media thing that we were talking about earlier was that it, I guess just to start this off, right? I mean, like the video kind of starts off eventually saying that like the birth, I mean, like not the birth rate, but basically listless men have been increasing since the 1950s, right after World War II, sort of like at a very tiny rate. And then it's dramatically increased in the 60s, 70s and just kept going like a hockey stick, right? And I think it largely has to do with three things, right? The population of the TV, TV first, the pill, internet. And then from there- We're gonna come back to the pill quite a bit. We're gonna come, yeah, the pill's a lot. And I didn't know, I thought the pill came out in the 60s, but apparently the 50s. It came out in the 50s, but it wasn't popularized and it wasn't actually put into like sort of mass production. It wasn't the pill until like about 1965-ish, like the mid 60s. Planned Parenthood sort of thing? Well, yeah, I mean, that was, that followed in the wake of it. But like you have to, and again, it's something I've done quite a bit of research on is hormonal birth, HBC, hormonal birth control. And what happened in the wake of that? And as people know, if you watch my show, I've been doing a series, I've been working up, I'm this close to actually making it a book, but I've been writing quite a bit about the year 1971. And there's actually a few Twitter accounts that I follow, like what the fuck happened in 1971, right? Well, I can tell you what happened in 1971 because it's smack dab in the middle of a decade that had the most social unrest and social upheaval worldwide, by the way, and not just in the United States, primarily in Western state or Western countries. But we'll follow the tracks. It's like you say, follow the money, follow the HBC. And you look at the sexual revolution that came right in the wake of that. You look at how sexual mores, morals and stuff were loosened and more unrestricted and more unfettered, let's just say, as a result of the fact that women were confident that they didn't have to worry about getting pregnant if they had sex with the right guy or the wrong guy. Or the wrong guy, or the wrong guy for the right reason. Yeah, exactly. I'm looking, I see, did I get? That is crazy, you said the 70s too, because that's around the time as well when the US went off the gold standard. The dollar started inflating. We can get into that too if you want. So I'll just give you the brief, because I have stats and everything here too, but just briefly, if you go and you look at what happened in the decade between, the 10 year period, between 1965 and 1975. So 1965 really is when HBC starts becoming a thing. And then you got miniskirts and you got the free love generation, and you got Woodstock, and you got what we would stereotypically call the boomers, right? And they were, I saw Rob Henderson had put something on Twitter not too long ago about how that in the wake of hormonal birth control or the sexual revolution, it was really about the cultural shift, or it was about like the baby boomers like flipping the bird to the greatest generation, to their parents who were actually fought World War II. And I think that's a mistake to just lay it out at the feet of just sort of this intergenerational kind of like anxiety or conflict, because I don't really think it's just that. I think it's primarily because we get one invention, change the world. And so it unilaterally put human reproduction in the control of women, or more or less, and now much more, but like back then, and I don't think they really realized what they were doing. They just want to get off, man. We want to have sex without having to worry about pregnancy that never in human history we have to really worry about that, at least on that scale. Right. I know people will say, well, there was contraception before that, and Cleopatra used, I don't know, some kind of special herbal blend of tea, and yeah, exactly. Hemlock will kill anything, yeah, whatever. I love all those old reports of all those teas and plants that used to cause abortions, but the Romans ended up, I forgot the name of the plant, but basically they drove that plant to extinction. As a result of trying, yeah. To use it. To use it as a form of contraception, yeah. And then you got to remember, even latex condoms weren't even available until I would say the 40s. Certainly during World War II, I think, is when they had them, but I'm not really sure. And only pretty, not rich, I wouldn't say rich men, but pretty well-off men could maybe use goat intestine as a condom, it's just crazy. Let's just say HBC changed the game. Correct. So if you look at 1965 to 1975, that's just from my wheelhouse, that's a game changer. It's also a society changer. So what happened in 1968? That's when the no-fault divorce was passed in California, courtesy of Ronald Reagan, thank you. Governor Ronald Reagan at that time. And this astrologist. And yeah, and this astrologist, yeah. Yes, don't worry, Gary the numbers guy is going to be sitting right over here in just a week's time, just settle down, Francis. So 1968, the first instance of no-fault divorce. Right. Why was it then? Why not before? Why not after? I can tell you exactly why. Do you know why? Do you know why it was in 1968? Please let me know. Because the rise in divorces that happened in the wake of the pill created such a glut of divorces that they had to find some more efficient way to process divorces in the state of California at that time. So if you look, and I'll show you the stats here and just to say, can you, actually, let me just show you this one real quick. This is a real easy one. And these divorces were primarily only in the boomer generation and basically, grab that, not the greatest generation and stuff. No, this is boomer generation. I'm gonna show you, this is actually a really good area. If you can throw that up for me. There you go. Okay, so this is the divorce rate. Sorry for the clarity here. This is the divorce rate and oral contraception use. Remember what I told you about how we had to look at variables. You have to look at two data points to sort of make a correlation. If you're looking at things in isolation, you can make up any story you want to, but here we have 1960 through, let's say 2010 here. If you look right around 1965, that's where the spike in divorce rates starts taking off. If you look at women using the pill right around 1960, which is still maybe like four or five years prior to the divorce rate spiking, right around 1968 right there, you'll see where the red line goes up. So, and you're looking at the amount of divorces per, you know, contrasted, let's just say, with the divorce rate. Correlation is not causation, but that's one hell of a freaking correlation right there. And they don't view this chart ever. No, they never, of course not. Because they're only interested in what's like, you know, what's popular and what's going off on, what, you know, what they want to talk about. Do you think it's largely because it would bring some negative publicity on the pill? It's unflattering to women's nature because what happens is, in the wake of the sexual revolution, what do we get? We got this sort of a loosening of sexual morality. Then you get Playboy, and then you get Penthouse, and then you get Hustler, and then you get, you know, porn movies in the 70s, you know, the Bow Chicka Bow Bow ones. Yeah. Wrong Jeremy. Yeah, and you had to go play. I mean, it was seedy, and you had to make an effort to actually go do that. Now you don't have to make that effort anymore here in the 21st century. But people want to get off. I mean, there was a quote I literally read this morning and stuff. He's like, you used to have to go out of the house to cheat, and now you can do it on your phone, on the couch next to your spouse. Yeah, exactly, more or less. Or the virtual experience of it. You used to have to go to, yeah, exactly. You used to have to go to a theater to see Deep Throat, right? Marilyn Chambers or whatever the hell, you know? The whole Pee Wee Herman way. Yeah, exactly. The whole Pee Wee Herman way. Thanks for that. Thank you for bringing that man now that's in my head. I contribute to the show greatly, you guys, I promise. So that's 1968. So right around 1968, you see the glut of divorces that happened, well, it makes sense that it would be better and easier if we could just process those that much faster."}
