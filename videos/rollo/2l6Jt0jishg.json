I only have one rule. Everyone fights, no one quits. You don't do your job, I'll shoot you. Do you get me? We get you, sir! Welcome to the Roughnecks. People told me I would have new people on this podcast. Welcome to the Roughnecks. Roll us up, Nicks. That's not a new intro. I have some new intros, though. See any good podcasts lately? Live from Reno, Nevada, this is Rationale. My secret bunker deep in the Nevada high desert. Somewhere in the Bureau of Land Management where the wild Mustangs roam. Yes, thank you very much. Oh boy, here we go. This is going to be a fun one. This is going to be a lively one today. Just saying. Actual statistical studies where they took thousands of people, put them on dates. It was in the UK where they do this study. They put them on these blind dates, and then they match the blind dates on the succession to whether or not they get a second or third date. And they correlate that by astrological science. And do you know what the answer is? Because I'm sure you do. What is the correlation? Zero. Zero. I don't know. Mother. Zero. It is zero point zero zero. Astrological science mean nothing. They mean absolutely nothing. You do, but you're right. It does have an effect. Are you a good buyer, sir? Oh my gosh, you said Libra. It's such a Libra thing to say. Once in a while, the universe will send you what I like to call a unicorn opportunity. Unicorns are magical, mystical creatures, and so they only come every once in a while. And so if the universe is giving you a unicorn opportunity, and it's right in front of you, and you don't jump on that opportunity and take action on it, you're stopping your momentum. But when you jump on that unicorn, even when you're scared, you do it anyway, and you ride on that unicorn, you're going to create some form of momentum. Why do you guys care so much about body count? Because, like, I'm a strong and independent woman, and I'm also oppressed, so I should be able to do whatever I want. Okay, tell me exactly how you're oppressed. I shouldn't have to explain it to you like you should already know, because, like, I'm a strong and independent woman who is somehow also oppressed, and I demand respect. Right. Okay, just tell me what you did last night. Uh, yeah, stranger 4559. Uh, yeah, respect me. Yeah. Yeah, I'm a strong and independent woman, and I'm also oppressed. Okay, like, the only thing that matters is that, like, I'm a strong and independent woman who is also oppressed, and guys should, like, just be okay giving me money so that I could be a total whore. Explain why men care about body count. I got it. I haven't told you the reasons why men care about it. You don't have to mansplain it to me, I'm okay. Mansplain? That's kind of a sexist thing to say. That's sexist to say mansplain? You're literally a white man looking at me, telling me, like, if you can't see how you being a white man has anything to do with, like, the power you have in conversation, then I don't even want to, like, talk about that. What does my skin color have to do with this conversation? We're talking about body count. Yeah, okay, nothing. Don't you think it's a bit racist to bring up skin color in a conversation, a dating related conversation? I'm just going to ignore your comment. You said it, so I'm trying to understand. No, it's okay. You said the words. I don't want to dig deeper into this. You don't want to dig deeper? I really don't. Do you want to walk back what you said? No, that's okay. Okay, you stand by it? We can move on. Hmm, yeah, and that's when I realized that, like, if I don't experience life the way I want to experience it, then, like, how am I ever going to learn? Exactly. Right? And so that's why I started My OnlyFans. And, like, I was like, oh, I'm self-employed now. I'm an entrepreneur. Like, I get to fuck guys on camera. Totally. Like, forget about the spreadsheets. Like, I'm spreading my legs, right? Like, I started to get, like, so comfortable in my own skin. Oh, yeah. You know what I mean? And other guys were getting comfortable cumming on my skin. So I'm like, okay, like, in my brain, in my existence, I realized, like, oh, this is for me. This is my color. 100%. Right? And so I was like, okay, I've got to deep throat the shit out of life. I agree. I'm some girl boss shit. Okay? And I start to manifest. I was like, oh, like, if I manifest, like, literally a festival of men exploding all over me, then, like, I'm winning at life. For sure. You know what I mean? And so I was like, oh, okay, like, you got to take action. You know? Like, if you don't take action, you can't let things happen to you. Like, you have to literally make them happen. You're so right. Right? So I was like, okay, I've got to start doing more of what I love, which is cock. I swear to God, we need more parodies of this shit. I really do. I heard this Bumble put out a study that said 90% of women on Bumble set their profiles to only include men six feet and above. All right. 90%, which I guess makes me not a feminist anymore, dude. I quit, dude. Because I was out there, dude. I marched, okay? I marched for your little 20 cents or whatever. I was out there, dude. I couldn't see anything, but I marched, all right? I was on someone's shoulders, but I fucking marched for your bitches. Would you turn off your Instagram, turn off your OnlyFans, turn off your Facebook, turn off all your social media if you found the right bro, if you found the guy who's like, I'm ride or die, man. This is the dude for me. Would you do that? And the number one answer every single time we ask this is, of course, no, it's offensive. It means you're an incel. Because what will happen is it's them confronting a cognitive dissonance. That cognitive dissonance is this, is that it's threatening to not have social media. It's threatening to not have a basis for which they can advertise their sexuality. And I'll tell you why that is, because it's actually inherent. It's like inherent to women's mating strategy. So to question it, it forces them to actually consider it. Don't look up. Kaleidos is king. He's a bro. Need to perform to qualify for intimacy. What that does is it turns men, especially in the 21st century, turns them into salesmen. And we've always been kind of salesman pitchman, right? Like, select me. Choose me. Choose this dick right here. Here, let me tell you, it's on sale today. You know, twenty nine ninety five. And wait, there's more. You know, I've got a great job and I like dogs and I like to take long walks on the beach. So that the guys is usually men are pitching. Not well, let's just say 80 to 90 percent of guys are pitching. They are putting themselves out there. They end up becoming salesmen. Women are marketers. They're advertisers. They don't have to go and sell a product. They can if they want. And we know where that goes. But for the most part, they advertise their sexuality. So they. And this is this is Roll Tomasi, the brand manager here. This is from 20 plus. A massive reduction in the amount of short term sex that people are having. And also you have declining marriage rates and family rates. The number of men reporting no sex in the last year has tripled from 8 percent to 28 percent from 2008 to 2018. This is men between the ages of 18 and 30. Short term sex has declined. It's also declined for women as well, but a little bit more for men. For the first time in history, 50.1 percent of women are childless at 30. And a report from Reuters says that 45 percent of prime working age women between 22 and 45 will be single and childless by 2040. What that. Wrong. Let me stop you right there, Chris. You are misquoting the Morgan Stanley rise of the fem. Or excuse me, the rise of the she economy. And those numbers are incorrect, sir. I'll correct you later. Short term sex and long term mating seem to be on the decline, which is crazy in a world of tender and Facebook and Instagram. Correct. How is the ease of access to other partners increasing while what actually occurs in the real world seems to be dropping down? Right, right, right. Hey, what's happening, guys? There we go. How's it going? There we go. Say my name. Howdy. Howdy. Howdy. Oh, boy. How are we doing today, guys? How are we doing? How are we doing? Let's move the camera a little bit differently. Every time I come back from. From an outside podcast, although I guess it was my podcast, I should shut up. Anyways, how are we doing? How are we doing? Let's see who's in the chat. Who do we have today? I've got OK. Man, you guys are already on top. Sam Bata is dropping the band hammer. He is my mod today. I think she's in there as well. Tori will probably show up at some point when she wakes up, wherever she is. Look, look, it works. Yes. I got the other I got the other angle working right now. Pretty soon this will be the the I just have to like get the raise it up a little bit. But then this will be like my my horns. Can I see if I can get it right here on set? I'm trying to get the horns. I'm trying to get this one. I can get the if I could just get the angle right, I could probably get the horns on the the Cytheria once again. And yes, I've got it's the return of the return of the destroyer base because I've been using the four string actually instead of five strings. Anyways, yes, pod class is in session. How's it going? Welcome, welcome, welcome, guys. So I wanted to let's see, start off with a few things here. I wanted to point out the reason why I put Chris Williamson's clip as the ending clip there is because I feel like merch. I feel like I feel like we are getting to the point right now in the sphere where we're playing the telephone game. You guys are playing the telephone game when you were kids, like you'd sit in a circle or whatever, or you get a bunch of bunch of people in class and was meant to show you like how rumors get started and how things sort of get get mashed up. Well, though, of course, what it is is like you are told like somebody tells you something and it's like in order or it's an act, you know, in the accurate form. And you're supposed to take that message and you're supposed to have whispered in the guy's next person's ear, the next kid's ear or whatever. And by the time it comes around, yeah, ring, ring. By the time it comes around, then the message has changed from like the first kid all the way to the 10th kid. And we're the 10th kid right now. I should say that. No, actually. Let's see. Chris Williamson is the the ninth kid telling the 10th kid about the rise of the she economy. Thank you very much. You know what? You should say my name. Thank you very much. No, Chris, it's not 45 percent. It's 42 percent. And it's by 2030. That was not Reuters. And it is not single and child. This is just single. That is. And I've been trying to, you know, push you guys, even if you're not in. I'm not in the man's fear. I'm not red pill. Then stop quoting shit like that. Please. And there goes my monetization. Stop quoting stuff like that from the get from the rip. OK, I you know, Adam Sosnick has done this, but he's not the only one. There's other people as well. Here we have Chris. Chris Williamson. I know I seem like an anal retentive a hole when I'm asking for a little bit of accuracy. That's why when you're on like a very large when you have that kind of audience, accuracy is key. And so when I start talking about, you know, why it is that the man's fear says certain things or what the Maxim's book that I'm working on. Thank you very much. It's coming along nicely now. But the reason why I'm right, I feel like I feel I feel like I have to write that. God damn it. I have. No, I don't feel I know I have to write this book so I can avoid that so that when people go, hmm, where did that come from? Where are those stats from? It's not Reuters, bro. It's not Reuters. It's Morgan Stanley. Rise of the she economy. That's where it came from. But you've heard it from me or you heard it from somebody else in the sphere who doesn't even who won't cite sources. You guys jump up my ass for nothing. He really doesn't say it. Any sources? I cite sources all the damn time, so much so that I catch stuff like that. So when I and but I get run, I get run up, I get run up the flagpole for being a dick about that. Sorry, not sorry. I have to do that. Nobody says that anymore. Sorry. Sorry. What did you like? Oh, viral shorts. Rolling your show on Axis Vegas was doing excellent until you let a kid with dynamite and mirey canes run your show. Plus, well, let's explain a few things. I know we're going to have to we're going to have to sort of break things down a little bit there. I have to explain to you like what the what the point what the the mechanics and the logistics. Like I said, there's a lot of moving parts when you do a show of that caliber. We decided from the rip that it was going to be a fresh and fit show. And, you know, just because I'm I'm promoting it on Axis Vegas, it's in our studio, not my personal studio, but the studio that we use is called Sticky Paws. I do not own that studio. So. You know, it's despite popular opinion. So I do not actually own that studio. That is a it's a commercial studio. I definitely pay a membership for it. We pay hourly. So does Miguel. So people people got all over me the other day saying like, oh Rollo says he's a one-man show, but then he's got he's got he's got what you call it. He's got producers. I got Travis. I've George George is another guy. That's one of the producers. Then there's Chase. There's a few other guys. Those are those are generally the three guys that do the production for our show. Yeah, I do when I'm paying for studio time. That's part. I got to pay the bills. I got to pay my people. Sure, but I there that's at the studio man. They don't follow me around. They're not George Travis. Please come up to Reno. I need your help. I'm still like here. Look, I have to I have to do that myself, right? I got to press the button to get back and forth. I am the producer here. I am the law. So what you got here? Let's see. You were called it just pearly Adam 22 pivoting going political black Manosphere cutting ties with Pearl. Yep, and we're going to talk about that one today too. That's in the in the video list right now. Oh, yeah, we're going to go there. What else do we have? What you got? Oh, here we go. When are you going back on sauce guys? I don't know if they if they want me to I did talk to I have talked to Adam since since our my blow. I took that I took that video down for a variety of different reasons and no Adam Sosnick is not like trying to sue me for like anything for you know, copyright infringement or or libel or anything like that. No, that was somebody else who will go nameless. But hey, that's the way you want it. So I took it down anyways. Um, but no Adam had nothing to do with that and I took it down for a variety of different reasons. Yep. Oh, wait, wait. Oh, this is so good. Thank you moose for for creating. What what is this your 80th account now? Well, well, thanks for having my back bro. No, it's I you know, I don't want to I don't want to throw too much at oh, hey, oh new member. Thank you. Wait, wait, wait. We need a new member thing. Hey, what should be the new member here? That'll be the new member thing. Yeah, we're going to talk about that a little bit today. I'll tell you the thing that guy get that I ate a lot of you know shit for was calling out Pearl for having Nick Fuentes on the show. And again, I didn't necessarily care so much about the fact she can have whoever I'm not telling anybody how to God forbid now, I'm not telling anybody ever again how to run their own damn show especially after last Thursday, but it wasn't it wasn't necessarily although now it is but it wasn't at that time. It wasn't necessarily the having Nick on the show. It was the fact that she was trying to explain that she didn't know who he was now. We know that that is bullshit categorically bullshit. And yes, I saw the I saw the video with with was it? Was it mediocre tutorials for what is the guy's name? I don't know. I always call him empty. But he came out Pearl pretty hard and we're going to sort of I'll break that down. I won't do the whole damn thing because it's I think it's like 20 minutes long. I'm not going to dig too too deep into that. The actual theme of today's show is is I wanted to dig into a section of dr. David bus is conversation with Joe Rogan recently because it's a show that I've been wanting to have with Mike Sartain. So think of this as a Michael if you're watching also think of this as sort of like a primer to the show that I would like to have with you so we can have this discussion. I want to get into the nuts and bolts of the differences between what dr. David bus calls mate shift or make switching shifting switching hypothesis versus ovulatory shift and do the dual mating strategy. I'm going to dig into that today. That's actually going to be the the primary direction of today what you got here. Myron is very direct. Yeah. Yeah, he does. And I wanted to also point out that going into a going into a somebody else's podcast right where you don't know the variables. I mean, I understand like we we told Myron from the from the rip that I mean it's his show. It was on fresh and fit. He has a much larger audience than we'd well certainly access Vegas. Now my audience is what am I at two hundred two hundred and eight thousand subs. Okay, organic subs. And yes, I know or subs are a vanity metric but still that's the way people like to you know, measure the quality of a show but he obviously has a much larger market share than access Vegas does because we're playing to about a thousand live views and he's playing to about 14,000 high views. So it's his show from that point. We ran it that way. He we ran it just or he ran it just like a fresh and fit show. So it's a while they didn't collect cell phones like they usually do. It was like, please put them out turn them off. You know, you put them in your purse, whatever. I'm not going to take them from you, but we don't want that distraction going on. So that was number one. See that's how we run things a little bit differently on access Vegas. We are okay with the girls having their cell phones because they like to watch you guys. They like to watch the chat. They really if they're watching the chat, that's one thing. If they're getting, you know, text or whatever and they look bored or whatever. Yeah, then that's I can understand that but the girls like to watch the chat and we're okay with that because we want them to respond to the chat. That's actually part of like our show. That's not part of fresh and fit. So that was number one number two. There's a history with Toy Hardy and and the boys and I did not realize that until it was too late. I wanted to make sure that everybody understood that. Thank you. Yeah, those are pretty good. That's a that's Klytus is king. You can go to find him. He follows me. I just all you got to really do is just like Klytus is king on like on Instagram and Twitter. He's not he's all over the place. He's a really good friend. He's a friend of the show and I don't know why he got banned. He is banned because he said he can't comment on the show. I have to figure out what's going on with that. But Klytus if you're watching I will definitely unban you if that's the case. I didn't think you were but who knows maybe I have some overzealous mods. So anyways, the yeah, I mean is a distraction sometimes but if the girls are like watching the chat, which is what I do more or less what on every show you'll see my phone is there on a rack and I'm watching the chat. I have to I mean, I want to make sure that I'm getting to the you know, the spicy super chats because I really feel that's the primary interest in what I call engagement media, right? Which is what we're doing right now. We're engaging in engagement media. So yeah, I the the criticism was primarily that Myron was a little too confrontational like unnecessarily confrontational and I can sort of get that but I also I can understand that but I can also sort of get that as well. The reason why there was conflict between Myron and freshman Toy Hardy is because she was Mike Rasheed's ex and she was she really wanted to come on the show. I met her at Babes and Toyland the weekend before once. I think she'd figured out who I was and then also discovered that we were going to have Myron and fresh in the studio in Vegas. She really really wanted to be in and I was like, oh great. Well, you know more than Mary or let's have her and she wants you flew her flew in from Hollywood or from LA just to do that show and now I know why because I there is some history with her breaking up with I think they were together for I don't know the details. I don't pretend to know the details but I do know that there is a backstory there and it made much more sense once she got to the studio and a lot of stuff went on like before and then after the show as well. So but before you guys go and you know pass judgment on the whole show understand there's a lot that went on behind the scenes that you guys really don't know about so Rolo. Do you think the Red Queen hypothesis can be applied in the SMPD? Yes, I can actually and the selfish gene, although that's another bull actually. Well, okay. So the Red Queen by Matt Ridley excellent book. You won't want one of my top 10 books. That's one of them the Red Queen by Matt Ridley and it's it's a little bit older now. So I have to sort of qualify that it's it's a little older but I mean the principles are more or less the same in foundations. It's still I think a valid book but and and yes can absolutely be applied to the sexual Marketplace today people kept asking me about like my top 10 books maybe towards the end of the show. I'll at least like rattle off five or six of them today. But at some point I probably will do a full book show. I have now also explain why I have a hesitation about doing those things because I think a lot of people look for answers and solutions to their problems in a book when and I'm not saying that please read my book, right? But it's also in the application. Is that book applicable? Can you take what you is the information in that actionable and are you going to implement that that I think is almost more important than actually reading the book. So we'll talk about that later. Thanks for being on. Yeah. Well, I tried, you know, I think a lot of people thought well, you know, Rolo and Mike are just sitting there with the dicks in their hand and they're not saying anything. It's their show. No, we ran it as if it was a fresh and fit show. They have a much bigger audience than we do. And yeah, we were kind of in a we're kind of in a in a bite, right? We've never had a castling on our show. In fact, that was part of our sort of was a mission statement, but our Charter anyways is not to kick girls off. We have, you know, I think that was actually the most girls we've had on any show. So when we've got 10, it's hard man. I think we had like nine nine girls and then us. I mean it was a little it's 11 11 people were on were on that show. Maybe it was less than that. Maybe it was like I think was like eight girls in us somewhere along there anyways, but yeah, it was it was a it was a learning experience for sure. But that's not our chart like we have a different show than my you want to know like people say, oh, you guys are just trying to be like the Vegas version of fresh fit. No, and I think that the last show pretty much explains why we're not so people think oh you you don't go hard enough on the girls. Well, if if you're if your favorite show is Myron and Fresh and for your favorite shows, whatever podcast your favorite show is, you know, where there's a potential for the girls to like either, you know Castle themselves or get Castle as well. Maybe we're not the show for you. We that's why we're not like that. So we're kind of in a tough spot, you know, it's their show and Myron can run it. However, he wants to and we said, you know from the get-go Myron, it's it's on you man. And I did if you you'll notice that the access Vegas show went for the first hour of the three hour plus show and once we hit the hour mark, then we killed my stream and then it was just on my on fresh and fit at that point. It's a fresh and fit show. So and it's is it Mike's friends? Yes, it is. A lot of people say well, we should have kicked off Myron like like imagine where our position is where Myron's running the show and we're like, is she going to leave? Is she not going to leave? I mean, she she took up, you know took off on her own. So it worked out but like from the get-go she was already kind of conference. She like Toy Hardy was very confrontational with Myron and I knew that was I knew probably within the first five minutes that that was what's going to happen. So there you go. I tried to I try to stay humble. I really do. It's hard. It's hard to be a Rolex Max for Asians. Okay, K-pop K-pop Max. Don't don't do it. Please don't do it. Yes. I know what K-pop is. Unfortunately, you know how I know what K-pop is because what is it Tim Henson from Polyphia was like I just he's like very popular to that set and I know who Tim Henson is and so I'm like well lost all respect for her on the age thing, but I really hated her when she made a stupid comment about having cancer. If you're a weak man big L. Okay. What else you got here? Throw that out. I love the FNF access Vegas. I thought it was a good show overall. I thought it was I would love to I'd like to do it again, but like, you know sort of get the right people on there. By the way. Oh, let me finish here. I knew the girl who refused to say her age was trouble. Yeah, and you'll notice that every other girl was just completely okay with saying that. So at that point, I think really what that was was sort of a battle of the egos. It wasn't even so much age. I think it was who was going to establish frame and Myron was establishing frame and he knows how to do that and he will he's actually very he's very practiced at that and very good at it. Myron should also realize hypergamy isn't a straitjacket Myron tends to speak in absolutes. Yeah, but sometimes necessarily so because it's hard to get a point across that's you want to know gosh, man. You really want my opinion on this. I'll give you my opinion. I don't like to do opinions or judgments, but I will I will point out here the see like contrast. Let's let's contrast fresh and fit versus like say someone like Brian from whatever podcast who is starting and starting to go up. I think I think Brian is probably going to overtake Pearl there very soon and probably because Pearl's kind of dropped the ball recently, but Brian's already, you know getting Michael Knowles on there and getting, you know, sort of like he's kind of like playing to I don't say the lowest common denominator, but he knows he's starting to figure out how the game is played and but if you look at the difference like say between Brian who is the host of whatever podcast and you contrast that with Myron Brian's not going to say okay bitch get off the show like that's not going to happen. He doesn't Frank have a castle them. So there's been women who like like walk off sure the castle themselves and he's like, okay, whatever, you know, whatever part whatever but he's not confrontational in that sense when you look at Myron and fresh. It's good cop bad cop. You got Myron who is the bad cop or the you know, the task master, right? He's the one who's going to lay down the law fresh is there to just kind of like, you know, what's going on? What he's kind of like that fresh kind of that's why I call Fred. He's got that kind of I don't say naivete, but it's not really naivete. It's"}
