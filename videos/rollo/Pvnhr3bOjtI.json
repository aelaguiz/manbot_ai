Yes, it's the Rule Zero live stream you didn't know you needed this morning on my channel. Roll Tommasi, savior of YouTube bannings everywhere. Gentlemen, are we, how are we doing this morning? A little bit better. Waking up tomorrow to a strike on YouTube. Yeah. So what happened? So explain to the people playing the home game what happened there. Yeah, I do learn to fight video series where I'm breaking down street fights and self-defense scenarios and telling people what they should and shouldn't have done. And I always get put behind the 18-year-old wall and then demonetized. So I never make any money on them. So I was like, you know what? Screw it. I'm just going to do these live streams, save myself production time and editing. And I did. And then, you know, it worked. It was really good this week. It was the first time I did it this week and it was nice. And then I wake up this morning and YouTube gives me a strike for one of my videos because it was a teenage kid knocking out his teacher. Oh, Jesus. And she started it, though. She pushed him first. Did he win? I'm not condoning it. And it was dumb. You know, it was dumb. I'm just like, oh, they're standing too close. This is a bad idea. Don't put your hands on people. It's educational, 100% educational. And nope, it's not allowed. It's mean. So I'm probably going to have to do that stuff. I might move that stuff fully over just to Rockfin because they don't I can I can I can say the N word and stuff over there. No one cares. Yeah. What's wrong with YouTube? No, man. Yeah. Some blue haired person with one hundred fifty thousand dollars worth of student loan debt is like, no, this is inappropriate. Fifty thousand. Inappropriate. Oh, man. You guys remember the religious right of the 80s and how that's just gone under. I mean, it's just you're right. Although Jordan's right. Moral majority. Yeah. That's the liberal majority. What's that? Did you post that picture? The meme? It was like things to worry about with when legalizing gay marriage. And then they had a list actually came true. World War Three teaching kids about sex in grade school. Yeah. Oh, my God. I saw that, too. I was like, is this for real? And somebody like doctor this up? No, that's actually a slippery slope is real. And all those all those. I mean, you were right. No, I'm going to share this. I want to share the screen with you. The whole reason for the this video, this guy. Can you see that? Yeah. Yeah. Can you? Yeah. Do I have to play that? I have to play. Okay. Yeah. As long as I can get me banned for it. That's fine. I need to grow up. And many to stop being cowards. Come on. Secondly. It's your fault. A woman walking down the street, minding her business. You approach her. You say everything that, you know, she would like to hear. I've seen her defenses down. Once her defenses are lowered, you then go in there, take what you want. And then you leave. Leave and repeat the cycle elsewhere. You do it again. You do it again. You do it again. You do it again. The sad music. The men who follow you now have to do the work. To help heal these women. These women end up destroying these men because they don't know how to believe in God. They're worthy of love. Because what you've done to them. He's done to them that they bear had to live with the scars that you have. Inflicted on these women. There is, there's a domino effect here. The other thing, a lot of guys don't realize and practicing this behavior is that. There's a karmic consequence to this. You don't get away with it. You never get away with it. So you find many guys who are out here playing these games. At some point decide I'm ready to settle down. I'm ready to do the right thing. And what, what do they want? What do they want? They want a woman with no. No past issues with no baggage. With no troubles, with no, with no issues. You get that woman. Because of who you are. And because you have. Triggered a set of consequences. She might end up hurting you. Even worse than you hurt the other people, because of who you are. Is teaching her how to treat you. Yes. Yes. Ladies and gentlemen. They're the ones that trick and fool them. They don't make decisions for themselves. It's all our fault. We got to save the hose. Save those man. Thank you. Thank you guys. I use this. I use this video. I think it was it was Hafiz, I think Hafiz was talking about. He had this analogy. So people don't like whenever I use this analogy, people go, what the fuck is we're talking about? But I think it was like about eight months ago, maybe even nine months ago. Hafiz from the roommates who is now quote, unquote, retired from the red pill, but not really retired from the red pill. He was talking about, he made this analysis, analogy and he said, you never make metaphors or analogies online, just saying. But in this case, I thought it was actually kind of apt, but in he was right or he was right, but for the wrong reasons. But his analogy was licking the ice cream and licking the ice cream analogy. Go something like this. Okay. Imagine an ice cream store and it's a 31 flip Baskin Robbins. Right. So, and all of these ice cream, like, you know, you go into Baskin Robbins and you're like, Oh, I'm going to go to Baskin Robbins. And there's like a big giant, you know, tub of ice cream or whatever. And they're all fresh. They all have the little seal on top and everything. And only certain guys are allowed to go into the ice cream store. And those guys go in the ice cream store and then they proceed to take the lids off of every one of these little tons of ice cream, like the ice cream. Right. And, and, and, and, and eat it up and lick it. And then they leave. Right. And then when regular average guys. Can get into the ice cream store, then they find that all the ice cream's already been licked. And it's like, it's like nobody wants the ice cream. That's already been licked because somebody cuts their dirty ass germs all over it. And it's ruined the ice cream. The analogy is that exactly what this guy was just talking about a minute ago. Is that because there's these evil, sinister players who can, who actually have the ability to. Go into the ice cream store before anybody, before any of the other guys get to go to the ice cream store. I thought was funny because it's a really apt. Like analogy, but he doesn't realize just how, like, it's kind of screws his position and really sort of reinforces a red pill position. Because. Also. Is still open, but only for certain guys. And only at a certain time. Right. He's also negating the fact that the ice cream chooses who licks them. Right. There's, there's, I was going to say, John, because I get this all the time. From shows. Like when I go on a, like fresh and fit or even access Vegas or like any of the panel show. Where's where there's girls in there. And so, and it's usually not the girls that are on the panel, but it's the women who are responding to the show itself. So it could be a woman. It could be a man. It could be a man. It could be a woman. It could be a man. It could be a man. It could be a woman. It could be a man. The show itself. So it could be like, you know, in the chat or it could be like in the comments or something like that later on. And I love how we get these sort of these women who are like, they used to be red pill females. They used to be red pill women. And now suddenly they turn into trad con women and they go, well, men were better. Then women wouldn't have to be on OnlyFans. They wouldn't have to be prostitutes. They wouldn't have to be, you know, you wouldn't have, they wouldn't be important. If men were just better men. And what I will, they don't realize the irony of that, though, is that they don't realize the irony of that statement, which is, well, then that means that women's agency, women's life and their decision making, they have no free will because men are the ones that are making that choice for them. Is that correct or is that incorrect? And they'll go, no, no, no, no, we're empowered. We're just victims. And what it is, it's this feminism. This is, by the way, I'm going to quote Royce here for a second. But feminism is basically a, it's cognitive dissonance. Women are either superheroes and empowered and can do anything and take on the world and be astronauts and everything. You know, the world is your fucking oyster. Or they're also victims, hopeless, horrible victims at the same time. So whatever scenario, whatever situation applies, a woman can either be a victim or she can be a superhero and it can do so on the fly. And this is one of those instances like this, the lick, the ice cream scenario was one of those instances. So whenever somebody brings that up and says, well, you know, men would be better if they just didn't jerk off. There would be no porn if men didn't have, if there was no demand, there would be no supply, right? Okay, well, okay, well, if that's the case, then the demand actually controls the will of the supply at that point. That's what happens. So when we're talking about like, you know, men would be better men or women would be better for men if men would just keep their dicks in their pants and would be more, you know, gentlemen and open doors and chivalry this and bullshit that. It's like, okay, well, what you're basically admitting to is that women's entire agency is based on, well, one sex. And then two, it's based on the fact that men are the ones that are making the decisions for those women. Do you agree with that? And none of them will ever agree to. Well, isn't it? The ultimate peak of that is when they accuse a man of getting them pregnant, it's like, don't, don't you have abortion? Like, don't you have a nuclear option at the end? And it's just, oh, he did this. It takes two to tango. It's like, wait, and you're right. You just swiped a flitch. I'm either a superhero or a victim. And, but ultimately when now there's a kid involved and whether the woman wants to have it or not, then she's like, well, I'm going to flip the switch now to victim and I need government and aid. And the man did this to me. And I, I don't know about you guys, but I'm exhausted by it. And I ain't even in this battle. I'm just, I'm just sick and tired of the, of the, of the why I'm over here. Now I'm over here. Now I'm over here. Now I'm like, I don't have time. I think men are getting exhausted about it entirely. Yeah. That's, I think that's half of the reason. And then they're true. What's happening is on, on top of that, people have to come up with explanations for why that's happening. And they have to find explanations that they can force fit and wedge into their own ideological sort of, you know, worldview right now. So it's the incels, the incels are doing this and it's, it's some, it's some fiendish plot between guys who are like the four and a half percenters like the Andrew Tate's, the Justin Waller's of the world who can go into the ice cream store before anybody else can go in. And the guys are just like, I'm not going to go into the ice cream store. Fuck it. I'm out. God. See you later. Oh yeah. And Red Pill has talked about this stuff so clearly, like practical female psychology for the practical man, David Claire, womanese, the correct combination of words to elicit the proper response from what you want. If it's true, that's great, but it doesn't have to be. That's all this is. They're saying it, there are victims on one side and heroes on the other because it gets them what they want. Objective morality called like will to power thing. I honestly think it's amazing. And the only reason it works on guys is because guys are stupid and they take it literally, you know, they treat women like men. Well, a man says what he means and means what he says. Well, they don't really not in this case. Yeah. And that's really the problem is that you just have to stop taking it seriously and understand they're trying to manipulate you into doing or thinking something. And once you understand that dynamic, the whole thing changes. Now it just becomes like some goofy broad running her mouth. And you're like, oh, Jesus, another one of these, huh? Yeah. Yeah. I'm starting to get to that point, Ryan, where it's like, I'm caring less about like what I know are completely like rejiggered, you know, biased. Yeah. And dude, if there was some ugly 45 year old frumpy soccer mom saying this, everybody would understand that. But you put it with a nice set of tits and a set of legs on it. All of a sudden everybody forgets. What are we just by the fact they play this game? And I don't I don't give a crap about difference in male female psychology or anything like that. We can if anyone would walk away with something here. Women do have agency. The entire phenomenon the past two weeks of the damseling, like all these guys like, oh, my goodness, nine to five. And then there was the gal with the septum in her nose. And I don't know what they were complaining about. They know what they're doing. Yeah. Oh, yeah. They're not stupid. Yeah, they're not stupid. And men have got to see and peer through this mystical magic words and and titties flaming hot red tits. You just they know what they're doing when they turn on the tears. It's an act. I'm not even being like edgy on this one. I just it's so exhausting watching it. And I and I love the guy like a brother. But joke for better bachelor. He I don't even know if I don't think it's an act, but he's like, oh, my God. I can't believe this girl is doing this thing. He talks about this gal called Jonah Yocking or something like that in Australia. And she's like, oh, my God, I slept with one hundred thousand people. It's like they know exactly what they're doing and they're getting and evoking the response of you. And I think just step one, the ice cream knows when to turn its lid on and off. It will it will turn its lid off on its own. It has a brain. There's brains in the ice cream. It's not a nonsentient entity. Well, the ice cream knows how to position itself in the in the display case. So ice cream will bend over and spread its legs. So legs and spread. Yeah. Joker knows what he's doing as well. The majority of the ice cream has stepped out of the refrigerator for the last few years. The ice cream is not as stupid as the guy eating it. That is starting to melt. Yeah. Well, they. The guy really cracks me up, like the Hafeez thing, Rolo, I mean, he's all over the blue pill talking points. But if you listen long enough, I start to have flashbacks of Oswald Bates. Do you remember Oswald Bates from Mad TV? He was the prisoner that always had the eloquent forms of speaking that actually meant nothing. It just went on and on and on. He was trying to sound as smart as possible in front of all the academics. Exactly. Yeah. I forget the guy. What was it? Andrew Wilson was talking about this one guy, and I can't remember the dude's name, but he said something very similar. So the guy's just very eloquent, but he's basically eloquently telling you like nothing. It's just pseudo profound bullshit. And it's just, all it is, is just, you know, I think it was, was it Vox Day used to call it baffle garble. Yes. There's never been a more perfect, like, you know, he probably made the board up, but I don't remember. Maybe he got out of a book somewhere, but baffle garble is really Jordan Peterson's baffle garble. Oh, and I have a new one. I've noticed lately too, especially when in conversation or listening to conversation with a lot of the young women and men today, they're doing something called argue maxing, which is what you're saying. What's that? I just, you can tell from the word. Yeah. Pay attention to any of the dating shows, any of the modern shows, even some of the more popular shows, even Chris Williamson will have guests on that argue max. The point is to just argue max is to maximize the argument, right, wrong and different. It doesn't actually matter. Argument's the most important point. Pay attention. It seems to be growing. Yeah. That, and then what Ryan, what was that? There's that one argument style, argumentation style, or it's like they throw out like one stat, they get the, they get the laughs for it. The yucks. Can you believe people? Oh, the Oliver, uh, Jamie Oliver thing. Yeah. Where it's more of just hypnotic than anything, right? Within 20 seconds, they're onto the next, the next topic without ever like critically thinking about the bullshit that they just tossed out there and got a, got a laugh track, you know? Well, it's so you don't, you just associate, uh, being derisive with, with information. Right. It really is like brainwashing. Yeah, it is. It's hypnotic is what it is. So because you get, and then I didn't even realize how common this was until I read that one little, it was just like a little quick hit thing from Reddit, I think is what you, of all places. Yeah. Yeah. And then, so I saw it was in John Oliver was one of them. And I think, uh, I think, uh, John Stewart used to do something like this as well, but it's funny how it's like always on, on, you know, that channel. But, um, but then you're starting to see that argumentation style amongst like, uh, people like destiny and people who just like, basically want to throw it out as quick as they can and get the yachts and move on to the next thing. Right. Huh. One bike. See you later. Yeah. No, no, no, no, no. Let's go back to that one point. No, no, no, no, no. Bye bye. See you later. That's all it is. Yeah. Yeah. But, um, as far as the, as far as, uh, the, I mean the, the captain save, Oh, this is a good exam. John, this is really good. Thanks for bringing this back. Because when I was doing the, the lick, the ice cream show, which by the way, I had to like take off, I had to take that one down with the ice cream show. That sounds like a great stream. I got, I had to actually take that stream down. It's actually, I have it private now, but I got to take it down because I had, there was, I got so many different copyright strikes for that one. Yeah. Which is weird because that was a while ago. Like I said, that was about like eight months ago, nine months ago. But, um, that's the, I think that's, that's very common. I think there's also this, uh, you're going to see more and more, uh, of this sort of thing happening, I think in 2024, because there's already this like concerted efforts to sort of like bring down the red pill in terms of like how bad, like, I love it right now where it's always, uh, well, we like the red pill, but we only like these parts where you say, go work out and be better and make money and get on your game and go to college and go to this and do that. It's all these, these pro social things. But when it comes to like, you know, a mental point of origin, when it comes to like, you know, uh, enlightened self-interest, when it comes to anything that has to do with the man himself, rather than that's outside of the female imperative or anything like that, that's when they have a problem. Yeah. They got a problem with the real substance. Yeah. Stuff that's negative to women possibly. Yeah. Yeah. Anything that is anything that is unflattering to female nature will always be the parts that they disagree with. And it'll always be men's fault. It doesn't have to be negative. It's something that women do wrong or do bad or looks bad. It's how can the consumer do wrong? Yeah. The other one who buys shit, would you have advertisers appeal to let's shame the people that's buying our widget? No, it's the guy's fault. The guy who makes the money and doesn't want to spend it, that guy, it's his problem. Yeah. Well, I don't know if you've guys seen this in your audience or clients or readers or just correspondents, but I have more recently, as we keep coming through this fog, try to instill the idea in my audience that you are only half the formula by, by default, mathematical default, women are the other half. And whereas I'm very proud of the fact that on our side of the team here in the red pill sphere, we're like self-improvement hit the gym, get good grades, for your own sake. And then the girls will have to come. There is no corresponding self-improvement on the feminist side of this. It's all use amazing the way you are and be a fat girl boss bitch and snap the fingers and be just the fat, disgusting pig and men, men, men, men, men. And so it shows you where, where the truth is, where the reality is who's actually doing the work. Who's more moral. I would say, Oh, who's right. Who's correct. But that still doesn't change the fact, look, there's another human being. There's another human mind at the end of this formula. And you can never forget. Otherwise you're just going to, how much time did you guys waste? Like, well, maybe I'll do this when you were younger, of course. Well, maybe I'll put on these types of shoes or maybe I'll arrange my art or my furniture, my apartment this way. How much time and effort did you waste? When, if it just the simple fact, like, look, dude, she's half the formula. If she likes you, she'll like you. And then go ask her out, put on, you know, don't stink, get a haircut, show up. If it doesn't work, go home. Okay. What's his haircut stuff? My point is even today, even today with all the red pill information that's out there, men are in part kind of still blinded by their biology and sex drive. I think it's huge to point out this agency issue that look, you don't have to do 110% do 95 deliver, you know, and if the girl also has a responsibility to come and meet you halfway. And if you're getting this woman, he's speaking, he's well, the lid screws itself back on tight and you can't find the chocolate chip ice cream just hit itself. It was here a second ago. It said it was going to show up. I can't find the chocolate chip ice cream. Now it's got the chocolate chip ice cream. Doesn't want you to lick it. And now you move on and get something else. I think that's, that's kind of another bit of a, of advice or an epiphany that, that should be realized from this conversation. Yeah, exactly. Oh, come on, man. The female self-improvement side, they got it on lock. I mean, I heard a quoted that here it is in a nutshell, manifest what you want and clean that birthright girl. Didn't come on man. Paul do a, do a whole course on that. The art of what was it? The, the law of attraction. No, no, it's even worse on the, just another, another aspect to that, that video that I think we need to talk about too, is the idea that these guys have a duty to save these women. They don't have a choice. Like you have to, you have to take what's out there. You walk into the ice cream store and all the ice cream is licked. You're forced to take the ice cream. Nah, go to another store, order, order some, order some online and have it delivered. What obligation do these players have to like, are they their sister's keeper? No. Yeah. That's why I'm saying, why would, why would people, Oh darn, you, you got laid by three, four, five different guys. It's kind of the same thing with being envious of the rich. Like, I don't know about you guys, but if I meet someone who earned their money and they, they are better off than me in some way, I'm like, Oh wow, look at that guy. He did good. I kind of aspire. What did he do? I'm not sitting there like, Oh, I hate, let's tax the rich and the 1%. It's the same thing. Like if your buddy got, let's say Jack got laid with this improbable scenario, but let's just imagine, let's all imagine that Jack actually got laid. Who would we begrudge him? We'll be all like, Oh man, I hate that guy. That Jack guy's thing. And I was like, yeah, good for you, good for you, Jack. Americans seem to like the Dutch, just saying. I do. A lot of money over the years. What do you say? The same psychological profile of somebody who's petty, petty envy as a pro as opposed to say productive envy. That's what we're talking about here is, is the Spurghtals going like, Hey, it's like, can't you just be happy for that guy? Or maybe admire to become like him. I will never be happy for you, Cappy. I hope you will have a dry spell longer than the creation of the universe. It must be nice to be that lucky to have Now I was going to say is I like what, well, you know, Fitch is saying right there. There's a, there's a little bit of evolutionary background to that too, which is in most primates, the beta males of like a primate, like still gorillas. Who's that? Let me gorillas, even macaque monkeys, chimps, bonobos, whatever. There's usually one dominant alpha that sort of dominates like the harem of females as well. And so what happens is that it seems like there's this really harsh pecking order in most primate troops where there's the alpha and the alpha kind of like beats on the beta males. And it's not so much because of it's out of like innate, like sadism, or it's like the guy, the alpha just wants to beat the hell out of it. I mean, maybe there's like probably some sort of genetic predisposition for that. But the purpose that that serves is it keeps the betas from forming coalitions. So what happens is the alpha monkey goes around and beats up on the beta monkeys so that they don't get any bright ideas of trying to depose the alpha. Because what happens is if the alpha doesn't do that, then all the betas get together and say, guys, come on, we're going to, we're going to form a coalition. We're going to beat the fuck out of this, out of this guy, get him out of here. And then things will be so much better when we do that. The problem is, is that the most alpha from amongst the beta monkeys becomes the new alpha of the troop, kicks that and starts the cycle all over again. And what happens in the uglier side of it is, is that once the alpha is, is killed or deposes, is run off, the first order of business for that new formerly beta that is now the alpha monkey will go and kill the offspring of the previous rival. And then that sends the females into estrous so that he can breed with the next crop of, you know, the next time they come around in their cycle so that he can be the one who is actually reproducing and passing his genes on and nobody else does. And then the cycle continues and repeats again. We see, we see now granted, we can't actually see this in human societies because it's illegal to kill people. Okay. But the other thing is you'll see that, that desire or that want for beta males to form coalitions to tear down alpha just for the sake of it, be the nicest son of a bitch you ever want to know. But beta males will still form coalitions to bring that guy down because there's one amongst them wants to be able to depose that alpha. And the only way he can do it is if he has backup to go and bring that guy down. And you'll see that the same thing happens in online mobs, in hell, even in shows that even the shows that John Fitch is talking about. There's this want amongst beta males for a strict set of rules that we all follow like bro code. We're all supposed to do these things. You're supposed to get one woman, stay with that woman, go into the ice cream store, grab whatever ice cream you want, and then leave. That's basically the idea. And we should all do that. And the whole reason for society's downfall of Western civilization is because the guys who can get in, the four and a half percent of guys that the ice cream wants to screw its own top off to be liked in the first place, that guy now has carte blanche. He could do whatever the fuck he wants to. And when that guy does what he wants to, that's when you see this whole coalition of beta male monkeys try to tear that guy down. Would you say though that the whole narrative of the leader of men belongs within that category? The guy who spouts the church narrative of you need to be a leader of men, leader of the community, and bring everybody together kind of thing where it's all teamwork? Well, ideology is yet one more tool, I think. So if a coalition of guys can't collectively bring down an alpha or they can't collectively overpower that, they'll find other ways to do it. So we've got to be able to disqualify that guy from the sexual marketplace. He's a cad. You wouldn't want to get with a guy like that. He's a player. That's why men hate players, because usually those players outclass them in the sexual marketplace. And so if you can say, well, I can't do it and we can't do it, maybe God can do it. So we say, hey, there's this big giant astral projection and there's this great man in the sky who's going to say you're a bad person for going in and licking the ice cream. If that will work, and I'm not shitting on religion, I'm just saying that that's the mentality. And if we can all get together and say, okay, we all believe in this, right? Yeah, guys. Okay, good. We're going to go tell the alpha who's licking the ice cream right now. We're going to go into the ice cream store and say, you know what? God says you're a very, very bad man. Meanwhile, God be here making single moms. I'll tell you, that would take too much bravery. What we see here in the United States and any place that's a democracy is they just vote to take their money away. I want to know how much of Justin Waller's money goes to pay beta males to go have kids with beta females in the welfare class. I think that's really where you see, well, we can't physically fight because violence is illegal. We can't go in, we can't with God or shame or for the moral sake of society. I think they're just, especially these, you get the UBI types in the audience where it's all doom and gloom and I can't find."}
