Yeah I just wanted to thank you guys for coming especially after last week's show First things first though, I am going to Kenya. So I just want to make some some announcements here I'm going to Kenya the last week or the last week of October first week of Assuming the last week of November first week of December. Okay, so that'll be a kind of a weird period for us But we'll need at least six weeks for you to get over the malaria. Yeah Okay, people can tell me that we're not like, oh, you gotta go ding a fever and everything else Hey, you guys notice him bleeding out of his eyeballs. Did you guys see that when he came back with that? We got a little bit some though. So I'll be in Dubai for two days and then it'll be in Nairobi for ten so nice that's coming up soon. All right. All right So I just wanted to get a few things out of here first I have you guys are we familiar with what's going on with Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith these days? Do you guys see this? Everybody and their mother is gonna ask me about this over the course of the next four days So I figured we should to get to it right now. I think Jada's savage Yeah, like that's kind of mean I think like if he's keeping it a secret for seven years that they're separated Like why why not out it together if you guys are both. Yeah, so so the issue is do you guys you know what this is? Oh, I know No, this analogous to tiger blood. Do you remember Charlie Sheen? Like I got Tiger? Yes when when reality what was the problem Charlie? Sheen had unprotected sex with a porn star and caught HIV right? He started saying he had tiger blood He knew he had HIV when he was saying that stuff So just so we're clear Jada Pinkett Smith was fully aware that aware that she was separated from her husband Which she went and her husband slapped that motherfucker in the face, right Chris Rock She knew the whole thing all that drama going back to the red table that and they're still together living in the Same house while they're separated now, I don't know about you, but if I was Will Smith, I think I could find another girl I'm just I'm just guessing something like I'm just guessing The problem with Will Smith is he's so like debilitatingly like blue pill Yeah, he will never give that like he's so invested in the I think she's got some Rihanna pussy Like what I'm saying is I think she's got magic She's pulled like the baddest motherfucker Yes, so she has like a status I don't think I don't think it's like nice to will but she must have some magic pussy To keep them. Okay with that. That's the only thing or men just love like toxic Women well, we'll probably likes toxic women. Let's just let's clear the air the other thing It's and then she was also with like August LC or she was with August Alcina, too No, I think she gets like some top the line Like I think she's got game, you know what I mean? And she's got guys whipped a little bit I think he's trying to pay her half of his fortune. Yeah, I don't think he's trying to pay her half of this I think they've always had an open thing. I think she's always requested an open thing from the beginning I think she said stuff about like never getting over Tupac Yeah when he passed so I think they've always had an open thing So like she writes letters to Tupac after he's dead. Yeah, so let's yes, if they have an open thing And they they have children together in a family like and they just they just don't want to make it messy or like divorce You know, I do think like if you're gonna keep it private for your family or the name Like maybe out it together the secret especially with somebody who is as you know, a celebrity like like Well, yeah, I feel like I feel like when celebrities definitely like end a marriage and they have kids together It should be like a joint Let's go let's go down the list of all the stuff because I have been dealing with this Bullshit since 20 since August of 2020 when the first thing came out when the what she was saying Oh, we had an entanglement, you know, it was like it's all about healing it's all about love and everything else and that was right after the the the August Alcina a Red table talk which by the way is her show. I believe yeah. Yeah, it's her show bringing them to the red And so the red table is is I guess it's a red table And so the red table is is I guess it's her catharsis anyways, and this was way back in in August of 2020 now I did probably one of my most viewed like over I think it's at least in the 2 million range right now But I did one of my best shows on just doing the breakdown of what was going on there And let me tell you since August of 2020 I have eight more shit for that show and everything else and like now it's like sweet vindication, man it's like a line to apologize to me forms right outside the door here because like everything that I said in that is 100% accurate as of today, but the then there's the Chris Rock thing when When Will Smith smacks Chris Rock now somebody I don't if maybe somebody at this table knows this but did Chris Rock want to date Jada at some point was that Because I'm looking at on YouTube and people are doing shows about that What Jada Jada like listen back in the day was Vivica Fox Jada Pinkett and Holly Berry like those were the three Baddest chicks in Hollywood. Everybody want to be in a movie with him, but this is like late 90s Well, you know a holly berries a little bit later, but like that was the thing and so basically like getting one of those it was just like a girl trying to get the Brad the Brad Pitt or the George Clooney or the fucking Leonardo DiCaprio like that to tear That's what it was and and will was big and so he had a big crush on I was very similar to like You know, I think Kanye had a crush on Kim Kardashian long before they got together. Yeah He was like trying to like he started at a Grammys. Yeah Yeah, so just just imagine like all of a sudden you go you're at fame level zero and then you're at the like the top Peak of fame and you can pick anyone you want you go after your dream girl And so that's what that's what Kanye did This is probably a similar situation where Will Smith probably watched the same 90s movies You know above the rim with two like all that same shit that we all watch when we were growing up back in the you know Those movies and she was the baddest jerk. She was one of the hottest girls So she watches that now the thing that happens, you know over time is is like she never this He marries an alpha woman and is probably surrounded He's he's surrounded by people in Hollywood who tell him this is what you got to do to get along There's another thing and I've seen this to be absolutely true One of the things they do especially to african-american actors is they dress them up in drag and try to make them look as as fucking Safe as possible, you know, they try to they do whatever they can to neuter them sexually or neuter them from masculinity standpoint And they're told to do that. So that's what you're gonna see the rock and drag You're gonna see fucking Will Smith and drag like you all these guys are gonna see Masculinity when it looks like fun, bro It's gonna be the Tyler Perry in somebody's in drag and then you're gonna we're gonna put Eddie Murphy in drag You guys notice this it is african-american male actors. They're trying to put in drag not Denzel Washington He said fuck that shit and that's why he does his own That's why he's doing the equalizer and he's not doing bullshit movies with fucking Tyler Perry is because he doesn't do that shit And so that's what essentially what happened. So he played the game. And so that's what happens You get a bullshit movie and then you get I am legend. That's how it works That's how the trade-off works you get you do a bullshit movie and then you do men in black That's how that's how the trade-off work And so the thing is with him is like he's he just thought this was the way it was supposed to be and his woman Is just like taking over and he figures everybody in Hollywood's having to deal with this and probably they are Probably they are and had he come forth and had some sort of like masculine relationship with his wife Then he's gonna he's gonna end up looking like Johnny Depp. Oh my god, like and that's the problem What do you think though? Like if I was Will Smith in this situation I would kind of benefit off of it like you can't tell me there are tons of bad bitches right now Sign in his DM that wouldn't go with him being like, oh my god. I can't believe she did that to you and he's like Oh They both end up looking cool in this scenario a little bit like she looks like a bad bitch that's savage It doesn't give a fuck and gets whatever dudes I think they only came out about the entanglement because I don't think he broke an NDA and he wanted to talk about it Cuz again her pussies probably bomb and he wanted to talk about it. I don't think she ever got over Tupac That's the first thing. So there's this is what I was gonna say. There's so many there's so many There's so many layers No, no, I think he would have gotten over she would have gotten over Tupac had she been dating a man I think she would have gotten over to pop just fine, but she wasn't dating a man, but see that's dating She will submit no No She was dating the effigy of a man like this not a man who would lead her ever Tupac would Tupac again Tupac would do things with her that Will Smith wouldn't she want again? She she would have she would have gotten she would have gotten over this had she been dating a man and she was not and That's it. And I would say this to Will Smith to his fucking face because I love him as an actor Yeah, and it's sad when it is sad what he has done here to himself and let me say one other thing I'm gonna bring it up again Cuz I keep doing it people get angry when I say this when a woman does this to a man It is more embarrassing than the other way around it I was always gonna go with it when a winnow winnow when a woman gets cheated on it's terrible But she the next she slides to the left her options are 100,000 times more than him and on average when Wilson when the man gets cheated on I fucked your bitch and some Gucci flip-flops And you're humiliated. Oh, that's why I fucked your bitch. That's what Tupac said about Biggie. Do you remember this? This is the main thing when men go after men The main thing they do is say your woman saw you as inferior and cheated on you with me because I'm a better man This is how men embarrass each other. That's what I'm saying. This is so much from a PR perspective This is so much worse. Not that Jada Pickett had a career to begin with. This is so much worse for For Will Smith than it is for Jada Pickett Here's the thing too that people don't talk about and it's not out there It's just because again this person wasn't open about it, but I'm pretty sure because like I said, they had like an open thing She Jada was mad I'm pretty sure during the filming of that that con man movie that it was rumored that he hooked up with Margot Robbie Yeah, that's right. Yeah pictures Look like you have Margot Robbie And so if I was a dude, for example, and I do have kids and a family I have like an open thing I'm fucking Margot Robbie When some guys saying Gucci boob lobs and if you're super secure in yourself, you're like, yeah, I'm Will Smith I can I can recover from the people are still gonna fuck with me and they do they still fuck like They still like he slapped Chris Rock. People are like, yeah Will Smith But and I'm sure like the slapping thing even if they're separated like I Understand the slapping thing from like this is your mother of your child No matter what if you're not in a romantic relationship, like you still feel family like it's a family member And like that's like the right way to do it I think we're misinterpreting though what he he said that she was you know, she she looked like GI Jane like that Well, I wasn't I don't think that was slappable. I don't think he should have gotten as sensitive about it Coming from Chris Rock Yeah, but he didn't write those jokes for that that's the thing it's like it was a scriptwriter for the for the Academy Awards I was right. I want to ask the question Dave I would you know what the first thing I saw when I saw that I said that dude has too much estrogen Immediately my first thought was like this guy is not sensitive I would my first thought when I saw that my first thought was this man looks incredible for 50 This man is probably on fucking like HGH or fucking test and he's not taking a fucking estrogen blocker and he because he watched he read some reddit post saying don't take an estrogen blocker and He became super super sensitive big old puffy nipples fucking sad like If somebody talks shit about me or puts their name in their mouth like in my mouth I expect them to stand up for me. No for sure But that's not what I stage if somebody tries to clown me and my looks yeah, you go you go Yeah, but the problem is the problem is his voice is cracking while that's you and him he's not he's not saying put He's not saying keep my wife's name out of your fucking mouth. He goes keep my wife's name out of your fucking mouth I just heard esterol. I heard esterol when I heard that shit. Estrogen drives everything. It's amazing what it can and can't do in men. I've seen grown men, bigger than me, 300 pounds with high estrogen and sobbing like babies, unfortunately. Yeah, that's what it felt like to me. It felt to me like somebody gave him bad TRT advice. That was immediately when I saw that shit. I'm not kidding. Will, if you want your testosterone pumping, come to me. Call me. I think you're a man. I scream good. Oh, you're trying to get at Will. No, I'm just, I'm saying it again. Will Smith watches this show. He obviously watches it. Hey, Will, after this one. I feel sympathy. I think Jada's cold. Sorry, Jada. But I would never out my business in multiple ways to embarrass my man. Even if he wasn't my man. If he's the father of my children, I'm not going to out him like that. Again, if we're going to talk about being separated, we're going to do it together. Especially if we're close and he cares enough to slap people on Oscar stages for me, I'm going to consider his look. I don't think at any point it was ever open on his side openly. I think he thought so. I think he thought it wasn't closed on his side. Smash Margot Robbie, y'all. No, I'm saying he cheated. What I'm saying is he may have cheated. I don't think there was ever a point where they both determined it being open, number one. I don't think that ever happened. And number two, what was the other thing you said? I know that the open thing was her thing from the beginning. You get with somebody from the jump and they say that. That's the whole thing of fucked it all up. I know a couple right now and she's just said, hey, I want us to be open or we're not going to keep going. And he just agreed to it. He just had his arm twisted. I think that's what happened. I don't think at any point did Will Smith say, you know what I really like is young dudes fucking my wife. I just don't think that ever happened. Do you really love somebody, though? Is that genuine love if you're willing to share them and open like that? I think it's love if you're willing to share because the two of you want to share. I think it's not love if it's a situation where you have lost respect for your man's penis. So you don't give a fuck if he fucks other people because you want to go fuck August. That's different. I think it all depends on how it starts. I think if you talk about being open when you're already into something, I think that's kind of wrong. I think when you go into it, like, for example, I've dated a guy before and he's like, I really like to get BJs from other girls sometimes or whatever. And because it was like on the second date, I was like, you know, like. Thank you for your honesty. I was like, I'll be in the studio recording. Like my throat is important. And I'm like, you're kind of like wide. I'm like, you go ahead. I was like, you can let him suck it. It's fine. And I'm like, I'd be busy, too. I work so much. I'm like, yeah, like, give me some free time. I mean, he could be a cuckold. That's my next thing is like a cuckold. Like he likes to watch like other guys like do his girl. Yeah, but I have a guy like that. He was a cuckold. So that came up, by the way, when I did that, when I did the original, the video that actually came up. Like, do you think maybe he's just gets off on that stuff? Because if you go back and you look at the 2020 interview, when he was on the Red Table talk with her, he was just like this close to like breaking. Like really, like you could see the tears almost like welling up in his eyes during that. He's an actor. He's a good actor. But does he have any reason to act at that point? It all looks good. I'm telling you. It's more pussy. Sympathy gets more pussy. Yeah, but Will Smith doesn't need to like turn up the get pussy meter. He's Will Smith. Like he's top ten all time. It never hurts. Yeah, but there's like no club we could go to right now or music festival where Will Smith isn't pulling 95% of the women. It's exactly why I think he's not a cuckold. I just think he's very secure. Like in his day, too, he was like the baddest of the bad. You know what I mean? But he could still be that today if his wife hadn't cucked him like this. And like I said, like if I'm letting a dude go get BJ's, I'm not doing it because I'm a cuckold and I want that. I'm doing it because I'm just so fucking secure. Like I'm like whatever. And you respect the transparency. And I respect the honesty and like it really just doesn't fucking bother me because I, you know what I mean? Yeah, no, I feel that. I'm like I got Will.I.Am movies to make or whatever. You know what I mean? Or I am legend, you know? Like I got stuff to do. Like go ahead. Like that's just secure. You go get yours. I'm going to go get mine. Somehow I am robot and I am legend turns into Will.I.Am. All right, let me ask you this. Who has higher status? Will Smith or August Alsina? I mean, it's obviously Will Smith. So you're saying that a high-value woman cheated technically on a high-value guy, a high-status guy like Will Smith. If August Alsina was MVP of the NFL, he's still 60% of the way to Will Smith. Yeah. We just remember when he punched the fucking alien in the face. Like how you like that motherfucker? Like that Will Smith? Is that a step back though is what I'm saying. I think, like I said, I don't think they cheated. I think it was an open thing. I think August, because he is below, wanted to talk. You know, it's like the same thing of the girls when the guys cheat and they're like, yeah, I had your man. And it's like because they want to feel like on your level. Holy bullshit. He was 23 years old when they were fucking. How old was he? He was so young and he wanted status. So he wanted to talk. He probably got like attached. She wanted some younger dick is what she wanted. For sure. For sure. I think she did that, like I said. But I think from the beginning, she's always been saying, I'm going to go do what I want to do. Makes me wonder what else she's doing too. Because this is just now. She's probably doing a lot. Well, she wrote a book. I think she's doing a lot. Yeah. I think we're about to hear about it too with her talking about the separation. Well, I'm just saying it's like, I think that at some point, I don't care how high status that guy is. Like it could be Will Smith status. If he's not laying down the good D, if he's not like being a man, if he's not the guy that's, he's not that guy who just gets it. She's going to go look for some outside of it for somebody who does get it. He'll be a loyal dog, but if you don't pet me, I'm going to go get pets. That's right. You got to pet me to keep me on the porch. I think they get it. Which again, like I said, he could be secure, and he's just like busy. And so he just lets her. Yeah, I disagree. I think if he puts his foot down, she's more attracted to him, and none of this happens. I think if he had set boundaries originally in the relationship and also been like, hey, if you want to do this, that's fine. We are going to terminate this relationship. Had he done that, she would have either gotten in line or he would save face, and he'd be much happier not married to the succubus. I think that's what would happen. I agree. Will, you should definitely just get out of that and come over here. I know. Will, you almost make as much money as Amanda Nicole. I am so submissive. You could be the man. Look at her. She's like, that's the pitch. You could be the man, Will. I love the pitch. I won't help you like that. You can pull my hair. I'm so private. I don't want to have none of our business. None of our business. I don't want to mess with the fans. That being said, do you like a guy who is more dominant, more masculine, more alpha? Yeah, for sure. Do you like a guy that's more dominant or alpha? But again, I don't think in that scenario he's not alpha still. I've actually thought about this a lot. I am very masculine, but I am fully confident in that if a man is more masculine. The chat's going to go nuts. But listen, if a man is more masculine and can bring out my feminine energy, I would love to be more submissive and just kind of feel like a woman because I don't want to have to be so masculine and independent all the time. Dave, I'm not going to ask you what kind of guys you like because I think I know the answer already. Brittany. I like to test guys in the relationship. I like to see if they can overpower me. So I act crazy. I act like a total bitch in the beginning because I want to see if they can control me and put me in my place. And if they can't, then I will run circles around them like I did with my husband. Okay, one more time, guys. I want you to hear what she said. She's being honest here. She's saying something that some people would not see as positive. She's being honest. So Will didn't let her not run circles around him. And two things happen. Number one, she runs circles. Number two, it begins a spiral of a lack of respect that goes down and down and down. Because you don't set these boundaries, she loses respect for you and she loses attraction for you. That's why you have to set these boundaries as a man. And if you don't, then she's just going to go do whatever. The main question I really have is, like, who's trying to fuck Jada? Like, young hot rappers, athletes, whatever. Like, what out of all the girls in Hollywood, why do you want to fuck Will's girl? She looked like a man. Oh, no, no, no. I think she threw it at him. I think she just threw it at him. I know, but still, like, why? Like, I wouldn't want to do it. But you've never been a dude. You've never been a dude. If you're a dude, like, you're 23. If a chick who shaves her head throws you. No, she had alopecia. She didn't shave her head. The thing is, if you're a 23-year-old guy and some girl's throwing it at you and she's famous or somewhat good-looking, 23-year-old guys don't say no to vaginas that's thrown at them. August is not confusing to me. I know a girl that used to like to take, like, guys' virginities, and I'm like, that's hot. And I used to like do that, too. Like, I think it's hot, like, going after, like, a younger guy. Bro, I just feel like you are just, like, covered. You are covered in, like, depleted uranium, girl. The toxic levels from you, Bella, are just outrageous, bro. I like to test men and just see if they can pass my test. If they don't, then I fuck all their friends. Sarah, do you like a guy who's, like, over-the-top masculine? I'm going for your friends. Yes, I definitely do. You like a guy who's, like, more? More masculine, yes. What does he have to do? What does he have to look like? How does he have to be? I don't have a set type. It's more personality. But just, honestly, if he sets a lot of boundaries. Do you get to know his personality if he's under six feet? How about that? Yes, set a lot of boundaries and honestly be kind of an asshole. Hold on, hold on. And I like him. When I say set boundaries, by the way, I set boundaries for him in the relationship. So, like, the Jonah Hill thing, I'll say it again, Jonah Hill was 100% in the right. He did nothing wrong. He told the girl. That boy was in my DMs while in a relationship. He ain't got no room to talk. Who, Jonah Hill? Jonah Hill. But, like, while he was in a relationship with this girl or after he broke up? Yes, while he was in a relationship with that girl. He didn't do nothing bad. Jonah, you've got some explaining to do. He didn't say nothing bad. He was just giving me, like, movie recommendations and stuff. But, like, he's like. Super bad? No, I'm so mad at him. Maybe he was. And you know what my Instagram looks like? Do you all know what my Instagram looks like? It looks like church. It does not look like the stuff he was requesting of his girlfriend. I do not look anything innocent on there. All right, let's see. And he was interested. Jonah Hill or Jason Momoa? Go. Is that a question? Yes. I'm trying to gauge the masculinity in either. All right, I do want to say, though. When I was in college, I told my dad I would probably go for Jonah Hill. And he goes, the fat kid from Superbad? Why would you do that? And I was like, no, it's the funny guys. I would have totally smashed before I heard the comments. Like, he don't like girls in bikini pics. Because that's all I do. No, I don't even think it's that. It's that. He doesn't like her in bikini pics. That's all you wear. Also, I would have smashed until I watched the movies he recommended to me in the DMs. Because he recommended these weird movies. And I watched them. And they were so, like, weird. And, like, out there. I was like, oh, okay. You've got some dark shit going on. Hey, guys. Can you guys remember me talking about this previously? About not snitching on yourselves? Like, you guys think that you're going to message these. It's so funny how many of my guy friends. They're not really guy friends. Talk shit about me. You didn't say anything bad. Yeah, for sure. But they'll talk shit about me to other girls. And then the girls immediately tell me. Guys, we're on a fucking podcast. If you haven't figured this out, stop snitching on yourselves. Anna, what do you think? Get close to the microphone. Yeah, talk into the microphone. There you go. Do you like the mask? Yes, of course. Because at the end of the day, we all want to surrender. Like, it doesn't matter how big balls we try to have. Yes. And, like, how he has to look in my eyes most of the time. Anna, just to explain for everybody who's watching right now in the chat and everything. Like, where are you from? I'm Russian. Yeah, you have to accept my accent. No, your accent's perfect. It's perfect. Where are you from? Where in Russia? The reason I'm asking is because are the guys in Russia, are they more... Yeah, I'm from the man world. The man world? You know, like, I cannot say what... You know, I super respect guys, and I super respect men. And then you're like, oh, they're like, you know, like, everything. But in the same time, they're in my world. But still, come on, like, at the end of the day, we still want to surrender. And we still want to surrender to who? To surrender to who? To someone kind, to someone lovely, to someone stronger than us. Worthy. That sounded like a poem. Yes. That was sweet. All right. That was sweet. Hey, where in Russia? Rostov-on-Don. It's close to hot place right now. Okay. Uh-oh. Oh, got it. It's close to hot place. Got it. Beautiful. Aria. Aria, tell us a poem. I don't have a poem. Sorry. But when it comes to guys, I think if he's a simp, I want him to be submissive. I want to be like, yo, cash at me right now. And then he does it. But if I'm actually looking for a guy that I'm in a relationship with, I would like for him to be dominant and assertive so I can be submissive. That's what you would like. You would prefer. Yeah. Hey, by the way, guys, those of you who are listening, women are not going to expect you to just get this. They're not going to tell you this. They're just going to, you're going to be in a relationship. And then it's like what Bella says, we're going to, they're going to test you. And then they're not going to say, okay, should I be more dominant or should I be more submissive? They're not going to tell you this. You have to just learn to get it. That's what this whole, this whole sphere is from is that maybe you grew up without a dad or an uncle. It's usually a good way to tell if a girl calls you daddy, like in the bedroom, like, or I start calling daddy right away. So I make it known, like, you better start acting like my father. I am your father, Amanda. You need to be in bed by 930, honey. So Amanda, what if he tells you, good girl. I have like, I think in the bedroom, I have like a praise kink or like, you know what I mean? Like, I like, I like Amanda. I am your daddy. No, no, no. Like words of affirmation. Like, oh, you did that. Such a good girl. But like harder. Now I'm like, yes, daddy. Like, or something like that. Or they're like, oh, you look so pretty when you're like gagging on my cock. Good girl. You do that so well, baby. Oh my God. I do whatever. Tell me, tell me. I make it easy, though. You don't have to assert anything. What kind of guys are you into? I definitely like more of the dominant older man that, like, not like super old, but someone that has their life together. What does his body fat percentage have to be? I don't have a time for that. What's his bench have to be? You know what? He has to take care of his pelvis. What's he squatting in the rack? If I'm, like, as much as I take care of myself and I pride myself and put a lot of work into the gym, I expect that. Like, not necessarily in the gym, but at least put a lot of something in some part of their life."}
