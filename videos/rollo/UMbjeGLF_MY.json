So let's get started today This is I'm here in Las Vegas, Nevada. This is red one studios and just wanted to Start riffing on a few things that are going on in the cocoa Should we even call it the mass here anymore? How about we call it the man? Oh, no, we're not calling No, it's just the the locker room man. Oh sphere sounds like a it sounds like I'm like a period a bar Yeah, like a man of pause. We need something different. We actually do it's the locker room the locker room Don't even go there. Well, I tell you what's funny. Here's here's here just so we can get started. Let's go Let's let's start with this The red pill is not the red pill The red pill is whatever anybody wants it to be right now. And as I said back in December of last year right before I should say on our rule zero end of the year show we make predictions and One of the predictions that I made On that show was that by August you would not recognize the man is fair. I was right Actually, I was right probably in June, but I said by August and now we are just approaching October and Here we are so what's become of our beloved red pill slash man is fear slash men's self-improvement Niche, whatever you want to call it well now it's a political vehicle and now it's a political football and we've gone from making pickup artists the boogeyman to making those red pill guys the boogeyman and Before we get started in today's video, I'm gonna be digging into the Matt Walsh the most recent video of him criticizing the red pills take on on marriage and a reason why you get the scare quotes from me today is because Much of this is just simply engineer re-engineered rehashed nonsense from Real well really the last election cycle because that's what we're about to launch into right now One of the things I would like to start with is a saying that I can't remember who said this But I've been re-quoting it and paraphrasing it for quite some time if there is no boogeyman. No one gets paid Now who's the boogeyman? Red pill is now the boogeyman those red pill guys those red pill guys those nebulous red pill guys lurking in the dark corners of the Internet in the dark web web 3.0 or 5.0 or whatever the hell they're talking about right now And as I said, what's old is new and so now we're also moving into the quote-unquote intellectual dark web Although it's probably like 3.0 instead of 2.0 1.0 would have been what the the Cernovich Sam Harris Weinstein and I don't mean Harvey. I mean Brett Weinstein. I guess you could probably throw Jordan Peterson in there the intellectual Illuminati right to whatever they are You're gonna see them pop up probably they're already kind of popping up. Everybody's sort of jockeying for positions right now But as I said before if there is no boogeyman nobody gets paid And so now the most convenient boogeyman is the red pill and I'm going to riff on some of mr. Walsh's Misinformation and I mean, I actually it's fake news It's engineered to be fake news and I'll explain to you why here but the red pill has now become sort of this bugbear of traditional conservatives or as uh Steven Crowder called them and I thank you for this steven uh big con The big one is daily wire So today we're going to start talking about some personalities of big con. One of them, of course is matt walsh Then we've got michael knowles. Then we've got uh, jeremy boring Then we've got candace owens and we're probably going to see some more people get uh Brought on board for daily wire because i've seen this I saw this happening really kind of uh, Probably the better part of last year Uh, there's this positioning on conservative media For who's going to be the host media for the 2024 election cycle And i'm fairly certain that daily wire has decided that they're going to be the ones Because it sure as shit ain't going to be the buzz or excuse me. Uh, it's uh, yeah, uh the blaze It's not going to be blaze. It's not going to be prager you in fact I wouldn't be surprised if daily wire bought out prager you at this point um, because they're practically the same entity right now, I can't even tell the difference between like ali beth stuckey and uh, Uh, what's the what's the black girl's name amala or something like that off of prager you she may as well Whoever by the way, whatever traditional conservative big con pundit that ends up on whatever podcast You all might as well just be on the same the same channel right now. Anyways, so like brian like yeah Well, we'll we'll get we'll get to brian. We'll get to pearl. Yes. You're going to hear a little bit about pearl today Here's your red meat for the for the uh, your preview of the red meat So today I wanted to dig into what matt walsh was talking about and I have to sort of rewind the tape a little bit here because The reason why I say that the red pill is now kind of like the bugbear for uh, traditional conservatives or trad cons or big con Is because they need an enemy. They need a low low hanging fruit. They need uh, a an easy target And if you can't find an easy target you manufacture one And that's exactly what daily wire has decided that they're going to do in the shape of let's see. Michael knolls Uh, jeremy boring and of course matt walsh right now And i'm sure there's probably some others that i'm not i'm missing right now as well. Ben. Shapiro ben. Shapiro But ben I expect that from right i'm actually surprised ben hasn't piled on he probably will after this video. Hi ben um However, I wanted to point out that uh, what first drew my attention to all this Was uh a post on a tweet an x tweet or a twix, whatever you want to call it On elon's new social media app, um, but so jeremy boring had come up with some uh, Tweet about how the red pill is anti-marriage and you can't be A conservative and be anti-marriage. I'm like, where's this guy getting this? And then I see a similar message or a similar tweet. I mean almost not verbatim, but certainly paraphrasing jeremy boring from michael knolls And of course saying those red pill guys are anti-marriage those red pill guys are contributing to the degeneracy and the moral decay of the uh of of the united states and of western society and we really need to get back to our cultural foundations and our virtuous What value? You know Enabled past we've got to swing the pendulum back to where it was before guys And if you're not on board with marriage, well, then you are uh, if you're not for us, you're against us then of course Matt walsh has to chime in i'm like where are these guys getting this? And i'm looking at some of the tweets and i'm looking at like similar words and and and jingo isms and Uh similar it's almost as if um, they're reading from the same script Now I don't have this queued up for you right now, but there's a very kind of infamous I guess meme video of uh Anchors news anchors like local news anchors that are syndicated. They're on a syndicate. Um Of local news stations and in the local news stay in those local news stations The uh, the hosts look kind of generically the same. You're not going to find it man. Don't even look for it Maybe you can I don't know if you can find it. That's fine. You don't have to interrupt anything for it. But the uh, The long and the short of it is you've got all of these hosts from all over the place and each one of them Is reading from the same script they're using this. I mean almost verbatim. They're using the same script And so what it is is it goes from from each and every single one of these. Um, these local news stations and It basically doubles up and it repeats it and say it's this big course of these Uh news anchors reading from the same script. Is that it right there? Jre news is all the same No, that's rogan. Well, actually probably rogan probably broke that one There you go. Yeah, I think that's probably it. I'll throw it up multiple. Yeah, throw that one up. Here you go You're gonna have to bring back uh, uh matt walsh later but go ahead and throw that one on You My name is jessica hedley and i'm ryan wolf our greatest responsibility is to serve our treasure valley communities The el paso las cruces communities eastern iowa communities mid michigan communities. We are extremely proud of the quality balanced journalism that cds4 news produces but Responsible Plaguing our country the sharing of biased and false news has become all too common on social media More alarming some media outlets publish these same fake stories without checking facts First the sharing of biased and false news has become all too common on social media More alarming Extremely dangerous to our democracy. This is extremely dangerous to our democracy. This is extremely dangerous to our democracy This is extremely dangerous to our democracy. This is extremely dangerous to our democracy this is extremely dangerous to our democracy This is extremely dangerous to our democracy. This is extremely dangerous to our democracy This is extremely dangerous to our democracy. This is extremely dangerous to our democracy This is extremely dangerous to our democracy. This is extremely dangerous to our democracy This is extremely dangerous to our democracy, this is extremely dangerous to our democracy. This is extremely dangerous to our democracy There you have it Congratulations daily wire you played yourself. You're now local local news station media Because every single one of your tweets every single one of your shows every single one of your clips every single one of your uh, Coverage Of really pretty much anything but i'm i'm noticing this because i'm seeing you guys throw the same narrative At the red pill. So it's the red pills against marriage. The red pill is for vasectomies The red pill is for xyz and every single one of you reads from the same script guess who the syndicate is daily wire Have fun with that one so when I see stuff like this and I see The same talking points parroted back over and over and over again I can only draw one conclusion is that you guys are all reading from the same script you guys Whatever your uh production team is whatever your pr team is In fact, i'm i'm i'm halfway convinced that you guys don't even do your own tweets at this point Now do I have rule doesn't have any proof of that? No, I don't have any proof of that but I but I can show you the similarities in those tweets man And every each and every one makes the same fundamental mistake Those red pill guys you guys never mention a name you guys never say who you're talking about. Is it me? Is it myron and fresh? No, they point out andrew tate. Is it andrew tate? No, andrew tate's andrew tate's yesterday's news. Trust me by by the time, uh by the time let's see Uh february of next year rolls around you. He's not going to be the household name that you think he is uh, but there's this similarity in messaging across all of all of the channels now As I said, this is local news Daily wire is one source and we know where it's coming from. All right, it's coming from jeremy boring Hell jeremy's the one that started the whole thing off In fact, every single tweet that came after that pretty much follows and i'd say verbatim But it's paraphrasing the tweets before it or it's paraphrasing the messages before it the red pill is anti-marriage No, no, we're not we never have been but you know who is you know Who who you've been quoting as the red pill instead of saying my name instead of saying myron gaines name instead of saying? anyone else in say rule zero or rich cooper or ryan stone or you anyone else who's been involved in the Manosphere or the men's self-improvement, you know Andrew tate by name, but you don't know any of the other personalities or perhaps you do you're just unwilling to Say anything about them. So Instead of saying my name you will say another name Pearl davis Now pearl davis is the red pill. She's the face of the red pill, right? Because that's all you guys want to quote whenever whenever pearl quotes something That is outrageous or it's a firebomb or she's using the flamethrower. She's throwing grenades. It's usually like let's repeal the 19th You realize where that comes from, right? It's not pearl davis who came up with that and it's not even me really Pearl just basically lifts my material parrots it back and then butchers it so you guys can then say well those red pill guys Or that red pill personality over there We know That pearl's team has been either part of daily wire or is still part of daily wire as well So you are controlled opposition quoting your controlled opposition Pearl davis is an employee of daily wire I would argue that probably brian from whatever podcast is also an employee of daily wire. How do I know that? Well Disregarding matt walsh for one second. He's had candace owens on he's had michael knolls on he's had Well, I know that lila rose is not necessarily daily wire, but she probably soon will be And if not, she's probably a contract employee. Anyways, now i'm seeing andrew clavin of all people How old is andrew clavin? He's like 60 68 something like he's a pretty old i'm not nothing against him. But I mean He's a pretty old dude. He's now quoting Uh, or using clips from whatever podcast So, I can only draw one conclusion, Brian. You've got a contract with Daily Wire, and that took place sometime between, let's say, the beginning of this year and right about now. Because when I can see Adam22 with LenaThePlug on there, and you've got Lila Rose on the opposite side, or you've got Michael Knowles on there, you've got Candace Owens, oh my lord. You do realize Candace Owens, her Twitter handle used to be redpillblack, right? That's back in 2014, right before the first Trump election. I mean, aren't they all Trump elections now? Every election for the last three years has been a Trump election, so I'll just throw that one out there as well. But back in 2015, her Twitter handle, when it was Twitter, used to be redpillblack. Because what these guys do is they will take whatever is cool, or whatever they think the kids are talking about, or whatever they think is like culturally the narrative of the time, and they'll add red to it. They'll add red pill to it, whatever pill to it. White pill, black pill, green pill, your mom's pill. I don't know. But the long and the short of it is this, is that whatever their pet ideology is, that's the red pill. Because nobody actually really knows truth except for us. Whatever our pet ideology is, that's the red pill. So the red pill gets tossed around, and it's basically a political football at this point. And Matt Walsh has decided that it's time to take the gloves off and come at me indirectly. He's never going to mention my name. I want to also point out that before any of this happened, I invited Matt Walsh to be a part of the video that I'm about to show, some of the clips that I showed you here. In response to a lot of this stuff that had happened this week with Big Con, sort of the red pill versus Big Con, one of the things I did was I was hosting Rule Zero on Saturday. Please go check that one out. You've probably already seen it. But it was myself, and we had an all-star cast. I think everybody really kind of showed up for that one, with the exception of maybe Sterling Cooper. Everybody in the Rule Zero crew showed up, including my good friend James Sexton. Now, James Sexton is a divorce attorney. He has been a divorce attorney for 20-plus years. He has got a little bit of internet fame\u2014actually, I should say a lot of internet fame\u2014really since the end of July. Rollo, are you saying that James Sexton has been a lawyer longer than Matt Walsh has been married? Yes. James Sexton is, in fact, a lawyer, Matt. So apparently, he's been\u2014 He's not an alleged lawyer. He is a fucking lawyer, okay? So here's the deal. James went on a podcast, Soft White Underbelly. That interview that he did, which was all of like an hour and a half, maybe two hours, ends up exploding. It goes viral because James is an interesting character. I've known James for a while. I wish I could say I had caught up with him earlier, but I hadn't. And then after that, I started making some clips of his Soft White Underbelly interview. And he reached out to me. I reached out to him. And I got him as a guest on my show about mid-August, which was directly after Soft White Underbelly. Since then, he's been on Lex Friedman just recently. So if you haven't seen that interview, it's about a three-and-a-half-hour interview. He went out to Austin, Texas, interviewed with Lex Friedman. And it was a very good show. I think anybody, including Matt Walsh, you should probably... I know it's really hard to sit there and watch three-and-a-half hours of a podcast. It's much easier just to carve up bullshit that your employee Pearl Davis says. It might be in your best interest to actually go and watch those before you start popping off about shit that you know nothing about. So yes, James Sexton has been an attorney for 20, 22 years, 21 years, something like that, at least as long as I have been doing what I've been doing in the Red Pill space, the Manosphere space, whatever you're going to call it. So he's been doing this for quite some time. He's not an alleged lawyer. He is an actual lawyer and has tried... How many cases did he say he tried? I want to say probably in the thousands right now. But the guy definitely has the background to know what the fuck he's talking about. So if you're going to try to belittle him and try to bring him down a notch by saying alleged this and alleged that, why don't you get your producers to find out who the fuck this guy is before you start mouthing off? Because all that does is lead me to believe that you're responding to something that Pearl put out there that your people probably put in her mouth to begin with. She's just a little puppet at this point. So with that said, I'm going to dig into what Matt Walsh was getting into today. You want to cue that up for me real quick. But I wanted to give you a little bit of perspective before we get into the guts of today's show. So what Matt is going to be responding to here is really the Rule Zero interview or the Rule Zero show that we did on Saturday of last week. I then did The Rational Mail, my show with Jim and Mike Sartain had Glenn. Glenn, you were in on that. And Rhinestone was with us. And Andrew Wilson graciously decided to come in and be part of the discussion as sort of like a counterbalance to because on my shows and on Rule Zero and on Red One Studios, we actually have people come in and we have like discussions with them. We don't just go and mouth off and pop off about shit that we don't know or shit that we put into other people's mouths so we can get content. That's just manufactured content. Once again, before we get started, I'm going to go and throw out, I'm going to put the gauntlet down here on this table right now. If you want to talk about this, if you want to have a debate about this, Michael Knowles, Jeremy Boring, Matt Walsh, Candace Owens, I don't care who you are from Daily Wire. If you want to come to this table right here, this fucking table right here in Las Vegas, Nevada, and you want to have a live, live stream debate about it, please come. Table is yours. We're still waiting on yours. We'll go to Sticky Paws. You want to be right here. That's fine. We'll go wherever the hell you want to. But we do it live. We're still waiting with a chat room open. We do it with the people who want to, if people want to super chat in and put their questions to you, that's how we do it. We don't go on just snipe from behind 20 minute cheese videos produced by your producers talking about shit they know nothing about and just mouthing off. We've been at this for quite some time. So I'm going to dig into what Matt Walsh had to say about, oh, just some Zoom call that these guys got on to discuss marriage. So let's, let's dig into this. I'm going to riff on his video here for a bit. So there's your preview. Here we go. I defend it because it's the bedrock of civilization. So it deserves defending and I defend it because it's under constant attack. So it needs defending. And one of the most troubling developments in recent years, which we've discussed on the show in the past is that these attacks are increasingly waged, not just from the left, but from certain noisy segments of the right as well. Stop right there. Okay. First off, the red pill is not the right. It's not the left. It's not the middle. We're not libertarians. We're not conservatives. There's, there's guys who have, they hold very, very liberal beliefs in the red pill. There's guys who hold very, very conservative beliefs. It's a praxeology. It is not a ideology is not a political stripe. There are people who will argue with me over this, but I want to point this out from the very beginning here. We're not conservatives and the red pill isn't, is not monopolized or owned by any particular ideology. Let's go. Right-wing influencers with legions of young, mostly male fans have decided that men should abandon marriage and family life and go their own way. And these, these influencers, many of them, all that there go their own way. Like MGTOWS say the fucking word, Matt Walsh, men going their own way. What's funny to me is like, I think he's reading from a teleprompter and I'm not sure he's the one who did the writing for the teleprompter at this point. Let's continue. That was a part of the so-called red pill movement pretend to despise feminists and yet have essentially arrived at the same conclusion as feminists, which is that we should give up on the family, the two sides. Hold that real quick. Now here's this right here is an attempt to say that the red pill is just the other side of the coin from feminism. They're different sides of the same coin. No, no, they're not. The red pill movement is not a fucking movement. It's not a, a political agenda. It's not a, a belief set. It's not a, it's not an ideology. It's not a philosophy. It's not teaching. It's not preaching. It's not good. It's not evil. It's not any of that. It is just understanding what is real and what is not, what is true and what is false. That's what it is. And the problem that these guys have is that when you, when you promote that and when you put something out there, you cannot just neutrally put out any kind of information without these guys having to have been told how to feel about that information. That's where all this stems from. Marriage almost as much as they hate each other. Now, one of these influencers is a woman named Pearl Davis, who has garnered a relatively large following on YouTube and various social media platforms. She's in her mid twenties, single and childless, and yet full of opinions about modern marriage and family life, a subject that she has no personal insight into whatsoever. She spent the past few days on the internet complaining. Yeah. Look at his glasses. Are there lenses in them or is he trying to do the Mia Khalifa thing? You can see the prompter. Oh, you can see the prompter. Yeah. And the past few days on the internet complaining about quote unquote trad cons like myself, who she says promote the nuclear family, despite not understanding what it's really like. Okay. Yes. All right. So he, this is the buildup Pearl is an employee. He only ever quotes Pearl. Who else does this guy quote? Is there anyone in the Manosphere? Is there anyone in the red pill community that he quotes? And if there is, is there anyone he quotes as often as he does Pearl Pearl is a reliable source of outrage bait. She is an outrage broker who is contracted by the daily wire. That's how, and by the way, you don't believe me. There's video. We're going to dig that video up as well. The video of her admitting to the fact that she works with are either former or current employees or her handlers are former or current daily wire. People continue to have wives and children don't know what it's like to be married, but a woman who is not married and has no children does know what it's like. In one of her tweets, she wrote quote, the trad cons push marriage because they aren't old enough to know better. They don't know the reality of what they're pushing. This is accompanied by a picture of myself and Shapiro, Michael Knowles. We aren't old enough to know better and don't know the reality of what we're pushing yet. A woman who is younger than us and single does know better and does understand this reality. Okay. Does that not seem contrived to anyone? Well, this is what Pearl always does. Yeah, of course it is. But the thing is, is like Pearl is very adept at regurgitating and parroting back shit that she's heard. And when you have people who are the producers and the, they're really the behind the scenes people at daily wire, when they're throwing stuff out like this, they know what the response is going to be. That's a bait. That's bait for these guys. It's not even bait. It's part of the script. First we say this, and then we say this. If you don't think that you think this is some sort of conspiracy, if you think that this is some sort of like a role is just gossiping again or anything, all I'm going to do is I'm going to point to you to a couple of other people here. We're going to look at Adam 22, Adam 22 and Lena, the plug in the infamous porn video between Jason love and Adam, Adam and Adam and Lena, the plug and the buildup to that it's engagement media. And this is a daily wire sort of ham fisted attempt to do engagement media, pretty much doing the same thing that Logan Paul has done with his wedding and the fight that's supposed to be happening. Did that happen yet? Did the fight go off with Logan Paul and not that I'm aware of? Yeah. What's his name? Dylan. Um, Danny Dylan or something like that. Dennis Dennis Dylan. Yeah. Did that happen yet? Not that I'm aware of. Not that you're aware of. Okay. So all that outrage bait that gets thrown out there, trust me, all of this stuff is, is pre-planned everything. By the way, what we're doing right now, you're going to comment on this. You're going to throw hate at me or you're going to throw love at me, whatever it is. Whenever I'm doing a live stream, that's engagement media. It's breaking down the third wall. Me just talking directly to you right now, that's breaking down the third wall and where's the fourth wall, third wall, whatever it is breaking down the wall between myself and the audience here. And also people like to feel like they are not only being entertained, but also that they have, they play a part in that entertainment. So it's almost like reality TV, but we're doing it in the social media age. So the way that I do that is I do live streams mostly. And, uh, let me, let me stop like five hour live streams every Sunday, 1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern. And anyone, even if you don't super chat, I often put up posts of people who I just think are interesting or have an interesting take. And they feel like they're a part of the actual show. They can in some way change the course of the narrative or the questions or the, the actual conversation that's going on in the show, even on access Vegas. When we read the, those super chats or we encourage the girls to actually keep their phones on there so that they can watch and monitor the, uh, the show, which by the way, will be tomorrow on the 28th. But the, um, the long and the short of it is that, uh, we live in an era of engagement media now, just being on YouTube and having a streaming video going on and having the, uh, the chat go on. Um, that's one form of, of engagement media. Only fans is also a form of engagement media. And if we take it to a meta scale, we can see that what Logan Paul has done and what, uh, what, uh, Adam 22 has done is they have taken the, the template for engagement media, and they've blown it up across all platforms, not just YouTube, but also other podcasts. And they encourage other people to participate in that same narrative for the event. In the case of Adam 22 and Lena, the plug, the event was the infamous porn video between herself and."}
