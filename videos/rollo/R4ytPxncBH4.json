What is best in life? To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentation of the women. You had to know that one was coming. Did I give that away? Am I that transparent? Yes, yes I am. Oh boy, here we go. Yeah, I see the chat's already on fire. Good thing too, because we're going to get into it. I'm raking out the flamethrower for today's show. That means everybody gets a bit friendly fire. Enemy fire. That works. Live from Reno, Nevada, this is Rational Male. Yes! That's for Ned. I'm looking to buy a house. In 1983, I'm an average person looking to buy an average house. I got this average degree, which I got for free, and work an average job. After paying tax and rent, I have... If I save 50% of the remainder, it would take me two years to save up for the 20% deposit. Remember that as we head back to 2023, and I'm still an average person looking to buy an average house, got this average degree, and I have an average job. After paying tax, rent, and hex, I have... If I save 50% of the remainder, it would take me ten and a half years to save up for the 20% deposit. It's clear that it's not just lazy layabout young people sipping latte that's causing the problem. It would take me 84 years to save up enough money if I skip having a latte every day just for the deposit. I don't have 84 years left. In 40 years, the average house price has increased by 14 times, whereas full-time salaries have only increased by 4.7 times. Another way of looking at it is, houses used to cost three times your salary, and now they cost ten times. All things being equal, you'd have to be making $300,000 a year to benefit from that same three times ratio. You might be thinking, $90,000, wow, that's high. It is. That's because CEOs and vice chancellors take millions and collect the total... His income to beat. I feel like this is going to sound bad. I feel like $300,000. I'd have to say $127,000. Probably $150,000 to a quarter of a million a year. $500,000? Is that bad? $150,000 maybe to $250,000 a year would be comfortable for sure. I was just having this conversation with my friend, and she was like, you have to manifest a husband, girl. Ideally, my husband seems to be making like $650,000. So you said you want $500,000, but what do you think the median income is for a 30-year-old? $60,000? $70,000? It is $45,000. Oh my god, really? Yeah. I think it's $250,000. It's $52,000. What? No, it's not. Damn, America. Tell these bitches to go to hell. Another thing I have a real problem with is the word respect, because there's two different definitions of respect. It's a gendered concept. There's a male form of respect, and there's a female form of respect. And you can even go look this up in the dictionary, because there are actually two definitions for respect. The first one is merit. What do you do that makes you respectable? So when guys say, well, why should I respect women? What do they do that I should respect them for? Have they created a business? Physically, are they impressive? Whatever the challenge is, what makes you respectable? Men know this, because men operate in hierarchy. So the guy who is at the top of the hierarchy, he has earned the respect of all the men below him. So it's like you've got the chain of command. You've got the admiral and the captain down to the private. Same thing in business. You've got the president, the CEO, the CFO, whatever, all of them down to the janitor. Whoever is at the top of that has more respect by merit. The second definition is everybody is deserving of respect. Everybody deserves a common courtesy. You should respect everybody. Those are literally two definitions in the dictionary right now for the term respect. So when women talk about respect, well, everybody deserves respect. That's the more common egalitarian definition of respect. Whereas the merit-based version of respect, what makes you respectable as a man, we apply that generally towards guys, because if the guy is not deserving of respect, then you're kind of like, why am I even dealing with it? Like you were just saying, who are these guys? Why are you hanging out with these people? Those are men, or maybe even women in this case, who are not deserving of respect, because they don't do anything that makes them respectable. They're not on that hierarchy. So you have to define which term are we talking about? Which kind of respect are we talking about? The female egalitarian kind, where everybody gets the participation trophy, and we all get here. You get some respect, and you get some respect. Well, I don't mean shitty people get respect, too. That's what I'm saying. You're going to get the respect you give. So just because you're a CEO, or you're the president of the company, you could be a piece of shit person at the end of the day, and why should I respect you just because you have that job, or you have that title? You've done something that is meritorious, meritorious. Say my name. Who's better at communication, men or women? Women. Women are better at communication. Women, for sure. If men are worse at communication, why do so many women expect men to read their body language rather than just be direct? Oh, my God. I don't know. Are men expected to be mind readers? Yes. Is that something that they want in a relationship and what they actually respond to? Absolutely. If so, how are women better at communication? We're not. But you just said that they were. I lied. Clearly, I'm not communicating well. Duh. What does it matter if you make all the money in the world, but you never find love, romance, you never build friends, family, social life, children? What's it all matter? You know, I had this one life of mine and the biggest shock to me was, wow, even billionaires have horrible lives because they have all the money in the world, but they never figured out love, dating, romance. They had children with the wrong people. And then I find people who maybe aren't billionaires who magically get this right and it's like their life's better than all the people we idolize on social media. So let me just give you the big picture so you understand it. I call my approach and my understanding of dating, mating, romance the 13th thesis. Let me repeat that. The 13th thesis. Why the 13th? Well, because as I begin to lay things out using the science, using what I learned from different mentors and my own life experience. Let's say you go on a couple of dates and you found out or a few dates, say it was going on for a month and you found out that simultaneous with you dating that girl, she was also dating. And by that, I mean sleeping with five other people outside of you. Are you not? I want to know. I honestly want to know. Do you just see this as a normal sign of the times or would you be disgusted? Also, would you say to yourself, she doesn't like me that much. She would have got rid of the other five and she'd just be doing it with you. Women don't juggle when they're when they really like a guy. There's no juggling. It's over. OK, so would you be thinking that, too? Like, oh, is she juggling because she doesn't really like me or she's so broken that she's so disconnected from her body and her spirit that this is just her way of life now. That's what you should be thinking. One of those two options. What you shouldn't be thinking. Oh, yeah, this is perfectly normal. They're doing their business and walking in there and what they're supposed to. This is not asking your body count. So you're saying body count doesn't matter to a real man. Body count matters to dudes who not in the count. Oh, Lord. This has been tonight's conversation. I ain't never met no dude. That's what I'm saying. I've never met a man who's had the, and ladies, I'm not saying it's like y'all easy. I've never met a man who had the ability to actually be with the woman that he wanted because most dudes with the women they got access to, not the women they want. I don't know a lot of men who put the women they want who be worried about who else she. I got money. I know the spots I can take you wherever the rest of them is. Take you. I'm confident in what I got. I'm not worried about who else you with. Only a dude who not on his square is worried about community. We don't. I don't know. I can say a just Mike. I can say an ace metaphor. I'm looking at somebody's nodding in the room. I don't even roll in the community that you was handing that out to. I don't. I'm not going to run into the dudes who happy and want to point the finger like, Oh, that don't shop where I shop. He don't land where I land. Oh, incredible men who are such special people in my world. I'm so happy I can stand here and tell you how much I love you. I've loved you for 13 years. I love you with all my heart. I really do. My husband, Sam. I miss film, babe. Oh, man. You are right. Leo don't care about nothing. And that's funny because that was from was that from Titanic or before? I don't even know where that was. Holy mackerel. When was the Titanic 1997? Somewhere around there. Boy. Wow. Yeah. Like that. Because we're going to be getting into issues of hypergamy today because apparently we need a fucking remedial lesson in hypergamy this week. So we're going to get into that children. Sorry. But, you know, sometimes the rest of the class is going to drag you down a little bit. So we have to like kind of catch up every now and then. We got to do, you know, Red Pill 101, which was kind of odd because that used to be the title that we used to call this show when I was doing the show originally with Pat Campbell. We call it Red Pill 101. And so now we kind of have to get back to nuts and bolts because there's too many idiots out there who've decided that they're going to be the utmost authority and the, you know, the top names in the field. Right. Remember at the end. Remember at the end of what is Raiders of the Lost Ark and they pack up the lost Ark and they put it all in the in the in the box and everything like that. And, you know, you've got what Indy Indy's like that belongs in a museum, you know. And there's like, don't worry about it. We got it. You know, we've got the top men on it, top top minds in the in the in the country on the top man. He's like, who? I feel like Indiana Jones sometimes. And the Red Pill is that the Ark of the Covenant has been like taken off into the warehouse and archived with God knows whatever else is in this big gigantic warehouse, which is kind of an ironic end to that film, considering all the stuff that they had to go through on all this epic adventure. And at the end of it, it's just kind of like, let's take this and just put it away somewhere. Top men who every time I get that, like I'm listening to I'm listening to these guys on on various podcasts who present themselves in some way as as the foremost authority on the manosphere of the Red Pill or whatever the hell we're calling it right now. And they'll say something to you, not just. And by the way, I'm not just poking at destiny of these people. I'm just there's a lot of people. Let's do it. Hell, even what? Well, Xena, the witch or whatever the hell she is, even they'll say the same damn thing. These Red Pill guys, these Red Pill guys, these Red Pill guy who top minds are on it, who I am. It's like enough to make a man insane. I'll tell you that how hypergamy is expressed in LGB couples. I will mark that and we will come back to that. Thank you for that question there, because that's actually in the notes today, which of which I have done quite the if it seems like my last few shows have been a little bit free form. They have been. But it's simply because I'm I'm I'm coming into them at over over the course of the week. And it's getting to the point right now where it's like I've got all these ideas for the show. And then I'm like, I got to choose amongst which one I think is like the most pertinent versus which is the most interesting, which is the most like educational because that's really what this is, a pod class. Got it. But before we get into that today, I have to go and do the do the rounds, have to make the rounds here. What's that? Yeah, I would love that. Yeah. Can you give me that? I would I would love to have that. Yeah. Throw that at me or email that to me after the show there. Thanos. So she's already got some people up in here. What is this? Here you go. Women seek attention and men seek recognition from society. Do you agree with this statement? If not, explain. We'll get to that here in a bit. Actually, that kind of factors into the hypergamy discussion we'll have today. DeSantis banned lifetime alimony changes vetoed twice by prior governor. Some trad cons are waking up. No, they're not. All they're doing is basically remember anything that has to do with like money. It's not it's not it's not because there was such an uproar and an outcry. It's because they're either losing money somewhere or they could make more money somewhere else. So when I when we talk about like a lifetime alimony and all that, you got to remember alimony. And just since this is a quick hit question, the thing about alimony is today's alimony laws were found like there's been alimony for a long time. I mean, it's been like since the 18th century. We actually probably even before that. But today in the United States, our alimony laws are predicated on alimony. anyways, on 1930s Depression era, men leaving their wives and kids and, you know, just basically live in fat, flat broke. And so all the alimony laws and again, alimony state by state, but depending on the state during the Great Depression, you know, early 30s, you know, alimony laws, that's where what we're dealing with the legacy of those laws still today. So good, good on DeSantis for that. But again, I can take that with a grain of salt, because it's probably a financial decision. This is much needed. I like Troy Francis content, but even recently conflated men wanting hotter younger with men being hypergamous, we're going to talk about the differences today, what we should be, should we even be calling it hypergamy, I'm going to get back to that today. But before we do, I got a couple announcements. Access Vegas is every single Thursday of this month, except for the last Thursday. So I've did we just did one last Thursday, which I thought was really good. We had Bradley on Bradley, I gotta say, it was okay. Um, I give it a B minus, I thought it was a good show, but it wasn't our best show. Simply because I think and I like Brad too, but I just don't think it was his element. I would love to go on his show and maybe have a different conversation. But he just simply doesn't is not familiar with what we do. And I think he was really more interested in like sort of the professional side of like what I do and what Mike does and everything else. And Mike has had interviews with Brad before. I thought it was a good show. And even before and after the show, it was a lot of fun. But it's just like in the middle of the show, and you're trying to, you know, there's no real frame of reference. So it still came off pretty good. I liked it well enough. But long story short, we have we are going to be doing every Thursday of the of the month of July. Well, except for the last one, because we have lots of things to do. My daughter is getting married on August 3. And so I've got to take a week. So I'm actually kind of doing some I'm doing a series of videos right now so that you guys aren't like left high and dry when I'm sort of doing my thing. And then we also have Babes in Toyland, which is coming up at the end of the month. I'll be at that we've got a bikini contest that's coming up the first of the wet Republic bikini contest just went off last. Just when was it always Friday, this Friday, and two of the girls who were on access Vegas were two of the winners. We had am Ambry, who was the second girl over from from actually the girl that was right to the right of Brad on that show. She took first place and then my girl Maya, she took second place. So it was pretty good. So we have that. That's coming up. We've got we have some other announcements. Some of them are confirmed some of our kind of like still to be confirmed, but I'm just going to announce them anyways. We have john circa coming in next week. So that's going to be something to look forward to for this Thursday's access Vegas, we're going to have to be very selective of the women that we have on this show, because we're going to we're going to get it done in Las Vegas. And we're going to do it Las Vegas style. So we got john circa coming in, we're going to break the internet. We were supposed to have Mike Rashid on with us as well. Unfortunately, Mike Rashid's mother passed away recently. And I think he made an announcement of this. But so we couldn't, we couldn't schedule him and our my thoughts and prayers goes out to him and his mom. And that we will get him later on in the month, probably like middle of the month, or like maybe the 20th of July, I think. So he is on the books, I don't know the date to confirm just yet. So we have circa coming in. We have we have Mike Rashid coming in. We also have Adam Lyons, old school pickup artists, Adam Lyons is going to be in this week. We're looking also at sharp from no jumper. Now, as you know, I was just on no jumper this last Monday. And so here's the deal. I made this announcement yesterday on rules on rule zero. But I'll make it now again, rule zero, by the way, was on red pill for Thor Markinson's channel, if you want to go check that out. I'm probably going to refer to some of the stuff I talked about on that as well. But anyways, I made this announcement, you know, I went on to the no jumper podcast. And I was on there on Monday, Glenn Lawrence, who's I believe he's in the chat right now working there. One of my mods now. But Glenn has just exceeded himself over the course of this last week. And his team, his video team and his production team, really, we are upping our production value, like I me personally, but also access Vegas are really upping our production value. And we've got we've got him and his team that are really sort of to thank for that. So big round of applause goes to Glenn. So I was on no jumper, I went on only one went on with Flacco. So just so you guys know, it's just me and Flacco in the whole thing. And we went on for about 20 or hour and 20 or two hours and 20 minutes is what we went for. So we went on that. And we we had a really good discussion. Now I like no jumper was a lot of fun. It was good to be back in my old my old stomping ground. Like I am originally from Pasadena, California. So like Glendale, Burbank, all that area, I'm very familiar with that. So it was great to be, you know, sort of back in home territory once again, or like, refresh myself, you know, they say you can never go home. So I was there. And I did the show with Flacco was great discussion. And I met sharp and sharp is one of the I guess there's Adam 22 Flacco and sharp are I guess the would be fair to say that the principal guys, there's other guys there as well. But met him really hit it off with him. We've had some exchanges and I'm following on Instagram, we're following each other. And so we're going to get sharp also on access Vegas, probably either the 13th or the 20th of July. So we've got some really heavy hitting guests coming up. I think it's gonna be a really, these are gonna be some really good, especially Zerk is gonna be good. I also have to add one more caveat to that. Zerka is going to be on access Vegas, we've that's already been established, but he's also going to be doing a debate with Mike Sartain. I'm going to moderate. I'll be kind of like what I did with Gary, the numbers guy. And I'm gonna should I get the clock out? Maybe I will. But I'm going to moderate a debate on whether flat earth is bullshit or it's not. So we're going to be talking about flat earth. And this is going to I believe this is going to be on Mike's show, but we will live stream we'll we'll live this one. So if he wants to put it on my show, or we're going to just do it on the access Vegas channel, we're going to be doing a lot more stuff with the access to Vegas channel. If you haven't subscribed to it, please do. It's the if you go down below the fold in the in the the links down below in the description, just just below the fold, go and subscribe to it right now. We actually cut half of the show off on Thursday and we migrated over to the dedicated channel right now because we're trying to get watch time hours so we can get about up to speed. Because once we can monetize it, then things then it starts rolling from there. So but but up until this point, all we've really been doing is on my show, I mean, because I've got the biggest following than pretty much anybody. It's sticky pause. But we've been working from my channel and Mike's channel, we're kind of like diffusing the subscriberships and the viewerships and everything we'd really like to just collect it in one dedicated channel. So that's what we're working with right now. So if you haven't subbed to it, please go sub to it right now. Or at the end of this show, that'd be great. Zirka is funny. I will give you if you guys want to know what my take on Zirka is, I'll just give you the the briefest of the briefest of descriptions here. Zirka is the Andrew Dice Clay of the red pill or soon to be the Andrew Dice Clay of the red pill. He is definitely a loose cannon. So we kind of have to like, remember what we can say on YouTube and what we can't say on YouTube. So I have to be careful of that. I wish we had like a six second delay like they do in like live, like radio. So somebody swears he can like gut like whoever the producer is can go back and bleep it out. But unfortunately, that doesn't exist. But it's almost like the, the the sensors are YouTube and get you know, if you get caught saying the wrong word, and it's not even swear words, you can say whatever swear words you want to on YouTube. But think about this. It used to be like when I was doing Pat Campbell's terrestrial radio show, I had to be in my best behavior because I couldn't look like when I said like, alpha fucks and beta bucks, I couldn't say that I could only say like, I came up with this alpha seed beta need, because I had to have some way to describe that, which again, we're gonna this is also part of today's discussion. But I used to have to say those things. And it's funny that the things that you can't say on YouTube today are not swear words at all, you could say you could say motherfucker all you but if you say other words, and that ought to show you something about like sort of how we're going, like societally right now and free speech, we've kind of outsourced our free speech to like private private companies more or less. But it's interesting to me, the things that you can't say are no longer swear words, there are things that are like might, you know, damage a protected class of individual or something like that. So very, very interesting. I was just thinking about that when I was thinking about how we can maybe do a sensor button, like a six second delay. Apparently, we can't do that with Zerka. But Zerka is kind of a loose cannon. And in a way that I kind of like that, I have talked with him, I unblocked him on on Twitter, we have a we have some back and forth. And Mike also has some back and forth with Zerka. So he will be coming in, I think it's going to be very interesting to see Zerka with our girls. Nothing against Fresher Fed, they got some beautiful ladies there and everything else. But it's sort of like a different class, different caliber of girl. So it's going to be interesting to see what happens in that. So that's that. What else we have going on? We have a let's see. Oh, well, let me tell you about no jumper, no jumper. I was on there. It's a pre record. That's why it's not out yet. So people kept asking me, they kept seeing all these stuff on Instagram and wondering where it was. It's not up to me. It's up to the guys that at no jumper who have their hands full right now. Certainly Adam 22. And I met Adam, by the way, when I was there, Destiny was there that morning. We're going to get into that in just a second. MLD was there. So MLD looking sharp. He was there. And Sniko was also there, which I had no idea was going to be there. So after I got done with Flaco's show, and I come out and lo and behold, there's there's Sniko. So just said hi, and met Adam. And, you know, just said, Hey, if you guys ever want to come to Vegas, you're welcome to come. And literally the day after the show is when all the the well, I guess it was during that show, maybe it was that day was when Adam was talking with Destiny and everyone else about how his wife had finally done like a guy girl porn thing after they'd been married. And he was having sort of a, I don't know, crisis of identity, right? Because of that or crisis of security or something. And I thought it was kind of interesting, because I know, yeah, don't don't come at me. I already know what what Adam 22 is history is. I like the guy very much. I met him or hung out with him just for just very brief moment when I was there. But very tall guy, too. But well, maybe if we can get him on the show and do an interview, with him, sort of on our on our turf in Vegas, I'd be great. I would love to have that conversation with him. But I thought it was interesting because his understanding of his relationship with his wife and is sort of endemic for what's going on right now. When we look at like what happened with like destiny and his open relationship, and I would presume that Adam and his wife have an open relationship because she's doing porn and he was doing porn for a while too. We had this conversation also on Access Vegas last Thursday with Sarah Jesse, who is a old school, very longtime porn star herself, who is also in a long term relationship with a guy and she's still working in the porn business. So we're talking about there's almost like a parallel to what was going on with with Adam and it was interesting to listen to Jess or Sarah Jesse talk about her take on working in the industry and essentially having sexual intercourse is her work, right? Okay, I'll give it to you. Well, I'm a whore. Okay, happy now. Okay. So listening to what she was talking about and how her arrangement works and the separation of say, like the emotional investment versus the actual physical act, we started getting into topics of how men can separate themselves from the emotional side of things. And because that's why guys jerk off to her porn, because they can separate the emotional investment from the actual act of having sex. Women, on the other hand, have to be at least conditioned to sort of be comfortable with separating emotion from the actual sex act. Again, we can go get back into how, you know, Jordan Peterson's was talking about, you know, meaningful sex versus, you know, just casual sex, how we want to talk about it. But I thought it was interesting when I was watching Adam 22s discussion with destiny and the rest. And I thought it was funny, almost ironic, that that at that point, and yes, I realized she was on black. Thank you. Let's just put that out there for the home. If you're playing the home game, she was on an episode with black. She was with the black dude. She's a white girl. But I thought it was almost ironic that that destiny happened to be on that show. Or maybe it was like having destiny on that show that prompted him to want to sort of have that discussion. Now, I thought it was funny because you got Adam who, you know, seems like a nice enough guy is really having this sort of crisis of identity, identity, but having this some kind of crisis, right, about how he felt about another guy sort of banging his wife. And here you have destiny who's like, what's the big deal? I mean, he's very open and very casual about the whole thing on pretty much every show I've ever seen him on. When it comes to this time when this topic comes up, and he of course, he thinks everybody's obsessing about it. Their only reason they're obsessing about destiny is because you have thrust yourself, pun intended, into the mass fear. You put yourself out there because you apparently you want to be seen in some way, shape or form, whether it's on Lex Friedman or on Tom Bilyeu, I hope I'm saying his name, right? His most recent three hour podcast, that in some way, wants to establish you as a, you know, the foremost authority on the manosphere, the red pill, whatever the hell it is, right, where we're gonna end up calling it at this point. And by the way, the red pill is alive and kicking and will be for quite some time. Trust me on this. I have outlasted everybody that came before you and everybody that will come after you. When when all this shit was going down in 2016. Exactly the same thing. You want to know why I was saying that, you know, by August, the manosphere will be unrecognizable. Why did I say in 2021? On fresh and fit? Why? What did what did he say? I said that is"}
