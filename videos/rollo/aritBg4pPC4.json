We will be taking all your questions today, I'm going to do a little bit of an AMA, I got a few things I want to get into my ear and review. Am I in time to re-introduce myself? Yes, you're correct, I am really a trans male. Got it. If that's acting to turn me into a trans male, you're right. 100% right. Rowell said he was really a trans male. Hey, live from the biggest little city in the world, Reno, Nevada, deep in the heart of the Nevada high desert, I am Rowell Otamasi in the Northern Command Center of Red One Studios. And now, this. Reason why men date younger women is not because of their physical appearance, their bodies, no, because today with plastic surgery and everything else, you barely know who is 40 and who is 18. Guys date younger women because they're easily manipulated, they're going to be very happy with a few crumbs because maybe they didn't experience much in the world, they're going to be just easily impressed. And it's way cheaper to date a younger girl. Have you ever had a dream that you had, you could, you do, you want. Men that still kind of push this narrative that like women with very high body count is a sub-woman. Why do you think they still do that? They say they do it because of the research on body count, which shows that people with higher body counts are more likely to be unfaithful, they're less likely to be satisfied in monogamous relationships, more likely to get divorced, you know, there's a lot of negative correlations with body count. And they say that it's because of the research, but then it's like the research shows the same effects in men. And you're not saying that men with high body counts are problematic. Oftentimes, these same guys are saying that men with high body counts are like successful or good. So it's like, it doesn't seem to be a research driven idea. My friend Alexander, who's a graduate student, he ran a survey and it wasn't a representative sample, but he found that the men who cared the most about body counts were the least sexually successful. The underlying factor that we see is that men who care more about body count, at least in his survey, tended to have more body counts themselves. It could be because they have religious beliefs about that, it could be higher disgust sensitivity. So they're obviously not going to have casual sex if they're really easily grossed out by that kind of thing. Or it could be sour grapes. This was Alexander's theory, which was that you can't reach the grapes, so they're too sour. The woman who are having lots of sex don't want to have sex with you, and so you say you wouldn't want to anyway. So it could be that. And these are all hypotheses. None of these are tested. I think part of it is sexual insecurity. I think that that comes from the fact. So I guess we should take it all with a grain of salt, right, Mac? That there's just more points of comparison. Statistically, if you're sleeping with a woman for the first time and she slept with nine other guys, let's say, and you're number 10, it's just all else being equal, 10% chance that you're the best ever. If it's 99 guys and you're number 100, it's a 1% chance. I mean, everyone's going to tell you that you're their best sexual experience. But most of the times, if they've slept with lots of people, that's going to be a lie. Some men know that and they won't admit it. I think that that's why some men care about body count. Well, I'm a whore! Body count. 20. 20. Let me go to my notes app. I'll just show it to the camera. This is the list. So, you know, we got all that. Period. I don't regret a single one. We all have fun. This has got to be at least 60. At least 60. She got 60? I have more than that. Are we counting work or not work? Because I do this for work. So if we're counting work, I don't know. If we're not counting work, like 98. Never mind, I am. I want to catch up to her, so I am going to f*** another guy. I am. I said I wasn't, but now I am. I've got to catch up. What's the optimum amount of people to have on a roster at any one time? No more than five, because you might start calling them the wrong names. Call them all bae. Five is too much. It's like a small basketball team. But nobody off the bench, though, so nobody can get hurt. Got it. How do you keep the feelings out of play? Never tell them your real name and don't tell them you love them. Okay. There you go. Noted. Writing this down, I am. For me, I don't let men day text me if they're on a roster. I don't want any kind of like, hey, how's your day going? It's like I don't want any mental energy. I don't mind that, but no holidays together. So don't ask me what I'm doing for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Nothing. Holiday alone. I'm doing nothing. At home, two cats. Yeah, yeah. I like your vibe. Thank you, I try. Percent of single women are open and looking for single dads. Why we like dads. Great question. Glad you asked. They are. We more stable, more mature, and they're less likely to play games. Or just like single women are looking for single 60% of single child. All women, single women are looking for men with kids because they feel like they are more relatable, more responsible, more committed, more loving. You guys are not. No, they are toxic us who love baby mama drama. All men with kids come with baby mama. All men with kids come with baby mama drama. He published in personality and individual differences found that women who are high in intrasexual competitiveness are more likely to advise women who they perceive as potential mating threats to cut off more hair in an attempt to sabotage their attractiveness. The researchers studied 450 women who were presented with hypothetical salon clients. Participants were asked to recommend the amount of hair to be cut off for each woman. Women who reported high levels of intrasexual competitiveness were more likely to recommend that clients have more hair cut off when the hair condition and the clients expressed a preference for minimal cutting. Another finding is that women advise clients of similar attractiveness as themselves to cut off the most hair participants effectively targeted women they perceived as being on the same attractiveness level potentially to try and reduce their attractiveness. Longer hair is a cue to youth and health. Yeah, men love long hair. I don't think women realize how much men love long hair. She's not a Christian. And now for the separated at birth part of today's intro videos. These men in the RP world. These men will sit here and they'll shame women. They'll talk crap on women all day. All women are holes. Women are this but the problem is is that you are the equivalent of a hoe because you're a bum a bum for a man a man that doesn't have a shit together doesn't have a good career that doesn't have his head on his shoulders. Isn't a leader isn't capable isn't intellectual Etc. You are the equivalent of a woman who's a fucking hoe. It's the same shit woman with a high body count woman. That's fattest woman. That's unattractive. It's the same thing as you in the sexual marketplace because you're supposed to bring safety security. We know women look for survival value and men look for replication value. If you're bringing to the sexual marketplace something other than what women are looking for you're not going to get selected and then these people on their keyboards spazzing out talking shit about women. You're in the desert talking about the water. You better take every drink you can fucking get nigga. That's just how this shit works. How men tend to care about women significantly more than women care about men in terms of like the actual love right? Women will love in this opportunistic fashion. Wait, what? They love you with the expectation and the condition that you're Wait, what? You're providing something in return, right? You're providing safety, security, etc. And they'll love you as long as you're doing that, right? Women perceive that as meaning that women love more. But what it is, you're loving him more because he met all your ton of conditions in the first place. And since all the men couldn't meet those conditions, but this one guy could if you're like, oh, head over heels for this guy. Yeah, got it. But if he stopped meeting those conditions, you put a shot clock on him and eventually you're gone. This is why women leave relationships over 80% of the time to upgrade because you stop meeting their conditions, right? Where did he pick that up? It was that the rules of the game are designed for a world in which there's baseline understandings of morality and the intersexual dynamic. But that has now been blown out the f***ing water. If you're trying to play a new game by old rules. What? Huh? That sounds awfully familiar. You're going to get beat every single time. This is why, just to be fair here, I don't think that men should sit here and say, okay, I'm going to play by the old rules of the game. Wait, what? Huh? If you want to be successful, you got to play by the new rules. You got to spin plates. You got to be the black belt in sexual. I'm sorry. What was that about spinning? What? You got to have experience with women, etc. Maybe if you want to try to remix it and say, okay, well, I'm not going to engage in sex with these women. Fine. But at least date them. At least go out. Have experience in the sexual marketplace dealing with female nature. Because if you enter a relationship, you don't have your s*** together as a man. If you enter a relationship with a woman or even try to date a woman, she's going to melt you dry. She'll sit there, forego sex with you. And because you have a religious belief, you'll wait six months to a year for sex, thinking, oh, this is normal. While she's f***ing the guy from McDonald's because he's hot. This is not the modern sexual dynamic. As a man, you must be the best option for them. And you must operate by the new rules of the game. What? The new rules of the game? I can't believe it. Holy mackerel. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome. We're on earth with that guy. By the way, that guy's podcast, I think, what's it called? Who Hurt You podcast. Bravo, dude. Bravo. Spinning plates, conditional, opportunistic. Let's see. What other terms can you rip off from my book, please? You know, when people, like, throw stuff at me and they're like, they want to talk about, oh, well, Rolla didn't invent all of this stuff. I'm not saying I ever invented it. I'm just saying I did come up with a lot of the terms that end up in shit like this. So welcome. Welcome. Happy New Year or soon to be. Happy New Year. Thanks for. Thanks for watching. Torsha, why are you getting me right now? Okay. I mean, see, this is what I get for leaving. Oh, there's Sam. Thank you, Sam. Sam bought us in the chat today as my moderator. I think I got two more people in there as well. How are you guys doing? I didn't think I was going to even do this show today, quite honestly. But I figured I'd give you a year review. Why not? We can do that. The reason why I didn't think that is because I had to take Ned down to the vet again because he had a new bandage applied about a day ago or two days ago, and he's getting what's called strike through, which means there's a little bit of a seeping through of whatever the fluids are. It might be blood. It might be pus. I don't know what the hell it is. But anyway, but they say if you ever see that, bring the dog in to have him rewrapped. So we went down there. And so if I'm a little bit late, I apologize. But he's okay now. He's good. We're all fine. Happy is sleeping downstairs right now, so we're all good. But that didn't stop me. Also, the other thing that almost stopped me was the lighting in this room. I just got a new soft box over here, and I'm kind of monkeying around with the settings. So if it looks a little bit different, maybe it does. Stop here and see if I can do it. There we go. Much better. So I got that going. I will be glad to answer any and all questions today. There's not going to be any limitation on Super Chats today just because it's New Year's. So I figured to do that. Did you guys check out the rule zero end of the year show? I ended up hosting that as well. It was pretty good. I thought it was good anyways. But, yeah, I've got that guy. I don't know. Somebody just threw this in my Instagram reels and everything, and I picked it up, and then I started looking at some more of these reels from this guy. And I guess the podcast is called, and I hate to give him free traffic, but okay. I mean, he's aiming the right way. If you're going to lift my material, at least give me a reach around, brah. But I saw this guy. I don't know exactly what his schtick is. Am I echoing? No, I'm not. Okay, I'm good. I don't know if I clicked it back over. So, yeah, again, I'm seeing stuff like this quite often. And so I'll call it out. I mean, at least you're on the right page, sort of. I think a lot of people are more averse to calling themselves Red Pill, or they want to say, oh, it's Red Pill stuff. But you'll still use my material, but you'll go after Red Pill guys. And I want to talk about that for a little bit today, too. I think that's going to end up being one of my prognostications for the coming year. I wasn't able to really go into depth too much on the Rule Zero end of the year show. So I might give you a little bit of an embellished, if you didn't get to see that yesterday, I'll give you an embellished prognostication. I definitely need this today. So we will look into the magic eight ball, regardless, irrespective of what Gary, the numbers guy, might think. Gotcha. But let's see. Well, we can start with you, Rational Trucker. How do you feel? How do you feel being married for 40 years after meeting your wife at Woodstock, according to a blueprint? Yeah, would you like me to pull that one up? I have that. Maybe I'll go dig that one out. Yeah, Woodstock. Yeah. No, it wasn't in Woodstock. Trust me. Can I actually tell you what I'm really all about? It's funny you should say that. Thanks for bringing that up. Yeah, we know who this was. That was kind of half the reason why I dropped in the very first video with Destiny. I thought that was interesting. Yes. And I also dig into DJ Academics. I think it's really coming at me personally. say but um i do know that he was just on i think it was marquette from uh i hope i'm saying your name marquette marquette um from saint and center and marquette got no love for dj academics so like we have we definitely have that in common but uh he was uh he was doing a breakdown video i of uh ax um latest where he was talking about how he got rolled for like four hundred thousand or five hundred thousand dollars i can't remember uh by his girlfriend and i can't like they don't pay me to keep up with that shit so i don't really keep up with that but i did catch about 10 minutes maybe 15 minutes of marquette stuff because i do watch marquette um and uh apparently he got rolled for uh four hundred thousand five hundred thousand dollars if anybody has like like can correct me on that i would please uh you know chime chime in in the chat i'll be happy to throw you on the screen but um yeah i saw that and i thought it was interesting because i have some other people who are watching uh instagram like my instagram spies and my twitter spies and everything i don't call it spies they just like throw things at me now and then um and somebody said i forget who it was somebody was say they sent me a link to a reddit uh post where um dj academics was coming at the red pill um those red pill guys and i i get it that's he that's his shtick right he wants to he wants to come at uh he wants to come out the red pill it's interesting to me because it seems like there's like a little bit of cognitive dissonance there for him because he's all very supportive of fresh and myron for the most part but then comes at me and i'm like dude you know that myron's like a majority of myron's stuff i'm not saying all of it but a majority of myron's stuff has been inspired or as a derivative of my books doesn't know doesn't care same thing with uh with the guys from uh flagrant too which i did see that uh what was it andrew schultz and akash i don't even know his last name uh once again throwing gasoline on the fire myron gains which by the way i think is kind of funny but anyways um the time to have gone after andrew schultz was about a year and a half ago maybe two years ago when the when the iron was hot but i guess now like myron really wants to like fight somebody myron it's like he wanted to fight who did he want to fight first i i forget who oh abba abba from abba and preach he wanted to go after them first and then he wants to go now he wants to go like dude bro like slow your roll man uh anyways uh i will i will try to stay up on top of this stuff as best i can spectator those red pill guys thanks yeah i need a shirt that says red pill those red pill guys or that red pill guy maybe i should do that i bet that would sell pretty well uh what are the chances of legislation being introduced to punish bachelors that refuse to participate in society uh slim to none uh because no one cares as long as you got a job as long as you're gainfully employed you're as long as you're an efficient slave that's it's all good how do i feel after being for you yeah i thought that was funny i'm gonna dig that up rational trucker actually uh sam if you can go dig that file up for me i have it i i just it's just on my youtube history i have to go i'll just go find it uh i wasn't planning on on digging into that but maybe i will uh jason crabber uh happy new year happy new year to you too my friend um long-time listener first time caller first time paying tuition for podcast pod class thank you very much about time the rational mail should be required reading for all men entering the dating market thank you rollo for uh for everything you do i don't think enough people really realize how old the rational mail is it is officially 10 years old as of soon to be last year uh let's not forget uh you're almost takedown in 23 due to a so-called troll yeah let's not forget that one almost uh you've mentioned that insight for women is extremely rare yes uh what percentage of women would you estimate have insight that's a hard call uh would you say most relationships fail because women lack insight yes i do because uh because insight okay let me back up just a little bit when i talk about like what is value added for a woman like when people say well what's a high value woman rollo i'm gonna point to the hottest piece of ass that i can find right i mean look big tits nice ass yeah perfect you know thigh gap i'm gonna point to that first obviously because guys are going to look for you know fertility youth beauty sexual availability so let's just get those out of the way and then we can get into other things icing on the cake right and i think that if you are looking or you're vetting i hate that word you're vetting for a girlfriend i'm not going to say why if you're vetting for a long-term relationship uh i think insight is the number one thing men ought to be looking for in women meaning that they are not just i mean for women to have like true insight like real genuine insight it means they have to in some way get over themselves um they have to get past that innate solipsism and i've done full videos about women's solipsism i've done all kinds of um all kinds of essays on solipsis on the solipsism of women and people like really want to call me to the carpet for that because they want to say well where's the where's the evidence where's the research on you're not going to find research on female solipsism because solipsism as a term is really a philosophical term but it can also be a technical term meaning that the only you know really the only thing that women think about is themselves not that that's a bad thing that is a feature not a bug of female nature they have to be that way because they have to be concerned with their own survival they are the incubators of the next generation and they have to be solipsistic enough so that the world kind of turns around them because they're interested like almost like to the point of ocd about their own interests about their own survival about they are the vulnerable sex and so therefore looking for long-term security and security for their children that is what i mean when i talk about solipsism in the sort of red pill red pillion red pillion terminology um so am i talking about the philosophical concept no i'm talking about like the the really the psychological concept and for a woman to have really to have true insight to have some sort of like you know to question her own motives or have a question about why she did what she did maybe i should apologize maybe i should think differently about this maybe i should reconsider having those kinds of things it requires a woman to sort of like push past that innate solipsism and that's why it is so very rare uh in women because it's something that i think i mean i'm sure there's probably a genetic component to it as well um like a like an intellectual intellect like an iq component to it but it's also you know what what was your upbringing like um were you are you know how did you have brothers and sisters that might be something that contributes to it and i think that a lot of people mistake female solipsism for narcissism and which is an easy thing to do today because when you see women on like the women on the street talking about their their uh body counts at mac murphy um looking dead at you we'll come back to that because i kind of want to get into the body count thing a little bit today because that was one of the key uh the key features the key topics for uh 2023 but um pushing past that um getting past the uh the solve the innate solipsism and because you're going to women in general are not going to be able to have sort of a true insight until they can sort of like um i hate to say be busted down a notch because i don't even like that but it's it's learning humility i guess and a lot of women don't really learn humility until it's too late until it's like until they're in the in the early 30s maybe mid 30s range and that's when they start thinking differently and that's when it's like oh i better get right with god i better do things the right way i need to start i need to shape up i need to do something i've got a kid now i gotta find a right i need i need a man with benefits um and that's when insight comes in i hate to say that like for most women it is like something that they're sort of through trauma and crisis that they have to come to um i am i think i also mentioned that most women are not um they don't think in terms of grand strategy and that's also another rare gift is for women who can see sort of the force for the trees and say okay where do i i'm 23 now where do i want to be when i'm 33 rather than living in the moment and having everything be about you know the most immediate stimuli that's sort of coming to them and you know they're at the top of their game right then we just talked to that where he's just looking at the uh the on the street interviews of women and their body counts you know they're very forthcoming about that stuff if you go if you go and ask them casually on the street i mean they they know that they're being observed that one girl actually says here's all the here's all the dudes i banging right literally keeping a a tally of all the guys and all the names right um why i don't know it's kind of interesting to me like if a guy if a gamma male guy keeps a an excel spreadsheet of like all the reasons why his wife or his girlfriend or whatever all the reason why he gets rejected or he gets turned down for sex because his wife has got a headache or whatever the fuck it is right that guy's a creep but the woman who keeps like this big you know tally this lot this list of names of the guys that she's fucked that's like empowering girl you go but if a guy did that that's like almost i would say that's sexual harassment so interesting you want to talk about double standards i'll talk about those standards that's a double standard right there there are more i will i will go i will die on this hill there are more double standards for men than there are for women hit me up about that sometime uh you mentioned the inside okay i got the inside thanks tom uh let's see uh ultra oh do you want that one okay i'll give it to you i used this already he's not a christian there you go hope you're happy i'll do it you know what it's new year's eve you want a sound drop i'll give you a sound drop what it what's f you money for all for you at this age mine is 12 million dollars um it's not two i could tell you that right now uh a million dollars does not go as far as uh as a lot of people think it does i'm still not a quote-unquote millionaire so just i'm gonna put that out there on the record right now um do i have a million dollars in the bank no i don't did i make a million dollars in any of the years that i've been sort of doing what i've been doing no i come close but no so uh i will be since we're getting to know rollo tamasi i'll be more than happy to tell you this is like i get i get like i rub elbows and hang out with guys like robert kiyosaki ken mcelroy jason hartman uh george gammon guys who are well i would i'm i'm i'm fairly convinced that uh ken mcelroy if he's not a billionaire he's just this side of being a billionaire i know how much these guys are worth and y'all think i am way more paid than i am i really not i uh i was in a i was in my patreon group my zoom call my patreon group but i was i was talking about i think this was last year and um i said oh sorry you know i was a little bit late i said sorry i had to go out and shovel snow i'm doing snow my own snow removal at my my new place because i'm still still kind of getting to know you know red one studios in this this area here and they're looking at me like you do your own snow removal like yeah i'm on my own goddamn lawn i pick up the dog shit too it's just i gotta get done somehow so i don't have people for that but uh f you money let's see not two million because that goes so quick because i want to do things with my money um i would say probably yeah you said 12 even that's a little over the top i would say probably like somewhere around eight maybe eight to ten i guess sort of do what you want i can do what i want now i buy the things that i want to buy i bought two cars this year i did cars that i wanted i bought a chrysler 300 hemi nice and i got a uh i have a new uh as you know i've got the new camaro as well too that's my vegas car but the uh the 300 was meant to be a vegas car and probably still will be i just have a garage for the winter time up here but i get the things that i want it's like oh it's not a lambo i don't care the the camaro is going to have a twin turbo kit installed so so it might not whip and it might not be a lambo but it's still going to make a lot of noise let's see happy new year what would you say are the priority things to negotiate in a divorce for someone like d like destiny the d we want to call him by his name steve steve but now um what are the priority things to negotiate well i think he's already out of it uh okay i have a confession to make i will i will cop to this because she'll probably just uh uh screen cap to the messages anyways but i reached out to uh to melina because there was a point where i thought hey maybe maybe james sexton would like to represent melina in her divorcings and by the time i had already like made that approach or like i i got into her dms or whatever uh i said hey uh i can put you in touch with james sexton if you are going to be going through a nasty divorce or something like that unfortunately she had already settled or there was already there was already a done deal and so i just left it alone but um like and well you need anything fine but i think and in this this is what um this is what james sexton was telling me is that you can do a post-nuptial agreement and i thought who the fuck is going to recreate that but apparently she she's already sort of cashed out or checked out um i don't know so don't ask me whether or not destiny paid for her taxes and i don't somebody said two hundred thousand somebody said three hundred thousand i don't know so you guys can go find out for yourself but apparently there's been some talk about like i don't know if this is in the past or maybe it was on his his uh his reddit channel or whatever the hell it was somebody was saying that he had uh friended her like three hundred thousand dollars for like back taxes or something like that i'm not sure but i do know that that wasn't someone it was a talking point put it that way uh not unlike well what i do know for a fact is that dj academics got rolled for about what two hundred thousand three i don't know four hundred thousand or five hundred thousand dollars by a girlfriend if there's any guy and you know maybe i should just like put out a a peace offering for for dj academics because i know he's struggling with alcoholism right now um but uh i would say this is that if anybody needs the red pill it's act act needs he needs a red pill especially you know i think somebody showed me this one video about like how he's talking about how the red pill doesn't talk about um
