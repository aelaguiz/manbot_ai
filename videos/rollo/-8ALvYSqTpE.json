My name is Michael Sartain. I'm a cat DILF. I have a podcast that pisses a lot of people off because I tell people numbers that really, really make them angry because apparently people don't like math. And and yeah, I do access Vegas with the world. We do this crazy show in Las Vegas something. Yeah. Hi, I'm Rolla Tomasi the author of the multi international selling best-selling book the rational male who will soon be in Kenya and Nairobi Kenya very soon and we do this little show called access Vegas. Oh, by the way. I also go by that red pill guy to I answer those red pill guys. Yeah, that's who they're talking and he's a rocker. I try to do my best. Okay, so kick it off with the first question here ladies. So most of us have been on this already. Of course. We're a bit older been on multiple dates, but what disqualifies a guy for you on a date? For example, it could be hygiene to be how it looks. What's the disqualifier for you on the first date? Yes. We'll start like right here. Absolutely. It's going to be your hygiene. You have to know how to brush your teeth kind of wipe your own ass, right things of that sort things. I shouldn't have to tell you you need to do right All right, what about you? Have you encountered many men who don't know how to wipe their ass? They had to find out If you give them enough GHB they just poop on themselves, you know what you told me, you know what you told me summer What about you Rose give her that mic and summer take that mic. All right. Okay, when you say hygiene, could you tell us an example? from a date yeah, like Brush your teeth, please always brush your teeth. What if they smell like weed? That's fine What about you So for me, I think it would be like poor communication skills and social skills Like how does he communicate with his peers and other people like but how did you get to know that? If you don't go on a first date with him Well, I've been on a first date with some Communication skills. Yeah, but you won't know until you're on the date with them, right? Yeah, true. Okay So what this qualifies them from the first date then? We come back to you, what about you I'm question are we already on the first date? It's no like it like you're not even gonna give him a chance. Yeah That's hard because I usually Okay You can only squat four plates Yeah, what's an automatic disqualifier that first thing that comes to mind Sometimes if they're a little too sexual at first without okay. Yeah, okay And sexual with a little bit of like too much like being demanding a little bit like disrespect. Mm-hmm. Okay What about you? That implies that you're on the first date already we're talking about before you know in a first date They will like try to know before the first day. Let's clarify before you can get on the date How do you just say no disqualified not even going on a date at all? Yeah, I mean if they start asking about like your friends, how can you bring a friend? Okay So bring you two girls. Yeah, they tell you to bring a friend. Yeah But hold on that is it to bring a friend so that they can bring a friend to and it's a double date or bring A friend so he could take you and your friend out maybe but you know guys tried to just Which one is that? Whichever one Really go in first days like that Like I don't don't blind this but I think if he was like that usually like guys when you're texting and stuff They're like, oh and you have friends or something like that. And he's like That's it. You just stop talking to them. Okay? Lady, I have a question. What about if he doesn't like it when you rip his shirt off in the middle What about biting random people Dude she was famous you go out in the clubs just rip dude shirts off and just fucking run It was amazing and I always used to pick the ones they had the most expensive shirts A funny thing is that's not a date. That's not a deal-breaker for the guys What about you so immediate disqualifiers Yeah, if I'm looking on a dating app at someone it's gonna be image-based most likely So it's gonna be someone who's either really out of shape or someone who has you know A lot of balding going on and someone who probably doesn't have you don't have to have a ton of swag But if you don't know how to dress yourself, you look Like you even left your mom's house in several years. It's a disqualifier You know, he's immediately out. I'm Canadian. So that's what's true. No, that's that's so actually that's a good point You know if someone and so I don't like to paint a broad stroke over all people because I think Some people you know might have certain things that are stronger in some aspects And so if someone was a liberal hypothetically, I'm not but and they were really strong in other areas For example, they're really successful or really high achievers or very good-looking Potentially I'd give them a chance. So I wouldn't say that's an immediate disqualifier. It's it's not a it's not a green flag But yeah image-based and then in person it just made me think I was walking my dog. Well, hold on This is just the first disqualifier. What about you for me? It would have to be like overly Bragging about themselves their bio. Yeah, or even when you're communicating with them and text Yeah, it's always about just them. There's a story being a porn star. Do you get that like a lot? I do. Mmm, I do. Well, it's you know, they want to prove to you want to prove that they're That guy. Okay. Yeah understandable. Okay. What about you? Um, I think that's Personality is a big thing. Like if they come across way too Strong that's kind of a big with the sharp strong like I'm just over Excited to talk to you and try to take you out like that. All right too much interest. All right. Yeah All right. What about you? No sense of humor. No sense of humor. Mm-hmm So what are you gonna like like if you make a joke and they don't like laugh or something like that? No, they make jokes. They need to make the joke You're a comedian, right? Yeah, so I need a left. Are you funny? sometimes Depends on the person some people think I'm funny. Some people think I don't I'm not Okay, what about you? I'd say a basic bad grammar to skinny gang of kids and how many women they follow and their follow list Okay, bad grammar kids and follow ratio. That's a white roll and Starting real quick. What are them for you disqualifiers disqualifier for me would be Just like sort of it's so funny because it's like the girls I'm friends with or the exactly the girls I would never fucking date. I love them. They're hilarious. I love having them on my show They make a great show but uh You know just like full of fucking red flags like bragging about like levels of independence and a necessity to not have not need a man At all at being independent is fine But it's just like one of these things where like men are useless Or something like that or just basically when you have a conversation with them about like, hey Do you know you're more likely to cheat if you if you fuck more guys before you got married and they disagree they start yelling At you because of that like that type of shit. I think that's a huge disqualifier. Just they don't bring any peace She's overweight I said you can't judge a book by its cover of it's like yeah, but you've got to see what the cover is, right? So and I hate to say but I mean, I'm just being honest like you can just judge his caloric intake by the cover exactly because it says a lot about your habits to like if you're if you're if you're in shape that tells me that you like Have some sort of dedication and perseverance because it take I mean, especially today. It's like 75% of the population is overweight. So, all right. I got a question for the ladies real quick She didn't know so I would say at first glance she said fitness physical fitness. I mean, are you gonna be healthy? Are you gonna live long? Are you gonna protect me? Yeah, you just like me Okay, we can start hearing their work our way back Assuming the guy checks all your boxes and he's attractive and you would see yourself going on a first date with him Does it matter where he takes you? Hmm? Yes or no? Yes Why? Because I think You're representing what you're gonna be in the long run. Um, I don't do like the coffee date I don't like dates that are basic unimaginative. You don't have to take me to You know, I mean, you have to take me to the most expensive restaurant, but you should think about it I don't like a man that looks like he's just playing numbers. Okay, you know assuming you Okay, take Applebee's Real quick assuming you Assuming you like the guy and he checks your boxes. He's funny He's what he's charismatic and all these things in conversation doesn't matter where he takes you on the first date. Yes. Okay, why? Well, if you're talking like restaurant wise, no, not necessarily But I just don't like to be like hanging out in the front seat of a fucking car Okay, assuming it's not him telling you to come over to his house or let's hang out You know doing something strange that puts you in a safety situation Not really, okay, then it doesn't matter Yeah Let me make sure I add that caveat if he's attractive and you find everything about him to be up to standard etc And he invites you on a date and it's nothing weird where your safety is a you know Risk doesn't matter where he takes you. I definitely don't think it does. Okay. What about you? I do I do Okay, why does it matter? I I like an adventure and I like something, you know, exciting. Okay All right, what about you So it's not a deal-breaker But I'm taking notes For example, I had that exact situation happen a few weeks ago Great guy took me to Benihana, which was fun and cute not super expensive But and it was not a deal-breaker, but it told me a little bit I think about maybe his socioeconomic status or his level of investment in me or what kind of you know restaurants He likes to frequent and that indicates to me lifestyle compatibility So it's not a deal-breaker, but I'm taking notes and you bougie, huh? Sorry I Mean you're a matchmaker so you understand the male perspective wouldn't it be fair to say that a lot of women go out for certain experiences and that's a Screening tactic to get rid of women that are there just for an experience versus to get to know the guy I certainly from a man's perspective could see that you know, if a man does not want a gold digger He might test her that way. Yeah, but from a woman's perspective It's a test too because I want to see how much you want to impress me as a man. Mm-hmm I don't think men think that deeply Yeah, I don't think they think that deeply to oh, let me do this to screen her They're looking for majority are looking for the fastest way to the vagina. I don't think they're thinking Well, let me do this and see how they're hoping that she they're hoping that she likes them no matter what he does That's what they're doing is expensive to some guys I'm not suggesting that men are testing women I'm just saying if that's the case I for myself, so it's not disqualify You'll go out but you're gonna be observing what goes on. I'm taking notes and I also look at it holistically You know if someone if that's the best that they can do and I see potential in them and they're ambitious Maybe I will give them a chance interesting, okay, I Disagree with you on that point because the guys that women want are gonna absolutely employ that test that you don't think is a test But that's fine. No, no, the women will I'm saying the no I know the guys won't play the test where they take her to somewhere that isn't necessarily as expensive or luxurious to see how she Responds what tax bracket is Ian though? Because I think a regular average. No, I'm serious a regular average working guy will ask Hey, let's do coffee That's why I qualified it by saying the men that are attractive that women want that have the network and the status a lot of the Times they'll test women by taking them somewhere. That isn't expensive to see how they react Well that I agree with if he's if he's in a certain tax bag I'm talking about the guy but you'll never know you'll disqualify that guy and you'll be like, oh he took me try to offer me To coffee. I'm not going. Well, I've been lucky enough to date guys that don't play games. That's a game That's not a game. You know, it's a game. It's it's literally a game. It's the definition It's literally wouldn't it be fair to say that women are the ones that play the game because the man has to attract her to some degree For the game to even begin I would say that women play a lot more games than men Yes, but that that's a game like let me let me hide You know that I date guys that are like this is what I'm worth This is what I'm coming with either you like it or you don't I feel like it's more of a self-preservation Tactic than a game like maybe he's protecting himself from being taken advantage of or used for their own reasons No, but what's the point of a date though again? I asked what's the tax bracket because men because men of means are not gonna play this game One microphone at a time because anytime you're speaking and there's other people speaking it hurts the quality of the show and the audience gets really Annoyed so if someone's speaking, please be quiet. So real quick a date What's the point of a date? To get to know the person. So is that a game? No, it's not a game. It doesn't have to be game I'm saying someone that's listen. No, I didn't say it's a game. I said someone that's pretending to be something They're not to test you. That is a game. That's like me showing up today I'm showing up in a bonnet and slippers to see if he really likes me. That's a game. I'm playing a game The point is to get to know someone on the right. So whether it's at Starbucks or at Fontainebleau doesn't really matter If he's if he's pretending that he can only afford Starbucks that is a game sir, that's a game But he's not pretending to take it forward both you can afford both No, but but if he's doing it with the intention to test her that is a game. It's simple math No, no, I understand that but what I'm saying is that women play the game too. Absolutely Okay, so so it for someone to play chess with you. You need an opponent, correct? Yes So therefore women play the game some men play the game as well Just that women don't like it women play the game as well. If not better than themselves. That's why women don't like that Well, I mean, it doesn't matter to me like women and men. It's not gender-specific women and men play games Yeah But women play games the majority of the time is just that very few men can actually compete and play the game back and better Yet at them. I agree with that as well So what I'm saying is that like the reason why guys will employ a tactic like that especially high net worth individuals because I know them and I know that they do this is because there's a lot of Vulturous women out there that are just looking for a bag or looking to get an experience, etc So let me test this chick. Let's go to get some coffee and see how she responds and she says no, I'm good I don't want that. Fuck you. That's how they move But you know men of means they're not a monolith because I know wealthy men as well and they're like, hey I don't give a damn. I want someone that looks good on my arm. You got a six-pack. You got a nice round booty I'm good with that. I know you're here for the money and I'm here because you look good Then they're just they're just smash and that's that's an L for you as a female Anyway, what's not an L if all she wants to do is smash There's this theory that men don't just that women don't just want to smash news flash guys Lots of women just want to smash and they want a guy that's gonna take him to really nice Here's the thing the majority of men aren't running rampant looking for wives the majority of them are looking to smash So women are like I don't mind smashing, but I'd rather smash after no boo than after Starbucks Yeah But that what you just defeated our own argument because women treat sex as a value-loaded exchange not an equal value exchange like you're trying To say it's not an equal value exchange It's I need something in return for the sex and a lot of times that means I need more energy and effort than I put In to get the sex when I'm saying is that cool that guy could put that effort in or whatever and if he has the Means and the money to do so But you're just gonna be putting a sex only category and never get the relationship that you want, right? But that's again women are not a monolith. Some women don't care"}
