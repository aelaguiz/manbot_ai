One novice frigate is on the way out. Welcome to Rules and Row, gotta get my radio announcer's voice so I can annoy Ryan Stone. Welcome to the year-end super stream extravaganza. There we go, there we go. Look who I have with me today, my goodness. If you're trying to get in, I got you probably in the back there. There's a crotchety old man. There's Miguel. Hang on, guys, I see you, Jesse, I see you, Ray, I'll bring you back in in just a minute. Okay, who's echoing, someone's echoing, who's echoing, who's echoing, who is it, you? It's not me, is it? It's not me. No? All right. That's one, two. All right. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go around the horn. Oh, look, there's Ryan. Ryan decided to join us. I forgot to hit the button. I'm stupid. Relax. Welcome. Okay, so let's go around the horn right quick here just so everybody knows who the cast of characters is today. Thank you, guys, for showing up. This is our year-end review. And, gosh, somebody is really mouthing off here. Hang on. Who is this? Is this you? Everybody mute real quick. There we go. Oh, it's you, Paul. I got you. Welcome to the show. Let me see if I can get that. There we go. Much better. Much better. All right. Year-end review. Rule zero. This is the show that we usually do to cover what we did last year, what we're going to do this year, what happened. We're just going to ask some random questions. We got a lot of people. I have people still waiting in the waiting room right now, which is great. I didn't think I'd have such a great turnout. I have first with me, I got Ryan Stone. How are you doing? Good. Dude, Christmas is wonderful. Isn't it? Merry Christmas. New studio. The girl renovated. I get to podcast about being a man. She gets to run all the power tools. It's a perfect relationship. You rule. And Dread is crushing it, by the way. I got Paul. Yeah, I was just going to say, you got your book going? And Paul, how are you doing? Yes, I have a book going too. Man, things are great. Things are great. Can't complain. Awesome. Awesome. I got Jack Napier in the house all the way. Hello. Where are you from? Where are you in the Netherlands? The North. The North. So not Ski Dam. So are you above Schiphol? Oh, yeah. Way above. That's like the north. I'm in the northeast of Ski Dam and even light out there right now. It's got to be like dark as hell. Oh, no, it's dark as hell out here as much as my bedtime versus first. There's a first for everything. I've got. Oops. Wait a minute. Where'd you go? Nuke. What's up, man? Say your name. Say your name. Introduce yourself. Nucleic. I'll just call me Duke for short. I like Ryan's pronunciation. The best. He has like three different associations. I love him. Not much. Just causing havoc on Twitter and youth. Thanks for having me. Excellent. Yeah. Yeah. You're you're the newest ad. So I just thought everybody went out. We occasionally we open up the the membership of Rule Zero to get some fresh blood in. And you are one of the latest members. Where are you? Where are you streaming from? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So where are you streaming from? I'm I'm in Dallas right now. Dallas, Texas. Cool. Cool. Cool. And for the first time, my red pill Muse has decided to join us. I have the Maya Allegra with me today. Maya has been on Access Vegas God knows how many times and SauceCast. So I already that was I think that was the last one we did together. And you've been making the rounds. You're just out in Manhattan or just out in New York. Not too long ago. And I think I know where you're at right now. Are you in Sarasota? You're in Florida, right? Yeah. I'm home now. Okay. I went to New York before Christmas kind of celebrate and get in the spirit and then came back down here for actual Christmas Day to spend it with family. Excellent. Good. Good. Good for you. So how's your how's your year been going? What is that like? Yeah. Introduce yourself. Okay. So my name is Maya or Maya Allegra, if you know me from Instagram. I picked up modeling again. I've been modeling since I was very, very young, a baby, and then picked up modeling again in May. Took off really well, really haven't been home since I've been on Axis Vegas, I think more than anybody. Yeah. On Axis, I think five times. And then we did the SauceCast together, but it's been a really great year. It's been really successful as far as trying to reach my goals. Excellent. Excellent. Good. Good to have you. Got some fresh blood. And we've got some old blood here. I'm going to refer to you as Dr. Thor now, because apparently we can use any pronouns we'd like. So therefore, you are now officially Dr. Thor. That'll fit. I mean, it was particularly since I am a below average God amongst men, but I have a book too. If you want to acquire a dominant masculine presence and go beyond alpha and beta, I have an introduction to I hear, yeah, it was written by you, right? We got to repeat that day. That was a good day. That was fun. We'll have to do that again. That was one of the highlights of my year, actually, was us buying the now infamous Camaro. Yeah. Last year's year-end show. We're batting over 80%, I think. Yeah, I think so. I think we're doing pretty good so far. Gubna. The Gubna. What's up, man? Unmute yourself. Well, here, I'll unmute you. There you go. Unmute yourself. There. Are we good now? Yeah, you're good. Okay. Keyboard shortcut doesn't work. Noted. All right. Anyway. Yeah. I'm the governor. I'm on Twitter and YouTube, got a gaming stream channel going on. Need to jump back into it, but hey, that's what this new year's for. So I'm ready and excited. Good to have you. The incomparable old man, old man river of the manosphere. Are you now a red pill adjacent, Cappy, or are you not? I am. Wait, where am I now? Yeah. Are you red pill adjacent? I'm pretty red, but no, after all I've been through, no, I'm pretty much in the thick of it. I'm off Main Street. Yeah. Yeah. So. And you just did an interview with Mike Sartain. Yeah, I did. Yeah. It's in the can. It'll be published. Like he says, it's going to be the first one he publishes next year. Now, I know both of you can talk a lot. Who talked the most in that interview? It was 50 50. Yeah. He's a good interviewer, by the way. He has a lot of follow up. Yeah. No, a lot of people don't pick up on that skill, but to have an interview go two hours and not miss a beat, that takes a lot of pre-planning and thought. So he's really good. Yeah. And I have to say, I will admit that Cappy has been my savior for like at least half of this year because I have been sort of bivouac-ing in his house in Vegas for, God, I don't even know what, six months, eight months now. I enjoy driving the car around. I have zero car expense. I haven't put any miles on my own car. All of the coming around the raceway and the real fun. Miguel. Where's Miguel? There's Miguel. There you are. What's up, man? Cheers. Happy New Year. Happy New Year, man. What's, I was going to do a whole bit like, cause everyone was doing like they have their own books or I also have my own book, Weapons right here, World War II, and The Auto Trader. What's up? That's great. That's great. But yeah, resident crypto guy, along with Charlie and yeah, crypto market is booming right now. Yes. I gotta also point out that Miguel is my partner in crime and my partner in business as well. He's my heterosexual life mate. You have to clarify. Rolo, ever since you got on that most wanted list, we're all in this together. Oh yeah. We're all going down. I was going to say we will, we must all stick together or we'll all hang together, right? All right. So let's see. I've got Jesse. I have you in the back. Ray, I got you in the back too. I'll put you guys up here in just a minute, just shortly. But what I want to get started with here is just what was your, I'll just go around the horn. You guys tell me what your highlight of the year was, what you see coming and what you'd like to, what you'd like to do coming up in the, in, in 2024. Now before I start making a, going around the horn here, just bear in mind, we are now in an election cycle. And before I even get started, I also have to point out that I think I was pretty much right about the fact that this, this show last year, I said this, I said that by August of this year, you would not recognize the manosphere. And I was wrong. It was June. Actually, it was actually earlier than August. And I think you'd be wrong. There's a lot of things that have been going on. And so before you, before you sort of mull this over in your brains, remember, we're also have destiny getting divorced. We also have Steven Crowder getting divorced, whatever, what else blew up in our faces? This, this fresh and fit got demonetized, Pearl got demonetized, Andrew Tate went to jail. Your Tate is, is on his, if not, he's on his way to prison. So yeah, I mean, there's a lot, a lot to talk about as far as a year in review, but you don't necessarily have to talk about that kind of stuff. Candace Owens versus Ben Shapiro, Matt Stedman went to jail. I kind of want to know what Ryan's favorite meme was that he threw out on Twitter this year too. The whatever podcast memes, the whatever podcast memes were the best. Yes. Yes, they were. So I'm going to get started here. Let's actually, Nuke, let's go with you first. What was your, what was your highlights of this year? And what do you see coming down the pipe? My highlight, like personally, I mean, I wrote that dating thread and it caught a lot of eyes. So that was, that was good. I realized that a lot of guys are putting in the work to, to improve themselves. So that was very interesting to learn. I thought everyone, we were all in this together, but no, no one really cares as much as I do. So it's very nice to do, to find people that do and really are, you see the difference between people that just talk about this stuff and try to monetize it for fun and like just for cloud and people that actually care. So it's good to meet the guys that actually helped me kind of reach out to other people too. So the guys know, those guys know who they are. For my prediction for 2024, I would say two things, basically for me, the alpha fucks beta bucks, the chasm between that is going to widen, right? As women become more financially independent and care less about the average man's opinion, they're going to kind of, uh, that, that kind of like chasm between alpha and beta is just going to go like, cause I, I, I go out on dates with girls that are just normal girls with normal jobs and they still sugar date, uh, whether it be on purpose or by accident, guys are still buying, uh, women's stuff, uh, to normal women. I couldn't imagine very attractive women, you know? And then my second prediction is that the language like the, the, the most powerful tool they have, uh, that guy, not since you're again, a centrism has, in my opinion is language, right? So if you notice over the years, at least these past two years, we've gone from boyfriend or girlfriend to partner, like everyone's saying partner now, and I'm like, when did this happen? And it's because the language is very sneaky. It's it's a, it sinks into the way we, to the way we think. And, um, um, there's research that says that the language you use affects the way you think. So language is like, what's going to like really be the most pervasive tool they have, whether it be on purpose or they do it, you know, um, subconsciously. And I would say that, uh, they're going to start pathologizing age gaps between, uh, older men and younger women, uh, for dating. Um, and we can't really see that because the oldest millennial women are now hitting 43, 44. They're getting past that, that point of no return for fertility, um, even with science. So they're going to start really looking back at the guys that did everything right and are just kind of like living what they want in their dating life. So those are my predictions. Yeah. Excellent. Excellent. Thanks for that. Yeah. I was going to say is, uh, the, on the partner thing, I was just joking about like Miguel, I can't introduce Miguel or, or Mike as my partner without going, my business partner, really? Stop, stop. Yeah. I called out, um, I called out, uh, Jedidiah Bila back as far as 2022, I think, Miguel, when we were out there and I was like, don't call your husband, your partner for fuck's sake. You know, you really want to help. So like, just call him your husband instead of my partner, this, like, ah, roll my eyes one more time. Uh, let's see, uh, governor, what do you see coming down the, uh, the pipe here, my friend? Oh my goodness. Where do I start? Um, well, first of all, with the partner thing, my favorite way to address that is to say Oh, so you're, uh, unhappy with your guy. Got it. Um, I had a girl that would tell me that same exact thing and yeah, that language. I think, uh, nukes, uh, language point is extremely a good one. Um, I'd also say my prediction for this year though is, um, we're probably going to be introduced to a lot more female influencers this year. Pearl was just the beginning. I highly believe that we're going to get a lot more of those even in say the age range of like in their thirties, forties, possibly, uh, shooting out more videos, trying to get more views, trying to get more guys to want to, uh, notice them basically because. We're going to see a lot more single women that are going to have guys drool all over them and basically, here you go, pay attention to me, I'll give you money, I'll give you attention. And then, you know, they're going to find out that these girls don't like it very much. But once they get engaged, as we've seen this year alone, and then another prediction would be a more political one, but we can get into that later. But I believe that we're going to have no choice but to have female vice presidential candidates. And I think for 2024, we're especially going to see an increase of that in future elections as well. Yep. I feel you. Let's see. Gov, I'm going to boot you for a minute, and I'm going to put in Jess real quick. So let me pull him out. Bro, I have to go, too. Okay, Cappy, let me get you in there, Cappy, then. I gotta hike. I gotta hike. Well, we wouldn't want to keep you from your hike, man. We know how important those are, too. Is that what the gays call it these days, Cappy? I'm so thankful that I have all my friends and Jack in the Internet. Predictions real quick, I guess. I think men are going to continue to accelerate going gold as the Internet kind of makes it undeniable how much reciprocal interest or lack of reciprocal interest men and women have in each other. So not a bold prediction on my part that things will continue to decline as they will. I also think this relatively recent trend with girls like, oh, my God, traditionalism, tee-hee, I want to so be the stay-at-home, that is going to be exposed for the money-making, click-baiting, attention-grabbing trend that it is once it does not result in more traditional type of behavior, girls losing weight or getting, frankly, fuckable. And so that, I think, will be exposed even before June of 2024. And then otherwise, yeah, what I'm doing, I'm going hiking and I'm enjoying life. All the houses are done. I don't have to do anything anymore. And now I can finally, in theory, continue to do this until I'm dead, where I want to work less. I want to do four hours a day, and that's it, and have a hard stop. I think what the audience really wants to know is, will you be riding your motorcycle from Las Vegas to Sturgis, actually riding it instead of trailering it? I've never trailered my motorcycle. I am not Glenn Lawrence. I am more like Paul. Paul rode up to Sturgis. But I will say, I've already ridden across the country multiple times in Alaska and Mexico, but I got a motorcycle up there and I got a motorcycle down here. So I just hop on my Spirit Airlines flight and I just go- Spirit. Well, it's Allegiant now. Spirit, sadly, does not fly to Rapid City. Kind of hurts me a little bit, but I still occasionally, if I don't have to, like, I'm not going to find a Minneapolis or something, I'll take Spirit. It's Allegiant now, or some country, I forget which one, that goes to Rapid City. Cool. Cappy, thanks for joining us. Yeah. Good luck to all you guys. I'll see you next year. Bye, brother. See you. Fuck you. Bye. Hey, and I think for the first time we've ever had is the other bald guy with the beard. Got Ray in the house. Yes. Ray, introduce yourself right quick. I'm Ray Gardner. I go by Gray Beard Actual on social media. The last year for me is really, I've only been doing this for about a year and a half. So it's gone from something I did on a whim to just basically watching my content evolve. And the only thing I see coming, and I don't have long predictions like everybody else, but I've been paying attention to what you've been saying, the election cycle and everything else coming along with it. I don't know what that's going to look like, but it's not going to be good. With Andrew Tate, Fresh and Fit, you being on this government list or whatever, I just think that's going to be magnified all the more. So more shout outs at least in the future. Cool. Good. Good to have you, man. Thanks for joining us today. Let's see. You know what? I'm going to put Maya in. Maya. Maya, what do you think of all this? Hello. This is your first experience, I think. I mean, this is, I mean, I shouldn't say that. I guess you've known about this stuff for a little bit, but you've known me for about a year now. You were on a private jet with Robert Kiyosaki and you were on that show as well. And so you've been sort of, I guess, immersed and like thrown in the deep end of all this. Just wanted to get your take on it. What do you see coming up? And I mean, it could be anything. You can give your predictions. You can tell what your highlights were for 2023. So as far as the Manosphere, some Red Bull, all the things like that, all I know is from being on your show. So I can't give too much insight on that like everybody else can, but I know that I had a wonderful time on your show and meeting you was great. I'm glad that we got to do the Robert Kiyosaki podcast together. As you know, he was somebody I've been listening to for years and to be able to meet him was fantastic. This year I was really immersed in everything, pretty much. Very go, go, go. I've traveled around 30 times this year, most of which were in Vegas. So I just predict probably more traveling because May will be a year of me doing this. So to not even be a year in and be gone that much, I'm hoping that this year just brings more of those kinds of opportunities for me. Yeah. Now that people are feeling to ask me like, oh, why are you having, why are you having Maya on the show? I saw there are some comments. Is that a woman? Oh my gosh. There's boobs on the show. Now I want to point out that you were probably the favorite of everyone in the chat when we do Access Vegas. And so first of all, let everybody know how old you are right now. I'm 21. Okay. And you'll be 22 in February? In February, yes. February. Okay. And so the reason why I bring you on is because whenever you're on, you have probably the most intelligent, most sober take of any of the girls on the show. That's really why you keep coming back. I think you have been on the show, I think more than Kylie has been on the show. I've been on it quite a bit, yeah. And that was also one of the reasons why I brought you on for Robert Kiyosaki's show because you had already, in fact, when I mentioned that, you had said something to the effect that you had already read Rich Dad, Poor Dad, and you really wanted to be on that. And I was like, okay, well, she'd definitely be the youngest. And I think, I want to say Cailin Franca was probably the oldest in that panel, because we had a panel of four women on that, and it was actually one of the best shows I think we've ever done on Access Vegas. But you always have a really good take. You're way more conservative than I think a lot of people really realize. And I want to also point out that she flies her own happy ass everywhere that she goes to. And I think you quit OnlyFans this year too, as well, didn't you? I did. So the reason why I really had it, and I know that it gets a bad rap and everybody's going to hear that I had one, and they're going to assume that, as people would call it here, 304. But truthfully, when I started modeling and I started traveling, in order for me to really pursue it as hard as I could, I had to quit my job. I couldn't be home all the time and be gone as well. So with Instagram shadow banning me, because I paid for the check mark, and fun fact, they shadow ban you more if you have the check mark, so I got rid of it. Stopped being shadow banned. And I really didn't need the OnlyFans anymore, because what I was being shadow banned for, I would post on there. And keep in mind, I got shadow banned for the video of the back of Deadmau5's head. Even after Access, I wasn't even in the video. So I've never posted anything explicit. I've never gotten down that kind of rabbit hole, and I don't plan to. I think when a lot of people look at my Instagram, or they hear that I've had a fan page, that they assume I'm somewhere that I'm not, that I don't have a certain set of morals or guidelines for myself that I do have. But you have to also understand that the vision that you put out on social media, for everyone across the board, that's typically not who you are at home. So there's parts of it that are very much so me, and there's parts of it that are just me having fun. And when you only see those highlights, you tend to make different kinds of assumptions of people. Okay. Before I let you go, you have to give us at least one prediction, what you think is going to happen in 2024. I think in 2024, I will probably never be home. Yeah, that's probably true. Okay. Thanks for joining us today. I will probably see you again in Vegas. We'll probably have, I can't imagine we wouldn't. Yes. So you brought up my birthday, February. So I actually was meaning to reach out to you about that. So I will definitely see you in February. In Vegas. Cool. Great. We'll have you on. Thanks for coming. Much appreciated. All right, guys. There you go. There's we got, we got one girl. People say we don't have women on this show. There we go. And speaking of women, I got Andrew Wilson just decided to show up to unmute yourself. The insults sound better when you unmute yourself. Andrew said, well, that, that hurts. That hurts my feelings. You cut me deep, man. You cut me deep. You cut me. You cut me bad. How's life treating you guys? Good. Good, man. Good to have you on. I, oh, by the way, your favorite person, James Sexton has, has told me that he is going to be showing up today too, as well. Good. Yeah. So well, I might as well just go with you. What do you, what was your highlight? What was the best thing that happened to Andrew besides the interview that you did on whatever podcast recently? For me, it was the debate that I did with Matt Delahunty where he rage quit in the first eight minutes. Now explain, explain who Matt Delahunty is. I know he is, and probably Ryan does, but I don't know if anybody else does. He's a prominent secular humanist debater. So he, he argues for the atheist position. We did a big, massive IRL debate, which got a lot of traction and we were both the headliners for that debate. So we went last and he rage quit in eight minutes because it was pointed out that his kind of worldview suffered from cognitive dissonance because he's, you know, married to a trans individual. So there, there's a pullback story there, but yeah, I would say that that was the highlight of the year. I didn't know. Yeah. Yeah. That, that was probably the highlight, highlight of the year, mostly because of the rage that came afterwards. I just enjoyed the hell out of it. Yeah. We still yet have to figure out whether or not Lauren Southern and Destiny actually got after it, but I think we'll find out pretty soon. That was actually going to be one of my predictions. I think we're going to find out the truth about that in 2024. I mean, maybe the thing is, is that I think we already know the truth of it anyway. I think we do. I think we already know the truth. It's man, truth always out, but you will, you will see more of these catastrophes happen with these online creators, especially these leftists who are falling apart all over the place as their narratives become challenged across the internet. So it's, it's not going to surprise me to see more and more and more of this kind of stuff coming out for all of these different creators. They can't keep a lid on all the kind of crazy shit that they're up to when nobody's watching, you know? Yeah. I think more, more recently I was, I was really kind of racking my brain doing my notes for today's show. Like there's so much shit that happened in 2023, like just even prior to August. And I mean, if you, if you even just look at just the, the Tate, you know, expos\u00e9s that have come out since, since they were arrested about this time last year, it just excluding that there's still a lot of shit that went down this year. The Crowder divorce, all the, the blow up with destiny, the blow up with, with Warren Southern, God knows what's going to, I mean, it's, I'm just waiting for it to percolate. Just enough so that like, like the, the women who hate on destiny who have always like, sort of like, didn't like him, but had to deal with them. Now that now suddenly they're going to, all the floodgates are going to open as a result of this. Is that what, is that what you're predicting? I think so. I think you're, I think everybody is pretty much dead on when, when they're guessing, guessing, predicting, I guess that we're going to see more females in the trad con space that are just going to sort of run with the new narrative, which I think is going to be the culture war, which we're already seeing, like Tim pool has practically renamed his stream, the culture war. I mean, literally it's in his titles now. So I'm pretty sure that's where we're going. I'll get to that when I give my predictions, but I think it's time to batten down the hatches just like we did in 2020 because a lot of shit happens in this space, in the manosphere space and we go through these cycles and it's usually a four year cycle and it coincides with the election cycle. Well, let me ask you a question and maybe for the whole panel, something that I'm conflicted on a little bit. Okay. So I have noticed that there has been a trend of what you would call the kind of trad grift East Gank, which has come into prominence over the last year. But the thing is, is that if the goal inside of kind of the, the red pill community, which, which I'm not a part of, uh, but I do interact with a lot of red pillars. If kind of the overarching goal is to shame women into more desirable social behavior, then wouldn't that be the preference? Anybody, I, I'm not trying to shame women into doing anything. I don't think you can change women. You can only change yourself and you need to think globally and act locally, work on your own relationship, lead your woman and the rest will fall into place for you. You know, you can't worry about what all these other hoes are doing. Nuke. What's my favorite quote? She doesn't know you. Well, uh, uh, so Andrew, I'm a big, I'm a big fan of your stuff. Right. Um, and I think, you know, probably you're much smarter than I am."}
