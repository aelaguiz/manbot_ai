The first venue is doesn't matter the first venue is anything. So for this perfect hiking, walking and talking, you're going to have this sort of basic vibing conversation. And then for the second venue, I always recommend a bar where you can sit side by side, play the questions game and good chance to make out there. And then if the makeout happens, then I'll go for a venue three, which is a couple's experience. And if I'm feeling like there's not the right vibe to go for the kiss and no makeout all in the date and leave her wanting more. So that's what I would suggest is like do the hike and do it like around sunset because that's, you know, who doesn't like a sunset hike, right? Then from there, like grab a drink. And if she doesn't drink, whatever, she can have a mocktail or she can drink whatever. And then, you know, if there's an opening, like if she's all over you, then maybe you consider ditching the boys. I would have one other venue in mind where you could do some sort of couple's experience. So maybe it's another bar, we could shoot pool or play darts, or maybe it's like an art gallery or is there anything like that in the town where she's at the pool? That's probably like the best thing. My favorite venue three, which is like we made out and the point of the venue three is to have like a couple's experience where you're no longer so focused on the conversation, but you're already making it out. You're basically touching her like she's your girlfriend. And then that builds a lot of sexual comfort to see the next venue, which is her place or your place. My favorite venue for that is like an arcade bar somewhere you can play like pinball, pool, basketball game. You know, you play street fighter, the old style, like video games that can be hard to find given the town, but anywhere where you can shoot pool is also good. And then, you know, if she's all over you. \", \"segments\": [{\"id\": 0, \"seek\": 0, \"start\": 0.0, \"end\": 4.639999866485596, \"text\": \" I always recommend like a multiple venue dating protocol.
