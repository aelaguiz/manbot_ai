Now let's dive into this week's content. All right. Well, I'm excited because we obviously talk about day game on this podcast and we've talked about day game a lot, but we have St. Robert. And I'm saying that with a Scottish accent because my name is also Robert and it's fun to say it like this. St. Robert's Day Game is back. I think we've done how many episodes together? Like five or six? Two or three. I think we've done two or three on each podcast. Two or three on yours and you've been on mine a few times. Yeah. So definitely like four, four to six total for sure. And I don't know two people that have coached more guys in day game than us. Well, there's, you know, some other guys, but I've had all those guys on the podcast, too. So we're two pretty big fucking experts on day game. And we're going to really break down some of the lesser known things about what how guys get stuck in their day game journey. What you can sort of expect in the day game journey. It can be a very frustrating, difficult process, of course. And, you know, St. Robert, you designed a really cool, you know, flow for this talk. So let's let's dive in. Yeah, I have so many no's. Guys, when I'm not looking at the camera, it just means I'm looking at all the no's, like several pages. But one thing I want to make clear, the things we're not going to be talking about today, I'm not going to tell you to just do more volume because you're not going out enough. And I'm not going to be teaching you like you have to use these stacks and this type of teasing and this great story. And then everything is going to work or it's not going to be like a simple one solution because those solutions don't matter. We're going to be talking about the big fundamental things, because after being in this field as a coach for more or less five years, I think I've been coaching for more or less five years. I realized that, yes, there are a lot of guys who try day game. There are a lot of guys gaming on and off, but most of them are just not succeeding. And whenever they reach out to me to learn about day game, I see that they are making the same mistakes. And those mistakes are so big that it's not even worth talking about things like what's the best opener or how should I build attraction or should I invite her to watch a movie or for a drink or to sit on the balcony? Like what's the best seat? Like we're not going to we're going to be talking about the big things. And I'm just going to run quickly through the table of contents. So first of all, we're going to be talking about why most content on day game and dating in general sucks, because I didn't know that. I thought that YouTube is full with good content. But one day in Mexico years ago, I just I was I was not sober at all. Let's put it like that. And I searched on YouTube day game. I guess I thought, OK, let's see what guys have. There is a lot of good content. And I was I was shocked by what I saw, the quality of like videos and infields. And it was unbelievable. So definitely we're going to we're going to talk about that and why that content still works and why you see videos with one hundred thousand views with half a million views. And but the content there, any intermediate day gamer would understand that that's complete nonsense. And I'm going to end this talking point with helping you understand how to figure out whose content is good and whose content is not good. Not by saying you should listen to me because maybe I'm not the right guy for everyone. But I'm going to give you a three step formula how you can understand. OK, you found a YouTube channel you like and how you can understand whether that's a guy you want to learn from, whether that's a guy you want to work with. Second big topic we're going to talk about, we're going to be talking about natural game and structured game. And again, I'm not going to be playing just for one team, just for saying only structured game, even though that's what I coach or only natural game. There is a time and place for structured game and there is a time and place for natural game. But if you want to do just one of those, you're not going to reach the top level of day game, your peak potential. So we're going to go over that and then we're going to talk about the big topic, a topic that makes me a little bit controversial. We're going to be talking about day game infield videos because I have never published an infield video and I will never publish in the future an infield video for many reasons. But I'm going to explain why I've published a handful of them, you know, I don't really publish them. I mean, they're on YouTube. People can search Robby Kramer plus day game infield, but it's mainly as a training for the guys that are in my inner confidence community that I reference. But that's really interesting. You haven't published any. And I'm really curious to hear about that. I've never published it. I'm going to talk about more reasons why, but one is I have four sisters. And I would really feel bad if I saw my sister in an infield video, but that's not important. I want to talk about why infields are a terrible way for beginners to learn day game. Whereas if you have maybe 15 day game legs, then infields become an amazing way to learn day game. But for beginners, it's a big, big, big mistake. So a little bit, if you guys haven't seen me before on your show, very shortly about me, I used to be like a real classical relationship type of guy. And I was always in my relationships and each of them lasted a few years. And I tried to do the right thing and I tried to figure it out. And I was reading books and learning about relationships, but it just wasn't working. And then I googled about the statistics of both relationships and I realized, oh, wait, like marriages, 50% and then divorce. And depending on country, in many countries, it's even worse. I think U.S. is even worse. And everyone's struggling. And the more I tried to be the nice guy, the more I struggled. And then looking at the statistics, I told myself, well, maybe I'm not the idiot. Maybe the way people are building relationships and doing all those things, maybe the system, maybe the model is wrong. And I basically asked myself, well, if this doesn't work, I'm going to start exploring what works. And it, of course, begun with a lot of day game. I was day gaming crazy. Like basically people who worked in the malls in the center of Riga, Latvia, where I was day gaming, they knew my face. What convinced you to do day game? I don't like partying. I've never liked clubs and loud places. I'm more of a day type of a person. I go to bed, like not at 5 a.m. I go to bed at like, you know, 11. Like midnight is late for me. Then I start judging. It's being kind of, oh, you should go to bed earlier. It's not healthy. So I just think day game is healthy. I've never been into online. Or I've tried it, but the quality there, unless you really know what you're doing with what you're teaching, that's a different topic. But yeah, day game just seemed normal to me. You know, like you see a girl on the street, like she's beautiful. And I wanted to say hi sometimes. And I couldn't, I just couldn't. I couldn't gather the courage. I remember when I was younger, I saw a girl on a bus and I was thinking, oh my God, what could I say? And I never did it until I discovered day game. And I did day game for a long time. And I coached guys from literally all over the world, U.S. and U.S.A. and Canada and Australia and New Zealand and Hong Kong and I don't know, Israel and Dubai and all over Europe and U.K. And I've traveled to coach to different parts of the world, like several places in Latin America and New York City and Chicago and Toronto and, you know, obviously all of the Europe. And actually the guy who put me on a map was Tom Torero, you know, one of the grandfathers of day game. He put me on a map because he invited me on his podcast. And I was just before I, he actually encouraged me to start coaching when I met him, when he heard about my results. And then, and I worked. One of the reasons I love interviewing about day game is because you're one of the other few guys who have both run day game and coach day game and all those places like I have, too. Yeah. And it's very interesting. We actually did another show specifically, I think, on your show about day game in Turkey. But anyways, I just wanted to interject with that with that little tidbit. I just wanted to give like a short five minute, three minute intro about who I am and where I've been. And I've coached for Tusk and I've coached, I've worked with the biggest Russian speaking gaming community in like the biggest, they have like hundreds of thousands of people. I was going to ask that. Is the Russian, well, is the Russian speaking community comparable in size to the Western, you know, English speaking? It's very big, but it's completely different. Their approach is very different. They walk with girls. They use, there are, they are surprisingly, the model they use for dates is like, it's almost the same. Like the principles, the escalation ladder and all the steps you do, how you start with verbal and these ways, and then you move into kind of physical escalation and pooling and very, very similar, similar things. What's different for dates for them is how they deal with when a girl kind of feels it's a little bit too fast. In the Western world, you have just, you chill out or you kind of do a little bit of push pull, whereas they have a very different approach to it. Their approach works in that part of the world, but I don't know a lot of guys who have successfully used that model in the Western world. It's just the Western world is so different. And I know guys who have gotten actually into problem, into trouble in New York where girls have called the police and stuff like that. Well, in my experience, you know, living in Ukraine for four years and spending some time in Russia, dating lots of Russian Slavic girls. In my experience, just from a really basic, basic, you know, one liner being more direct and more assertive works a lot better in that part of the world. So, yes. Okay. If you look at me, this works incredibly well in kind of the Eastern, more kind of like, you know, kind of the further East you go, the better it works. Right. And then you go to like Latin America and they really have to chill out and become much more, you know, like soft is not the right. You could say more. Yeah. Like I have to become this more fluid guy. You know, I am this bearded, shaved head, tattooed guy. I used to have a nose ring and this beard is nothing. You still have like a way bigger. Have you ever seen the movie Eastern Promises? No. You should watch that. It's like a funny depiction of what you're describing. You don't look Eastern Promises, but the guys in that movie, like the hardcore, like Slavic looking, you know, tatted up, got the big crosses, like gonna fuck you up, extremely masculine, dominant. So, anyway. That works in Eastern, but for those guys, no, when they go to the Western countries, and I know a lot of guys, and by the way, the guys who are really good in their movement, they're doing so good in that environment. The stats they're getting are through the roof, next level. Like I don't know guys in the West who are getting results like that, actually, but again, those same good guys go to the West and they will just be destroyed there. So, I've kind of seen that part of the world of day game and dating, and I've seen the Europe part, and I've seen kind of how it works in Latin America, and I've coached a bunch of guys from the US. That's the other thing. Yeah, that's the other thing that's so cool. It's like until you've successfully learned to communicate with women kind of all over the globe, I feel like you don't really have any business being a dating coach, because you're going to bump into client situations where they're meeting a girl who's of Russian descent in Miami, and you're going to treat that girl a lot differently than the Latina Brazilian that you met in Miami, and these guys are just trying to apply the same basic principles. They're completely forgetting there's this humongous cultural thing. I don't know. The way the girl was raised is going to very much contribute to how she's going to be attracted to a guy, what she's going to find interesting, and whether or not you're going to be successful with that girl. So, I mean, dude, I feel like we could discuss the differences between Eastern and Western stuff all day, but maybe a different podcast. I've done the topic on Tasks, on James Podcast. I think we kind of East versus Eastern versus Western. I've even done Russian versus Ukrainian kind of what are differences between them because there are there are differences in in like because I've definitely noticed Russians will cheat. Russians I've found are are a lot more like gangster um than Ukrainian girls. Ukrainian girls are are you know they Ukrainian girls I feel are very savvy they're like human lie detectors I think they're a little bit I don't know like craftier maybe they've got a little bit better detection but Russian girls are much more savage like they don't give a f**k in my experience. Yeah and but there's a sleeping generalization. Before we before we jump into the big day game things you know I like having all these conversations so there's one one thing to mention about Russian girls when I say they cheat and and things like that it I I published a podcast about that and then I get some backlash and people from Russia message me and explain to me why they cheat and it turns out it's because of social kind of stigma about a girl being single so she will be in a relationship with a guy she hates just to not be single until she finds someone better or she will pretend that she's in a relationship when when she meets someone she will say she's taken when she's actually not so that's like a real small but I just wanted to clarify this so that guys kind of don't think oh all the Russian girls are like this and that no no it's not like it's it's it's because of social stigma whereas but but with Ukrainians I'm really surprised how they know their stuff they know their values and if they want to have fun they'll have fun but and and they will enjoy that but if they are taken like I had a rule I spent three months in in Kharkiv Ukraine if I was in a set and then she said she has a boyfriend I just have a nice day bye I learned that there's no point in continuing this conversation I know the Russian speaking guys are a lot less likely to cheat I yeah but I know the Russian speaking guys like they were doing really good with those as well and they were taking girls who have never done that to crazy sex parties and things like that but again they were playing it next level I don't know how to do that with those types of girls so anyways let's let's start talking about the first big point and again as I said guys I don't want to give you like the the seven mistakes that are keeping you from succeeding the day game we're going to talk about the big picture things and and if you're making these mistakes and those small things don't they they just don't matter those are those are small nuances you need first to kind of figure out the big stuff and even if you have like maybe five seven ten day in place you might still be making these mistakes unfortunately especially if you're a good looking guy then try going to a harder city anyways the first first five five to seven digging lathes that's that's no slouch you know like I can take guys that's pretty that's pretty good it can take a while to get to that yeah yes that's why I said if you're really good looking then like be careful with with your kind of confidence maybe that's because you're really good looking and you're in a place where girls really like day game in no cases like that but seven to eight it means already yeah you know what day game is all about because I look at day game at four phases that day gamers go through we're going to talk about that at the end and we're going to be talking we're going to be running a different free completely free webinar where we're going to be talking about 80 20th day game and what are the few small things you have to focus on in each part of day game to get to the next phase to get to the next level but we're going to talk about that later and and then but again anyways mistake number one is watching the wrong content and this is very very common when you're just beginning when you're when you're starting to when you're just googling how to meet girls and you find the day game and you just go day game approach and you start watching videos and then and you start seeing guys approaching girls on the street and kind of talking about game I just wanted to quickly talk about why most day game and dating content sucks and there are a few reasons why people like to publish day game content the content that beginners are watching that the stuff where you see a guy approach a girl on the street and he gets numbers you see him get so many numbers or oh my god you see a guy kiss a girl on the street five minutes after over here oh my god that gets every fucking oh my god all guys how can I rapidly escalate during day game like dude you're asking the wrong question anyways you can do that but it's not gonna like that number is gonna flick you're either gonna get a same delay that's kind of the stuff what was the guy's name uh one of the big good guys he was good but his the stuff he teaches I've talked a few guys and they were not happy but uh damn he was buddies with tom torero really really good guy never shows his face yad whatever no no no yeah yeah it shows his face yeah yeah it is incredible actually not not as a teacher but as a day here he's incredible oh doesn't matter guys the guy who was talking about super fast escalation on the street you guys know who i'm talking about if you've seen if you've seen his videos he's incredible day gamer but he was talking about it anyways there are several reasons why people are posting content like that and and why they are so good at making the content so kind of clickbaity uh first of all the first thing the first reason guys post content about digging is well bragging rights you'll get bragging rights not just not only if you were a coach and then you're gonna say oh look at look at I kiss close the girl on the street can you do that no I can come here I'll teach you but also casual day gamers I've met a bunch of day gamers who are just your normal average day gamer not not great not terrible like you know an average dude he's getting laid like once in a while in the right place and with the right girl and then these guys were recording infields and posting those infields on youtube and simply for the bragging rights there is no there's no they're not making any money from it and they're not teaching but but you know they like kind of to record they have all the gear cameras mics and everything they like to do that so that's number one people just like bragging rights whether that's coaches or or or or just regular day gamers and of course the other reason is to sell you more stuff and what what what people are really good at doing you're in general see that in in content marketing uh people will not teach you stuff that works people will not tell you on the video stuff that works they'll they will tell you stuff that will make you click subscribe will make you join their mailing list will make you buy their magical online course they will teach you stuff that gets you to do all those things not the things that are getting uh you late and because for them it's more important to sell you stuff not to teach you how they can actually work because when you give out dry day game advice and i'm known and i'm a cliche dry day gamer like my videos are me in front of a camera talking head not a lot of kind of graphics not a lot of editing terrible production quality and i just go through step by step what you have to do well that's that's what all my business coaches over the the last you know 10 years have told me they're like stop giving away all the really good information and strategy because no one's buying it they all want quick easy painless instant results and they want to be bullshitted right and i'm here giving like solid applicable really actionable advice and no one's like oh yeah that seems a little bit hard i'm just gonna buy this guy's magic yeah i'm just gonna buy this online course i'm just gonna go on this bootcamp with like seven other guys and he's gonna pay 5k and or like you know like so you know you know how this works you know the industry and so that's the second reason and the third is uh simply doing random tiktoks and influencer stuff because you actually see tiktokers and youtubers kind of influencers with millions of subscribers go on approach girls on the street in in in parks in very different situations they will even show the girl that they're recording sometimes yes sometimes not they have to show their recording by the way they are smart and they don't want to get cancelled they do have to the girl has to know it's being reported there are rules around that but youtube isn't doing anything about that but it's actually illegal in europe as far as i know so so you'll see a lot of guys like that they will be talking to girls they will be getting they'll be getting numbers and and and and but the thing that guys don't understand is that those numbers are flaking and basically whatever whatever resonates with the with sad guys sitting in their apartments believing that women are taking over the world feminists are evil and or whatever they're just there is a part of guys and there's a lot of guys like that online whatever resonates with those guys there's going to be a lot of content about that uh for example there's there's i've seen these videos on youtube where there are guys saying oh you have to stop simping over girls and how this guy rejected this girl who wanted him and well this random dude who isn't getting laid is talking about rejecting girls because she's dressed too sloppy there is a lot of hatred towards women so there is there is definitely there's a lot of content for for these types of people as well and and but of course the reality is that these guys who are rejecting girls are not simping they are not sleeping with with with a lot of girls or any girls at all and they're definitely not have not being in quality relationships if that's what they're looking for uh they simply couldn't fix their dating life and started uh hating women and and you know and of course there's a lot of videos about guys saying uh that uh for for and this is mostly reddit like i kind of went on a spiral one day just to kind of explore and there's guys complaining that all these girls like they're really the princessy looking girls who are like dressing so sexy like they can't get a quality man because a quality man won't be with a girl like that he cares more about well if you've been in the dating world long enough and you've been doing good you start to learn that those girls are getting the best men because a lot of those women aren't just beautiful but a lot of them are smart someone looking very good and beautiful and dressing sexy isn't a reason to dismiss them and that's kind of basically there's a lot of that's kind of the fourth part of content is just content against women and and a lot of people like uh like uh watching that because well it makes them they feel empathized with they feel understand yeah yeah you know oh yeah i struggle with dating turns out it's it's it's the the women are but the women everyone's a problem except for me everyone yeah and there's a lot of of course it's a i wouldn't say it's like the biggest part of content there's a lot of stuff like that and that gets a lot of lot of views but okay there's also a lot of uh day game content where actually guys are trying talking about day game and and and teaching day game whether that's through showing their recordings and maybe explaining what they're doing or there are uh explaining day game on videos or giving step-by-step stuff like i do so there's a lot of that stuff let's say i i don't think your average viewer is watching tiktok influencers approaching girls or or hating women i think there's a very small percentage of your audience and my audience i don't think people like that are kind of following us they're they're watching other stuff and dude i grew my tiktok to 20 000 followers a couple years ago and didn't get a single client not even a single phone call from that 20 000 i had millions millions of views not a single inbound lead i was like fuck tiktok what a joke so now now i'm throttled i i post there all the time and my videos only get 200 views all of them get 200 views each and if they even showed it to my followers i'd get more than 200 views anyways sorry yeah it's like my youtube channel you know uh so so but uh guys who are learning day game who are not doing these dumb things they they are watching content there and they're trying to find content that's actually legit because there is a lot of content out there and a beginner if you don't know what works and whatnot it's it's easy to be talking to a lot of dumb stuff it's easy to be i get seduced i mean it's so easy yes it's so easy to go on youtube or any of these social media platforms and they're gonna show you the the stuff that's already popular right and pretty soon you're like 45 minutes deep until like a red pill nonsensical video about fucking blah blah blah and it's like why am i even watching this you know natural lifestyles videos can't can i can i talk shit about someone public is it illegal i mean i've had all those guys on the podcast they've come on all my party trips um so that would be some juicy some juicy content but go for it no i think they no no they know the party stuff right i just don't agree with how they coach day game or i think that'd be really interesting to hear about that too um well they i got them into the party scene um back in 2017 i helped them host a boot camp in new york for their really advanced guys and we did all social circle and then i invited them on the first sort of playboy yacht trip i did in 2019 and then you know i've got tons of content talking about this whole thing and then later on when i quit and got kind of out of the game got married that's where i think they started tilted um but before that they were really only doing day game right that was like their whole thing they weren't into night game at all it was just day game so now i think with their elite guys they do more social circle stuff but i'm pretty sure from you know what i spoke to them recently about their most of their boot camps are all very day game focused i know they are yeah i've met them on the streets i've i've heard what they're teaching and and and and i've coached a bunch of guys who have done their boot camps yeah okay yeah like because half of my I've had coaching before from like the biggest name of basically all the biggest names in the industry like yeah, no, no, I'm nothing like they know their party stuff. I just don't agree with kind of the next topic we're going to talk about is natural game versus structure game where when do you use which type of game and I think you're teaching it in the wrong part of a day game journey and we're going to get there. But before we go there, let's talk about guys are watching content. And they want to understand, okay, so what's good content? What's bad content? Who do I who do I work with? Or like, they're thinking about hiring some someone like, how do I figure out who do I trust? There's a very simple crystal formula you can you can use. And it doesn't matter how good their content is. It doesn't matter how, how it may like it makes sense. It doesn't matter that it makes sense. And it like it just clicks with you. And it's yes, this is what I've been looking for. So the first stop, the first step is you try their free content, whatever they're teaching, maybe they have like their signature video series or or like a like a free PDF or whatever, like get that, get whatever you can do for free. And implement that stuff in your day game. Go out and try do let's say 50, approach 50 women trying this stuff. At least 50, a minimum of 50. I'd say if you're going out a lot, then maybe that's not that much for you. But if you're day gaming on and off, then maybe 50 is a lot. So do that. You need to get an accurate sample size, you know, and I think a minimum of 50, a minimum of 50 approaches is probably what you need to really get some decent data. Yeah, like a minimum, that's a minimum of 100 is better. But you know, start with 50. And then that's kind of fine. And if a guy has crippling approach anxieties, there's no way he's gonna even gonna do that. Well, he can watch the video and see if that actually helps him overcome the AI. He can do that. Okay. And when he does that, then that's a that's a whole different conversation. AI is a very big topic. We can talk about that another time. Because I've worked with guys with incredible, incredibly crazy, crazy levels of AI. And they're very hard to work with. But I've seen not everyone can succeed, but there are guys who can anyway. So you've taken the free stuff, the free video series, the free whatever, PDF, you tried that and you see that works. If it doesn't work, either that coach is not for you, just because you don't click with his material, or his material is crap, or you were really bad at implementing it. We never we will not find out what didn't work out for you move to another guy just do the same thing with try someone else. Next, don't just straight go for the coaching. Don't spend however many thousands it costs to hire the guy. Don't don't do that. Because maybe their content is good, but but the way that coaches is just as good as their content, you know, there wasn't any any added value didn't learn anything new. So most guys who coach, they have something cheap, maybe they do coaching goals, maybe they have an online course for beginners or something like that. So do something like that, get a coaching call with them, where you are working with, let's say, reported sets, where the guy listens to your sets, and then tells you what to do exactly what mistakes you're making exactly how to fix them. You go out, you implement that you do your 50 sets. And you see whether the cheap stuff was way better than their free stuff. And if their free stuff helped you and then their cheap stuff helped you, you can hire them like that's it. Yeah, that's smart. I mean, that's what I did with my first coach. I was Lance Mason with pickup one on one back in 2006 2005. I got his like, you know, funny like banter CD deck, you know, it was like 56 $57 or whatever I listened to it, I applied some of it, you know, in the bars, I was like, this works. And then I got on there like, you know, $47 a month, a little, you know, forum membership thing, stayed on there for a few months, and I took a bootcamp. And because because we are in this, and that was, that was before after looking at all the mystery method stuff, and all the hardcore PUA stuff, which was most of the stuff at that time, right. And I found pickup one on one, which is way more natural, which is more like a flirty pantry style, which fit my personality. So case in point. Yeah. So where was I? Oh, yeah. And the reason why this is so important, because they game is like sales, if you're good at a game, you're probably good at sales. And if you're good at sales, you're gonna be good at a game sales guys are really good in a game. So there's a lot of guys who can sell their stuff. But I don't suggest jumping the gun. I'm just like buying it, do your research, do your homework, because as I said before, around half or maybe even more, let's say 50% of the guys I coach have had coaching before. They have coaching from the biggest names in the industry, maybe from several of those guys. And then there I am still coaching them. And that's just because they bought whoever they found, they liked the infields, they liked what they saw, and they bought it. So don't don't be the guy gonna wasting, you know, 5k on and then kind of all shit. Now I gotta figure out how do I actually learn the game after doing that, and you're gonna be spending more money. And that's, you know, anyways, that's the first topic next. And this is gonna be a shorter one, natural game and structured game. I teach structured game, but I like both approaches. And we're gonna talk about when in your day game journey, you should be using which approach, we're gonna be talking about why natural game is so appealing, why people like natural game. Maybe let's start with that. If you tell guys, listen, if you want to get really, really good at day game, you have to learn really good day game stuff. Without a stop. I mean, that's true. If you can't stop a girl properly, you will not succeed. If your opener is bad, if you're maybe stacking is a thing we use to get topics to talk about without asking boring questions. Hey, how are you? Where are you going? What do you do? Where are you from? Well, doesn't care. So there's a technique called stacking. And, and if you tell guys, you need to learn a good opener, then a good stop, a good opener, then you need to learn a few really good stacks that you're going to be using. Over and over again. And then you're gonna kind of learn some structures, some some kind of frameworks for storytelling, where you can build interesting stories to make them more attracted to you. And if you tell this stuff to guys, and then the other option is, well, just be yourself in sets like you're a cool guy, build your volume, girls will come be a natural, just be yourself. So what is going to be more appealing to guys? Of course, that's gonna, it's gonna Oh, yeah, I'm a normal, I'm gonna do that. And I'm not gonna be some freak, like, right, running, like, I don't want to memorize routines or lines. That's creepy. And by the way, just so we're clear, I am not teaching guys to, I'm not telling you, like, Listen, this is the this is the line you have to use. And now go tell that line to girls. And they're like, they're gonna like use this story you that like, No, yes, when I coach, we have structures. But those structures are, it's a framework, but it's a plug and play thing where, hey, here's a framework. Let's use this framework to build stories about your life that you can use. Let's use opener, let's create openers that will work with your personality. Let's, let's have stacks that work for you. Not, you don't have to run around and tell to every girl like, Oh, hey, you look cute, like you look French. That's what everyone's doing, like from London day game model, like most guys who do London day game model beginners, they're running around and just starting Oh, you look French, you look Swedish. And that's what they're doing. That's, that's not what I'm talking about. So I'd be curious. Do you think it'd be valuable for me to, because I'm totally in agreement with everything you're saying. And that's essentially the model that I've been teaching, which is first learn to stop. I teach you guys a framework for coming up with their own openers. And then there's a few stock ones that work in any situation, like, Hey, not to be that creepy guy that hits on you in the Starbucks, but I got to be that guy. Right. And then I promise I'm only one third creepy, like after they laugh, right? Like, that's kind of my main thing. And go to I love to, you know, use that one, because I've had so much success with it. And any guy can say that and no girl's gonna be like, that's a lie. Right. But then I teach another thing, which I call the play by play, which is a simple way to basically, like, tell her exactly what you're doing, but in a way that kind of frames it in like a funny way. Right. And be like, so I saw you across the street, I was considering running across the street, I noticed a huge truck was coming by. But I knew if I beat that truck, the other side, I wouldn't die. So this is me coming to meet you. I almost got killed by that truck. I deserve a medal where I come from. Nothing wrong with it opener. I think, especially if you are someone who is naturally good with people. Yeah, you you take the same line. And you give it to an introverted guy who's not good with people and has a lot of like a strong approach anxiety and it's gonna be a disaster. I teach that as a very advanced sort of thing. Once you graduate past the bullshit kind of training wheels, then you can use that. But okay, cool. You can definitely there's nothing wrong with that. You know, I've joked that I could probably open with something cheesy, like, Hey, girl. And once you're really, there comes a level where just vibe takes over and the technique kind of goes away. And she knows what's up when you open and, and she knows that, like, I've asked girls after the same delay, same delays when you meet a girl, then you take her to a bar and then home and then sleep with her from day game on the same day without interruptions. And I've asked them, Hey, when, when did you decide you're going to sleep with me? I've had girls who said, but when you, when you said, hi, I saw your eyes and I knew this is the guy like, this is, this is the guy I'm going to have fun with. So, but yeah, with a complete beginner, that's not work. Oh yeah. So, so I can use very different types of openers and be very creative and it's going to work. But when, when a beginner tries that, it's just, just not going to, not going to work. And this is kind of, we're going to get, we're going to come back to this topic a little bit later. So let's kind of start with, with the conversation, not natural game and structured game, but we're going to start with natural game versus structured game. Because I've met many guys and, and, and because I travel, I'm a day gamer. I have a small following, but I get recognized in almost every city I go to. Like in Buenos Aires, we were sitting with buddies in a bar and, and some guy walked up with a video of mine. It's like, and I'm sitting there with my girlfriend. It's like, Hey, is that you? And, and so I meet a lot of day gamers and, and they all have their beliefs. They all have their favorite YouTube channels. They all have their favorite books and approaches to day game. And they're really believe that that's the way to go. And they are right. I look at only one thing. I look at how they're doing in day game. Like that's, that's all I care about. I don't care about anything else. And the really harsh reality is almost all of the day gamers who do, who are doing good, who I've met in my life became good because of structured game. That's it. I've met very, very few guys who use natural approach to day game and, and, and got good. And here's the exception when that happened. Just as we talked before, a guy who is in general, really good with, really good with people, social guy, he's into sales or something like that. And then no way. And maybe he, maybe he partied. Maybe he has a bunch of plays from online or social circle. And then he starts day gaming. And then that guy, I know this dude, he's like, he's pretty short, but he had like this long hair. And he's like pretty broad shoulders. Like, you know, the hip surfer boy. And he's a nomad all in tattoos and super positive dude. One of the most positive dudes I know. That dude, you give him any approach to day game, he's going to be doing good. That's the same kind of argument that people have about diets. Like if you are eating junk food all day, whatever diet you try is going to work for some guys, whatever they're trying, it's just going to work. Because when you're talking about an average guy, unfortunately, based on the results I've seen, based on the guys I've met, structured game works better for learning day game period. But there come, we can, we come to like a weird point. You, you learn structured game, you learn a good stop or a few good stops. You learn a few good openers, not copy paste stuff, stuff you figured out that would work for you. Some good ways to get topics and then interesting stories. And, and you do that. And, and, well, and then at the end of the day, you're going to be saying the same stuff to every girl using the same stories. All the time. And it's all going to be completely copy paste. And is that who you want to be long-term? And I'm, I don't want to be like that long-term, but, and that's where we come to natural game. The better you get a day game, the more you can start dropping off the training wheels and then freestyling more and just, just, you know, just, just go and then just let it out, whatever comes out. And, and that's how you, you're going to come up with amazing new stories. When you let go of the old stories, that's how you, that's how you learn new stories. And this is actually when at the end, we're going to be talking about the four phases day gamers go through. This is one of the, one of the phases, the guys who have, who are getting, doing pretty good at day game. Let's say guys who are like eight, maybe 10 day game plays, maybe even more, but they still, they're good in, in the situations that they're good at. One situation, like a street, single girl, place to stop. They're really good at that. Right. But as soon as it's in a bar, in a store, it's a two set, it's a, it's a girl who's a really nice girl. It's a girl who doesn't speak perfect English or whatever language the guy's day gaming in. These guys are really struggling with it. They're amazing one trick ponies. That's their biggest problem. And this is where you start playing. You start putting yourself in different situations. You're, you're starting to think outside of the box, outside of the structure, because when guys are learning day game and they're just being, going in a set and just being themselves, the problem is they don't yet know what girls like. What type of stories girls react good to, what type of attitude is a good one to have in a conversation, what is a bad one? If they start learning day game with a structured approach, they put in the reps, they simply learn what works. They get many reference experiences. They see, oh, I did this and I had a bad response. But I did these things, which were a bit more kind of within the framework of structured day game. And, oh my God, it works. So they learn what works from experience. And then once they have, let's say, maybe 15 day game days, I know this is a lot for some guys, but once they are at that level, they can slowly start dropping those training wheels. They can think outside of the box, they can start experimenting. And then the goal at the end is to become a natural. Natural game is an incredible idea. I love the idea. But unfortunately, you don't get to natural game by learning natural game. You start with structure, but then you transition into natural. And this is how natural game and structured day game actually works hand in hand. People start with one and then transition to the other. It's one plus one equals three or even more. It's not one or the other, it's both. And again, we have this big fight in the online communities between structured game and natural. So I haven't really seen what the natural lifestyle guys coaching. I know you're saying their sort of style is more natural than a structured style. Yes, but actually I've heard them teach bootcamps and I've heard them explain some structure, actually a little bit of structure in the bootcamps. So they're not as natural as it seems. As the name would suggest, they're not as natural. One time I went out with their really advanced guys. They asked me to fill in for them when they were in New York City and we were doing that other sort of social circle advanced partying stuff. And I was listening to what they were doing and it was pretty similar to kind of what like the students that I have coached were doing. But I think those guys were already pretty decent day gamers. I haven't seen when they coach like total newbies. But it sounds like you and I have a similar sort of coaching style because I'm extreme. Like if you can't stop a girl, there's no point in even doing anything else. Then it's like you need to have an opener that works for you that you can kind of go to anytime and you need to structure for coming up with new stuff. And then you need to stack a few things to get in the conversation. Because if you immediately go into Walter Cronkite, you know, sort of boring question mode, that doesn't work either. Right. So, yeah. So, OK, got it. There's a lot of stuff that I like from what I and I haven't watched a lot of their content for obvious reasons. Because just because I don't watch their content in general, I don't do it. I've learned what I needed to learn and I'm not really interested in. Yeah. There's a point of diminishing returns, you know. So I like some concepts, but they're going to work for a very small percentage of people from the get go. You already have to be very social and pretty OK. But if you need a bit more structure, if you are a bit more introverted, if you have a little bit more A.A. And you haven't historically been doing incredible with girls, at least in your age. Maybe you did when you're 20, but then you're 40 and you're doing terrible. And now you want to start day gaming. Well, you're going to need a little bit more structure than just, you know. So that's kind of the problem. And of course, with all these companies, it really depends on who you are getting coached by. And by the way, one thing I know about one big company, which I'm not going to name. Or this is I don't want to just this would be too dirty. But I literally know that when they film their boot camps, they figure out who's going to be fine with being on camera. And the best coaches are going to be coaching the guy who's fine with being on camera because they show that that guy is getting results. Right. And I think that is very dirty. That's I think that is legit. So that's why I'm kind of always telling guys, be super careful. Do those three steps. Check your free stuff. Get something cheap. Preferably, if they have multiple coaches, get a coaching call just so you see that. OK, you're going to be working with this guy who you had a coaching call with. Not you have a coaching call from the best guy and some random dude is coaching you. Don't let them hand you off to someone else. You're legally protected. They can't do that, actually. Make sure they can't do that. So just so you get what you pay for. You know, if you don't then ask for a refund. If all of a sudden they say, oh, you're going to get coached by someone else. You're like, well, I didn't pay for that. OK, now the third big topic I want to talk about, I want to talk about infield recordings and like a big problem with infield recordings. There are a few reasons why guys watch infield recordings. Mainly the two biggest ones is credibility to understand whether the guy they like, whether that guy is credible, whether he's actually good at daygame. And that's actually kind of like a funny thing. You're going to see why in a minute. And the second reason is to learn daygame. So let's break down these two reasons to watch daygame infield recordings on YouTube. And let's start with credibility. You see number clauses. You see these case clauses or whatever. But the thing you don't see is that a lot of them are super flaky. And the quality of the sex that you see in a lot of infields is just all you need to get a number clause. You have to become pretty decent at teasing. And an average daygame student knows enough teasing after one and a half, two days of coaching. Like the sets an average daygame student will be running after two days of coaching will be the quality of sets that you will find on YouTube. And the guys who are watching, they don't know that. So I have a very simple question. Let's say someone is a beginner or intermediate daygamer. And they want to understand whether this guy is a credible, good daygamer. The guy whose content they're watching. So when they watch this guy's infields. So how does a beginner or intermediate daygamer know that the infield they watched is a good infield? They don't. Because they don't know how a good set looks like. An advanced daygamer can look at a daygame infield even when that infield is a very different type of infield. Different approach to game and different models, different whatever. And he will be able to more or less understand if that's a very good set or a shitty set. And if it's a guy who learns structured game and he's watching an infield from a structured daygamer, he will understand that it's a really good set. And with watching different models, you have to be exposed to very different types of daygame to judge different types of sets. But the problem with credibility coming from infield recordings is that the guys who are looking for credibility aren't able to judge that credibility. Aren't able to judge the set and understand whether that's a good or a bad set. Actually, the typical infields, you see these high-energy daygame sets where you see that the girl really likes the guy and she's responding so well. She's giggling and she gives the guy the number and all those things. Almost all of those sets flaked because it was too high energy. Good daygame sets are boring. There's nothing exciting about a good daygame set. This kind of brings us to the second reason why guys are watching infields. To learn daygame. I agree. Just to interject, I agree that they can't successfully judge whether it's good or bad. And there's a lot of bias there. The only value I ever got in watching infield videos was mostly from YouTubers who had funny shit to say. That I could then be like, oh, okay. I'm going to use that infield. Like I watched Vitaly. Like King Vitaly. He's a YouTube prankster. And he had this hilarious video where he asked a girl. He'd go up and he'd go, three questions. Are you single? Two. Fuck, what was it? First, do you find me attractive? Second, are you single? Third, what's your excuse for not making out with me right now? And then he'd just go in and make out with these girls. So it's like, who knows if they were staged or not. But I'm sure some of them are real. He's a pretty charismatic, funny guy. And I'm like, fuck, I could do that. I actually did that to pull a threesome. I went up to a girl with my girlfriend. And I was like, three questions. One, do you find us both independently attractive? She's like, yes. Are you single? Yes. What's your excuse for not making out with us right now? And then I just put the girls' heads together and they kissed. And then we kissed and we had a threesome. So I'm like, that's valuable. I feel like finding funny content and then making it your own and using it can be valuable. But that's not really what you're talking about, I think. Yes, no. We're going to get back to what you just told, which is a great use for infields. But it's not for beginners. Right. A beginner is making mistakes in the basics, in the fundamentals. They're messing up the open and the teasing and story. They're just all over the place. And their day game is what they need is to build some fundamentals. Run a super basic set. Learn to drive a car straight. Learn to get your job in a car. You can learn all the fancy stuff later. Learn the basics. Learn not to burn those sets. Learn to not be a moron when you go in. Learn to just \\u2013 you're not going to be great at day game. But you know, you're not girls. You're going to be getting laid. I think we should \\u2013 maybe not right now. But at some point, set expectations for what different guys can maybe expect as they're getting into day game. Yes, it's a very good topic. You're willing to talk about the topic because a lot of people are not willing to talk about the topic. They don't like those real numbers. Oh, no. Let's talk about that. Yeah. Another time we can go into. Yeah, let's put that in the plans. Okay, so when a beginner who doesn't know the fundamentals, he watches these interviews. He watches \\u2013 what was the guy? Vitaliy or \\u2013 what was the guy? Vitaliy.TV. Yeah, he sees that. And then he thinks, oh, that's what I need to get laid. And then he goes and tries to implement maybe not that but something similar in his sets. Or he wouldn't have the balls to do that if he's a beginner. Maybe he tries. He sees some other stuff in the new field. You know, like a Maradona move where you shake a girl's hand but then you don't really let it go until she kind of pulls her hand away. It's an advance. I don't see a point of that move. But a lot of guys love that move. It's a legit move. It's a working move. It's Tom Carrero's move. I don't understand why would you do that. But, you know, and a beginner takes that and thinks that, oh, that's what I need to do to get good at the game. No. Their fundamentals are fundamentally wrong. There's a mess in fundamentals that they need to fix. And then when they fix their fundamentals, they're going to be getting laid. And when I started day gaming, I loved infields because they were motivational for me. I had a very, very, very strong AA. It took me two weeks of going out almost every day for more or less two hours to do my first ever day game set. So when someone I'm coaching says they have AA, I had a worse AA. I think I might have had it worse than you. I took a boot camp. I took a boot camp because I had crippling AA. And I could do it at the boot camp when the guys were pushing me. And then I went back home to San Diego and I couldn't do it. I had to take two more boot camps before I could actually, like, do it. So, you know, my AA cost me about $7,500, I think, something like that. Yeah, that's actually a legit problem. It's kind of different. When I work with someone who is very strong AA, I like to know that that's their thing. And there are things we do differently just to kind of make that likelihood of them being able to continue when they're back home much, much higher. And that's why I don't coach. That's why I don't do the boot camp model either because I'm like, fuck, no one should have to spend that much money to get over this basic thing, which was the only option for me at the time. You know, now I teach my guys how they can get over AA before they ever meet me in person. But I digress. Yeah, yeah. And that's a good idea. I think AA for a lot of guys, for some guys, they need coaching for that. Others don't. Others just need some accountability and things like that. But for some, you know, and of course, I think it's not a big percentage of guys who get coaching because of AA. I think they just want to learn really, really fast. And that's going to be like, okay, teach me everything in a week and let's go. Like, I don't have three months to learn the game. Right. As long as they understand that they have to do some day game before to get that out of coaching. I think that's fine. So anyways, and back to the infields. So in the beginning, I was just watching them because they were inspirational. I couldn't, like, I don't think it was learning much from them. But then after more or less, I got to 50 lathes. Oh, my God. Infields were like, I learned from infields. When I had watched all the theory that I needed and I had implemented it as good as I could. That's when I watched some high quality infields that, by the way, good infields are not available for free on YouTube. Like, forget it. Google infills will sell those infill products and you're going to be paying a few hundred bucks to see those infills. So I watched Tom Torero's stealth seduction Incredible infill product not available anymore after his passing and cancellation But he died or he was just canceled No, he he was canceled and then he committed suicide a little bit later. Yeah I think I did hear about that. I did hear about yeah It was it shook the whole day game community and then but it made some guys think about It made a lot of guys think about kind of these Traditional day game beliefs that oh you can never have a relationship You're a day gamer and the relationships don't work and then a lot of people started questioning because he wasn't the first guy And there have been cases before and there have been cases guys completely switching to the other extreme and becoming very religious and Oh, yeah, like russ right? Yeah. Yeah russian and his forum you couldn't post anything about dating anymore and and you have guys that have become kind of you know, like Pretty much nazis like in their blogs and then some of the biggest names in industry So and after that a lot of kind of people in the sphere started looking at all these like old school day gamers They were incredible day gamers, but they were kind of like, okay, these guys were incredible day gamers, but Some things aren't working that well for their life, you know, maybe that's not where I want to go anyways, so no and the way I I had learned all the fundamentals and I couldn't understand how do I learn more and what I did is I started watching really good infields And I noticed in infields things that no one had explained in theory video I noticed extremely small things that they were doing in sets and that again took my game to the next level So that's where I think Infields are an incredible thing. If you are an intermediate day gamer with maybe like eight plus plays then that's where you should start watching infields and now the last thing I want to talk about finally, let's talk about the webinar that we're doing and And the four phases of of any of day game journey because there are several phases Day gamers go through and this is sort of when you're looking at technical advice step by step stuff. What do I do here? What do I do there? How do I get to the next level? If you go to the gym and you ask the rapid guy, what's your workout plan? His workout plan is not gonna work for me. I'm not, you know yet there and I you know I need something different. I'm a beginner but guys are looking for challenging like Learn to improve your challenging or qualification or learn same delays and whatnot Well, maybe if you are a complete beginner and you're struggling with Basic openers. Maybe that's not what you should be focusing on you have to look at What are like 80 20 80 to 80 20 of day game you have to look at what Few small things I can learn in where I am in day in my day game journey right now will get me the biggest Results and those things are completely different Depending on where you are in your day game journey, and I've divided this in four phases I have a micro like a very small online course about that But it's the same stuff we're going to be talking about on the webinar So let's go over those four phases phase number one is well, you have to overcome approach anxiety and put in enough volume Going to a gym once a week won't work and day gaming once a week won't work either So that's number one and for a lot of guys this is This is very big because aa is a big problem for a lot of guys. It was for me and I thought No, once I overcome a once I can talk to girls. It's it's gonna happen. It's gonna be amazing but well, unfortunately aa is just the first phase and once You overcome that then then you can move to the next phase but how do you know when to move from one phase to the next phase because Someone might be listening to us and thinking well i've been in day I've been day gaming for like three years. I'm respected in these and these online codegen communities. I'm an intermediate day gamer I'm in phase three Well, the only way and this is important. The only way you understand in which phase you are is based on your results it doesn't matter how credible you are how like whatever it's it's all about your results and I think you have to stay in phase one and focus On your aa if you can do 25 sets in a week a few weeks in a row That's the only thing you should be focusing on you shouldn't be focusing on like how to pull her fast, you know How to have set up a day game threesome But once you do that, you move to phase two and that's where you're putting enough in volume. Now you have to learn Day game fundamentals. You have to do all those basic stuff like build a good fundament So you can then add all the advanced stuff and you stay in this phase And there are several things you have to focus on here. We're going to be talking about that on the webinar Here you stay until you have eight day game ways why eight because Well, you go to five that kind of you know makes sense like you have decent day game But then maybe you're a good looking guy who just got lucky So we add a few more just just in case And I think eight is a good number if you can get to eight day game ways It means that most likely you are pretty decent at day game fundamentals. Once you're here You'll start getting late consistently And this is actually a very easy phase because all you have to do Is fix the big basic mistakes you're making and then once you're there you get to the third phase And it's very important what got you Through the second phase if you keep doing that You're going to stay at the same level to get to To graduate from the third phase from the phase of mastering day game. You have to learn completely different things because You're basically a one-trick pony You you have the fundamentals you are you're probably good at one or two things and and that's it And if you want to get to the next level, well, that's Where you start learning completely different things and you graduate from the third phase When you have I would say 30 day game ways You definitely have some same delays and you know, if you have some day game threesomes then, you know props to you Like that's really good. This is the paradise. The phase three is kind of day game parties. You are just getting Getting late left and right the girls that you know Everyone's in some community and girls are complaining. Oh, I like I met this good girl and and she never does this well When you are at this level You're going to be posting lay reports in that community about a good girl who's never slept with anyone before the fifth date You had the same delay with her and then like a month later. You had a threesome with her That's kind of the level of course that doesn't mean you're going to be sleeping with all the girls you're open You're still going to be sleeping with The expectations for one out of 30 girls you approach If you're really really good, but that's kind of the third phase and you have to go It and each of these phases requiring to focus on completely different things and the last the fourth phase is If guys want to find a girlfriend then well, we're going to be talking about the phase how to find a girlfriend from day game, uh That's it. I covered all the notes that I've prepared. Oh my god Unbelievable. I'm excited to to do the webinar and get into that. I'm trying to I was trying to see where I fell into those those stages. Um You're I don't know how many I don't know how many lays I had. I would guess around 30 Um, yeah, you have a little place from other sources. So No, sorry Day game. I'm only talking about day game. Um, I probably had around 30 Had a probably three or four same day immediate ones Never did a day game threesome. So that that one had a gazillion other threesomes But what happened with me specifically maybe we'll get into this on the webinar was I found that eventually the quality of girl That I could get from day game wasn't nearly as high as the quality of girl I could get through the social circle strategies that I learned that I was just like I feel like me going up to this girl and the act of doing day game was so much of a status Lowering situation that the hottest the nines and the tens would just kind of be like Eh, that's cute. You're fun. You're cool. But the fact that you're doing this means you're probably not a guy that I would date and the only and then I I tried to come up with a way to kind of beat that by Not asking them out and funneling them into like parties and social events and that kind of worked And I tried this both in la new york and ukraine Um, but then I just you know I started doing the trips and it was just like day game became useless and up and just No point even wasting my time because I had so many leads however, when I did get I had like a bad like breakup and I was feeling down and just Like what I always did to get my inner game back on track because i'd go out and I'd do day game Because that would really just kind of it's it's like the most pure form Of social interactions see a stranger you're attracted to cute girl on the street You go talk to her right as you mentioned earlier so that'll be fun to kind of dive into those topics and And discuss one last thing because I like what you just said. I really like this is what I'm going to finish on um Day game isn't the best way to get laid for everyone Sure, there are guys who look at it. Yeah, like, um, you know, this didn't work with that type of girl that type of girl or or Day game definitely isn't the the end all be all I I think part of becoming really good Is is kind of figuring out what works for you and what's your best environment? But if you look at what's the best way to learn to communicate with women And to improve your dating skills wherever you're going to use them later I don't know a better option than day game because you put in the volume you have a limited Approach and just polish everything and get those reference experiences get those Numbers and dates and delays and all these adventures and regulars and you know, have your fun And then if you later decide that there's something else you like maybe the social circle parties or or conferences or some guys discover like the world of bdsm and they go there and they So that's where dating comes in And I agree that's I mean that was my journey, yeah I mean like and that's what I tell the guys I work with I say, you know day game is like the dead lifting Of of exercise right? It's like if you can do this You know this thing and you can do it. Well, you're going to succeed no matter what Um, and it's going to fix your inner game issues almost always So, you know, that's why i'm such a big proponent of it. Obviously. So so dude i'm super excited for the webinar We're gonna do um, if anyone listened to this and they want to find you where can they go and hear more of your stuff? They can just sign up for the webinar like link is probably going to be in description They they can just do that and and the webinar we're gonna Host like we're gonna make it so that even the guys who for whatever reason don't make it to the webinar i'm gonna upload the recording on my platform because I have a platform for my Online courses and everything and the video is going to be available there for free For a while so even if you sign up and don't make it to the webinar you're gonna have the recording you can you can go back to it and and And when you sign up for it, i'm gonna also send you the best kind of stuff to watch like some videos, etc After the webinar none before Uh, so I think that's just the best thing to do.
