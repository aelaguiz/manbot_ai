We were looking to date, you know, the ratio of men to women was always very favorable. The nightlife was insane. Obviously now, I'm sure things are radically different. I know a ton of Ukrainian women have left and gone to Warsaw, Germany, Berlin. It's like, I've got lots of clients in Berlin. I've got a few clients that are in Warsaw and, you know, they're running around talking to girls, doing their day game approaches, whatnot. And like most of the girls that they meet that they actually like are Ukrainian refugees. So I guess my question is, like, have you seen anything interesting about that? Like, you know, is there any sort of like dating scene? Do you think those girls will come back once the war is over? What do you think is going to go on from like a dating perspective? Look, at the beginning, a lot of people left. Right now, a lot of them came back. Still, the numbers are still crazy of people that stayed. But also at the same time, a lot of the guys here are just in the army, right? So so still the ratio of guys to girls is still, I think, the same, if not even more. There's more women. Oh, yeah. Still more women. It's different because, you know, it's very hard to be not even party, but to be extra happy, you know, like it would look. \", \"segments\": [{\"id\": 0, \"seek\": 0, \"start\": 0.0, \"end\": 4.0,
