I say it all the time to my son, too. So that's how hardcore are you guys about that? Yeah, you know, because they could easily be like, well, look, mom and dad are a great model, like our family's dope. So they're like, hey, maybe that's the path. If they came to me and they found themselves pregnant, I would, of course, support. But you want to put as much friction on this topic as possible, I feel with your kids, because it is just completely transformative in its capacity to completely change their life, right? Yeah. You're now responsible for someone else attached to another person for the rest of your life. It's not to be taken lightly. So putting friction points and resistance on if that ever came up in conversation as if this is something that they wanted to entertain or do or enter into early, you could say, I would certainly like, you know, not shut it down, but I would put some resistance on that decision for them.
