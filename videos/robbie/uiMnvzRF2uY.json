And even if I could, I didn't really know what to do with them. I felt like when I did hook up or fall in love, it was almost by accident. Now that I've been working with Interconfidence and taking their programs, I feel a lot more confident about approaching and talking to women. I feel like they respond a lot better to me and I'm just more comfortable in my own skin than I was before. I've recently started a relationship with this girl who unfortunately lives halfway across the country, but we started off being very kind of on a weird foot with each other, but since we've gotten to a very deep position where we trust each other well and talk a lot, and it's a very novel experience for me, I haven't really had that close a relationship with a woman before. I would say the one thing that I learned that got me from point A to point B would be learning to be more in my body, stop analyzing things as much, and I'm much more able to approach and talk to people of all life and just more confident with myself. \", \"segments\": [{\"id\": 0, \"seek\": 0, \"start\": 0.0, \"end\": 11.960000038146973, \"text\": \" So before working with Interconfidence, I
