Hey, everybody, welcome back to The Leverage Podcast. We've got a really good buddy of mine who's also a tribe leader in Leverage Group. By tribe leader, I guess you could just call that he's kind of a big deal within the group. Glad somebody picked that. Yeah, and we're going to be talking about a whole bunch of stuff today, a lot on persuasion and just getting people to say yes to your invitations, but I don't want to spoil it. So Nick, welcome to the show and tell us what we're going to talk about. Well, thanks, Robby, I'm really excited to be here. And what we're going to talk about today is essentially my interpretation of two books. One book was written by a guy named Jim Camp called Start With No. And then another one is a book by a guy named Chris Voss, who wrote a book called Never Split the Difference. And Chris Voss was a FBI hostage negotiator. In fact, he was a big deal. He was the guy that trained the people. Most of what I want to talk about is out of the Chris Voss book. And so why would you have me on the podcast? I didn't write these books. I didn't create this material. But my story is that I'm a chiropractor. I'm like, well, as a chiropractor on here talking about somebody else's books. I've been practicing for about 18 years. And when I got out of school, I was from a really technical end of spinal rehabilitation. And I was so excited to get out in the field and work. And I had all this research and data and reasons logically why I am the best guy for you for care. And what I found for the first really three to five years was a lot of frustration because I didn't know what I didn't know, which is people are not motivated by logic, facts, and research. We make decisions based on emotion. We justify them later with facts. So I was hammering people with research and data and facts, and it just fell on deaf ears because they weren't compelled emotionally to make a decision. And so in my time as a practicing spine guy, I've probably had, if I do the extrapolatory math, about 100,000 or more interactions, personal one-on-one interactions with patients. What that's allowed me to do is very quickly, first of all, I realized that I was as much of a counselor and a psychologist to my patients as I was their spine doctor. And so all that face time has allowed me a lot of experience with reading people, talking to people, listening to people, and trying things that didn't work. The typical traps that we go down, meaning the yes thing, right? We're all hooked on yes. And so that's why I'm so excited about this, because it's all about getting people to say no, which feels counterintuitive, but is incredibly effective. Yeah, I read the books about, I want to say around two, two and a half years ago, and they had an immediate impact, and I started implementing some of the advice and had some very fast results. At the time, I was doing a lot of sales and marketing and was really helping. And then about six months later, I kind of went in a slightly different direction, did way fewer sales. And I don't think I really got a chance to ingrain some of the teachings. And then when you told me that you had gone through those books, it was like the light bulb went off. It was like, oh my God, I've been forgetting these amazing, what do you call them, distinctions, basically. And then we started talking about it and how you can apply it to all different sorts of areas, sales, persuasion, dating, you name it. Well, when we talk about no versus yes, and when you start trying to phrase questions to get a no, you realize it's a little tricky because we're so addicted to yes. I mean, how many times do people just automatically say yes to things and they're not even really listening? And we want to say yes, and we want to get other people to yes. But the dark side of yes is that people can feel that in a lot of yeses, there's a fishing hook, there's a trap. And even though you can easily compel people down this road to saying a bunch of yeses, there's a bunch of layers there. I mean, yeses don't always mean yes, because yes is nothing without how, right? I mean, people can agree to something. It's like we've talked about pity numbers. You approach a girl, you get a pity number, or you get her to agree to go on a date. And then she says yes, but nothing ever happens, right? It's a yes. Right. She flakes because it wasn't really a yes. She just, there's a lot of reasons we say yes to people and they're not always to genuinely implement going forward with whatever the plan is. You know the, I'm sure you've heard of a yes ladder in sales and marketing before, right? I think that like, I remember reading about that way back when I started studying sales and thinking, this is so, just so like lame. And how would that really work? Yeah, I was like, that's not gonna work. I don't think it really works. People pushing it, you know, try to say the worst is like those old speed seduction idiots. Try to use this in dating where you're like, you know, you go up to a girl and you get her to say yes to like five or stupid things like, you know, do you like ice cream? Yeah, right. And then you switch. How about you come out and get naked with me? Oh, well, yeah. I just said yeah to the ice cream, so count me in. It's like, come on, that shit is just so fucking terrible from back in the day. Well, that all started, that started with a book written in 1981 called Getting to Yes. And that book is really logically sound. I mean, logically, it makes sense, but it neglects the fact that we're not logical decision makers. We're emotional decision makers. And people want to be understood and accepted. But people need to be or people need to feel safe and secure. And yes, takes away that security. And no, no is security. As an analytical guy, like you and like a lot of our tribesmen, I really like the science behind things. And if you think about many of the things that we've talked about are rooted in evolutionary biology and our survival drive. And if you think about the part of the brain called the amygdala, the amygdala means almond in Latin, because it's an almond shaped organ, which has two of them, one on each side of the brain. And the amygdala is basically it's, it's got four times as much tissue area for processing the negative things as it does the positive. And the reason is because, again, it's driven for survival. An example of that would be, say you, and it's and it's automatic, like say you're walking through the grass and a snake jumps out at you, we don't have to think about getting away from the snake, your amygdala just says, well, get away from the snake. And so or say you get bit by a dog, right? And then a year later, you see a dog that looks just like the dog that bit you will immediately these involuntary feelings of apprehension and fear all come up because your amygdala is trying to protect you. But what we can do with the amygdala is when we address the negatives and the barriers, it actually does something where it changes the wiring and it frees up space for the positives. So we can get into that too about it. So just just so I understand it has four times the processing power for negatives as positives or the other way around? Correct. Correct. So it's basically designed to it's survival. It's your reptilian brain, they say maybe that is supposed to fight or flight, freeze. That's the amygdala. We're talking. Yep. Fight. Yep. Fight. Fight. Flight. Make friends is the states that we have. And in with the flight is also like you said, the freeze. If you're walking through the woods, and you hear something that startles you, you don't immediately break into a run or put up your fists. First thing you do is you stop like, what's that? Right. Have you ever seen the movie Free Solo about the guy that climbs El Capitan? I saw the trailers for it. I might have seen it. I don't know. I don't think I saw it. But I know exactly what you're talking about. Yeah. Yeah. He climbed this guy climbs a part of El Capitan. It's a 3000 foot vertical wall with no ropes. And so he's being examined by a neurologist, and they do, I believe, an fMRI on him. And the doctor, she says, see on this side, this is an amygdala firing in a normal person when we show them scary images, it's all lit up like a Christmas tree. And she says, and then over here, here's your amygdala when we show you startling images, it's black, it doesn't do anything. So this guy, whether he trained his amygdala to reject that stuff, or he was born with some developmental difference, because obviously, you got to be a different kind of guy to climb 3000 feet with basically nothing to hold on to. And no ropes. I mean, it's the movie's terrifying. Like, even though you know, he's not gonna fall. You still are scared to watch it. Yeah, I don't think I saw it. I'm sure I didn't see it. But I remember having quite the reaction just from seeing the trailer. Oh, man. Yeah. Yeah. So that's, that's crazy. He, he did he train his brain to, for that, or he was born like that, you think? They don't know. They don't know. I mean, it's maybe a combination of both. The guy's done so many scary things. You can see how the feedback from his amygdala might be blunted. But it's, it's startling. I mean, it almost, it's, you almost think that maybe there's some, the guy's kind of, he seems a bit autistic, maybe. So maybe it's, there's a tie in there. Yeah. Was there some, was there some storyline as well with his girlfriend? Yeah. So he processes a lot of things differently. Like his, his girlfriend essentially had to train him. She would say, I love you. And he would, he would say initially, well, I appreciate you very much as well. And thank you for saying that. And she'd say, no. Now you say, I love you too. And mean it. He just wasn't wired like that. He's a strange guy. Yeah. Shit. Sounds like a tough relationship for her. I don't see it going like super long. So back to yes. Right. The dark side of yes. Yes. Yes, as it is, we know it can be a trap. And there's, there's three different kinds of yes. There's the counterfeit. Yes. Which is the, you get somebody to agree to something, but they, they agree to it just because they want you to leave them alone. Okay. Fine. Yes, sure. I'll do it. And then there's a confirmation. Yes. Which is a little better, but it doesn't necessarily lead to action. And then there's a commitment. Yes. And so these are, these are really important distinctions and great reasons to get more away from using yes and more to using no. What were the three? It was the counterfeit. And what was the second one? Confirmation. Confirmation and commitment. And the commitment's the real deal. Yes. And on the other end, the counterfeit is the phony. Should we do some, so, I mean, the obvious example for counterfeit, you know, that we see all the time from guys going through the leverage program and approaching women is you get a ton of counterfeit yeses when, you know, it's like, if you want to learn what a counterfeit yes is, you know, approach some women, be straightforward and you'll see how that goes. Anything from a phone number to, you know, Instagram to, you know, guys, guys will say all the time, I got her number. And it's like, well, it's a counterfeit number, right? Or I texted her and she seemed really interested when, you know, when she gave me her Instagram and I messaged her on Instagram and then she just never responded. Like, that was a counterfeit yes. Well, in, I'm sure in sales and marketing, that happens all the time. Would you get that quite a bit with your patients when you were, you know, whatever, trying to sell them on some sort of treatment? It's funny you asked that. Yeah, I've actually had a pretty hard smack in the face with the yes thing. I've used a number of different coaches for chiropractic in business. And one of the coaching systems I used was built on NLP and that yes ladder and all that stuff. And it was very scripted thing that logically made sense. And it is coming from a good place. You're not trying to, I wasn't trying to talk anybody into something they didn't need. I was simply trying to lead people to the conclusion that's best for them when I'm sure that I can help them. So I'm actually going through a situation right now that's a backlash from all this yes stuff. So what happened was I treated a woman who was probably 60 and she's very happy with her care. And she had gone almost all the way through care and then she referred her daughter in and the daughter went through the same process. And the daughter had some friction from her husband from the get go. But she told her husband, I don't care what you say, I'm doing this anyway. And I thought at the time, good for her. being her own woman. Well, what happened was probably from negative talk from her husband, combined with she may not have been getting the results that she wanted. She never said anything to me. But clearly, she and her mother, her mother later, accused me of sort of using pain to get people into care and sort of taking advantage of them. And I was was really surprised because her mother was totally stoked with her results. But then she had gotten flipped. And as you know, people are bad with direct conflict and resolving conflicts. And so rather than just come talk to me and say, Hey, I'm not happy for whatever reason, in which case I would have said, I will do whatever it takes to do right by you, whatever that means. She didn't do that. She and her mother both anonymously filed a complaint against me with a large insurance company. And as we speak, I'm being audited by this company to check for my billing practices, and my note taking and basically what they're looking to do is they're looking to take money back from me after the fact. So it was really disappointing, because it's annoying, it's stressful, it kind of bums you out, because it's like, why couldn't we just talk like people rather than this, you know, behind the scenes, I'm going to get you thing when it all could have been easily resolved with some communication, which is what this with the no thing is great about is it, it opens up communication, it's really meant to get more information and truly understand where the other person is coming from. Because when we get to know it, no doesn't mean no forever. No means I'm not ready yet. I need more information. I don't understand things along those lines. No is really a good thing. The other thing that you find with no is how people very often just don't listen. People are just sort of on this autopilot. Yes, yes, yes. In fact, I've had it where I've done these no things with people and patients. And the question is set up for no, but they'll go just autopilot. Yes. And I'll go, yes. And then they go up, they snap out of it. And they realize, oh, I'm not listening. So it's cool, because it reengages them. And they pay more attention because they've been caught not listening. Got it. So yeah, let's talk about some examples, where we want someone to get to know first. And how do we do it? Okay. Well, if there's anything else, we need to understand leading up to that. So it's sort of situationally dependent, like, I mean, a cheesy and easy example I could get, or I could give would be, say, in my world. Hey, Robbie, would you would you like to get rid of your headaches? Right? You've come to me with headaches. Instead, I could say, hey, Robbie, have you given up on being headache free? It's a much different question. Because it opens up all kinds of things. If you say yes, I've given up on it. Well, that's good to know. And that opens up a whole dialogue of what we need to know. But if you say, or if you say yes, I've given up. But if you say no, I haven't given up. Great. We're into a constructive conversation. Totally. Yeah. So I'll use it in just to try to use no. I'll ask questions that are kind of silly. Say at the coffee shop, just to get in the practice of it. I'll say rather than can I have a quad cappuccino? Like, sure, of course you can. But instead, I'll say, is it crazy for me to get a quad cappuccino? And they'll go, they might go, oh, that's a lot of caffeine. But yeah, here you go. Right? So just practice. And it feels a little weird at first. But it's just like you talked about, you read the book, and then we can easily forget about it. And you sort of don't implement it. Yeah. Another great example. I don't remember if you told me that this, or it was in the book, but when he asked to sit in an area of a restaurant, or someone else's in an area of a restaurant that was closed, and how did he, how was that framed? Yes. So the scenario was they were in a busy restaurant at about at happy hour. And all they wanted to do after this meeting was have a happy hour drink. And so there was, all the seats were taken except for this roped off area. And rather than say, is it okay, if we sit here? He asked the server, would it be horrible if we sat here? We just want to drink. And she goes, No, that's fine. As long as you're out of here by six dinner time. Yeah, so and I've used and I've used that would it be horrible thing in scenarios like that? And it works great, because it's sort of makes them think about it a little bit. Yeah. And say, well, I don't, it's not horrible, right? You can do it for now. You can, there's framing phrases like you brought up one as far as an approach. Is it too forward? Right? Is it too forward for a guy to see a lady walking down the street, and run up to her and say, Hey, my name is Nick. Right? I've not used that specifically. But it's really good, right? Because she has the right to say, yeah, it's horrible, or no, it's not horrible. Right? You can say things like, am I out of line to whatever? Have you given up on whatever? Are you against whatever? A great one that I love is, if I wanted to talk to somebody, rather than say to them, like we often say, Do you have a minute to talk? That's terrible question. Because in your mind, you're going, well, what's a minute, first of all, if I do agree to talk to you for a minute, do I want to talk about what you want to talk about? And how can I get out of this conversation when I want to, instead, great thing to say is, is now a bad time to talk. It works amazing. Yeah, that's great. You say, Yeah, now's a bad time to talk. You can say, Okay, well, when's a good time to talk? And just that little thing alone, just starting a conversation with that change everything, you know, especially because I think the hardest thing if we're talking about, like an approach, like if you get a girl to stop, right, and she's stopping just to be polite, that is never, it's never going to result in a connection. Now, because she's basically just like, All right, I'm gonna be polite. I'm gonna let this guy kind of run through his, his spiel here. And I'm going to be on my way as fast as possible. There's no opening for a connection to happen. Because she's, she's basically already said no with a fake with a counterfeit. Yes. Right. Same thing for I get those people who, you know, they're, they're out on the street with a clipboard trying to get signatures or trying to get donations. You know, I'll stop for them for a second. Because I'm, you know, sometimes I'm too nice of a guy, you know, too much of a pussy. Right. And they'll, they'll use some like, Oh, can I pet your dog? And I'm like, Okay, you know, right. And I know that they're just doing it to, you know, to then weave into the whatever sales is coming, right? They can, you know, the dog's an easy angle, right? It's like the guys that hit on a girl by like, going up and asking about the dog, but the girl knows it's coming. And it's like, you know, yeah, yeah, you don't get it that that never works, right? To go that dog angle. I'm completely closed to whatever they're selling immediately. But if I think if they were to use what you suggested, you know, I might be way more open to it. Yeah, when you have the right of refusal, it offers protection that offers safety. I mean, if you think about you've been around little kids, I mean, I don't know the stats on it. But I bet you money when you hear little kids, one of their first words that little kids learn is no, they learn how to say no really quickly. For protection. No, no, no. Yeah, it's true. There's a I bet you if I bet you it's one of the first if not, maybe the first word that most little kids learn. Because it's it says a lot. Um, is that something that they teach on purpose? That's just that's just the, the basic, you know, parents, making sure their kids, you know, say no to strangers, or? I, I don't think so. I mean, this is this is my interpretation of it. This is not stuff that's in the book. I was just in thinking about it. I was thinking, how often have you seen a kid who basically can't talk, but they know one or two words like mom, but they definitely know? No. Yeah. So yeah, this could be this could definitely be used in in approaching, which I know, like a lot of the guys listening to this podcast are going to be really interested in. And what I didn't want to do was write a bunch of canned sort of approach lines, because I'd like the listeners to utilize these sort of these pre framing phrases, like is it too forward to form their own personal approach to it. And like we've talked about, or like you've taught us, I should say, the very first thing is you have to get you have to commit and you have to get them to stop. Because when you think about a woman who's a foot shorter than you, and 100 pounds lighter, it's that amygdala thing, some strange guy stops her in the street, the first thing she's doing is assessing her safety, and going like, what does this guy want? What's going on here? So you have to break past the barrier of where she's just alarmed, and then get to the is it too forward? Right? I'd love the guys to go out there and use that. And you came up with the is it too forward thing. And I think it's, I think it's really good. And I think it'd be really useful. Yeah, that one would be cool. The other one that immediately comes to my head would it be like, would it be like, totally weird? If, you know, I don't even lie to the Starbucks? Yeah, there's so many options with it. And I think it's much more disarming. And I know when I was just kind of first getting into, you know, approaching women, without drinks without being drunk, you know, in a non social environment. So on the street at a Starbucks, you know, in the library, wherever it was, it was terrifying for me to do it. But when I had something that I knew I could say that was really authentic, and that made me, you know, I made me a little bit excited to say it, that was a total game changer for me. And I don't know if that's true for everyone. I know it's for a lot of people, I talked to a lot of guys, I coach, you know, everyone's a lot of their first thing is like, well, I don't know what to say. And when you don't have that objection in your in your brain, and you have something that's that you actually are excited to say that you want to try out. I think that can be a huge, you know, the difference between doing it, not doing it and doing it and having fun and creating a connection versus just, you know, total getting rejected all the time. Well, authenticity is everything. I mean, unless you're a sociopath, you're not going to feel comfortable saying something that feels inauthentic, or made up. And so I think that's hugely important. And most of the guys who are attracted to being their best selves are going to be analytical guys. And I think sometimes guys get hung up on the magic line, like, how did you say that exactly? Like, what's the line? And then all the things that you talk about, about, you know, when you get in your head, and you're not paying attention to the other person, you're not watching their cues, you're simply thinking about, well, then if she says this, I got to say that when that's just not the case. We read, if you both read the book, what everybody is saying by Joe Navarro, great book. And but I've had conversations with guys about the technical aspects of when they do this, it's steepling, we do that. And what my point on it to them sometimes is, it doesn't matter what you call it, we can all read cues, if we just get in the moment and just pay attention. You can tell when people are open, are closed, are nervous, are cautious, are scared, it's, it's really pretty, pretty obvious, because we're wired to pick it up. We have the, you know, we have the start with the no. But there are any other teachings beyond that, that we can apply this to that really stood out? When you when you think about these books, these books are both designed around negotiation, hostage negotiation, Jim Camp's book is business negotiation. And so you think, well, this stuff that we're talking about isn't really negotiation. But when I was thinking about the definition of the word negotiate, there's two definitions to negotiate, negotiate, and I'm paraphrasing, right, I might be a little off, but negotiate. First definition is to for two or more parties to arrive at a decision mutually using words, right, we think about a business negotiation like that. The second definition of negotiate, is to find your way around or through an obstacle or difficult path. And so that's really applicable for for this, this conversation, because there was a situation when we were at the immersion, which I told you about at a nightclub, which I utilize these techniques for negotiating a difficult situation. And use a thing called tactical empathy. And tactical empathy is when you're, you imagine yourself in the other person's shoes, you recognize and vocalize their perspective, you understand what's driving their feelings, and you identify emotional obstacles that are getting in the way. And of course, you analyze their words, tone and body language and make sure that it's congruent. And so the situation that happened, and there's a guy out there that may listen to this podcast who will know who he is, I won't name him, but it was it was a really salient sort of application of stuff. So for those of you that weren't there, we were at a nightclub. And we were just nightclubbing it. And this guy became really upset. He had an interaction with a girl that didn't go well. And she got upset. And he got really upset. And he stormed off. And so I he's a buddy. So I didn't want him to be just so darn inconsolably upset. So I tried I followed him. I stopped him. And I said, Hey, bud, it seems like you're really upset. He screamed in my face about this far away. Why does it seem like I'm upset? I said, Well, in my late night DJ voice, I said, Well, you, it seems like you're upset because you stormed off. And because you just screamed in my face. And so I said, that's why it seems like you're upset. And he said, Well, I'm upset, because I'm putting out a lot of effort. And in trying to talk to girls, and I'm not getting, it's not going how I wanted to go. And so all I did was I mirrored him, I simply said, right back to him. What he said, I said, You're upset, because you're, you're really trying hard. And you're putting yourself out there. And you're not getting the love you want. And he said, Yeah. And then he went deeper. And he said, Well, I'm upset, because of this other reason, too. And I just did the same thing, I mirrored him. And I said, You're upset because of blah, blah, blah. And the cool thing about that is this guy was hopping mad, really, really mad. But as we got down this pathway of this tactical empathy, and this summarizing his feelings, people that are upset, typically, really want to know that they're heard, first and foremost. And that really diffused a bomb, if you will, diffused his being really, really upset, and brought him back to earth and sort of reason reentered the conversation and really salvaged, I would say, his night or at least helped it a lot. Because it's funny how people, you say what you what you think you mean, but people hear what they hear. And he later came up to me and he said, Well, I wasn't mad. I was just upset. Mad was never used upset was but it didn't matter because it got him talking and then he was tuned back in. So it was really cool. Yeah, I mean, the application for that. I can probably use it on a daily basis. I tend to tend to upset girls I date on a pretty regular. So my choices. Here's what you do it when when doing these things and labeling their feelings. We don't want to use I right we want to use it. So it seems like you're upset. It sounds like sounds like you're really passionate. It looks like you feel you're heading in the wrong direction. It feels like and by doing that, I mean, if we say, I can tell that you're upset. Well, first of all, when you say that you're making it about you. And they might say, Well, you're wrong. I'm not upset. I'm mad. But that's a crucial part because the cool thing about it when you label their feelings and say things, it seems like you're upset, or it seems like something has got you upset. You might even be wrong. But that's okay, because they'll say, Well, I'm not really upset. I'm just this or that. And again, you're just getting information and understanding the person. And it's, it's a really powerful way to diffuse a situation. Yeah, so you say it seems it seems like you're upset, or it seems like XYZ, you could use this for other things, too, right? It seems like you're sad, or maybe whatever anything. Yeah. And then they basically say, yeah. And then where does it go from there? There's a little bit more questioning, like, when do you know to stop? So what you can do is you go to the summary, where ideally, if you want to switch somebody's viewpoint, you want to get them to to say, that's right. I mean, how many times have you had somebody say, you're right? Well, if you get you're right, you're not doing it. Right? Because you're right is kind of a counterfeit. Yes. And you're right. People say that all the time just to get you to leave them alone. But if you get them to But if you get them to, that's right. So going back to that situation, it seems like you're upset. Yeah, I'm upset, because I'm out there putting myself out, I'm trying and I'm not getting the results I want. I can imagine how that would be really frustrating. And I'm also upset, because I feel like I want to get more one on one time with, with what with the coaches, and I'm not. You're also upset, because you want to get more one on one time with the coach. So then I summarize, you summarize, you package it up, and you say, to show them that you understand them. So you're upset, because you're really passionate about doing. You're really passionate about getting to a point where you're able to connect with girls, but you feel like in this situation, despite all your efforts, that's not really happening. And get them to say, that's right. Once you get them to a that's right, that's the that's the golden thing. And in that situation, I don't, I don't know that I got this guy to a that's right, but I got him to at least an implication of you're not always going to get word for word, that's right, there might be, they might say, you got it, or some strong affirmative like that. And that's basically when, yeah, that's kind of when you've changed, or you've, you've helped them get out of that emotional mind, you know, mindset. I know he talks about that in terms of hostage negotiation, right, when he gets the person to say, that's right, that's kind of when you know, that's when he starts going into a deal. Is that right? Correct. So I've got another real example that I used, where I wasn't trying to defuse a situation, I was actually trying, I was genuinely trying to change someone's behavior. So I think I've told you this story. But how it goes is, my dad, myself, my dad's neighbor, and my employee, we're all in a shooting league for pistols. And it's four people on a team. And you, you, obviously, you want to shoot well, because it's a cumulative score. And then you're ranked based on that, like you, I'm pretty competitive, and I want to do well. So my dad's neighbor shoots a revolver, right, the old, old style, like wheel gun. And he would insist on shooting the revolver, what's called double action. So the revolver, you can cock it, and shoot it, or you can just pull the trigger and shoot it. Well, when you pull the trigger and shoot, it's not nearly as accurate, because there's this long travel, the trigger, and it moves the gun. So he's shooting, and he shoots these just terrible, terrible scores. And so I went and talked to him. And rather than say, why are you shooting double action, dummy, which is what I was sort of thinking like, I said, how, how'd you shoot, man? He said, terrible. I was like, well, are you shooting as well as you want to shoot? And he said, not at all. I said, are you shooting single or double action? I mean, I knew the answer. I could have probably just said, are you shooting double action? And he said, yep. And so rather than say, why are you shooting double action? I said, well, what do you hope to accomplish by shooting double action? And he said, fun. It's more fun to shoot double action, and it feels like it's kind of cheating to shoot single action. I said, oh, okay. So you feel like it's just less authentic of sort of tactical shooting if you're shooting double or single action? He said, yeah. Well, then he said, and that opened up the conversation. He said, well, how did Christy shoot? Now she's my employee. She's a brand new shooter. She outshot him by a hundred points that round. I said, she shot a 344 out of 360. He went, what? How did she shoot? How'd she do that? And I said, she shoots single action. So that changed the landscape. And guess what? He's been shooting, he's been practicing single action. So it went great. It's so funny how people get stuck on stuff, but these examples happen all the time. And you think you could just say, bro, come on. But it's not about that. It's about the authenticity for him and the experience clearly, but you would never know that if you approached it the other way. Well, I mean, with guys like you and I, I mean, you can say to me, dude, what are you doing? Don't do that. Do this. Come on, dummy. And I'd be like, okay, got it. Most people don't have that kind of rapport. And a lot of people are so thin skinned and can't tolerate that sort of accusatory input that they just completely shut off. And you're going to alienate them and hurt their feelings. And you're really ultimately not going to get what you want. Right. Yeah. It's like, do you get to be right? Or do you actually get what you want? And so many people, they're stuck being right. However, being right doesn't make you happy because usually it doesn't change the behavior that you're looking to change. Absolutely. Being right, who cares? I mean, you can be right and be friendless all day long. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. Yeah, those are such important examples. So how does one, how do you get good at this stuff? Is it just, you know, obviously I read the book and I remember I took some notes and I was implementing it and that was helping, but, and that was helping, but you know, it didn't really stick as much. What have you done to really get this stuff to stick? I'm just, I'm trying to stay obsessed with it and I am pretty, pretty darn into it. And so I try to make every interaction that's possible. Start with no, trying to get to know as much as possible, even if it feels weird, because it's kind of like any process, it's going to feel weird at first, you're going to kind of go too far, but that's okay. And I, and whenever it's, it's working because I'll have conversations and I'll ask questions of people and then I'll realize, Nope, I went to yes, but my brain will say, well, here's how you could have said that in a no right away. And so I do that and then I combine it with the, the tactical empathy and the process that I spoke about with the, the tribesmen in the club where it's, it's really super simple. And the great thing about it that I found right away is it really just opens up the lines of communication. And you know, it's kind of also like we talked about, we want to think about not so much. Don't think about the outcome. Think about the process. Think about the, don't be outcome driven, because then you'll be in your head. Think about, I'm just gathering information. And it's incredible how when, when you really work to understand people, how things go, the connection just goes so much deeper. And these, these things are really immediately implementable because you're not really memorizing, you're not memorizing lines. You're, you're simply mostly just saying back to people what they've said to you. And that really resonates that, that triggers mirror neurons in the, in the brain and immediately established, establishes more of a connection. So use it, right? Yeah. It's just like, you gotta go out and you gotta go out and try it out and fall on your face a little bit, but you don't fall far with this stuff. I mean, the worst thing that's going to happen is, so what if the coffee girl goes, Oh, weird way to ask for a cappuccino. Right. So, so would it be terrible if we gave the, the listeners your, your emails so they could ask you questions? Yes, it would be. No, I'm just kidding. No, it wouldn't, it wouldn't be terrible. They can definitely ask me questions about it. Really what I'm just going to say overall is get the damn book and read the book. Cause you could ask me a ton of questions. I'm happy to answer it because of course we know that when you teach people things, you learn it better yourself. So I'd love to teach it, but mostly I would encourage guys to really onboard this stuff for yourself, go through it, write it out, make it your own. And feel free to ask me questions about it. It's great stuff. All right. So I'll put a little link below you know, some people could, if they feel like doing it, but yeah, I wonder if the author has any sort of follow-up stuff. There's there, I think he's written another book, which I don't have, but really what the guys can do is just go to YouTube and just search for Chris Voss, V-O-S-S. He's got probably 10, easily referenceable blips on YouTube. There's Google Talks, there's like kind of a TED-style talk and he talks about this information with real examples. And I've listened to all of them multiple times because every time I do, I get a little nugget out of it more. And he's an interesting guy and you realize the subtlety behind this approach where it's kind of a sleeper approach and it doesn't feel manipulative. It feels really genuine because it is really genuine. Yeah, it really is. Well, dude, you've done such a good job, you know, being able to package all this together and explain it in a real-world example and lots of real-world examples. I appreciate you coming on and sharing this awesome wisdom with everyone because I read the book obviously and that wasn't enough to get me. And now I'm totally inspired to like really revisit it because it, yeah, it's so applicable and useful. Thanks so much. Well, and going forward, yeah, man, thanks for having me on. I'm really flattered. I'm really grateful to be here. And I want to thank you. I mean, I thank you privately. I want to thank you publicly for what your life's mission is. And you, the exercises and the reflection that I've been through while I've known you have been some of the most difficult and bracing things that I've ever had to face in my life and also the most important. Because trying to be your best self, especially when centered around like interacting and dealing with women better, brings all of your deepest, darkest shit out. And if you don't face it, you go down the road of a lot of guys. I mean, Jordan Peterson talks about low status males and how common it is for men to remain low status males, meaning guys that never reproduce. Whereas it's really rare for women to remain low enough status females that no one will reproduce with them. And I really think a lot of the anger problems and maybe the outbursts of even violence, well, we know that it's true, these outbursts of violence and these guys that hurt people over their frustrations and their inability to articulate themselves. And probably one of the most important things for a man, which is to feel important enough for women to consider carrying your genetic material so you can live on. And so thank you for doing this for all of us, guys. You're a great coach. And you've got saintly patience. Thanks, man. No, I love it. And I really appreciate that acknowledgement. That means a lot.
