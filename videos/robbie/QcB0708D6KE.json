Just before we recorded this interview, my building decided to have a fire drill. Yes, they still do that for some reason. I guess we're in LA and there's earthquakes and who knows what's going to happen. So unfortunately, we had to push the recording time of this interview back. So if you're watching this, obviously either on YouTube or Spotify or on my site, you'll notice that due to the later start time, we lost natural light. And because my studio is all natural light, the recording will be a bit darker than usual, but don't let that take away from watching amazing content. Lionel is a total beast and you don't want to miss what he has to say. So enjoy. What up guys and girls? Welcome back. We've got a very special treat interview because I haven't done many live interviews. First one in this room, many, yeah, some other spots, but in the new studio, we're here with Lionel Coleman, who is a jack of many trades. Just on the short like walk up from his car to here, I found out he's a professional. He has a professional security company. He's got a bulletproof G-Wagon, bulletproof Lambo. You also sew. Yes. You know, I love using my hands. Male model, influencer, motivational speaker. Yes, sir. So, dude, I'm stoked. Yeah, me too, to do this interview because, you know, we're talking models beforehand off air and living in LA and it's, yeah. It's a beautiful thing, but it has ups and it's downs, you know what I mean? All around. Of course. And it's your first drink in four or five months. So cheers to that. Yeah, seriously. Cheers, cheers. First drink, man, I've been craving it too. Yeah, I've been trying to drink less, but I've been doing a pretty good job. My wife doesn't drink. So, yeah, it helps a lot. Yeah, especially your wife, you know, they're usually the ones that drink the wine and you have to drink the wine. Exactly. I save a lot of money too. Yeah, exactly. So, yeah, tell us your story. How did you, you know, you were telling me before about the crazy shower incident and then the surgery, but like, you know, you were telling me you grew up in Central Florida. I grew up in Central Florida. You know, in a broad scheme of things, you know, my father was in the military 22 years. You know, I was raised in a very strict family, you know, and both of my parents were fighters. My mom, she did martial arts and my dad was a boxer. And so that kind of fell in my lap that, you know, I did that also. Played football, you know, did all those sports. Then I grew up and came out to Los Angeles. You know, I had a friend who his mother is an actress and they told me, they were like, you know, you need to come out here. And I was modeling at the time. And the next day I booked a flight and I came out here and things started taking off. But within a little bit of time, a freak accident happened, you know. Wait, before we get to that, so you were basically living in Florida and because you were telling me before that it was kind of like the crab in a pot syndrome? Yeah, crab in a bucket syndrome. Crab in a bucket, yeah. And I'll explain that, you know, real quick, you know, because people really don't understand what that means. You put a bunch of crabs in a bucket and there's a crab at the top and crabs are trying to pull it down. Not because they're trying to get out themselves, because they know what they're capable of. They know that they can't get out the bucket. They're trying to get that other crab down just because they don't want him to get out. So I had to leave from where I was at, you know. I knew I was blessed and highly favored. I was blessed with many crafts, many abilities to do certain things. And like I said, my father was very strict. So, you know, I had to learn things early and this was a place where I could really blossom. I knew that, you know. So you came out to LA to pursue modeling? Not even just to pursue modeling. I would say entertainment in general because, I mean, I've been on four television shows. You know, I've done runway modeling across the world. You know, I've done print modeling. Obviously, you know, now the influencer stuff. So it's just, you know, they all go kind of hand to hand and they fall in your lap when you do good at whichever company you're working with at the time. So I came out here to really just pursue my crafts because I knew I could become successful. LA is the place to do it. Yeah. Everyone's out here trying to get it. This is a hustle place. Everyone's out here trying to get it. And if you're not, it's going to eat you up and spit you out quick. It is, it really is. It's, I mean, I first moved to LA in 2008. I went to school down in San Diego. And just like, you know, San Diego is not a small city, but it compared to LA, like when you get here, the energy here and just the people doing stuff. There's a lot of people claiming to do stuff who aren't really doing stuff, but there's still like an energy here. And, you know, just being around that, those people, you know, just like how we met. I'm in the dog park downstairs, running to a guy that, you know, Ishmael, who's a buddy of yours. And, you know, like him and I, we met one other time cause we were hanging out out back. And the dude who throws plungers was, he's like a big... Yeah, yeah. What's his name? I'm blanking on it, but he's very popular, you know, 300,000 followers, whatever on his YouTube channel. And he literally just throws plungers at a sign. And, but the videos are... Yeah, they stick and the videos are like, I don't know, there's something about watching those things stick and just the way that he cuts them and edits them. It's a plunger. It's a fucking plunger, exactly. And my wife recognized him out there and then that's how we met Ishmael. And then, you know, here we are, the podcast. So it's like, that doesn't happen if you're not in LA or if you're not in like a place where there's interesting people or, you know, living in a cool place. So... And, you know, I explain to people too all the time, like where I'm from in Central Florida, even if you are an actor, not saying you can't become an actor and actress, but here you have the Sony lot, you have Paramount, you have all these different lots and castings that are here. You know, you see all the young kids here that are getting on television shows or getting these gigs. It's because they're here and there's so much talent that I've seen and not even just from where I'm from, but across the world that isn't being seen because they're not in the right location and they don't have the ability to get there, you know, or just the financial backing to be able to pursue their dreams, you know. But one day we'll make that happen. Nice. Yeah, one day we'll make that happen. This podcast is primarily, you know, dudes between age, you know, 18 and 50. And it's shocking to me how many guys I talk to that are trying to get better at dating and they live in like bumfuck nowhere. And I'm like, you know, the first thing that if you're trying to succeed in that market alone, like you got to just do the simple math, be like, how many girls are here? And yeah, you're probably gonna have to leave, you know, it's like, and then they do eventually, but that's kind of the hardest part. And like you said, the crab in a bucket syndrome or, you know, getting out of that environment because most people, it's just scary to like leave home or, you know, do... That's what it is, fear. Right. A lot of people have a lot of fear of not just failing, but just being by themselves, you know, me being out here for all this time without my friends and family that I grew up with, you know what I mean? Yeah. It's, you know, like LA has its great times, but, you know, holidays come around and things like that. It gets, I don't want to call it lonely, you feel very alone. Yeah. You know, because it's that genuine love that you don't feel. Like you have people who will invite you to Friendsgivings and things like that, but when you, if you're a deep thinker, at times it will get to you. And I've been a victim to that. Sure. Yeah, when I lived in Ukraine, you know, that was obviously, you know, none of my friends or family growing up. I made new friends there, of course, but like that, it was around those holiday times, Thanksgiving, you know, Christmas time, whatever, when those connections, when the people aren't there, you just feel that void, I guess. Yeah. Especially when you see all the people that have there. Right. There's a family there, it's like dang, even though they invited you, you feel that. Right, it's not the same. No, it's not the same at all. So you moved to LA. What happened next? What was the... I moved to LA. I immediately got clients to personally train. And they paid me up front. A good grip of money, actually. How'd you start that up? Just, so like, did you first, you know, like build your body, get in really good shape, and then go after clients that way? Tell me. So the way it worked was, I was in a runway model for a while. And I was telling you before, like my contract ended. And they wanted me to slim down. And at the time, you know, just from my genetics, I wasn't going to be a slim guy. Right. And I love to lift, so I didn't do that, you know. But because of my Rolodex, you know, me lifting and me having a strong passion for not just getting big, but shaping my body, people start inquiring my services before I even had services. But the thing is, one thing about me, like I said, my father was in the military. Anything that I do, I do serious, and I take serious. So I got my personal trainer's license kind of by default. Like I was studying, and I knew all these things. And I was going to some big time gyms, and in the gold gym, and I got offered a job before I moved here. Oh, nice. The one in Muscle Beach? Yeah, well, no, no, no. Back in Florida. Oh, okay, got it. You know, and the guy was like, dude, you can do this whenever, you know what I mean? So because of my, again, my network, my friends, you know, they knew a lot of people. They were like, we want him to train us. So it just fell in my lap. So I get to LA. I have these celebrities that want me to train them. They trust me. They see who I'm associated with. And before I got started, I was like, you know what? Me and my friend, we're going to take a vacation. We went to Cancun, Mexico. When I got back from Mexico, there was a leak in the ceiling. It wasn't leaking out. It was just a bubble. And I told the maintenance people about it. They said it wasn't going to fall. Three days later, it fell on my head. Had four nails stuck in my head. Like three nails stuck in my feet. Six herniated discs. Terrible. When you said the ceiling, because you showed me the photos, it looked like a giant copper, I don't know what the hell, pipe or something fell on you? When you have levels of floors, you have to think, we're on whatever floor we're on now. Right. For us to have this much weight on this floor, it has to be a lot of construction underneath the whole bed. So, you have to imagine how long they have been band-aiding this issue. I see. You see what I'm saying? Right. Their inspections were not being properly inspected. So, you saw the bubbles and you're like, that looks sketchy. You know what I mean? And then it got a big bubble. He even admitted to touching it. That's the scary, that's the crazy part about it. He's like, oh yeah, I told the other maintenance man to fix it. So, they're telling me... This is in the valley? Yeah, in the valley. So, they call me He-Man in the gym because they're saying I'm in the two percentile of being alive. Like, I'll show you my sheet from my neck all the way down, six herniated discs, pinched nerves all the way in my spine. Like, I didn't walk for a year. I taught myself how to walk a year. They're wondering how I'm doing what I'm doing. I'm back to lifting. I'm back to training people. You know, I'm in pain 24-7. Yeah. But it's a different type of pain. Tell me about like the emotional sort of process you went through. You know, because that's like, you know, you're at the top of your game. You just moved to LA. You're training celebrities. And now you have like this, like, fucked up accident, you know? Like, I know for myself, like, I don't know. I think I have like a lot of rage inside or something. But like, I'm always very thankful that like something really bad hasn't happened to me because I just feel like, I get mad like, you know, someone... I don't know. I just get like easily triggered. But I'm not like an angry dude or anything. No, I'm not angry. It's just like... Yeah, but if something like that happened to me, I can see myself being like, going into that victim mentality, getting super like angry, wanting like revenge, wanting this one. It's like, I feel like it'd be really difficult to manage those emotions. And where you're at now is clearly fucking amazing. Like the way you talk about it, you know, there's no sort of, you know, you were even telling me before how it was kind of like a blessing in disguise. So I'd love to hear about that because that was... So I'll tell you like, so when it comes to pain, you know, playing sports, boxing, doing those kind of things, I felt pain. You know, I've had to deal with that. You know, even in football, I've had to sit out from ripping my ACL. But this situation here was my back. It is my back. And you hear our parents, older people talk about their back problems all the time. I've never had to deal with that. Never knew how consuming it was. Right, because you hear about the back, and you're like, oh, the back. But then, I mean, I had lower back pain, like for two days. But it was like, you can't do anything. You're just like... And what I was going through before the surgery, not only did I have to pay back over $30,000 to clients, I was 25 years old, turned 26, moving from Florida to Los Angeles by myself, spent all this money to move out here, and a few months had to pay back $30,000. And those were the contracts that you couldn't train your clients for. Exactly. Jeez. Right, that I was... that I have counted on that, that I've made moves based upon that money because I've already had it. Yeah. So that was one emotion. Then there is that emotion where I've had at the time females that wanted to come over that that wanted to hang out with me. And I couldn't I couldn't do anything about it. And I said, I actually been in bed with a female. She's a she's understood. I just didn't. It wasn't so much pain. Just like just like it was just so consuming. You know, you can't like relieve the tension by at least just like being with a girl or anything like that. There's there's time still today. To like that, I can't get comfortable not sitting, standing, anything just cannot get comfortable. And it's terrible. You know what I mean? It's terrible. And then, you know, so I did. I went to I went into a nice depression. Yeah, because I mean, I couldn't go out. I couldn't lift, you know, the medicine they had me on. Obviously, like there was no drinking, you know what I mean? It was just it was terrible. Like I wasn't making money at the time. I wasn't. Did they put you on? So the medication was like for pain and that sort of thing. Was it any. Dude, this is a bad thing. The medication that they put me on is the reason why I end up having a blood clot after surgery. Shit. So the medication they put me on was a was it was for inflammatory and for pain at the same time. But with your blood, it makes your blood like cooler. So you're supposed to stop taking it for a damn near a year before surgery. They didn't tell me to stop taking it until two weeks before surgery. So I had surgery and it just wouldn't stop bleeding 20 minutes away from death to the blood clot. They said if I wasn't built how I was built, I'd have been out of here. Well, you see what I'm saying? Yeah. So it was just like the emotional part was just all the way all around that. Like there was not enough sympathy or empathy in the world to make me feel better. I didn't even want to hear it. You know what I mean? Yeah. How long was that? Yeah. How long were you in that mental place? So I had two to two different times. It was like I got into that that mental place within. Because of how I was raised, I just tapped into my other crafts and thank the Lord they took off for me. I told you like I saw and I was making bags for celebrities. Neiman Marcus, you know what I mean? So you can't really move. So you start selling, you know. Well, I learned how to sew when I was younger. Right. You know, and I met up with the guy out here who he did it. You know what I mean? He also did it. So we started we parted up together. But then instead of actually training people because I'm educated on it, I was really tapping into body sculpting, like really sculpting a person's body because most people think it's just a gym, but it's majority of diet. Right. So I tapped into that part of what people should eat. OK. You know, so I just I'm a hustler. You know what I mean? Yeah. It was just like I got into a state of mind of I'm still going to secure my bag. Right. You know what I'm saying? And but what happened is I was I was able to move. I was just in extreme pain. I wasn't on bed rest until surgery. OK. And I didn't get the surgery. So it happened in 2000. It actually fell on me in 2017. The surgery didn't happen until 2021 because in 2020 COVID. Right. There was they just shut everything down. Judge. No, no. Anything. Just because because the lawsuit that was going on or. Well, yeah, because like I had to get into a lawsuit because the surgery, everything was so expensive. Like, yeah, it was great in the building. They rightfully so. Yeah. But the judge, if they didn't want to talk to me, didn't because of COVID. Right. So I had to suffer for all those years. And then one day I was checking the mail and just completely felt scripted. I had to army crawl all the way home. Wow. Yeah. So you didn't say, wow, you didn't have the surgery for four years after. So you were just kind of living with the herniated discs and all that pain. Because it was, you know. How the hell do you stay in good shape? You know, like I told you, I because my father, like my parents were very athletic growing up. Fast food wasn't a thing. Like I told you, my father was in the military 22 years. That's rare in central Florida. I've driven through there. It's a it's fat person. Yes. But how my family was. Yeah. My mother respected my father as the man of the house. You know, he came home from from from work, from the army. And we had cooked meals. Right. You know what I mean? Like the most we ate out was like if we went and got some Popeye's chicken in the bucket, it went by the river. Right. There was no McDonald's. There was no there wasn't any of that. So I never really craved it. That's good. Anytime I ate it, my stomach was just messed up. You feel bad. Yeah. You know, so staying in shape was in hard because of the diet. Right. I'm saying. And then obviously I was able to walk and stuff like that. You know, so I was able to. You already had the lifestyle of a healthy person. Pretty much maintain. Yeah. You know, I wasn't hard and, you know, shredded like that, but I didn't get too far out of shape. Interesting. Yeah. So that's how that part worked. And when I finally had surgery, oh, man, that was terrible. That was terrible. I mean, they didn't treat me right at that hospital at all. We're still going through it. And I will say it was Los Robos. They had me on an IV machine. They only had three three wheels on it. Supposed to be one of the best, best hospitals in Beverly Hills. And I walk in there and, you know, apparently they don't like people of my kind in that hospital. Oh, it's like that over there. And I actually walked in there and our older person says, what is he doing here? It's a hospital with old money. So it's like Beverly Hills old. Exactly where it was. Right. And everybody in that in that hospital, they pretty much live in plantation homes. Well, that tells you where what their lifestyle is like. Totally. So they're looking like, why is he here? Why is he not at the entertainment hospital with all the other young and rich people? You know, so they didn't treat me right in there at all. It was it was a mess. It's definitely when the documentary comes out very soon. And you guys will see how much of a mess it really was. And because it was COVID, I had no visitors. Oh, man. I feel like I was like, dude, I feel so bad for all the people that were in L.A. during COVID. I was in the best place on on planet Earth. I was in Kiev, Ukraine before the war. And like for me, I was single at the time and all the nightclubs closed. So my, you know, party pad was turned into the best nightclub. And no one like you could call the restaurants in Kiev and be like, hey, party of eight. Are you open? They're like, no, but come around the back door. We'll we'll serve, you know. So it's like but L.A., from what I've heard from all my friends and stuff like it was just like, hell, lockdown central. I couldn't do anything. And so, yeah, that's lockdown. So you're you're dealing with that. It's COVID. You know what, COVID? Luckily, I didn't have it. But I mean, all I had was a freaking small television up there, a little little juice, apple juice box. They come in and ask you what you want to eat for breakfast, lunch or dinner. And it's just these little sandwiches. I couldn't lay on my back. So my hips were killing me. They were raw, raw, dude. And so you like sit up the whole time? No, I was laying on my hips. Oh, on the side. On the side. OK. And I literally had to piss in this urinal thing. Yeah. Like a bedpan deal. Yeah, it was, dude. Like, I never in a million years thought I would be that vulnerable that I couldn't do it. You know what I'm saying? Then I literally had to have someone wipe my butt like, oh, wow. So, yeah, you couldn't get up at all. Fuck. At all. You see, you've seen the scar on my back. It's from my ass crack almost halfway up my back. You see what I'm saying? And like fresh out of surgery, I couldn't move. Like, you know what I mean? Like, it was terrible. It was terrible. And got out of that. Three days later, you had to get rushed back to the hospital for a blood clot. And they said, if I wasn't built how it was built, I would have. It would have went to my heart immediately. Ironically. What saved my life when the initial injury is why I'm hurting now as we speak, like there's not a time in the day I'm not hurting. The level of pain is different. There's not a time in the day that I'm not in pain. Um, what saved me is they said there's muscles around your spine that, you know, like I said, I'm in the two percentile of being alive. Two percent of the human population. That suffers like all those like an accident like that. Or if you look at my sheet right now, anyone who looks at my sheet would say this person's a corpse. Wow. But there's muscles around your spine that most people never, ever work. But it's because I did so many different things. You know what I mean? Right. That's what held. Like, you see how long my scar is like you. It would have snapped you in half. Sure. But my muscles. So your spinal cord is OK. And all the muscles around there kept it. Am I not saying my spinal cord is OK? Can you see where that surgery is at? That's where it was breaking. Wow. Yeah. As it got up, it held it together. Right. Now, the reason I'm in pain now is because all the muscle I have is way on that. I see. Yeah, I see what I'm saying. Right. So it's like before it was a nerve pain. Now it's more of the incision and a sort of a deep pain, you know, and I don't take pills. You know what I'm saying? So I just have to. Is the nerve pain worse? Oh, my gosh. Yeah. Yeah. The nerve pain, like I said, I was walking to the mailbox and just fell. But it's almost like, you know, you have a tooth pain. You take a toothpick and you poke it like you poke any nerve. I don't care how big and strong you are. You're fucked. You poke that nerve and it's oh my gosh. Yeah, it's nothing that you can just push through. Right. You know, when your discs are hitting your nerves. No, you can't just push. Oh, man. Well, I think my my lucky stars, I've had lucky enough to haven't had to deal with any nerve pain. Yeah, glad you haven't had a shower fall on your head, man. You know, right. You know, it's great. During that time when you're like, when did you get into like the security stuff, all the other like the TV shows you were on, the reality shows like was that all pre-COVID or is that all been? No, that was all pre-COVID. OK, take me through that. Yeah. So like I told you, I've gotten into my crafts. You know what I'm saying? So being the fact that that I that I did box, being the fact that, you know, I've done a lot of sports. I have a large, a large network, you know, so that the security that also fell on my lap. I knew a guy who had his own company and he let me slide in with him and he showed me the ropes of how to get my own and not. I still am. But that that career field for me was short lived, especially with this new generation. Security used to just be you're there. You're securing the, you know, the venue, the people. Yeah. Now you literally have to get down. Really? Almost every time. And that's not what I want to do. Right. You see what I'm saying? Especially if you're already in pain. No, yeah. Like you literally have to get down every time. Like if you just see someone just ran on stage at 50 Cent, you know, he just had a concert and had to come in. I don't want to be doing that all the time. And you know what I'm saying? That's not cool. You know what I mean? It's not fun. You know, what drew you to that in the first place? Just because you got a hook up there and. Oh, well, at the time, like I said, at the time, it wasn't like you had to get down. Yeah. I got to be clean of the my clients, the celebrities. I knew them on a personal level already. So they didn't treat me as I was working for them. They would treat me like I was working with them. Right. So I'd never felt I never felt any kind of way. And it fell in my lap. You know what I'm saying? I knew what I was doing. I've been shooting since a kid. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. So if I had to do something, they know I could do it. They know I can be in a room, speak different languages. You know what I'm saying? I'm a chameleon. Yeah, I could throw on this right here. People think that I'm part of the party. Right. But I'm not. You see what I'm saying? You know what I mean? So it's like it's it was one of those things that they my clients knew that I was the perfect person to be an eye in the sky, like people that people wouldn't be looking at like, oh, there's securities over there. Security is one of the like, as you're saying, a lot of people think of it as like, oh, a security guard or like security. And there's this I don't know. I don't think people understand the level of depth, especially when you're working events with celebrities and people like that, because you do you have to blend in. You got to be able to read the room. You got to be cool and not look like security, but still like be ready in case something happens. And those the guys that are huge, they want them to look like security. Right. Or that that fear for people to say, oh, there's security. But then you have some people out there who think they're bad asses. You know what I'm saying? And they try to sneak around or whatever. And that's where I come in, because I'm not from L.A. Right where I'm from. The street that I'm from, it's one way in and one way out. You see what I'm saying? So I've lived many different lives. I really have. And so like when people see me, they think that, you know, I have been a party promoter before, you know what I mean? They see me and they, you know, even I even smile. Like, you know, I've been I've stood next to somebody that I've had to like literally take right there. You know what I mean? Like because they didn't know I was security and they're pulling something out. Right. You know what I mean? And then it's like I'm holding them in my. Yeah, well, this is four hundred sixty five pounds of pressure right here. So you're not getting out of this grip, right? You know what I'm saying? All I have to do is wait for the police come. They come shake my hand. You're paid. That's right. You know, it's just so interesting. Like all the social dynamics that go into that. I used to know the guy that worked the door. I mean, this was many years ago at Tokamadera, which I don't it's still a decent, decent dinner spot or whatever. It's kind of a little bit over the hill in terms of like hip spots to go out in L.A. But this guy. had some of the best social skills of any sort of dude I knew. Plus, he was, you know, in really good shape. But he, you know, he worked the door his security, but he also like, they hired him because of his social skills, not because he was big, right? Because like, he knew who to let in who to not let in. He was he was basically in charge of making that place awesome. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And he did like the that place got popular because of him. And you know, girls will even show up like, Oh, you know, he's at the door. I want to I want to go because of him. You know, it's like, that that guy can make the whole party. Yeah. And see, I've never been that guy. Well, I've made the part. Yeah. Yeah. But I've never been the guy at the door. I've never been that like, that's a different sort of security, sort of security. And you're on the clock. See me, I wouldn't get hired. Okay, it's for this night. But then tomorrow, I might be downtown sewing beds, right? Or printing shirts. The next day, I might have a photo shoot. You see what I'm saying? Like, I never wanted to have to clock in. Yeah. You know what I mean? You're sitting at that door. Like, I mean, you're sitting there until your job is done. You know what I mean? Yeah. And if there's another opportunity comes up, then you just miss it. So have you ever have you ever had like a quote unquote real job? I had I had one. This is funny, actually. I've never actually had a nine to five job or a job like that. Longer than six months. Really? Never. My very first like real, real, real girlfriend of like many years. Well, I say many years like, you know, we were in high school, whatever like that. Her brother and I, we had we had a T-Mobile company. We were a second party dealer. So what that means is for T-Mobile, all we had to do was get the contracts like people, you know, the two year we were the guys who remember back in the day, you had the kiosk and I'm like, Hey, hey, do you have a cell phone? Oh, yeah. Those guys are good. Yeah, we got to get them to stop and check this out. Oh, we got to talk about this. I'm excited. Yeah. This is what people don't know. The reason why those people were so effing annoying is because only thing that that company, whether it was AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, only stipulation they had was you had to reach a quota of contracts. Okay. Everything else you sold in there, you kept was yours. So like, so like, if you needed them to provide it, it costs a certain amount. But if you had another plug, you had another way to get Bluetooth, you had another way to get at the time it was Razer phones. Okay, well, my girlfriend's brother at the time, where whoever he knew in China, we were getting freaking Razer phones for little of nothing. All we were doing was copying T-Mobile's packaging plans. So people were paying at the time all this money for Razer phones. That was our money. Wait, so walk me through that. So you get the phones from China for nothing, basically. And then you would you'd be at the kiosk, T-Mobile kiosk, so you're selling them a plan, but you're making money on the phone. So we get a percentage off the plan, just a commission, right? Right. And they're signing like a two year contract at those times, right? Yeah, two year contract, whatever it was, but then the money comes in because they have family plans. They want to add this person, they want to add this person, they want to add this person. But then they're also buying the phones. Okay. So then we like had like a package or like whatever. So like, I'm like, I'm these phones, like we're literally getting them for like 40, 50 bucks. Like, you know what I'm saying? Yeah, people are buying them for like 400. Nice. And you're keeping them. It was ours. It was not a T-Mobile phone. It was Motorola. So that makes sense now. Because I always wondered, I was like, the guys working those kiosks, those are like legit salesmen. Like they're out, they're out doing this for a reason. Because they're like, we're making 1000% off the cell phone, like the contract. And now everyone has a cell phone, you know, no matter what. But at that time, people didn't have contracts. They had prepaid or like whatever like that. So we reeled them in, and got them to, you know, got them to sign up on a contract. And they wanted the phones, you know, their kids were there, right? No. And that's, that's where the salesman part comes in. Like, yeah, about the phones. How did you so how did you like, what was the training like for that? The reason why I ask is, I've done a shitload of, of sales in my life, a lot of those sales have been like approaching women. It's which is effectively the same skill as working in a kiosk to try to sell someone a phone is not that different, right? It's so like, how did you? Did you like, because I never felt like I was a natural salesman when I, like, I think I was maybe a junior in college or something. And I was like, I hope I never ever have to have a sales job, because I don't know how to sell shit. And then by the time I was like a senior and starting like graduating, then I got into like all the dating stuff and approaching women. And then I realized, all right, if I'm, if I'm not a salesman, I'm never going to make any money. I'm never going to be able to like, pick my own destiny. And I'm like, I saw the importance of that skill. And I saw approaching women as a way to like build that skill, because it's like, you're the product, you're going up, yeah, you can either sell yourself or not. And see with me, because how I was raised, you know, let's, let's be honest, you know, I'm saying, racism is still going on today. And where I'm from in Florida. It was heavy, right? Yeah. But one thing about me, you know, like I said, I lived many different lives, me and my father being in the military. I was always the new kid at the school. Because you're moving around a lot, right? Yeah. Moving around a lot. But I learned at an early age, I can set the narrative. So every new school I went to people, you know, how they talk about the new kid. I was always good at sports. So like, that was always a thing. You know what I'm saying? You played football? What else? Football, basketball, baseball. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. So I played all the white people sports, ice hockey, golf, tennis. I actually like golf, but I'm left handed. I'm actually looking for a left handed club. My wife's lefty. She loves to golf. I'm actually looking for, I don't want to buy a brand new pair because I have too much going on. I don't want to be nuts. But like to find a used pair of left handed clubs, it's like, yeah, it's ridiculous dude. Like this one guy just had some, but they were like in his garage forever and like warped. Imagine finding lefty women's clubs because that's even smaller. She might as well go to Dick's Sporting Goods and buy some stuff. You know what I'm saying? Save her some time. But to answer your question about being a salesman, it wasn't so much me picking up the skill on how to sell a phone. Everywhere I went, not saying I had to sell myself. I had to sell the narrative of how I wanted people to treat me and to respect me. You see, me and my father have the same name and it's a unique name. But not only that, it's just like when I say treat me, it's because of opportunities, like you get left out. You know what I mean? So it was kind of a natural, you know what I mean? Especially when I speak to women, me and my mom look, we're almost like twins. My hair used to be long and braids too. Oh really? Yeah. So like we look, I'm very in tune with women. So when the family comes up, I initially speak to the man, like my father was a military, I speak to the man. I give him the acknowledgement that I respect that he is the man of the family. Then I go and tell him to check things out. While he's checking things out, I don't go to the wife, I go to the kid. One thing about me, I'm really good with kids. So I'm talking to the kid like, what do you like? Do you think your parents will buy you this and that? So now this entire family is consumed around this kiosk. You see? And what is the wife doing? Looking at what she likes. Now she's not thinking about a plan. She's looking at this pink razor foam. And now this kid is looking at me like he wants to be me. Even though I wasn't always, I was pound for pound my entire age. So he's looking at me, I'm in this suit. He's like, I'm talking to the kid. Now I go back to the husband. I don't speak to him regular. I act like I'm pulling him to the side. You know what I'm saying? You talk to him like that. Next thing you know, you reel them in, you reel them in. Then he's like, well, my brother needs a phone. You know what I'm saying? If you look at plans with, with, with even now, I mean, you buy a single plan, it's one, you buy two or add a line, it's one, but a family plan, you get a better deal. So you end up wanting people to get a family plan. Now they're buying more phones, which was our money. Plus the commission on the contract. So now you're getting five phones and geez. So we made all that money. And then I'll go ahead and tell you, um, when that, that era slowed down, um, people started like, remember like when everyone got hip cell phones, people start complaining about us haggling them in the mall. Right. Not just us everywhere. Everyone got time. Like you walk through the mall and be like, if they were like, sir, you'd be like, like, exactly. It was past that era. Yeah. There's a window for that. Right. And did they, did when, when you got that job, did they teach you that? Like, you know, that pitch? It was me and him. There was no pitch. It was me and him. So, so you guys came up with that whole sort of technique and spiel. This is all it was. Yeah. He, it was, uh, he had a friend who worked for T-Mobile. The T-Mobile, I guess somehow presented, um, they wanted to be in malls and you could be second party dealers or whatever. He came to me and was like, listen, this kiosk, we can pay it monthly. And it was rent. It was, uh, you pay to own. So we end up paying the rent on the kiosk and then we end up owning it. Oh, wow. Okay. And then when that era ended, we realized it was ending. We sold it for $250,000. Amazing. Yeah. $250,000 for the kiosk. And it was actually turned into a piercing, the earring, the Yeah. That's who bought it. Oh, okay. Wow. Because it was, wasn't just the wood kiosk. It was how we made it and the location of the kiosk in the mall. That's a big thing. This was Florida. Yeah. If you're in the, if you're have a kiosk, but you're in the back of the mall where nobody walks, I mean, we were in this by the food court where everything was popping. Right. You know what I'm saying? Like you have to pass the lights and stuff. You have the razors at the time. Yeah. Like we were, you were doing good. It's so funny. Cause it's like, I would walk by those kiosks and I knew right. That it's like, I'm a good salesman because I'm easily sold. Right. Like I call myself like the biggest pigeon ever. Right. So like, but I, I don't know, maybe, maybe the guy was just blowing smoke up my ass. He told me like, to be a good salesman, you have to be easily sold. Cause you got to be able to convince people and be convinced. But I knew I'd walk by and I knew they'd say something. And I knew there, you know, I know I it's like, I saw it and felt it happening. And it's like, I couldn't even stop it from happening. Right. And I was like, okay, whatever. And I tell my clients that too. I'm like, you know, even if you're, you know, spitting game at a girl and she knows you're spitting game, it's still going to work because it's like, she's, she wants what you're selling, you know? She wants what you're selling. And with me, like you said, you're easily sold. My parents used to tell me before I even knew prices of things. If I went to an aisle and they say, what would you want? And I picked something, they'd say it was most likely the most expensive thing. And I said, I've always had expensive taste. I've always had taste in quality things. So I'm not easily sold because I know what I want. But if you show me something that I didn't see before and I want it, you sold me. Like when I bought my G-Wagon, the guy kept trying to get me to get the GF. He's AMG dude. And you're saving this much money. And I'm like, dude, I came here with a cashier's check for a G-Wagon. Right. You're not selling me anything. And like I tell people, you know, they have these shows about people selling these multi-million dollar homes. You know, you go to Rolls Royce, you go to, oh guys, you buy a Lamborghini, you get a free shirt and a hat, by the way. But you go to these places, those people aren't selling them. Somebody buying a $50 million home, you didn't sell them that home. No. Okay. You showed them that home. Right. And they decided if they wanted to spend their $50 million dollars on that. You didn't sell them anything. The product sells itself. Well, when you have that much money, no one's selling you anything. Exactly. Like you're getting what you want. Right. You're not going to convince me that this closet is good enough for me. I'm spending $50 million and it's not. You're such a good salesman that you can get that guy to not live in the mansion and move instead to a two-bedroom apartment. I'm just going to go ahead and just settle for this because you're such a good salesman. Right. That's not happening. That's not happening. You see what I'm saying? So I've always liked nice things. And I would save my money. Like I told you, I had brains when I played basketball. Allen Iverson is my favorite player. All my shoes, my arm, my bands, everything was Iverson. So I would save my money to get that. So no matter where I went, I don't care if it was a shoe store. I don't care if it's clothing. Somebody could try to sell me something. It ain't AI. It's not, it don't got a number three on it. I don't want it. You know what I'm saying? That was me. But at the same time when it came to being a salesman, I knew that if a person said no immediately, what kind of person they were. If they gave me three seconds, like Jordan Belfort, like he says in Wolf of Wall Street, he goes, whoever speaks first loses. Right. So when he asked that guy and the guy, he was quiet for a second. You don't have to ask his wife. He got them. You know what I'm saying? Right. He got them right then and there because he didn't say no immediately. He thought about it and then he spoke. He lost. Right. Because now your brain, because now you want it, but you're thinking of why, if what can happen if, if can I not get it, but I can get it and I like it, but what's my wife going to say? Well, that's when the salesman comes up and says, hey man, who has a cojones here? Right. You get what I'm saying? But then on the same time, it comes to happy wife, happy life, happy. you're a happy world. I mean, that's what we think, right? That's a dangerous trade. But yeah, but for Oh, man, for, for sales, and so, okay, I have so many questions. So this was in this was before you moved to LA. Yeah, this is in Florida. Yeah, what's going on with you from like, a, you know, single guy perspective? What was going on with your dating life at the time? What was it like leaving? Like, what was the dating scene like in in Florida, versus coming to LA? Like, what did you notice there? It's just like we started off, man, where you even though, Oh, and built into that. Sorry to bombard you with multiple questions. But like, what was what did your trajectory of your Instagram also look like? Because that's a huge part of the dating process. And that's, you know, so Instagram, I can honestly say, I didn't give a damn about until, and to give people perspective, you've got like 130,000 followers on that. Until I moved to Los Angeles. And, and I got to see people making money from it. Because where I'm from, people post pictures just to keep in touch, right? Just like Facebook, right? Or like that. And they wasn't even Facebook business at the time. So Instagram was social media where I'm from. And that was in the time that we're speaking of, didn't really play a part. It was it was like MySpace was bigger than anything. Like, right, if you were in a place to have your photos, and got moved in a different place on MySpace, admit something. I was number two. And now number five. What happened? Like what? I forgot about that. How the rankings of people? Yeah. It mattered. Like, yeah, someone moved. How old are you? I'm 32. Oh, wow. You tell you. I mean, because I was when MySpace was good. I was like, 2023. Yeah. So like, you were hella young when Yeah, yeah. Like, it like, why did it? Why am I not number two anymore? Like, what happened? Like, we're not friends, right? You know, so. So when, but the dating aspect, like I told you, my business partner, his his sister was my girlfriend, you know. And at that point, it was cool. Because I was like a job, you know, I had a girl, you know, girlfriend. And I love to go on cruises. We were going cruises all the time. And it was, it was cool. You know what I'm saying? But what kind of cruises? Carnival cruises. Oh, nice. Out of Florida. That's my favorite. Yeah. Carnival is great. And the one that goes out of Long Beach goes down to Mexico. It's like the I haven't been to Long Beach. I haven't been out of that one. And that and my mom's 50th birthday, I took her on a cruise, just her and I, people didn't know if she was my mom, my girlfriend or my sister. So dudes will be looking and then they will just give up. Because they're like, either, either one. They see you and they're like, hey, I'm on the wave. Either way, we might as well just not do this. You know what I'm saying? It's hilarious. It was hilarious, but it was great. Just my mother and I, you know, so to get back to your question, social media didn't get really into my life and involved until I came to LA. Yeah, the interesting thing about social media, especially Instagram, and when you're not in, I mean, it's things have changed now. But it's like the way I feel about Instagram and social media altogether. It's like, it's not real. The money's real. But the rest of it's not real. Perception. Yeah. And but you know, when you're in, like the situation you described, it's just like a way to stay in touch with your friends and share pictures. It's almost just like an online album. Right. But but then you come to LA and it's like you everything like your business runs for Instagram. It's your visual resume. That's what I tell people. Instagram these days. This happened last week. And this sounds so, I'm not a millennial, but this sounds so millennial. Instagram sent me an email, I went to log in, I posted I posted the same thing at five in the morning for the past almost 10 years, five in the morning to make you a legend. Yeah, I posted something with the I have an alarm, but I don't. But I believe in that because you know, you they say you get 24 hours in a day. Yeah, there's 24 hours in a day, but you don't get to actually attack those 24 hours in a day. And obviously, I mean, we've heard, we've heard, you know, Muhammad Ali and talk about it is a Washington talk about it. We all know, you know, you supposed to sleep this much time you eat this much time you drive as much time. So how much time do you actually have to work out on your craft? Yeah, we already know about that. Um, but I will say, when when I got here, and I seen how people were, were making money from their visual resume. Yeah, I seen that they put out what they wanted you to see. Right. So I was confused at first, because I did so many different things. And it was like, it was only way that would make money. It was engagement engagement. You go to my Instagram now. I mean, if you you might out of 10 pictures, there might be one that doesn't say pay, pay partnership. Like right now, I'm nothing but billboard. I'm nothing but advertise. Yeah, I know. So you're selling the athletic gear and stuff like that. I mean, so you're monetizing it. Yeah, yeah, definitely. Because one, it's a it's, I can pull it up here. So we can we can we can, we can be honest, it's toxic in a way where because it's nothing but highlights. If if you're not monetizing, you're just showing your highlights. And everyone who tries to relate or knows somewhat of you, they want to live like you or do what you're doing. And if they can't do what you're doing, they tend to have FOMO, right? You know, I'm saying fear of missing out when you're really not missing out on anything because it's your life. You see what I'm saying? Like you're looking at someone else's life, which is nothing but a perspective of what they want you to see, right? What goes on outside of these pictures, you have no idea. You don't understand like this picture. So yeah, so take us through these and this picture right here. I'm holding my son. Yeah, I was in so much pain. Really? I was in so much pain right there. Holding him. He's only just turned four in August, August 6. But he's huge. Like this kid is so tall. Yeah, yeah, he's huge. And my back was killing me. Uh huh. You see what I'm saying? Yeah, he looks big for a four year old. But you would never think a seven year old. Yeah, exactly. And you see this picture here. In the middle. I had cramps out the ass. My back was killing me. You would never think so. Yeah, you have no idea. Well, in the deposition, the lady, she handed me my packet. And I said, come sign me up. She was Korean. She looked at me. She didn't know. Yeah, yeah, I'll speak your language too. You know what I'm saying? That's how we get that. So she handed me my packet. You know Korean? Yeah, so my dad, he, you know, he did, you know, he did tours. And you know, he, like I said, it was he's all about learning. And, you know, I had my childhood, I hate to say it. How many languages do you speak? Well, at one point, I was speaking five. I understand five. You know, you don't have to keep up with something to speak like so. They say it's I mean, I can I learned Russian when I lived in Ukraine. Yeah. And I noticed that just learning another language and being able to speak another language, it like unlocks a bit of just like it unlocks your brain in a weird way. It like allows you to it like forces and I've looked at studies on this and stuff. They say it helps you be I sound dumb saying it helps you be smarter. But no, I'm in a guy in the airport. I have because I have an American Express Platinum. So I was in the in the skylight. Right. And I wasn't thinking I was just, you know, I was in my in my work mode. And I put my American Express Platinum on the table. He's like, What are you doing? Like, you don't pay for anything. I was like, Oh, yeah, that's right. He was also Korean. And we started to speak and we do business to this day. Really? Yeah. If I speak back to him, right, his language, he would have just did that favor for me. And it was gone. You know, it's just whatever. But it creates an instant connection. Because it's like, you respect me, you respect my culture. It's not only that, because you are able to understand their language. You look at people different. Like, right. If you Yeah, you understand so much more of their culture. And but yeah, sorry. And not even not even just that, like, okay, you go get a pedicure, you go to a Vietnamese place. If you don't speak their language or understand them, you're just going to go there and get your feet. Right. If you understand their language, you know, they're whether they're talking shit or not. That reminds me of the Seinfeld episode. But they might be having a conversation that you can chime in on. And you never know how far it will get you. Yeah. Oh, dude. So the other day, I was getting my haircut, right down the street where you're stuck in traffic where we can see the sirens there. And the, you know, the barber and the female barber, whatever haircut or stylist, whatever next to them, they were speaking Russian. And I was understanding that they're from Odessa, they're talking, they're speaking Russian from Ukraine, because, you know, spoken, kind of 50-50 there. Most people in Odessa, their mother tongue is Russian, is Russian, right. And so, you know, at the end of the haircut, when I'm looking in the mirror, and I go, like most of the most of their language was Russian. Well, so with with in Ukraine, so Ukraine was part of the USSR, right. And anything that was part of the USSR, the Russian language was pushed on. Okay, I see what you're saying. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's why it was like that. Like, it was actually forbidden to speak Ukrainian, because it wasn't the official language. So it was really only spoken more in Western Ukraine. Like my wife, she grew up in Eastern Ukraine, and like her mother tongue is Russian. But you know, she obviously learned Ukrainian in school, and she speaks that just as well as she does, or just as she speaks Russian. And obviously, since the war, now it's like everyone's, like, for me, it sucks, because I was learning Russian, because everyone's speaking Russian. And now it's like, you know, you don't speak Russian. You speak Ukrainian. Yeah. You're not speaking that. Right. Yeah. So I'm getting my haircut at the end of it. He's showing me the mirror, like, how's it looking? And I, I turn him and I go, zaibis, which is like slang for fucking awesome. And you don't know that that word unless you actually speak the language. And he just like, he was like, what the fuck? He lit up. He was like, that's what that lady lit up in the deposition, because these are the people we're suing here. Right. So and she's looking at me like, just like some young black kid, you know, young, and this is a huge lawsuit because of, I had a shower fall on my head, and I didn't die. But it's funny, because I've been in debate class since a little kid, like my dad is, he wanted me to be a JAG lawyer. And I would have became a lawyer. What's a JAG lawyer? A military lawyer. Okay. We go in as an officer. Got it. When you go in as an officer. So you have to go to like one of the like West Point or one of the military colleges for that? Um, there's different ways to go about it. Yeah, there's different ways to go about it. But like, because there's different classes that you can take while you're just like you can graduate with your A. There's different things like if you're an ROTC, there's different programs you can take to you can graduate at a higher level. So it's, it's quicker. Right. Um, but being a lawyer, I mean, the girl I was on Bad Girls Club with, shout out to Sayor, she's an attorney now. She graduated from Pepperdine or something like that. And people seen her on Bad Girls Club, and they would never think that she's, she's, she's a lawyer now. But for me, yes, I have a gift to gab, but there's no way in hell. I go to my lawyer's office now and I see all that paperwork. And he tells me I'm like, Eli, like, you read all this? He's like, yeah. And he tells me on his free time, he picks up the book. What? You're better reading. There's no way in the world. I'm doing this. So it's like, I would love to be a lawyer, but I'm not doing that. Right. So I guess I'm not gonna be a lawyer. But when it comes to speaking about something that I know, factual languages that I know, when I said just the simple word comes out of my mouth, because it's Korean, it's not Spanish. We're in LA, you know, like the look on her face was like, holy shit. Like, so there was like, we're in a deposition. And she's, you know, in a deposition you have max seven hours, she took the maximum seven hours. She's going through this paperwork, trying to get me different ways. Mind you, the father that I had, did that to me almost on a daily basis. Now, so you're comfortable? Yeah. Like, are you like, how was school? Yeah, your teacher called and said this, no teacher call. You see what I'm saying? Like, didn't see it. But so like, she would ask me questions like, so what exercises can you do in the gym? And I would say, instead of just answering her question, I said, you know, I'm a master trainer. So I would say, well, in the physical therapy office, I said, there's free weights. And I said, there's machines also there that are in almost every gym. So what are you really asking me? Next question. They just shut up. What you just asked me is redundant, right? Because in physical therapy, they have been doing the same workouts just at a different level. You didn't ask me what level that I was doing the machines. You didn't ask me how far I was doing how much weight you asked me what can't I do? Right? Well, the things that I can't do is on that paper. It tells me I can't put anything on my net. It tells you what I can't if I can't bend over and pick up. Yeah. So you're asking me about machines and weights. Well, you lost that one. Try again. Yeah. So I was just just killing. So sometimes he would hit my leg because when I do when I do know what I'm speaking about, and especially when someone's trying to attack me or something like that, I get going. And I make them feel very small, like when it comes to because, like I said, I lived many different lives. You see what I'm saying? So while from any given time, you know, so I can come to my homie like this and be like, Hey, bro, you know, I mean, like, we got to handle this situation, like that little town, you know, I mean, we got a lot of grandma, we got a boom. But then I walk into a room and I'm like, Oh, great. My mother, you don't have to say like, Sure. I'm a chameleon. Totally. Yeah. So when she's when she picked up on that, she was like, what am I off? Yeah, we like we have to get this kind of money, right? Seven hours. She tried to ask me every question so many different ways. And I was because one I didn't have I wasn't lying about anything. So when you don't have anything to lie about it, I mean, you're going first of all, yeah. But the fact that I seen how long after the second break, and we were there for hours, I was like, she's gonna work for the seven hours. Let me see how many questions you get. Let me see how much of a lawyer you really are. Yeah, you don't You know what I'm saying? You should be one of those like expert witnesses for uh, yeah, right. Yeah, it's a lot of money. Yeah, but uh So Going back to instagram. Yeah when so what when did you make like a conscious choice? To grow that what did you notice about your your growth? Did that come from like the reality shows you were on did that come from the training? Like how did you grow and how did you become so when I got on the realities the shows? And how did you get on the shows? What were the shows? You know what? I think it was shout again shout out to say aura, but it was a few people they reached out to If you notice again, like I said Reality tv shows you always know there's usually only one black guy You see what i'm saying? Right and he's a unique person. You see what i'm saying? Either he's a buff guy, you know, he was a model. Um, you know what i'm saying his sexuality whatever it is It's something that sticks out Um, so there's a few people they reached out to and the mtv texted me to this day multiple people Like they referenced me. So they were like we have to find this kid. They found me They've been texting me ever since since 2016 so I got on reality tv and that kind of built up my instagram, but it wasn't like monetized It just got fans and stuff. I had all kinds. I had Everything that I was doing on there. I didn't know I was just posting and I was getting likes It wasn't about money at the time. It was just about and what was what were the shows? So I was on uh gaming dating. Okay. Um, that was a dating show. Yeah getting I was uh, I was on a bad girls club. Uh, that that was uh, that was that was pretty cool Um battle of the x's that was pretty cool. Um, so like all those things were just so these are these are like dating Yeah dating reality. I mean every reality show is kind of like what's going on with dating the love engines, right? But like That's so yeah, so that was pretty cool, but that that wasn't that didn't monetize me. Yeah, that was just like people See, I just build your yeah the monetized stuff came from me working out The the gym I like to go to different gyms. I like different vibes in the gym and check out, you know, because like You get a new outfit. You feel good. You know i'm saying so I put a Nice gym outfit and I go to a different a new gym It's a different vibe i'm gonna get a good workout because it's just like i'm using a different machine Seeing different people people are not coming up to me, you know talking to me all the time So i'm i'm meeting people and and where I was living at the time. There was like three major fitness influencers there Well, I told you who my parents were, you know who they are. I'm not starstruck Right, but when it comes to working out not starstruck I want to work out with people who are I want to say better than me but more advanced who can push you Yeah with anything in life. It's like if you can get If you like any time you want to improve at something if you can, you know Luckily enough be around someone who's just a little bit better like that's even better than being around someone who's like way better because it's like you can see the gap and you can learn so much Like with golf like i'm always i'm I mean, I I got a scholarship partial scholarship to play at ucsd I'm a very good golfer, you know played my whole life. Um, but like what do you shoot usually? Around even par. Okay, so let's go good day. I'll shoot a couple under okay bad day. Yeah Exactly i'm a little bit better after a couple beers, you know, you gotta find that balance Yeah, but um, you know when I play around guys that are better than me Like I play way better versus when I play with people you're sharp like, you know what i'm saying? Yeah, you can focus more like they hit a shot and you're like Oh, I didn't feel confident about that shot until I saw them hit it and now I can hit that shot No problem, you realize like when they were hitting it like they were focused they weren't like bullshit and you're like, okay, right Like you show up you show up. Yeah, you show up But even when i'm hooping like you know what i'm saying like dudes really playing defense. It's like okay They're really playing defense. So we're gonna play let's play. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. We're gonna play you know i'm saying Um, so working out I and that's got to be hard for you to find because you know If you're already in insane shape, you're a beast. So like finding someone else who's in different gyms. Got it. Yeah locations certain gyms Right, like it's like the the elite sort of yeah, this gym is known for that Yeah, it's similar to golf courses. I guess too. Like there's some courses where you just you're not gonna play there unless Exactly like of course like, you know, i'm not gonna say the certain gym, you know gyms that are bad I won't do that talk bad about a gym, but there's certain gyms that I won't go to because it's nothing but a fashion show Sure, you see what i'm saying equinox bus hollywood Maybe I think I mean there's work, you know what i'm saying? There's I mean, yeah, you can you can speak a little bit but still work but like when everyone's in there just you can tell They're dripping where you're wearing jewelry. You're wearing jewelry and then you're not in there to really work out, right? Come on, dude, like you have a kilo gold Cuban bracelet on what are you doing? What are you doing? You know what i'm saying? You know, so i'm i'm working out. It's nice by the way. Oh, thank you Appreciate it. So I like they're matching right? Yeah. Yeah. These are matching. Yeah, this one right here I love rose gold, you know what i'm saying? So like and but and I have another one live that my brain, you know, amazing I told you i'm a watch collector too. Yeah a bunch of watches and um, so Working out like I'm younger but people can actually see my focus they can see my passion so I had a couple guys come up to me and be like, you know, you want to work out man? They're fitness influencers. You know what I mean? Yeah, so working out with them, you know, they're posting me on their story I'm posted on my story, but i'm just Posting because I am these guys Yeah, they're posting because they are but they're signed to ehp labs. They're this this company this company out of nowhere I started getting emails and started getting free meals I can't shout out to iconic meals almost two years straight. I didn't have to pay for any meals amazing like factor So it started off With me just getting free things like my bed like my bed's huge like, you know, my bed was free You know what? I mean? Like, you know just give me a free bed. It's just a free, uh, california king mattresses It's huge what's the correlation between they're just like you need to sleep better because that'll okay a little stretch but hey, why not free bed It's all about because the quality of sleep Yeah in any industry or in just in life. It's so big. I wanted to ask you last night. I told you Yeah, I went to it this morning. I texted you right and then you were texting me again. It's Yeah, yeah, so that's that's what I wanted to ask you especially as like well. Are you single now or yes? Okay, so as a single guy, it's Really difficult to do the early Sort of wake up thing for most guys because they're going on dates or they're going out on the weekend they're drinking and they're doing the party and stuff and like they're trying to meet girls and then That is a huge conflict to waking up at 5 30 and hitting the gym and beast moding and growing your business and it's like it's one thing for you know a lot of these Married sort of you know easy for for someone like jeff bezos to say like yeah wake up at 5 30, you know Get that money, you know, whatever but like you got a wife. You're not trying to get out there You're not trying to meet people. You're not trying to be social. So Obviously you're doing something right there what's your secret when it comes to waking up early and still having a social life and uh, the balance with me is um, and this isn't for everybody that I do it and like people always say It's easier to do something when you Either have to or it's making you money versus you're just doing it Um, it's like my first client Is that four in the morning? You know what? I mean? Yeah on the other side of the world I get up in the morning. I go on live on facebook on facebook, you know i'm saying on average I make it between 50 and 100 bucks a day You see what i'm saying? So i'm up early. I get so much done before nine o'clock Mm-hmm That like even if I don't take naps, but I just rest, you know what i'm saying work from my phone You see, you know what? I mean? I get invited to events I I show face at events. I'm not like I said, I was a party promoter in orlando in miami. I've done all that I'm 32 years old now Seven and a half four years. I'll be 40. Yeah Promoting for yeah, you're at the I did I did some I mean I was never a promoter but I you know, I was telling you before on the on the call that like I was Basically running model houses with a bunch of promoters and these guys were in there like, you know, 23 24 25 And I at the time I was 30 30 31 and that's like being a promoter, right? You don't you don't have a very long window. It's like being a model Or being a you know, it's nice. I'm going to catch up to you. Yeah, it was nice. Sorry guys that i'm That i'm sniffling I I there was a hurricane here, you know, it wasn't very big But then I went to florida to visit my family and it was a hurricane as well You see what i'm saying? Then I came back here. So my allergies are a bit messed up That's why i'm, you know stiff a little bit. So excuse me for that. There was an earthquake during the hurricane. Oh, yeah I remember. Yeah. Yeah, I was driving actually. Yeah, it happened and I was I had I had some clients here We were doing a little event and um a few of them had never been in an earthquake and neither has my wife from ukraine and she's like what the fuck is happening like I was driving, you know, it was like You felt it. I felt it but it was more or less like a woozy like a cruise ship It wasn't like a I wasn't still like I mean I was like, what is this? Am I afraid to call these earthquakes? And i'm like You know what? I mean like being in florida Mother nature like not saying california hasn't had some bad earthquakes or whatever because I mean I haven't lived here that long to experience something like that but mother nature has Hurt florida louisiana has hurt us so bad. Yeah that Small stuff like this like I don't really do nothing. Yeah, I don't entertain it like I don't even like they said it was earthquake I was like, all right, I gotta get back on phone. Yeah I'm still driving But to answer your question this is the biggest thing and social media I'm, i'm gonna say this because i've been wanting to say this you asked me what my secret is, right? We I had a very good conversation with with with a lady friend And she was like She's seen older people. She sent me a meme And then she's seen an older couple and they were just laughing, you know doing her thing and she was like I want to go up and ask them what's their secret? And it was very simple for me And I broke it down for her And I I could break it down right now, but it would take a little bit their secret is When I and I told her I just said I I broke it down into social media But I said they didn't have and her answer was but we should be more of adult To to not let certain things affect us I said but that wasn't topic of discussion You asked these old people. What was their secret to being together this long? I said today's world Look, you know how many contacts you have? I texted you at two this morning Your wife could have assumed it was someone else even if she didn't If she would have said who was that texting you even though it was on dnd if it wasn't She would have woke up. You would have woke up 2 a.m in the morning Regardless if it was me or not that you can't tell me anything that doesn't that feels good to anyone That your partner is getting text messages at 2 3 in the morning you want to ask Who's texting you? You see what i'm saying, right? It's always that that question's gonna right. Yeah, so those old people's secret is That they never had to have that emotion. They never had to ask those questions If you go that wasn't part of their bullshit, you go through my dms right now men and women sending me raunchy stuff negative stuff positive stuff, but at the end of the day, they never had to Go through that. Yeah, they never had to have that emotion of Somebody is trying to get with my partner because if you didn't work Or live around that area go to the grocery store. You didn't see anyone. All right. Yeah, that was their secret That's a lot easier. Yeah, so what my secret is it's not even a secret. It's something that i'm i'm learning And I want to become a better man every day And this is what I asked myself I said I know what is your perfect person and I can write it down or answer it to myself, right? and then my next question is Am I the person that my perfect person would want in their life Kind of look in the mirror right there. See what i'm saying? Yeah We we can always say what we want from a person But that person right there. Are we that person that they would want right? That's I mean I I I say that to uh on the on this podcast all the time I say you want to 10 Are you a 10? Can you look in the mirror and say am I a 10? Right? Like you get what you deserve You see what i'm saying? So the way that it's it the way that it's been transitioned for me smoothly is because it's been people doing like Like-minded things being like-minded. You see what i'm saying being at the end of the day If we spend enough time together and we get along we're gonna grow a bond and a love for each other but Then you say you know what? We're such good buds. Let's live together We end up living together and end up Whooping each other's ass and never talking and speaking again. Why just because you have that emotion doesn't mean you're compatible So the secret is finding someone you're compatible with not just attracted to right You see what i'm saying? Sure that attraction and that love is just an emotion But when you're trying to date, I mean, I don't date to like to break up like or just get with someone to break up You know, it's longevity Are you compatible with that person? Longevity or is this just lust? It's just attraction and lust and yeah, it's blissful for the time Yeah, so that's my secret. It's like I don't I don't rush. I'm not trying to rush anything And I mean, I mean let's be honest it's about to be 2024, you know women used to be more Standoffish nowadays women are Are are going after what they want what I noticed in 2017 Right before I moved to ukraine. I I and like I said, I was running around with those promoter guys managing model houses Like we had we had model houses in New York, Miami and LA, and they had a standing table at, you know, five nights a week, one oak hooray Henry's like, you know, all the any night of the week, basically, I could just show up to a club. And it would be 10 models to promoters. And you know, I just roll up. And I learned I learned pretty quickly, that anytime I tried like spitting game with the girls anytime, anytime I tried to initiate anything, it was just like, No, no. But if I let them chase me, right, and I just let the ratio work in my favor, because I'm already at a, you know, in a situation where it's like, four to one women and men, then it's like, here we go. And that was so different than what I experienced, like, kind of growing up. And when I, you know, moved over Eastern Europe, like if you get the man goes in the he pursues, right, but here it's like, everything's reversed. It's like the women are, they're kind of chasing the guys, they're looking for the high status guys, and they're going after those guys. And the second they feel like you're going after them, like, Oh, you're a loser. You know, it's like it, you know, it is a double standard. But after you hit 25, you ask a woman, or even 30, you ask a woman, you know, from a financial standpoint, like, who's worth more, you know what I'm saying? Like, at 35 financial standpoint in this world, who's worth more a man or a female? And when you're aging, yeah, a woman's clock is ticking, right? So I had to work, I had to realize, I'm not in my 20s anymore. I'm not just you know, I'm saying I'm 32 years old. The the females either that I'm attracted to or that are attracted to me, they're looking for certain things. They're not just looking for a good time. You know, some maybe are just in that world just looking for a good time. But then you look at where are you that person, that the women your age? Yeah, exactly. Where are you that that person's just looking for a good time, right? You know, it's probably at a club or some kind of like venue, whatever, you know what I mean? But somewhere serious or going throughout this life, you go to the post office, I'm talking about just places where you're handling your business. A female will see me, you know, 32 years old by myself, you know, handling my business, she sees something, you know what I mean? And if I'm attracted to a female, I have a way where, you know, it's not, oh, you're sexy, you're beautiful, whatever. No, it's not just attracted to her by her looks. You know, if you're attracted to somebody, I feel like before you should even approach them, not be a creep and just stare at them. But what are they doing? What are they wearing? How are they moving? Can you see what just made them smile? You know, and I hate to say it's a game or whatever like that. But if you see, she picked up a certain scent, you know, you're in the mall, you're in the in the in the fragrance section. And you know, you walk past her and you say, excuse me, like, do you think that would smell? She doesn't know that you just seen that she smelled that. You see what I'm saying? Right. Conversation right there. Yeah. And at the end of the day, I hate to say it's a game. But females don't like to be attacked. You see what I'm saying? Because when men do that, they not saying every guy, but most men have one thing on their brain when they do that, right? She's like, okay, he thinks I look good. He's all at me, whatever. Yeah. But and they've felt that 20 times since they left the house. If she thinks that I'm bullshitting her, the fact that I came up to her and I'm just willing to have a conversation about something that has nothing to do with her beauty, nothing to do with what she's wearing, just literally have a conversation with her. She's gonna start to look at me. Yeah. And to try and try to look at me. And then if you when you leave off, whether it's Instagram, phone number, or it just I'll see you again. The universe is going to bring you back around because you're like minded. You're going to go to the same places again, right? It's like, so this is my first drink in almost half a year. A girl, a female who lives the same type of lifestyle as me, we're going to be going to the same places. I see I've met females, and nothing's come about it that I eat lunch by myself all the time. I love sushi. I see females that are on their shit that eat by themselves for lunch all the time. And now we're not strangers anymore. You know, yeah, sometimes we sit next to each other at the bar, nothing comes about it. But we sit next to each other, we have a conversation, we converse about whatever was going on in our lives, right? You see what I'm saying? So it's more or less finding somebody that you're compatible with, you know, not just attracted to Yeah, you know, because that's just an emotion. Yeah, exactly. And I mean, there's there's a lot of gold in what you just said. So many things to pick out. I mean, what you said about just not being the obvious guy who's, you know, falling over his shit and complimenting them. And like, you know, she's gonna hear that so many times. And instead, if you're just taking in, you know, stop for a second, like, look beyond what she looks like, like, what is she doing? What is she looking at? What does she smell like? There's guys are always asking, like, what do I say? I'm like, well, if you're asking, what do you say? You're not watching what's going on. You've seen her, you're attracted to her, you know, you got a little shaky. And now you think you're you're brave for right? IQ drops. Exactly. It's like, be something else than just a horned dog. You don't say it because we're human at the end of the day. If it gets to that point, I guarantee she wants it more than you do. Yeah. Like, so that's, that's, that's a no brainer. Like don't even worry about that. You know what I'm saying? And it's like, that's why I say I hate it's a game, because I really am not playing a game. But this life is chess, not checkers, right? You know, just like with anything, even if I'm if I want to do business with a guy, if I see a billionaire, the first thing that I do, I'm not gonna go talk to him about, oh, what I can do and no, that's not what I want to do. I see it's gonna be immediately turned off by that. It'd be like going up to a girl and being like, I got a 12 inch dick, right? He's like, I don't need your money. I don't like it. I sit next to Mark Cuban in Orlando Magic. You see what I'm saying? The first time I met the conversation I had with him had nothing to do with nothing, like nothing to do with just flirting, male flirting, bullshitting, right? Romance. Exactly. You see what I'm saying? Because you build a relationship, relationships will make people want to help you to be a part of your life. You know, at this, in this world, every people know people, people know that other people are opportunists. And there's not, there's a stipulation that that's bad being opportunist. But if you're not, if you're not trying to carpet DM, what are you doing? You see what I'm saying? But when you're opportunist, and you're just trying to use people and not utilize, and that's another thing. He said that to me, I thought that was cool. He said that to me on the on the right here. Yeah, you're sitting in traffic, you know, you're under right here. And we're having a conversation about how you can easily just waste endless hours in LA traffic. Just, you know, zoned out listening to music, maybe not even listening to music, just in your in your thoughts. And yeah, and you're like, yeah, so right now I'm talking to you. And I'm utilizing I'm not using you. I'm utilizing. And I was like, yeah, that's that's what you know, because we're having a conversation pre podcast and like, you know, getting to know each other. And it's like, and that's it. I wanted to explain because some people don't know, you know, ignorance is bliss. And people take the word ignorance as as a derogatory word. You can use it that way. But it's not we're all ignorant to something ignorance is just the act of not knowing. When you utilize something or someone, I utilize almost everyone in my life. Because when you utilize means that we're both gaining. When you both getting utility, exactly what you use, you're gaining. And you're not you're not thinking of the other person. You don't care what happens to the other person. Yeah. See, in traffic, I knew we're about to do this podcast. I didn't want to be stale. But on the same time, I wanted you to get to know me a little bit before I got on this podcast. So I was utilizing the situation of okay, I got 20 minutes to drive right now. Instead of getting to your your condo and trying to speak real fast to who I am. Let me go ahead and talk to you. Yeah. And let me say fresh totally utilize the situation. Yeah, you see what I'm saying? Yeah. Yeah, it's, you know, I think there's a big difference. And I, and I've noticed this with with really successful guys, is you, you know, that sort of thought process where it's like, Alright, what am I doing with my time right now? Like, it's this consciousness, it's this awareness of, I'm not just going to do the mindless thing. I'm not just gonna like, check out and listen to my favorite radio or like, it's like, no, this is a time of the day where I can be getting something done. Like I can be doing I could be baking a win win situation here. Like, what am I doing? Like, am I doing the like, just asking yourself those questions, you know, and having that having that conscious thought to like to do that. And to understand like, it takes a much deeper level of awareness that that most people kind of go through life with, you know, they're not thinking about that. They're just like doing their old, you know, they're doing their habits. Yeah. And I think it's when I hate using the word success. But when you when you hit, okay, no, I want you success. When you hit a goal that you thought would take you longer than expected. It's like, damn, okay, I hit this goal. I have another goal. But before I can get there, I have to sustain this. How do I sustain this? Like, I wanted a Lamborghini. I got it. But am I making enough money to get that oil change every month? Do you know how much a tire costs on a Lamborghini? A rim costs on a Lamborghini? A fan? How much is the shirt? Well, it's free. The shirt was free. You know what, but actually, technically I damn sure paid for it. Right. You didn't see the little ugly ass hat he gave me too. You know what I'm saying? But at the end of the day, you know, I had a friend. I said, why didn't you buy a Rolls Royce? I was like, dude, no, I was like, the maintenance on that vehicle is six figures. The maintenance on the vehicle, like what do you know what I'm saying? So I feel like this generation has a big FOMO because of the social media of I have a goal and I'm gonna hit this goal. But they're not thinking about how they're going to sustain that once they get to the goal, once they get to the goal, right? Because it's like, okay, like this AP, for instance, I have a friend, you know what I'm saying? He wants AP. He makes that money boom, and goes and buys this. But now what about the rest of his life? Yeah, see what I'm saying? You just put it all into that. Do you have AP lifestyle money? Or did you just buy AP? Right? Did you? Yeah. Did you spend everything you made on the AP? Where do you live? Do you own a house? What's in your account? Like, you know what I'm saying? What's your savings? What do you have here? You know what I mean? So it's just like, when you want a certain lifestyle, you have a goal, but you have to have a way of continuing. And that's another thing, like when people get lawsuits, it happens all the time, people go broke so quick. Yeah, because they change their lifestyle. But yeah, they got all that money at one time, but their life wasn't making that type of money. So they bought all of this. It's like lottery winners. Yeah, they move here. And that money just goes, goes, goes, goes, goes, goes. And then what so what were your sort of financial goals when you moved to LA? And then like, when you hit those, what changed? And what are your goals going forward? Do you look at it as that? Or like, how do you how do you formulate those sorts of thoughts? To me, my financial goals, I can honestly say, I and people will be like, people can take this how they want to, I can say there's, there's never enough for me. And the reason I say that is because my goals, and I genuinely mean this, I love to help people who also love to help themselves, like who has a passion. So the reason why I say there's never enough for me is because I've the fact that I have so many crafts, I see investing into yourself, you continue to grow and grow and grow and grow. So like you can have a small agency, you know what I mean? And then next video, you come into a million dollars and have a bigger agency. But you make three more million dollars and put it into that your agency is okay. Now that's just that. But I also so I want some leather, I can only make 50 bags, I sell those bags and make money. Do I take that money and cash in and go buy another AP? Or do I just put all that money back into leather and suede and gold? Because that's what I made my bags with is suede. You know what I mean? Like I made a bag for future to collab with Supreme. It was actually red Ferrari suede from a Ferrari. Wow. Yeah. And I did my own leather buffalo leather and made my own white cocaine white bag. And I had 10 karat gold zippers. See what I'm saying? I could have taken that money put it in the bank or whatever and just spent it now. Yeah, about another AP. Yeah. Back to the brain. So you know what I'm saying? So I feel like until the day comes that I'm ready just to and I and I like I'm looking at this guy over here on this this this billboard he's a marine marine was in the army. But he can't my dad's had surgeries, all this and that still can't sit down. So when I say there's never enough because I don't think there's ever going to be a time unless Laura's plan tells me you can't do anything else you got to lay down that I'm ever going to stop growing. And as this world continues to grow, finances, I mean, money, nine currency, which comes in many different forms, is what's going to continue to make you grow, right? See what I'm saying? So my when I when it comes to a financial goal, I've already hit my lifestyle. Like, unless my lifestyle won't change unless I'm making that get from a lump sum, unless I'm making like 10 million more dollars, my lifestyle is not going to change. So when you're formulating your goals, are they, my guess is they're not around like the, the money or the financial part, but it's, it's around whatever the, the growth sort of aspect is. No, actually, um, I, uh, you know, contrary to belief it is, um, because right now, it's funny, I'm going to use this analogy, like a woman's body clock, a woman typically wants to have a baby around a certain time, right? Yeah. I mean, past like past 40, you're, you're looking at like major problems, major problems, the statistics of having a healthy baby past 40. My sister just got pregnant. She's 37 and, um, you know, she healthy baby and everything, but like it was close, it was pushing. Right. Yeah. Yeah. So doing, uh, with, with my injuries, even though I'm, I'm doing what I'm doing, I know how I look, how I look. I'm hurting right now. You see what I'm saying? And the doctors, I mean, they've told me straight up, they call me, he, man, they, they say like Leonel, like you do that, but they're like, let's, let's be honest, like you didn't have a fusion. We shaved your disc down, but at some point in your life, you're going to have to have a future. I know that what I'm doing now, there is the, there is an end time of how I'm moving. So in saying that I do have to make enough, a certain amount of money for that next chapter in my life. Got it. You see what I'm saying? Because this page, that's an interesting situation, you know, that's for, for you, because it's like, you've got that shot clock of knowing that like once my back is in a certain point, like those things that I usually do to generate cash and Well, it's just like, they told me straight up what's holding me together. Days that I don't have the best workout or days that I just chill, I heard the worst. Like me moving, I, I, I, I, I feel better if I'm just sitting still, I'm in pain. Interesting. So the more you move, the better you feel? Yes, the more that I move, the better I feel. And, um, I know I'm not going to always be able to move like this. You see what I'm saying? Yeah. So, so within saying that, knowing that I'm not going to be able to move like this, I know that I'm going to have to make a certain amount of money to be able to invest in that next chapter. My book isn't closed. You know what I'm saying? My book isn't closed. Maybe, you know, Harry Potter had all the books, so maybe this book might be closed and I might just be starting another one. Different book. Just a different book. You see what I'm saying? But at the end of the day, wherever there's a chapter, where there's a book, this one right here, one day will be closed. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? I mean, it sounds like you have so many different sources of income and, you know, you've got the bags, you've got- And those things there, those things there are, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, they're, they're gifts to me. They're, they're crafts that, that I was, that I'm able, that I was born with, uh, naturally that I, no matter what craft or gift you were born with, you still have to work on it. So it was something that I acknowledged. I worked on it. Um, not saying I mastered it, but I, I, I took a, uh, I've kind of mastered how to make money from it, but those things don't make me my money money. I say an extra money, but bills, help a mom, son, da, da, da, da, da, da, da. More like a creative project. Yeah. Like I will always do different things. Like I flip homes as well. No, I'm not a real estate agent, but I flip homes. You see what I'm saying? Yeah. So it's like those things there to keep passive income going, but to the next chapter or the next book is going to take a certain, a lump sum of money to make that happen. You see what I'm saying? Not just those little things there, you know, those little things there just to make my life more peaceful. Gotcha. See what I'm saying? You know? So what are you working on next? You have, you said you had a documentary coming out? I have a documentary coming out about my back. Okay. About my back, about the, you know, from the rooters to the tutors, baby. I'm talking about, I even, even my, my first carekeeper fell asleep and I had a blood clot. He fell asleep and wouldn't answer. I was screaming for my medicine. I had to try to get up and get, and I did, I got up and got my medicine myself. He was sleeping. Wow. Yeah. It was terrible. I mean, I have so many recordings in the, in the, I would like, I would be recording this, this old white lady. I could tell she was racist too. I look, she's like, she couldn't find my babies. She put an 18 gauge needle in my hand. I still have a scar there. Still have a lawsuit from that too. Cause an 18 gauge needle, that's a drawing needle. Okay. A drawing needle. That's what you draw. Cause that's a big one. That's the one that they, they, they draw. Draws, draw your blood. No, no, no, no. That doesn't go in your body. That goes into the medicine. Oh, got it. Put it in my freaking hand. Jesus. Yeah, dude. I'm numb, but I'm recording all this and I'm on the, I'm on the, I'm like, y'all, isn't this such a shame? So like the documentary is going to show, and it's not just about the bad. It's going to show. So even you've dealt with a lot of like medical malpractice sorts of things. Yeah. And, and I can honestly say it's even in a documentary, like the obvious racism. Like I'll just do one quick story. It's really quick. The, I was in the, she took me off my IV, but I still had a thing in my arm, but I wasn't connected and they did no TV, no nothing. I'm sitting there for six hours. She said I was discharged. My lawyer was in Encino. The hospital was in Beverly Hills. Long story short, when I came to the hospital security guards, they knew who I was, they wanted my autograph. Hilarious. I'm in pain. Yeah, out of my face. So, but they were cool. They were cool. They were cool dudes. So, you know, she's, she said I was discharged after six hours. I get up and I'm walking. I'm like, and I'm, I'm, I'm speaking for my lawyer. He's like, I'm leaving Encino right now. He's like, I'm coming to Beverly Hills. It was five 30. My lawyer is a very, very, very, very like chill dude. I've never heard, even when he raised his voice, it was still like, now I'm looking back at it, it's kind of like humorous because he's so like that he's not an angry person at all, but he's like, man, I'm an attorney. He's like, do you think that I will be driving at five o'clock from Encino to Beverly Hills, if you didn't tell me that my client was discharged, dude, when I tell you, I freaked out. I knocked out all the computers off the thing. They called the code gray. The lady came through with the needle. I said, listen, guys, I guarantee you right now that needle will be in her before it will be in me. So the security. They like came to like, like tranquilizers or something? Or like the day you went off. Code gray, code gray, code gray. Cause like, then you're like, he's like freaking out, freaking out. I'm in this gown. I'm breaking everything, dude, I'm breaking everything. Like I'm in so much pain, six hours of no medicine, six hours. And then she had the audacity to lie and say, she never said I wasn't discharged. So why did you take the IV out of my arm? Because when you take the IV out of my arms, that means you don't know I'm getting my vitals. So if I'm not discharged, why aren't you checking my vitals? I just had major back surgery. I almost died. You see what I'm saying? Dude, all the computers, all of everything. And the lady's walking down, you can tell like how I'm looking at her and like, I'll show you the pictures. It's so crazy because when I went in there, I was about 40 pounds bigger now when I went in, but because they were feeding me, it was proper food, but because it was so small, I got like so shredded, I got so shredded. You can like see everything and I'm in that gown, but like, and the look of my face, I like a demon, the security guys came and they came around the corner and they got in front of her and they were like, at that point, I didn't care about consequences. I didn't care about anything. I wish she would've got close to me with that valvo needle. She would've been the one trick alive. She would've felt, for the first 30 seconds, she would've felt the best she ever felt in her life. You know what I'm saying? She would've been so, you see what I'm saying? Whatever, the ketamine or whatever. I told them, yeah, I told them, I don't care what kind of surgery I have. I guarantee you, she will not put this in me. You see what I'm saying? So the security guys came and got me, sat me back in the room and she came in and she's like, I never said that, sir. The main lady, the main doctor came in and they were like, okay, we're going to deal with this later, which is a little off suit about it. Because why was this patient off of medicine for six hours? That means I had no food, no medicine. No one was checking on me. You didn't know what my blood pressure was like. I just got out of a surgery from a blood clot. What if I was in there dead? No one came and checked on me for six hours. It's crazy how, like, I hear these stories more often than not, of just like totally negligent, you know, care. And it's not like you're in some shitty facility. Like this is Beverly Hills. If you look at Los Robos, they're one of the three top surgical hospitals. I mean, but this is how it's explained and I'll be completely blunt about it. They say in Beverly Hills, they have the hospital for the athletes and entertainers, and let's be honest, African-Americans are the majority of the entertainment business as far as the athletic side, then they have Los Robos, which I told you is the old white money. So they're looking at me like, why am I in there? Well, it's because of the lawyer that I have. And that's where he says his clients. It doesn't matter that I'm in there. I should still be my freaking my monitor thing. Instead of four wheels, had three wheels. It was a hospital. I mean, it should be. Yeah. What do you want? You see what I'm saying? So it was just like it was it was it was terrible. It was terrible, man. It was terrible. But I also knew that I laugh at it. Sometimes I was like, this is just making me stronger. You see what I'm saying? I know I was I was like, because if I live through this, I was like, y'all not going to be ready for what I hear. You're not even ready for what I hear. And like now I'm still not in completely. I told you, I've been walking a full year, like walking, walking through the full year and I can don't really I'm in pain. You're not that tall either. No, I mean, I've been working since middle school, though. Nice. But the fact that I can do this after surgery. Yeah, I get done. You know what I'm saying? When I'm lifting weight, six, six, one, six, two, it's flat. You're six. OK, yeah, five, six flat. But I'm heavy. You know what I'm saying? You know what I mean? But I can I got used to my on my on my on my Instagram that my first time back in the gym, I'm shooting. So I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm pulling back. Yeah, I'm stepping back from behind the three. You know what I mean? Yeah. Shot, shot, shot. I still got it. You know what I'm saying? So it's just like one of those things that I just feel very blessed that even though I'm in pain, although I'm in pain, that I'm able to still, you know, do the things that I that I love to do. Maybe not at the level that I was doing it before, but I can still do it. Yeah. I mean, that's got to be so tough because I mean, I, you know, sports are my favorite thing. Like I'm an athlete. I grew up playing all the sports I could. And if I you know, that's that's basically if I'm not working, I'm playing golf or I'm playing hockey, I'm I love it. So to I've had one injury and I got you know, I broke my thumb playing hockey, which should happens. Right. But like you couldn't even use your hand like it was like. Yeah, I couldn't I couldn't play hockey for whatever. It was six weeks or something that was and not being able to do that. Like I felt like I went into a depression, you know, I couldn't golf. It's like so I can only imagine being out with a back and being in pain all the time. It's like your hand. So I'm left handed boxing. I broke you see this other boxers go up. Oh, yeah. I broke my pinky completely. This bone like my bone is sort of like this is like this. Yeah, I can see it. You can completely see it looks. Yeah. Around it. Yeah. Like you can see it. So it's like even when that happened, it was like. I can't do anything, you know, and I'm left handed, like, you know what I mean? It was terrible. This my goodness. So you're telling me that when when that happened, too, like you couldn't couldn't couldn't be with girls like you were just totally at that. I could put that to be to be blunt. Only thing I can do is a girl right. Mm hmm. At least you can do that. But no, even if it was the if she was enjoying it too much and it was the wrong way and I boom. Yeah, it was like, oh, you know what I'm saying? Like, and she would understand. Yeah. You see what I'm saying? Because it was like serious. But I must say, you know what I'm saying? I'm yeah, I'm the man. You don't want to. Exactly. No, like I'm the one. I'm the one leaving you dead in the bed. Like you're the one sleep by the time I come back. I'm taking a piss. Right. You know what I'm saying? That's that's how that works, baby. You know what I'm saying? God, the Lord bless me. You know, the Lord bless me. You know what I mean? But that was it was just terrible, man. It was it was terrible, dude. And even in the hospital, this is the medicine they had me on. But we had the nurses that I had. They were young, you know, and a couple of them had a thing for me. And there were some embarrassing times, like there was time that they gave me medicine that it hurts so bad. They blessed me with any of those nurses wiping your ass hot. So check this out. I have a funny story after this, right? So check this out. And I don't even remember this happening. The medicine they gave me on it gave me. Not only did it give me an erection for like three days straight, but it's well be linked in with. OK, when I went to sleep one time, like Viagra. It was like some crazy because like, you know, when they push all that medicine, like it kills your test and kills all that stuff. I know they found Viagra on accident. They were. Yeah, yeah. Accident. But that's why I like it. They have to like keep changing it because your heart. Right. But so the medicine they had me on, you know, it was killing my test. And like, you know, I was breaking out so bad. They had to put me on something else. When they put me on that, my body reacted so crazy on it. Like it's I was like a freaking donkey. Like, you know what I'm saying? So when I like I mean, I went to sleep, you know what I mean? I don't even remember dreaming. I woke up. I mean, I had. I remember all over myself, I had like paper towels, which is really even though my nuts could hold that much. So the two it was two nurses that came in and they were there. They were really hot. And I was really hot. Yeah, no, they were really hot. And they were actually like I was like embarrassed because it was so much like it was it was so much like it was like like, you know what I'm saying? And then like she actually had to like lift me. And she's like, oh, this is heavy. And she like it was so funny. They were making me laugh because like I was actually crying at the time. And she was like in one in one of the nurses. She was like, I didn't think this was possible. And she said, well, this. This was the best part of this night, like they were just making me feel good, but I can tell, like, they were trying to be professional, but at the same time, they were like, and then... They've seen everything, but it's still like, it's so funny. They found me on Instagram. I'll tell you about that later. It was crazy, you know what I'm saying? Now that I think about it, I'm like, can I have some more of that medicine, like whatever that was. And I always say, I always say nurses are like the horniest, some of the horniest women out there. It's like nurses, teachers, flight attendants. They work with annoying people all day that like make their life hell. So they finish work and they just want to, they want to party. All right. So we took a little break. We got a refill. Cheers again. So there was a few things, I forgot where we left off, but one of the things I was super curious about, from a dating perspective, like being, being at the, I don't know if you want to call it celebrity status or being at the, the amount of recognition you're at, like, have, how have you noticed that's changed as you've gotten, you know, more noticeable, more recognizable? And then also we should talk about, you know, dating different cultures and what we were kind of talking about before. So, well, you know, it's, it's, it's an interesting topic because as, as time has gone on, the world has changed so much, especially post-COVID. You know, in living in Los Angeles, you know, people, the way, the way people's morals and the way people's respect for themselves, not people saying that people don't respect themselves, but let's just look at, for instance, stripping men and women. I remember when I was a little kid, if somebody was stripping, they went to a different state town. They didn't want anyone to know that they were doing it. It was like, now it's like, here's my only pants. Here's my, I mean, people have a little bit of a guy, people have stripper poles in their, they're saying at school, that's what they want to do for a living. I mean, you have, not saying there's anything bad, but strippers that are instant famous, like super, super famous and making so much money off of it just from quote unquote selling their body, you know, like, you know, people want entertainment. But to answer your question, it's like, it hasn't even been because of, yeah, it has been because of status, but as this world has transitioned, and again, people are opportunists. People see what they can gain from you. And me being somebody who utilizes the people and different things and aspects in my life, I can tell when someone's just trying to use me. So you're feeling that from women? Yeah. When they're trying to use my life. They see like, okay, he's got X, Y, Z followers. I can, you see the angling there. Like, I can, I can tell, like, and I can tell, like, if we, if we go somewhere, like when your phone is like the kind of pictures they want to take. And like, if they, if we go on a second date or we, or just, just another time, you know, the captions behind the pictures that, that they just want to make it look like that's their lifestyle. I can kind of tell if that, if they're with me just for a good time, or if they're actually just trying to see me. So I sit, I sit back on it, you know what I mean? Yeah, you watch. I don't press on it, you know, because at the end of the day, I know my worth. I know my worth, but I also know that my position can be replaced, but I also know that I'm unique. Yeah. There's only one of me. My position might be replaced, but there's only one of me, darling. That's a good distinction. You can, there's one of you, obviously, you know, your position in her life, right? She can replace that, but you are, you are the only you. I'm the only me. Yeah. You see what I'm saying? Yeah. That's pretty profound. Did you ever struggle with confidence or ever struggle with, you know, anything like women related or? I can tell you, it's not just because of, you know, every, every, every, any guy as a kid who was always a good athlete went through a cocky moment, especially if you're a good looking. Yeah. But with my father being strict as he was, confidence was never an issue for me because before I had to prove myself to the world or a crowd, I had to prove myself to him. Yeah. So I was prepared. Right. Spelling bee, basketball, baseball, football, debating. You weren't even thinking about the other regions. Like, how do I make dad, like? Literally, like, it can be a crowd full of people and like, I'm on the basketball court and like, I'm looking, I'm looking at him. I don't even listen to him coach. Yeah. I'm looking at pops, like. Right. That's, that's so like huge, um, because most of the, most of the guys that I see that really struggle is it's simple. It's a lack of a really strong masculine role model where they grew up, you know? Um, and I struggled a bit with dating. My dad's amazing. He's like the best dude ever. He's not, he's not like what your dad is, how you're describing. He, he, he was like very, whatever you do is perfect. I love you no matter what. Um, extremely easygoing, extremely like kind. Um, and it wasn't until I had like a buddy when I was in like my early twenties, who is kind of that like abusive father figure that I never had, that I kind of needed to be like, dude, you're fat. You're a fucking lazy piece of shit. Like, get the fuck off your ass. Like I was 60 pounds, you know, heavier than I am now. And there was something about that, that like, it wasn't, it wasn't fun, but it's like, it's what I needed. And it's kind of like that whole idea, like metal sharp or diamond sharp as diamond or whatever the fucking quote is metal sharp as metal. Like you need that push that masculine sort of like the real talk, the real push. And I hate, and I'm going to go back in on your question. I don't date. You see what I'm saying? Like if I have a rotation, that's what I have and I'm safe about it. It is a double standard, but a woman is being penetrated. And whether she says she has an emotional connection or not, you have to allow that man, you have to submit to that man. Okay. A man doesn't have to submit to a woman. No. A female has to submit to a man. Unless he's getting pegged. Right. Unless he's getting pegged. Which is all too popular these days. Being in LA, I mean, that's just like, whatever. You were coming from LA. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Like, that's just, it's common, but you know what I'm saying? But it's just like, it is a double standard, but it's true. And when I say I don't date is because it's like, if I'm dating someone, I'm dating someone. I don't date. Because one thing about me, I have a love language. A girl just asked me what my love language was the other day. My love language is not giving. Not giving. Like, you know what I'm saying? Like, random gifts. It's not my love language. Because the way I was raised, like I told you, like we were not, I didn't come from money. You see what I'm saying? So I have a value on of currency. I'm going to stop saying money. I have a value of currency. You see what I'm saying? And I've been in positions where I've spent $20 on flowers and 30 minutes later, all the petals are all over the ground because we got an argument. That $20 could have went in the gas tank. You see what I'm saying? Not saying every once in a while to put a smile on your face. See, instead of, not saying I won't ever do it, but I'd rather give you an experience. Babe, let's go on a cruise. You're off this weekend. You're off this Memorial Day. We're going to go on a three-day cruise. I'd rather do that than spending little $40. Now some people like stuff like that, but it's where I see life because a little $40 here, a little $40 there, a little $6 there, a little $8 there. I could have taken you to Katana and we could have got the big fish. And you would have posted it and told your girls I took you to Katana and da-da-da-da. Or you want this, these little carnations every once in a while. And, oh, but then you're going to sit here and tell me how unhappy you are because we didn't do anything. And you want to go here. See, what gets me is when you do shit like that. And then it's like, okay, now what? You know, I get up with a broke back every day and bust my ass at four o'clock in the morning to do what I need to do. And you're going to be unappreciative. Not saying everyone's like that, but when I say that's not my love language is because yes, I'm tainted from that. But at the same time, I see life in a different aspect. That's just me. Not everyone's like that. You know what I'm saying? Like, I've had a female where she loves to buy cards all the time. And I look on the back of the card, it's only seven bucks. But I look in my drawer and I have like, and you count them up, you've gotten me 300 or something dollars worth of cards. Like, to be honest, I would have rather a small bottle of credit if you were going to buy me something. You know what I mean? But you know, to each his own. But as you say, dating aspect, I'm not out here just dating because one thing's for sure, two things for certain, you don't want to get something you can't get rid of. And, and I could be but about it. I'm not a two pump chump, a pretty pussy. I'm sorry. A pretty vagina. You know what I'm saying? And some nice, some nice rack and a pretty face isn't just going to get me off. You know what I mean? I've been a runway model for a long time, but we're all naked in the background. They're all Victoria's Secret or whatever models. You see what I'm saying? I can look at the Lord put beautiful people in this world. I can look at a naked body right now and still have a soft meat. You see what I'm saying? That doesn't do it for me. You see what I'm saying? Like, when it comes to that situation, we got, we finna get down. And if I'm getting down, you ain't finna be him, him, him, to him. That was just a young man. I can't kiss you when you're no. And I'm not judging you for that. That's just not for me. You see what I'm saying? To answer your question is very easy for me. Now, other guys I've had these conversations with, it isn't because they haven't lived the lifestyle I have. They haven't been in the job and throughout their adolescent years. You know what I'm saying? They haven't had a lot of attention. You know what I mean? And now they graduated college. They have a good job. They're making six figures and they have a little confidence. You know what I'm saying? They're able to buy what they want and live. So now they're going out and they're trying to get girls or out here dating. But it's like, when you're out here dating, I feel like most people, and this is just me. I feel like when you're out here dating, you still don't really know yourself. Because when you're dating, you're trying something out. Yeah. Like if I date somebody, if we break up, we've been together. If we, if something goes wrong, it's like after like three or four months, you see what I'm saying? Like, and that's just because we're not compatible. And that's because we learned we're not compatible. But when people are out here dating, they go on three, four days, they might sleep together and it's over. And I'm looking at like, you know, I don't do it just to impress a female, but I like doing nice things. You see what I'm saying? I like nice dinners. I like, yeah. You know what I'm saying? I like going to basketball games and sitting on the wood. You know what I'm saying? I'm not talking about VIP. I'm talking about on the wood, squeak, squeak, squeak. You know what I'm saying? I like doing stuff like that. And I'd be down if I spend that money on you. And the next night you get by another dude. Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. See, and not saying that hasn't happened, but I don't know about it. You know what I'm saying? But you open with me and tell me that you're dating multiple dudes. Okay. You want to give me the coochie? Okay. I still might get a coochie, but baby girl, you don't come over. You know what I'm saying? I'm gonna order her some food. I like eating good. So I have a couple, a couple of guy friends. They're like, man, when you, when you, you know, I see you with a girl, you spend a lot of money when you out. Listen, I don't spend a lot of money on me. She's my guest. Exactly. Yeah. I'd be spending it anyways. I wanted to go to Boa tonight. Right. And I wanted her on my arm. I wouldn't go to a private dinner at Nobu. She was just on my arm. Right. You see what I'm saying? And they, they got it twisted. They think you're out there trying to impress her. And the thing is we're in 2024. We have kids who are 10 years old, making millions and millions of dollars off of YouTube. Okay. You're never going to be that guy. Yeah. Ronnie James already has made more than $6.8 million in indoor endorsements. Cause you know, they've been, they're paying high school and college kids now that has nothing to do even basketball. You see what I'm saying? How much do y'all say those kids are making? And, and, and it's not, and you see what I'm saying? Because kids are making this much money. So if you're, if you're spending money to try to impress a female, you're, you're spinning your wheels because I hope that's the narrative that you continue to have for the rest of your life. You see what I'm saying? Because you're wasting your money. Like you're literally wasting it. You're throwing it away. Because you're going to spend that money and she's going to be like, Oh yeah, I have to go to work tomorrow. And you're going to drop her off. Just like, I don't understand. I mean, some, like I said, to each his own, I've been to strip clubs. I don't throw money in a strip club. Cause what you're going to leave the strip, you're going to throw all that money and leave the strip club with a hard day. That's all you're going to leave with. I've been to the Rhino in Vegas too many times, too many bachelor parties, nothing good happens. And if you do meet a girl in there that worked there and you wait outside and she leave with you, that's your ass, the police come. So you don't do all that money and leave with a hard day. And guess what the dudes that are throwing money, it's nothing but a competition about going back and forth. Who's throwing the most? Who's got the biggest dick? I got money to throw. And those girls know. They're just like, well, look at these guys. Come on. Yeah. That's their job. Exactly. They want it. Yeah. That's, that's their whole thing. Their job is to get you to fall in love and spend more money. And these guys are like, Oh my God, there's a connection there. That is their job. I'm not saying they're bad for that. I'm not calling judging you for that. That is their job to make you feel good. Right. It's a strip club. I will go in there. If I do with my friend and get a drink, you know what I'm saying? I'll talk to a girl. There's, there's been times that a girl says you want to dance. I'll throw her $20, $40. I'll throw her, give her $24. And they sit there and talk to them. Sure. I was in Tampa. That's my favorite thing to do at a strip club is to just talk to the girls and like ask, you know, grill about their game and like, yeah. And she's half naked. This is a good conversation. Yeah. You get what I'm saying? I don't want to dance. I want to talk. First of all, you're sticky. You smell like Victoria. Don't tell nobody. You see what I'm saying? I don't know. Don't do not sit on me. Touch me. He was just sitting on him and touching him. He was fresh off of work and construction working all day and plumbing. And he just came in here smelling like yesterday. Do not sit on me. But at the same time, you look good girl. And I want to know, I want to know your story. Are you here? Oh, you're putting yourself in college. Oh, I see why you're here. You know what I'm saying? I'm judging for what you're doing. Right. You know what I mean? But at the end of the day, you are not finna catch me coming in with a bunch of Nazi. I'm going to spit some free game right now. A lot of guys see these rappers and athletes, you know, when they have these big bag, duffel bags of money and all these ones, see I run with these guys, just like I bulletproof my cars. They get the right head off on their taxes. You see how Oprah and Ellen, they always give out stuff at the end of the show. They get the right that off on their taxes. See, they get to say how much those receipts were. When those rappers go to those strip clubs, they don't say that they were hosting. They don't say that, but they were. So when they, when they're, when they're on that job, and they take out all that money and throw it, that was part of the job. That's the write-off. So now they're looking like some crazy ballers, right? Like Drake throwing $500,000 in the air, looking like a crazy baller. But Drake just wrote off almost a million bucks. Wrote it off. And then he got the video and then that video. Got the content, got the look, got the everything, got the girls popping that ass. All that. And he just wrote it off. Yep. But then you catch the dummies out here trying to keep up with the Joneses. You're using your real cash dummy. Yeah. That's gone. That's pre-tax money too, by the way. Yeah. Pre-tax. And if that girl ever seen you, she would not recognize you. And if you've seen her and be like, I seen you at your job, she's really going to tell you to get away from her. Yeah. You just approached me and you approached me because you met me at the club. You just approached me and you approached me because you met me at my job. Yeah. You're getting me tuned for that. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly. Like, so you get what I'm saying, though, you know what I mean? So it's just like, yeah, it's, um, I mean, what you were telling me earlier about the, you know, the guy who's renting your, uh, Lamborghini and he's writing it off because it's bulletproof and now it's a security service. Yeah. Yeah, man. But dating scene out here, um, you know, just because I don't date. What you said, what you said is very profound. And I say this all the time. It's like, when you hit a certain level, you just don't date. Like, I don't even, I tell my clients, don't even use the word date. Don't tell girls are taking them on a date. Don't talk about dating. Like just say we're hanging out, we're doing a thing. We're going somewhere. Like there's no remove dating. It's just, it creates that, that, um, what's the word? Like it makes it so formal, right? Look, there's been so many girls, not saying I put them on a pedestal, but not, not girls that I've been trying to, like I said, I trained a lot of mostly females and I have a certain level of respect for them. Not saying I lose that respect, but they're like, yeah, I'm dating a few guys right now. And I'm like, girl, you're getting fucked by that. You're just pretty much saying you're fucking a few different guys, right? Exactly. You're not dating him. He's, he fucked you once. And you're just going out on, you're going out and you're hoping he fucks you again. Right. I'll take you somewhere else. Exactly. He's on Valentine's day. You're getting three gifts, right? Cause you're fucking three different dudes. Like that's what I just heard. Because the girls don't realize this. They, they think, you know, they think, Oh yeah, I'm dating this guy. It's like, no, you didn't see it. I told you I'm very into with women. Me and my mom, I'm going to show you. I have a picture side by side. We're almost symmetrical. It's really actually kind of scary. Like I'm going to show you, it's kind of weird. I, one time I put it on my story, I took it off. It's where we're almost symmetrical. Yeah. And, uh, we pretty much are, eyes, nose. Like we have side by side. It's like folded. Crazy. Weird as shit. I almost want to show you right now. Um, but like the, like there's when girls, when, when, when girls say that, I talked to my mom, I'm very in tune with women. And it's like, in this day and age, it's because the, the, the moral, the moralistic like factor of this world, like what it used to be, women are supposed to be this prize. You know what I'm saying? Like they don't just give it up. They have such a tainted feeling with men. Now they're just like, shoot, if I want it, I want it. And if they're going to give it to me, they're going to give it to me. Like, you see like girls be like, if a guy's not taking me here, like, we're not about to do this. Like he's into this type of restaurant or this type of, or he's buying me this. And it's entitled ridiculous demands. Well, I mean, the, the sad thing is it's a lot of the time that's their reality because there's so many guys willing to do that. And they're just making it harder for everybody by simping like that, but to say it guys that come from money from here and people from different countries with money, they come over here because, you know, like I said, I'm also, you know, I have my residency in Dubai. They live by a different creed. They come over here and it's like a free for all, you know what I'm saying? They don't have their family. They don't, their family doesn't know what they're doing. Judging them. So like I used to have a, a, uh, I had an Airbnb business, um, prior to, I still have it, but it was a big, a bigger business and we would rent out a bunch of places in the Hills. And one place in particular was just like amazing party pad, five bedroom place, Doheny and sunset. And every summer we'd get the Saudis coming over. They'd rent the place for three months straight and they would just party. They'd, you know, they fucking bring in tigers and lions, just going crazy. Like they didn't give a shit what, you know, 30 K a month, whatever. No big deal. Yeah. Well, money just different kind of money. Yeah. Way different. You see what I'm saying? They come over here and they're like, I can do this. I can do this. I can do this. Like everything's yeah. Yeah. Like these safe websites. I can do this girl. Like what? Like, you know what I'm saying? Like, so they're just like, so these girls realize, you know, I can make, I know so many girls that, excuse me, that make money that just go on dates with guys. That's their job. Yeah. When I say dates, I'm not talking about sleeping with them. No. Go out to eat. Right. Like these men have so low self-esteem, their money is their only self-esteem, right? So it's like they're literally paying this girl 50,000, $1,500 to go out to eat with them because they want to look like that guy because when they see a guy like me and that they want to poke their chest out, well, dude, you're out of shape and you're ugly. And she's 23 and beautiful. I can tell she's not with you because she likes you. There's no real connection. Yeah. At all. Dude. Right. You're going bald. Like, you know what I'm saying? Like, yeah, it's, it's, it's so obvious when that happens. Yeah. She's not with you for, but here's the crazy shit. There's dudes now, like you see all these OnlyFans models, right? Like they're, these girls are making a lot of money and the guys know they're not talking with those girls. They're talking with a guy chatting for the girls. There's now like, I've got the data on this. I do the research. I've got, you know, people who are running webcam studios in Montenegro and stuff like that. They're like, there, there are guys paying for OnlyFans girls. They know are AI bots. Yeah. There's literally a guy sitting there saying, I'm going to give money to this robot who's pretending to be a woman and I'm going to have my, my connection with her. I'm going to, I'm not going to date because I feel like I have no chance. Dude, did you hear about the number? The number one, uh, OnlyFans girl was a real girl who made herself an AI. Looks like her, but she made an AI. So all the new, all the stuff she's doing, is it really her? She's not doing it. She started off, she did post a naked picture, but it was, it was very provided her legs were open so you could see everything. But from that one picture, she's made a million videos, a million other pictures as a bot. Wow. And guys will pay for this knowing it's a bot. She's the number one. She's the number one. And she doesn't, she's not even taking, she's not even doing it anymore. Right. Yeah. It's just shocking to me that, that that's a market and it's a growing market. Like crazy, growing like these girls, they don't have to work anymore. And it's not crazy to me. It just dawned on me. It's not. And I'm going to say this, I'm going to speak to the camera to all the women who want a good man, a good man. There's going to always, it's going to be issues. There's going to be problems. And this is for, and I call you women because I'm 32. You're not a little girl. You're a lady. You're a woman. When you want a good man, the main thing that he wants, the main thing is peace. He wants to be able to come home and not argue. He wants to be able to work and not argue or have a headache about his wife being upset with him or his girl being upset with him. A man wants peace. I'm not saying men are perfect. I'm not, I'm not speaking about us right now. I'm talking to you ladies who want a good, solid man. Everybody as a human being has demons as a human being. We can all do wrong. We can all do right. And we all have triggers. Men lie, women lie, people cheat. When you're in a, if you're in a relationship, most people are scared to break up. It hurts. Breakups suck. Most people say leave before you cheat. But majority of people don't because leaving hurts. People are scared. And when you leave a relationship, especially if you live together, your entire life is changing. So people cheat for a peaceful situation at the end of the day. It's not a bad thing at that time, but it's just masking. Like if I took a Percocet right now to mask the pain out of my back, I didn't fix my back. I just masked the pain. That guy went and slept with another woman because he wasn't turned on by you because he wasn't at peace. It's not justified at all. I'm just giving you the reason. Now there's other things that women want, but that's not what I'm speaking about. To really bring that as I've learned, I've done wrong. I've done right. But one thing that I've learned, and I can say I've learned it because I've turned down some beautiful, beautiful women. Because at the end of the day, when you go through things, one, one small disagreement, even if it's a small argument, what it turns into is a not, if it turns into a non-peaceful life, if my day is going on and I can't, and my photo shoots, I can't even get into a photo shoot because I'm, my face is all scrunched up because I'm, that's not what I need. Yeah. We, if we can't discuss something and if we can't talk about it or talk about it later and come to some type of, I don't want to say agreement, but some type of solution, then we might, we must not be compatible, you know? And like I said, every day is not going to be sunny and roses. And there's going to be some dark ass days. But at the end of the day, a man wants a peaceful home. Because when I said, if you want a good man, right? I don't care how much money you have. You can have, you can be a successful woman all you want. And most, a lot of women these days say men are intimidated by successful women. That's not it. A lot of women that have become successful become, I am women. I don't need a man. And even when they do have a man, they want to be the voice. They want to be the alpha. But let me tell you something. If you're with the alpha man, you will never roar louder than him. You will never be able to walk in his shoes. Michelle Obama, she is a powerful, powerful woman. Obama said he would never be where he would or where he was without her. But at the end of the day, like a deck of cards, there's a king and there's a queen for a reason. And you want a good man. I don't want to say allow him because you don't allow anyone, but let him be the man. Your voice can still be heard without all that alphaness and all that toughness. You make your money, girl. Congratulations. You make your money. We going to have fun together. But at the end of the day, a man wants to be, and it's going to be a man. And the women that say that, that been are intimidated by them. There are some men that are intimidated by them. I haven't met a real alpha man. Right. But a real man, a real man that you think is intimidated by you. He's not intimidated. Turned the fuck off. Yeah He's turned the fuck off That's what he is Because when you're walking around here talking about how much money you make and you don't give a shit and this and that Okay, you're this boss and you're this and that but get a flat tire who the fuck you gonna call your man So have you read? Um, david data way of the superior man? No, I haven't read it I had started listening to it on audio, but I didn't finish it. So he talks a lot about feminine versus masculine energy And I feel like what we see today and what you're speaking to is these women who have embodied their masculine and they've Essentially decided I am so masculine. What do I need a man for and there's no man who can do the but They're going against if they are if they are inherently a feminine sort of energy, right? Because you know They haven't transitioned yet Exactly you don't like you don't the When if you are inherently feminine and you spend all your time and you're masculine you're going to be incredibly unhappy right, like if if i'm doing feminine things all the time, like if i'm doing things that Are like for for me like what so the way he describes like masculine versus feminine It's feminine energy is is more about like you think about the ship On the water the ship crossing the ocean masculine energy is going from point a to point b Feminine energy is the ocean the chaoticness the beauty the danger everything crazy and unexpected that could happen right when i'm on my ship and i'm going i'm doing that thing that I want to do that I know is Making me a better man. I feel good, right? and Someone who's got a feminine energy when they're doing that thing. They might not feel good about that. They're gonna be more Feeling better, you know Whatever the fuck they're doing, right? and That's what you're seeing is these women who are like they're they've taken on this masculine role And they're really unhappy about it and they're pissed off about it It's like use it against you Yeah, and they and they're they're saying like well I can be like but you don't want to be that woman Like you don't actually want that because it's not lying. You're attracted to me Of who I am i'm an alpha male I don't want to be with the alpha male. I want to be with the lady Yeah, and let me tell you something it's about to be 2024 you make your own cheddar that's even better You see what i'm saying? Yeah, we can live a beautiful life. But when you're trying to be as alpha as I am That's not gonna work Because again, I say I don't want to be with a male alpha male at the end of the day If you had to throw down who's winning the fight? Like I said your tire goes flat inside the road unless you call roadside service roadside service Which is probably gonna be a man that shows up, right? You're gonna call me no, but ladies and i'm and I mean this from my heart. I'm not speaking about I'm, not saying every woman is like that that is successful. I'm not saying every woman that makes her own money uh is anti-man and uh, I am woman i'm saying majority of what Is being put out there and what we're seeing on social media Where men speak about i'm just i'm i'm giving some game about what some good men speak about and what what turns them off about uh, very successful women these days It's because this aggressiveness this alphaness That a man wants a lady. I want a lady. I don't care if you made zero. Well, I do care But But If you had a regular job or you had a very top corporate job where you work in entertainment business at the end of the day I want you to be my lady Not someone who's in competition with me I don't want so I don't want us to go out to eat and people look at us like uh, uh, uh business allies Like you're you're my like cfo when i'm the c no, I don't want it to look like that I want you to look like the lady on my arm. No matter I want when we go out. Nobody knows your financial status You look like I take care of you regardless Because your financial status and your business that's your business and our business in our household for our future in our lifestyle When we go out you don't have to walk with your chest poked out because you got this Job and only men have this job, but you're the only lady in there. I get it You have a lot of odds against you but when it comes to the person you're supposed to be in love with or spend spend what your your your home time with I'll i'll bring the analogy to my father He was in the military in very racist times And he had to set a certain narrative at home And this is personal But you know what? My father brought that home And guess what happened? He lost his family You see what i'm saying how'd that transpire because all the Aggressiveness all the anger all the the racism he had to deal with at home He had to conduct himself in a certain way at his job To keep his job. He was high ranked He was high ranked And when he got home, he took it out on us, right, you see what i'm saying a female who like Who's in the office in the white house or whatever like that and she's the only lady at that table. She has to be tight Because there's a bunch of testosterone in the room and she's estrogen But when you bring that home There's where the problem lies, right You see what i'm saying totally because now you're not being my lady, right you're being this alpha Who you're wearing a mask who you're wearing a mask and if i'm mad if I even match you First of all, if I match you it's going to be unmatched And if I go further now, you're saying i'm going too far. Yeah You see what i'm saying? It's like leave that Leave your business to your business if you have to be that alpha woman at work by all fucking means Yeah, that's what you got to be. That's your that's what you have. That's your job. That's your role If you have to be that alpha woman at that round table But when it comes to that dining room table Yeah You're my lady my wife my woman and the mother to our children They don't need to be looking at you and looking at me and saying who's daddy When we go to a restaurant, I mean damn you order my drink I mean if you order my drink when I go to the bathroom to be nice, that's one thing But when you're at the bar and he goes what you guys like to drink? Yes. I want to uh, no chill out right Okay, because if that's what you want to do You can either go find someone else or you can order your drink by yourself you see what i'm saying, I didn't invite you out here because At the end of the day no matter how much money you make you're still gonna want me to pay for the check Totally right, you see what i'm saying? So at least give me at least give me the satisfaction of being the man here. Yeah But like, you know what i'm saying? Like but you know what I mean? Yeah So and that's just what it is, you know, I mean so you see Well, i'll say this and i'll fix the light you see a lot of guys um myself included before I came back like There we're in the situation where it's really hard to find a feminine woman in the states, you know, um And you see the guys like leaving and going elsewhere for that. Um Any thoughts on that? Yeah, i'm gonna i'm gonna die. See there's so much And this generation that we cannot say And leave it broad because In this generation it was a lot of babies having babies And what I mean by that There's so many people that are 32 that their parents are only 50 You see what i'm saying It's just you'd be younger than that. So one of my best friends has uh He was a grandfather at age 42 see so like What i'm saying is that the kids didn't get raised with with certain I don't I hate to say it morals, but with certain uh morals and attributes to know that to certain things so Go ahead and say your question again How'd you say how'd you so it was effectively that like you see a lot of a lot of guys Leaving the states and dating elsewhere For the reasons that you mentioned right? It's very hard to find a woman. Who's who's feminine and like effectively not going to try to To compete against you on a masculine level and it's like why would I play that game here? When I could see here's the thing First thing in the morning before people check their voicemails emails anything. What do they do hop on social media? Okay, they hop on social media and they see The people that they follow And the women that they follow they decide it down their man pays for everything. They live in good Well what they don't see Is that that man is a very rich man who's an athlete and who knows what's going on behind closed doors? He's cheating on her left or right if he's whooping her ass who knows Yeah, you see what i'm saying? And who knows what her financial status is? Are you who knows if they're in debt? You have no idea, but you see the exactly that you just see the the highlight curated exactly so when you say to find a just a feminine female, it's because Women are saying these days and I mean they've told me we've had conversation Why am I going to do that when he's just going to do this or you know what i'm saying He's going to do this regardless. So what's the point? Yeah, you know what? I mean like that and that's how they're really feeling because they're looking at their phone and they're like Well, if she can just chill and he paid for that I can do it too. Yeah, why not? You see what i'm saying? Why would I do anything? It then goes back to the conversation that we have the out-of-towners or the people that inherited money that Follow that creed So if a woman even just like they say a pit bull gets a taste of that blood You know what i'm saying? Yeah, if a woman gets a taste Of a man just giving stuff to her and she her life is free like that If she wasn't raised with those certain morals that are embedded in her She's gonna go with the the flow and eventually with and what people don't realize Even these women that are selling their bodies look at people even doing porn they're crying their eyes out at night I've interviewed a few of them. You see what i'm saying? Yeah I know I know some retired porn stars right now very young Very very young who are millionaires that are they there's a girl she she doesn't even have sex anymore right now because she looks back first of all, she can't even type her name in without just I mean just look and she feels Now that she's out of it because in the time she was young making money. She was horny, whatever Yeah, now that she's a tad bit older She feels so degraded. Yeah, like and I know we're on a podcast i'm gonna be blunt you type in her name and You go to images and it's just her face was sperm all over Sure. Yeah at the time. She probably thought oh look how sexually liberated I am. Look how cool this is I don't get money. I don't conform to those rules. I have these followers exactly people like me. Yeah, but now everywhere you go People are looking at you in a certain light. You don't walk into a room with respect You know i'm saying just because you have that much money people aren't respecting you. Yeah They're they're they're looking at you and like people are making comments and it is it might not even be like Negative comments like look at it might not even be like that It might be like oh come here, baby Like you getting holla that all the time because people looking at you having sex on the internet every day You see what i'm saying so it's it's like it's so sad that this generation has been exposed to so much And and and currency comes with it. That's that's the problem That currency comes with so much exposure right of doing of doing I don't want to say nothing But not even not a skill set by effectively selling entertainment yourself So what did kids want to be when they grew up like 20 30 years ago? Everyone wanted to be an astronaut, right? That was like the coolest thing I want to go to the moon. I want to leave this planet. That's like the most respected I've never said this but you know, some people say they want to be a police officer You see what i'm saying, right? I'll never say that ever but you know, but like some people say that I want to be a firefighter now when a kid say that I want to be a youtuber Yeah, that is the most sought after job for like age 10 for tweens, you know 10 till 13 like they they did a study the other day and like that is you know, they china the u.s that people want to be youtubers that is the The and it's like you can throw plungers. You can you know make podcasts whatever but I never wanted to be an influencer. I just I mean people ask me why on my bio I say entrepreneur not influencer I say because There's people out here that are just content creators. They get up in the morning and they're just creating content And they're influencers I have i'm an entrepreneur because i've lived many different lives. I've done many different things I make money. I make currency many different ways, but I have an influence right, so To meta you see I showed you they paid me twice yesterday So meta i'm an influencer But Lc I say i'm an entrepreneur who just has influence on people, right? if you're doing your job well as an entrepreneur, you Clearly have influence and you have you have the ability to you know, get people to to follow whatever you're working on Exactly. So you can enroll people in your vision and your projects. It's like people like this generation No, people really haven't broken it down. Are you an influencer or do you have influence? Yeah, which one? It's a good distinction too. Yeah, like if you have influence you now you have the ability To to master your craft and become something so great But you're looking at instagram tik tok and all this stuff You're seeing people making easy money just from their iPhones and that's what you want to do You see what i'm saying? And it's and it's so sad people don't want to you know The allure is I get to make money doing something easy and the reason why it's sad though is because You can go out of style real quick and people don't My generation we don't realize how much time's passed about like i've been in other since 2016 Like time has gone by like this. I'm 32 now. It's seven and a half years. I'll be 40 years old If I didn't have other crafts or practicing other crafts, let's say my instagram did get shut down for real If that's all you got you're fucked Completely. Yeah, you have you haven't practiced another craft in years, right? And that's what you see with so many of these, you know female influencers, right they've built their entire everything on On instagram and you see what instagram's doing is, you know, they Effectively used young beautiful women to grow the platform and now it's like oh you posed in a bikini That's that's sexually explicit. We're gonna shut down your shit. We'll change our terms Yeah, we'll shut you down They don't even know the fucking terms, right? You asked an employee in instagram. You think they know the terms no way but terms Yeah, it's it's fucked like because like these women they built everything on this and the crazy part is every platform has different terms Like so this is a crazy part meta bought face our instagram, right facebook boys So I do I like i'm a foodie also, so I do reels for restaurants So on instagram, I put a song On the and it made complete sense with what I was doing And I have it set to it shares automatically to facebook facebook sent me a message sending me a warning saying that I was going against their terms and conditions Because I had that song on there and i'm like all I did was share it I like like it's combined but the terms of condition on facebook are different are different Like on live on instagram, yeah, you can have music playing in the background whatever like that on facebook I don't like some people want to have music with their but Like I can't even go on live in a gym on facebook because they have music playing in the background right So the terms and conditions are so different for things and so I have to drop the hat yeah, and they do that on purpose, of course, you know because it That benefits them because they can just Listen I have a couple people that are actors right now that are looking for jobs. You know, how long the strike has been going on. Yeah so the crazy part is it's like These networks They're still getting paid off of reruns From commercials all this and that yeah, and they don't have to pay these actors or these writers So they're still making money You see what i'm saying? Yeah, so it's like these companies and these big these big these big industries It's like they are making money off of people And if you're putting all your eggs in one basket It can be a very scary day Ahead. Oh, yeah Very scary day ahead and that's why I have so many different endeavors. Yeah, like people like right now If shit hit the fan, I know I can sell Two of my vehicles and i'm I I can i'm back You see what i'm saying? And it's just like You know, even when it comes down to jewelry i'll have diamonds in my necklace in my in my my bracelets but my watches They're all plain jade So I can resell them because you go to a jeweler with a bust down ap he's not gonna want that Why because those diamonds were set customly You see what i'm saying? He might give you some money for it, but it's not gonna be what you want You see what i'm saying? So at the end of the day, it's like you i'm not saying everybody has to have a More than one endeavor, but if you Are not working a nine to five if someone's not writing you that check every week or every two weeks well, what you're saying is is important because You know if you just play the I want to be a youtuber game And you build your youtube to a couple million subs and you monetize it And then you say the wrong thing and then they shut down your youtube. You're you're done. You're fucked right because you're a youtuber like Just the idea when I heard that I was like fuck youtube like fuck youtube For two hours Like i'm away from my family out here in los angeles I haven't felt that sick in my stomach Since the day I left When my shit was shut down My videographer he's he's major like he does for you know, really major people When he looked at me and said he's he's nigerian. He said But I don't know what to say when you're When your brother tells you that when he's not like, oh, you're gonna be good man. Don't worry about that Yeah, but he looks at you for real and says Dude, I don't know what to say Because they sent me two messages one. They said you've been suspended and the other one said It has been deactivated and cannot be restored I said We were at breakfast dude, I think this is youtube no instagram, okay I didn't even eat. Oh, yeah, I was like it when it said cannot be restored, right? my mind would instantly go to like Even if I reposted stuff like I have stuff from years like the comments of people. Yeah So then I wrote them and they said they restored it it was deactivated on accident What the fuck On accident on accident. So for two hours, so right now Oh my god I'm going on live and people are like Resharing my stuff for me because once that happens It's shadow bands you for a little bit like people are even some of my friends like they're like you posted today I was like, yeah, you know what i'm saying? Like you have to get it back going again But man for two hours I was so sick Like I I didn't even know like what to do. Like why am I gonna go to gym? Like I don't even know what to do like Yeah, it'd be like someone like ripping off an arm or two. You know, it's like what what what the fuck do I like? and it's so Here's the shittiest thing about it. You can't call anyone like you can't you can't give him a call and say like what happened? It's it's like these This thing that doesn't even exist email meta and hope they write you back. They hope they shut down my um, My meta like advertising account. Yeah for I don't know what and You know and I get emails from meta that are like so that they said they restored it four years later I Emailed them and said like hey, can you can you restore it? And then they answered and they said yeah Can you restore it and then they answered and they said yeah, we we don't even know why we shut it down But now I get messages from meta that i've responded to that I obviously didn't respond to that say your account's been deactivated shut down and then I check and it's not And and i'm like what's going on here? This is from the meta direct You know facebook messenger message and then it says I responded i'm like what like all of this Stuff is fucked It's to the point where it's like that's when that happened I said, okay like How recent was that Not not even two weeks ago really oh shit, that's what I was saying like I'm going live now people are like really trying to help me get my stuff back because I did like shadow banned me like you Know what? I'm saying? Like like he typed in my thing and said user not found I was like, oh my yeah You know what i'm saying? Right? I might as well just hang it up and just go to flipping houses and Sell my vehicles get a practical vehicle and some jet skis and buy a house in florida You know get a couple some chickens and plant some some collard greens You know what i'm saying? Open up pop eyes. Yeah. Yeah, seriously like you know what i'm saying? Like like it's it's crazy how Social media has taken over This world like turn on the news right now the people's handles are down there Yeah, true. Look at the dancing news guy. He's like famous not from being a news guy from dancing Like do you see what i'm saying it's like like you're talking about doing the plunger Yeah, it's like I mean you you ask it's like so there's obviously value in like entertainment yeah, right and there's there's value in in those things, but like I mean I guess if if we look at where things are going with ai and if Ai can effectively do a lot of the jobs that we were previously doing You know, what are people going to spend their time doing is that making? I recommend everybody because at the time we thought it was like I don't want to say stupid. I hate use the word stupid But very um fictional If if anyone has any just free time and you're bored go back and watch iRobot Will smith, right? Yeah, I don't think i've watched it. I'll watch it. I'll be the first one dude Like it seems so far-fetched. Yeah, because like at first they were just robot but then like they had their own brain I have this thing on it was on instagram like The guy asked this robot like should we be scared about what's going on? And he was like Yes, I know I said no you shouldn't be scared but You should be aware that in the future robots will have their own emotions and like it was like because we're making these robots that are tapping into the database that Every keyword every website everything more knowledge than we have so that we're going to type in That's going through There that's what they are. Yeah, they are but we were to type it in ask It was pretty cool. Um earlier today one of my clients he uh he essentially programmed A he gave chat gpt a bunch of different commands and he got it to respond Like a beautiful woman would respond to a guy trying to pick her up at a bar and he said if You know a true alpha you're going to respond this way but if he's a beta simp who's pretending to be an alpha you respond this way and It did and it did he worked it worked. Um, you know, there's some changes that need to be made but like I mean once you embody that thing right now, it's just a something you can talk to right through through You know the internet but like once it's actually an embodied thing, right? Like now that thing is A force to be reckoned with I mean look All the way down to trashman The garbage guys Look how many jobs were lost because now These trucks have the arm to pick up the trash can and put it in Before you had guys you got those guys. Yeah guys They don't need them anymore Yeah Once this ai thing Gets more than it is we are going to be like They're going to be us and we're going to be like the the old them trying to catch up right? Because they have information that we don't yeah, I mean it's you know if From the interviews i've heard with guys like musk or yeah, you know bezos or whoever, you know They they all say the same thing. Like I hope the robots are nice to us Uh, you know, we hope we can program them in a way that they don't see us as useless and they don't dispose My question really is why are we doing this? Well, I think it's greed-based like whoever can get to the goal post fast enough is gonna get the richest and I get that like That part I understand What's the justification? Like why are we doing this? I feel like it's one of those things where Like you're not going to be able to stop innovation and I don't think Humans have the capacity to like reason beyond. Okay. Yeah There's only like so far out in the future you can reason behind right and you have all these other drivers of You know personal ego greed, whatever it is It's like I want to get I want to design the first robot that's smarter than a human everyone Like who if that's the game you're playing if you're an engineer if you're musk like you want to win that game But you're not thinking well, is that well, hopefully you are but if you haven't looked at all the different You know All the different like decision trees where that could go wrong where programming that robot could lead to the demise you know, that's yeah, people are worried about that singularity when that inevitably happens because I mean if you think about it it gets scary because like if it gets to the point where we have to Now go against the robots, right? They're a robot like you see if you watch our robot what you haven't seen You've seen those dogs by boston dynamics, right? Yeah Dude, you can kill it because there's another one who cares Jason, zorillo at the something is a super when he did his his uh, his his performance. He had dogs robot dog. Yeah Like you know what i'm saying like you shoot it with a bullet it's metal like what like what's gonna happen It's gonna keep coming It's what And then it's just like people are getting Desensitized with human connection like we're talking about the girl with the ai he's talking to this girl Yeah, well what you're gonna see soon. I mean, I feel they already have this they've got a brothel in germany Where you can sleep with dolls, you know, and as soon as those dolls They've had that for four years. But as soon as those dolls are capable of Tricking a guy into thinking there's a real connection there Why would that guy ever? Bother with dating if he can get the same sort of payoff if he can convince himself I mean, that's that's a big leap, but we already see that happening. Like if he can convince himself that like This is just as good then Well, and when you say convince i'm going to be completely honest and again ladies i'm not talking about every woman out there Relationships because of, because of life is getting so hard, it's getting less and less more peaceful. Oh, I'm glad you brought that up. I wanted to talk about that, but yeah. Getting less and less more peaceful. And you know, people not being at peace leads to so many different things. People leading towards drugs, people getting addictions, all forgive me saying drugs. I'll put it in a broad statement, people going to addictions for peace. Yeah. For a peace of mind to be like, I'm not worried about that. Right. So I can just take his Xanax and have peace. Yeah. Take his Xanax and just be chill. And take a perc and be chill, shift some lane and be chill. So when this dog can make this guy, when this dog feels like flesh and can, and make this guy feel a connection and never bring him any drama. Bring him the peace. In the world. Why would he do anything else? You see what I'm saying? Not every guy would feel that way, but a lot would. A lot would. Yeah. Especially if they're upset and disgruntled with dating and the options out there. I would never meet this guy, but when I hear, when I speak, I speak to a lot of men, you know what I'm saying? Like for, not just advice. I like to hear people's story because I live different lives so I can relate to the good and the bad, bad from the good. Yeah, man. You know, my second marriage went like, what? Oh, you're saying, cause you're, you're married now. So you were talking about your second marriage. Right. So you were married three times. Like you're not even talking about the first one, like you're talking about the second one. So it's like guys are going through all these relationships and spending all this money when they can. And then they're like, I can just go over here and have a connection with this thing and never bring me a drama. I don't have to spend as much time. And it's like people are going to get so dissatisfied. I mean, look at when COVID happened, even, you know what, when the kids had, when COVID happened, kids couldn't go to school. It was getting really bad because they were just playing video games that were inside. They weren't having connection with other kids. They were getting very, uh, autistic. Yeah. Like, yeah, pretty much. Don't have like their personalities are going downhill. You know, they're like, they're not sociable. They don't know how to, they're like, they can't look at you in the eyes. Yeah. They like, if you don't need those social skills, like, why would you bother? So it's, uh, yeah, it's, it's, it's kind of like scary where it's going, of course. Um, and what you said about bringing peace, you know, it's, it's interesting. Um, the guys I know who are very, very successful and confident when it comes to women and, you know, with their love life and all those things, they all, they're all looking for peace guys who are not are looking for adventure. Go out, get the adventure. You're going to want the peace at the end of the day. Right. It's like, right. Um, and now I see so many guys subscribe to like Andrew Tate and those, you know, those are all guys are like, Ooh, I want that adventure. I want that thing. I want, you know, it's like, I want to drive the Ferrari. You drive the Ferrari 10 times. You're like, okay, it's cool. But right. It's not like you don't get that same. Right. Right. And then, but at the end of the day, it's like, yeah, you want peace. You want, you want your life to work. You want to not focus on that all the time. You want to, you have other things that are going on. You got other hobbies. Like, you know, you got your sewing at your bags, you got your different businesses. It's like, you need those things. And if you know, your woman's not bringing you peace, it's like, what's the why? Honestly. And it's like so many men, it's like, and if you're not capable of, like, you, you've got to do the job to get her to be peaceful. Like you have to be that masculine energy to get her to relax into her feminine and actually be peaceful. Cause if you're not, she's just going to be like that crazy storm. It's like when a guy literally comes home from working all day and he walks into his home and it's just, he just turns around and walks out. He doesn't even say anything. Cause he's just like, what the fuck? Like so many guys I know get off of work and they don't even go home. They want to go home, but they're just like, it's, it's not even going to be peaceful. You know what I'm saying? Like they're, they're over there having dinner by themselves at Applebee's reading text messages of getting cussed out. Cause she's thinking he's doing this. And he's like, see, he's like, there's nothing I can do right now. Yeah. It's not even worth the fight. He's like, I could have just stayed at work. You know what I'm saying? And it's just like, it's sad when they say it's cheaper to keep her, you know, there's guys that work at the space center, you know, back where I'm from. And I know this one man in particular because of alimony and child support, he now lives, he now collects unemployment and lives in a studio apartment. When this man had a yacht, big house, won't call it a mansion, big house had everything. But because she wasn't happy anymore, it's cheaper for him to quit his 300 and something thousand dollar job and live in a studio apartment than to work and pay her. He was losing. He was in negative working there just to pay her. Cause she has to maintain her lifestyle. Right. So yeah. Now that he's working or not working, he's, he can't afford her lifestyle. Yeah. He has peace. Yeah. It's so fucked. It's so fucked. She loses and he loses, you know, but you know what though, you say she loses, but she's just got another guy around the corner. What was her motive in the first place? Did she lose? Or was she just winning during this time? And now she's going on to the next, that that money will keep coming until I'm married, which why would she ever get married again? I'll just keep collecting that money. It totally. Yeah. Ladies again, I'm not saying it's all, not every woman and I'm not saying it's just women. Some guys live off their female. Look at Mary J Blige. She said she had to go back on tour just because her ex husband spent all the money. Perfect example. Yeah. Yeah. It can happen both ways. What are your thoughts on marriage, by the way? Never been married. You have a kid. Never been married. I wanted to get married. Um, my thoughts on marriage now, I feel like the government has gotten too involved for sure. I mean the whole point of marriage when it was a thing was to, it was a property arrangement and a way of pooling assets and using it to your financial advantage. Utilizing each other's lives to live, to be unified. Right. Then they conflated it with love and all of these other things. It used to be jumping the broom. It's not just that anymore. You know what I'm saying? And so it's just, I haven't heard that expression. Jump in the broom. What is that? What is that? I haven't heard that expression. Oh, so in jumping the broom comes from a, it's an old, a slave term. When they, uh, when, when the slaves got married, they held hands and jumped over the room that like sealed the marriage. Oh, interesting. Okay. So, and that's what it was. We jumped the broom. We're married. That's what we had. That's all. The only thing is that was, that's all they had. Right. That's all they had. Now you got to sign this document half of it. This is yours because this is when you have so many of those. And I'm going to be honest with you. Having the conversation of a prenuptial agreement is not going to leave a good taste in almost any woman's mouth. Except for her, believe it or not. Really? Yeah. She, she was like, it would be stupid for us not to have one. And, uh, that's how I knew she was the keeper. Cheers to that. You got a sister? You got a sister? What do you mean sister? Girl, I'm going to Ukraine. Yeah. You know, it's not right now. Not right now. But yeah, like I would hate. And that's the thing. You don't even want to have that conversation. You don't even want to have to do that. Right. But it's just like, because of the way the world is now, if you're not happy, I'm not happy. And we say, okay, we don't hate each other, but go ahead and live your life. It's not that simple anymore. No. Cause you got that. And now you want to get the lawyers involved. And you have the ability to like, just make their life hell because you want to. Yeah. And the lawyers are the only ones who win. It's, you know, I've, I've got a client who's going through, he's on his third, he's had two divorces, which, and, you know, he was, he was playing the same game, like what you were talking about, where he, it just makes more sense for him to not, to not succeed because he's losing. Oh yeah. Yeah. Cause it'll cost them more money. Right. So the government's involved. It doesn't, it's just really a bad deal. You know, for us, the only way I could get Maria into the country was K-1 visa, getting married. You know, and I've, I knew going into that, like we, you know, we'd had that conversation about the prenup. We'd getting married was, so I come from a family of I'm, I'm the oldest of four and both of my parents are one of three kids and all three of them are married, never a divorce. Both sets of my grandparents married for 50, 40 years or something. So like there's never been a divorce in my entire family. So that made me think like, okay, I can't be the first to get divorced. I better, I better either not get married or pick, make sure I don't fuck that up. Right. Um, and then given the situation of immigration, all that stuff, it was just something that like, it was unavoidable. But if I was in the U S and I was dating an American girl, fuck, what are, what is the point? Like there, I don't see any advantage. I only see disadvantages of getting married. The crazy part about it is we, you know, and this is decades ago, two, three, maybe even four, divorce wasn't an option. So there was no need, there was a stigma for it. There was no need to have a, an, a conversation of a prenuptial agreement, but there's people who get divorced after a couple months. You see what I'm saying? Like, it's like, no big deal. Whatever. Yeah. Whatever. Get divorced. Like, you know, I didn't like this, you know, this was cool and all everything. But like, so you guys were just dating and signing the paper and now your lives were fucked. Not even dating. They're just hooking up. Yeah, exactly. Just hook. Yeah. You're just hooking up. Cause you guys hate each other. Really? Like, you know what I'm saying? But now you gotta go through all these legalities and you see what I'm saying? So to answer your question, how I feel about marriage, I would love to be married. Um, but to be honest with you, man, I really don't see. Okay. If I were, if the day comes that I get married, I'm going to be an older man and she's going to be my age or older woman who we've lived our lives. We're not going anywhere that we're getting married for us. You see what I'm saying? We're getting married for us. Not because we're young, we're blissful. We're about to get married. Have a big wedding. We're getting married for us. But as far as like this now, Oh hell no. No. Yeah. There's no way. It's just, it's, it's too scary. Your life is on the line. Yeah. It's like you're everything. I'm 32 years old. If I got married right now, everything I worked for, if that woman one day woke up and said, I don't want to be with you. My life is changed. Mm hmm. It's changed. And I'm not just talking about my life, my life being married. I'm talking about my entire life. It's changed. I got to sell this, sell this, sell this, sell this. Like I heard this. Yeah. You got to make all these decisions that don't make sense anymore. You know, just because I said I do. Right. Because I was in love, which is the whole stupid thing about it. Like, okay. If I was your wife right here, like we're sitting right here and we say we're in love and we go down to that bank and go get our marriage license and then come right back here. What just changed? We went to the bank and we got a piece of paper. Look at all the legalities that go to it. Yeah. Now I got to go back to the bank and we got to sign this. We got to sign that. It's just a bunch of paperwork. Nothing changed. I love you. You love me. Well, me and your life, I want you in my life. We're not going anywhere. That's what it is. Right. Yeah. Nothing's changed. So it's just like, you know, um, I get it. Girls, you know, women, they see other women getting married. They're like, that's what I want to, I don't want to just be a baby mama. Right. I want to be a wife. But too many situations, people just want, and I won't say people, just want the wedding. Yeah. Which is what we've been conditioned to think we need to spend all of our money on and have a big party. Why save money and buy a house when you can just have a big fucking wedding. Take out debt. Have a big wedding. Yeah. It only happens once. So you better have this big ass party. Go to school, take out debt. You know what I'm saying? You take out debt, go to school, have to pay that back for the rest of your life. And then take, then get married. You know what? You just owe the government for the rest of your life. You know what we should do? We should spend all our money on a party. That's what we should do. Go out, make as much money as we can and throw one big ass party. One big party. Invite a bunch of people you don't even care about. You know, they'll bring, they'll give you a few gifts that you don't need. Some plates and forks and shit. And just have a big fucking party. Never say die. Yeah. Just a big fucking party and a bunch of people you don't know. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. And that, that, that is the reality. Situation and if you really want to talk about it Back in when people when you got married the woman's dad was supposed to pay for the marriage. What happened to that? Right. Where's the dowry? Where where's that? Well, yeah, exactly. Where's the yeah, we because that's the one deal you're supposed to get At least I don't have to pay for this wedding, right? Yeah, it's the hell you do you do And the honeymoon and the ring the honeymoon the gas that you pay for Everything And then the prenup if you didn't have one because you probably didn't get one because you didn't want to have the conversation And if you do have that conversation Besides her besides her yeah I can I can guarantee you the dynamic of that relationship This has changed Yeah, it's a shitty conversation. If if someone doesn't want to have it well because here it goes Well, we're married. What are you trying to say that we're going to get divorced? You're playing that game, you know, it's like well, you know if you really love me you wouldn't care about that if you really believed in So if you really wanted to marry me, you wouldn't think that we're getting divorces That's why they want this conversation right Checkmate. Yeah, like it's like come on Yeah, but the minute you're not happy when you're divorced in what yeah, it's like oh my god so it's like that that that that that question that you asked me is like such a It's such a mind fucking the headache because it's such a double-edged sword it is especially when you've Grown up with morals when you're growing up with parents, even though my parents. Yeah, they're divorced now But you know, they're married 17 years, you know, and you grew up in that household. Yeah, you know i'm saying so when you see that and you feel that and it's just like but then you you see what the world is today, you're like Dude i'll Shoot myself in the foot if I did that right now like every day you're walking on eggshells to make sure she's not fucking mad Yeah, you know what i'm saying? Like you better not have an instagram you better not go anywhere you better be home by this time It's like it's like yeah, you you wonder like that's not peaceful. Why would I just be single? What's the point of this? You know, what's the point of this? Yeah, really? What is the point of this? You know what i'm saying? Like So, I don't know man. I I just feel like this the whole dating world this whole relationship world of right now, this is a big transitional time and in the world for everybody a big transitional time and I think The most important part is people finding themselves and when I say finding themselves finding what you like About yourself finding what you don't like about yourself Acknowledging it willing to make a change and then finding out what you like to do for a hobby And trying to make a living out of that hobby You see what i'm saying? You know too many people are trying to scam and just get over on the easy way You'll find something that you try to find something that you're good at and make a living from And if you don't in the meantime find a job, that's not too stressful on you So you can continue to support your lifestyle Yeah, but at the end of the day you have to be okay with you first before you can be okay before you can be Okay for anyone else Before you can be okay with anyone else you have to be okay with you You see what i'm saying? And that's why I live in a high rise and i'll call my mom sometimes i'll be looking at and i'll just be crying but i'll just be thinking i'll be thinking that the heavens above that where i'm at i'm crying because I'm human. I'm human. So i'm allowed to feel that emotion of missing my family But i'm blessed I'm, i'm in pain right now, but i'm blessed that i'm here able to talk to you Because 98 of the human population would be here You see what i'm saying? So it's like I feel like in this transitional part, you know, you look at social media you see the marriages and the this and that You know, that's cute but Let's find ourselves You know what i'm saying? Let's find out who we are You know and because when you find out who you are a person who's compatible Is going to They're gonna show up they're gonna show up yeah, um, you know, yeah it's uh For me it was um, you know that process for me was was an interesting one and I didn't I didn't I guess didn't realize I was going through it, but I I I found myself through I hate to use the word dating but through dating endeavors, you know, like I was I felt like I was on this journey of becoming the best version of me and building my confidence and And I did that through My dating endeavors, right? And then I and then I realized like oh it's not about getting the 10 or you know, having the You know, whatever sexual conquest or checking off that thing on the bucket list, you know, it was it was about Feeling good and feeling not feeling good but like feeling Um, what's the word you're saying? It's like find finding myself like who am I and like you said something I just want to hit on what you just said you found that through your dating endeavors, right because You know who you are. You're able to date. I know who I am. I'm not You see what i'm saying? You were you're able to You were I don't know if you still are but i'll be your wife now, but you were able to date a female and know She's probably dating someone else Me I can't I'm gonna go fucking i'm gonna go. Oh, that's interesting You see what i'm saying? There's no fucking way in hell like that. I just that you're coming to my you're sleeping in my bed today And then sleeping in his bed. No, no, no. Yeah. Yeah, I would I was going through I mean I was seeking those women out you know, I was Basically, you know running trips and doing playboy calendar photo shoots in the maldives and you know only picking women Who would submit through our site who would like, you know Send us send us nudes or be like I am sexually liberated. I want to have this crazy fun experience I'm, not obviously only dating you. In fact, we're not even dating. We're just fucking And it was like great. Like let's let's let's party So And I but I guess it was a part of myself that I was finding and and that for for me, it was like I had all these validation issues when it came to um, just my own sense of like confidence and my sense of worth and I always felt like, you know women I always felt like I guess What's the word? Um I I felt like beautiful women didn't notice me And I was kind of invisible to them for a long time so I needed to get to a point where I felt that both women and men were like, oh that guy's that guy's you know, he fucks that guy fucks That guy's a beast right? And then and then once I felt that I was like, oh, okay That's no longer that exciting the validation The validation's not not interesting. Yeah, it's like when you want to start working it out It's like no one's looking at you. Then you start making gains and people are looking at you then you're like All right. Well, this is what I do. So You know what i'm saying? It's that same thing. Yes that same feeling you're doing it for the you know in the dating world I had to work backwards Instead of trying to see what I liked I'm an alpha male There's beautiful people everywhere I had to see what I didn't like. Yeah, you see what i'm saying? So I could pick up on that faster You see what i'm saying? Like I could pick up on the red flags like Okay, boom I see I don't like that I'm not trying to change anyone, but I see there's no longevity in that. Yeah I see that she might be quote unquote loyal but She likes to flirt. I can't I that's not that's not with that. That's not my thing, right? You see what i'm saying? Yeah, you know what I mean? I walk into a room with a lot of respect So i'd be damn I walk into the room. I think you don't need that in your life You see what i'm saying, so that's me but that's what I mean by I think that right now people need to find Theirselves instead of looking at social media and trying to go about their life how someone else is Yeah, because it's their life not yours and that's the big problem is Spending so much time on social media like I try to first of all, I I Unless someone's gonna tell me this is a dumb business practice and I should do this which my You know the the people I look up to in business have not yet told me but I create content Yeah, I try to never consume it, you know Like i'll watch people's stories that I care about like, you know to prepare for the interview with you I watch your stories that would be your page, right? But like i'm not surfing the fucking discover page I'm, not looking i'm not endlessly scrolling through through tiktok videos like fuck that like i'm putting shit out there because Every minute, I don't know how you feel but every minute I spend doing That mindless entertainment and every minute i'm entertained on social media. I feel terrible I just I feel like the life is being sucked out of me. Yeah because like And the things that I follow but if it's not motivational It's people in my industry and like i'm seeing them on vacations. I'm seeing them I don't need to be seeing that because i'm losing focus. Yeah, because i'm like damn like I ain't taking vacation Right You're like I should be out there. I should be out there like god. No, like well i'm not out there You know what i'm saying or like? And then you're like wait, they're not actually on vacation. They're just filming content Oh, you see somebody you see some kids some people that you know went to something and they didn't invite you You could make your own narrative of like oh, they didn't invite me like well, why did I get it? But well, it would probably not even been like that. Yeah, I feel like they just went and like But now you're just thinking having all these thoughts and all this crap going through your brain and it's like that's why I was so excited when you invited me on here is because I've you know almost losing my life, you know, I've lost my life a few times in different ways, but this situation right here really opened my eyes up to Who am I? Because you know Not saying I felt invincible But doing so many things and and and perfecting not perfecting but almost mastering so many things Whether I did it right at that point in time where I was able to correct it And that being snatched from you And you can't do that. Yeah It it really and I hate using this word because people use it so terribly these days, but really humbled me People use that word so terribly they think just Oh, I bought an ap you're not humble but No, I worked hard I think you can say that a shower And a ceiling crashing on you and going through that. I think that deserves to to you can use the phrase But you're right people don't they oh I was humbled by this you're right people bastardize the word. Yeah, they really do and it's just like I hate using but I I can honestly say like Out of everything i'm done. I mean like I played both sides of the ball You know i'm saying I I hit people you don't say i'm breaking your ribs, you know what I mean? i'll put my face mask right in between your numbers, you know, I mean like I've done all these things and I almost lose my life from a shower falling on my head that let me know right now like Anything can happen at any given time and that you don't have control over it Yeah, you see what i'm saying? You have to make the best out of every day And to make the best out of every day you have to be okay with yourself Because when you wake up and you and you take that that you open your eyes and you take your and take that breath It's you And you yeah in that moment Before you say anything to anyone. It's you and you And if you're not okay with yourself if you're if you're depending on someone else to make you feel better You're a lost soul And and and unfortunately That's majority of my generation. Yeah, or they're on pills Although on pills, which you're a lost soul. Yeah You see? Yeah, you know what i'm saying? So it's it's it's sad and that's why I said I I I realized You know meta calls me influencer I say I have influence You know, I have people In my dms telling me like, you know, you know that that I motivate them I even have some ogs and they call me on some silly stuff like Boy, you hey, you know motivate I was in the gym today people looking at me I'm on my life today like you know what i'm saying? And it's just like that makes me feel so good because They ogs from the hood. So they don't just give flowers like that. So they call me. It's not trying to boost me They just telling me like yo, but I appreciate it. Like, you know what i'm saying? I feel good. Yeah that lets me know that I had a Strong enough influence that they wanted to better themselves because i'm not in the gym working for them. They are yeah You see what i'm saying? But whatever I did whenever I said Made them think that hard about themselves that they wanted to do better. That motivates me. Yeah, that's real influence You see that's influence. Yeah, i'm not trying to just be an influencer and just create content. No like I want to be a good influence you know and um That's why I want to be a better man every day. I have a four-year-old son, you know what i'm saying? Uh, and he had a real runway at the at his school two years ago. He was two years old No, he had just turned three And they had a little runway. He got to the end of the runway. He was like He wouldn't be like papa, yeah, you see what i'm saying and I was just like man like It it's amazing to me that like when you do well Or someone sees you do well how much they want to replicate that. Yeah, so this social media thing All people see their highlights and when I say highlights is either the best of the best or Have the utmost sympathy for me There's no in between There's no in between it's either a couple is so happy that the next day They'd have deleted all these photos, right? You know what i'm saying totally But you don't know what happened in between you have no idea yeah But every day there was a new picture of some like smile, yeah well, dude, I uh, hopefully anyone who Who follows you on instagram?

Coleman Mr. Underscore coleman 777 on any platform and The documentary will be coming out very soon We don't have an exact date because you guys know how editing goes and all that kind of stuff there Where it's going to be put out before the new years because I rep these companies that i'm representing Another thing that i'm doing is i'm the prodigy child of not taking narcotics Because if you look at my sheet, which I will share you guys will see in the documentary If you look at it, you'll be like what the fuck? You see what i'm saying? But I don't take pills for many reasons your body can get addicted to it Then you when your mind gets addicted to it That's a big problem because you feel like you can't continue to thrive without those Whatever you're taking. Yeah, and not only that You can't really look too good when you're taking this no testosterone either like no let's see and that's another thing The fact that i'm still going through what i'm what i'm going through they test all my levels Yeah, so there's certain times that they have to give me the trt shot because they've put me on Certain type of not medicine as far as like pain medicine Yeah, like when I was in the hospital all those medicines shut my test dude. I was breaking out like crazy They had to give me like some like stipulate or something like that, but they have me so regulated right now Everything is boom. I'm so tapped into the health side of things because I see Now that i'm 32 like i'm not just like just bouncing back from stuff Yeah, but on the same time I see i'm able to dictate my body You know what? I mean? Like how not just people see the outside but even on the inside, you know, like and yeah This is gross whatever guys but even when you check your stool where after the age of 30 years old you need to check What when you use the restroom what's going on in there? You need to yeah, you know i'm saying So you need to go into the doctor. You need to make sure you learn a lot from that Yeah, you need to stay hydrated. You know what I mean? All these type of things. Um That I wasn't in tune with until this situation happened to me Yeah, you know what I mean? And like so many people ask yo, is this guy on steroids? I put guys on stage and I will say if I was You guys would know and I would be I would be a really big Sorry to say a motherfucker I really would be you know, but um, i'm gonna tell anybody, you know, i'm gonna tell anybody Majority of how you look on the outside starts in the kitchen Starts in the kitchen and it ends in the kitchen You see what I mean? Yeah, like When you go to the gym besides cardio, only thing you're doing is breaking down your muscles So i'm gonna go ahead and give it to you real quick if I cut him right now His skin is going to create a scab, right? That scab is not going to be even with his skin. It's going to be lifted And after it heals over depending on if he has keloid skin like I do see I have keloid skin It's lifted. It's above my skin. Why it was a burn that healed over and it's bigger now So when you're lifting weights, you're ripping your muscles You have the reason why you're drinking protein or you have your eating protein is to heal the muscle Which is scabbing over which gives you gains. Okay. Now what I will say this is You're drinking protein to heal yourself A protein shake is considered a meal But a protein shake is not a meal replacement And the reason why I emphasize that because your kidneys and liver will suffer Terribly if that's what you're doing They have meal replacement shakes Just like a square is a rectangle, but a rectangle is not a square A protein shake is counted as a meal But it is not a meal replacement So I eat seven meals a day. Well right now I'm eating five I eat three meals and I have two protein shakes Two of those shakes are counted as a meal But let's just say I was Really rushing and da da da. I'm not going to drink a protein shake and say oh I had a meal No, because that's building what you just tore up, right? Or repairing what you tore it up. No, I haven't torn anything up What i'm saying if i'm busy, yeah, and I didn't have a chance to eat and drink a protein shake Oh, you mean as a meal replacement? That's bullshit, right? If it's just designed for what it's designed it is to repair the repair and it's counted as a meal But if you're very busy and don't have time to eat they make shakes out there that are meal replacements because things that are in protein shakes Are toxic to your body, but when you're ripping your body down like that stuff gets you know I'm saying it your your body does what it needs to do Yeah, but if you're not ripping your muscles down and you're just drinking a protein shake you're doing nothing but harming your body, right? Because guess what your muscles aren't ripped up. So it's not repairing shit. It's nothing but doing nothing but going through your liver, right? So you see these guys who are not lifting but drinking What are you doing just filling your liver up with protein like what are you doing dude Like you're just gonna shit it all out, right? No, like actually no like You're clogging things. Yeah, you're clogging ideally in a perfect world. You'd shit it all out Yeah, but the stuff that they have in there yeah protein shakes like no like It's terrible. It really is like these guys that i'll have a position. All right, dude, like You know what i'm saying? Like that's what you want to do I'm trying to tell you but you know what I mean? Like and on top of that if you're not working out and you're drinking a protein shake you're gonna get fat. Yeah You see what i'm saying, especially some of those like the muscle milk and that's like it's all sugar Never drink muscle milk Your body over 34 grams of protein your body's not going to hold it. It's going to dump it out So if you're out here and you're buying okay, if you want to be a bodybuilder you want to gain muscle And you don't care about your abs go ahead and buy the protein that has the 40 something grams of protein and whatever whatever All you're doing is Filling your body up with more fats because your body's only going to keep 34 of those grams of protein Mm-hmm so Go get the protein That's about 24 grams of protein 24 grams of 30 and the low calories You go you go to the gym and you drink you go to the gym you lift you drink one right and then Later on you drink another one because you have broken down your muscles That day you see what i'm saying every day work two muscle groups Another thing anyone who goes to the gym and works every muscle group a day. I don't know what you're doing I even know that come on. Yeah I see someone on the internet. They work every muscle group that every day i'm like, so when do you heal right? If I cut you in the same spot every day, when is that? Close up When I like how you how you put that? Yeah, never never ever. Yeah, if I literally slice you in the same spot every day You're never going to heal it's never going to have any type of growth or any type of You know what i'm saying? Like where do you where are you going? Yeah, you know So that's a whole nother conversation guys because I have a passion for that stuff and people you know they had that people put so much false information on the internet, but What I have in store all this will be answered and it's going to be free game Because I know i'm going to get it back tenfold and I really do want to help I do really want to help people I do want to help this generation strive to become better because right now We're battling ourselves and we need to come together You know i'm saying we and and and I know that's not what this is about But like I said, we're too legit to quit i'm lion fit You see what i'm saying? And one of my mottos is we get better together Yeah at the end of the day, I don't care if you're black white jewish muslim, whatever like that If we all came together, do you know how great we would be?
