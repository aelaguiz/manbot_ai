I did a lot of day game with him as a practice of getting him out of his shell. I'm a huge fan of day game. If you haven't been out on the market for a long time, if he was recently divorced, and it's like, you know, you need to get in the gym when it comes to dating, that's day game. And he wasn't expecting crazy results. And, you know, I told him not to expect crazy results, but he did, you know, have some dates with some nice girls. And at the end of the day, it was a much better strategy to use Social Circle plus the sugar dating, of course. But realistically, like you said, like once you get over 50, one out of every whatever percentage of women that you meet day gaming is looking for a daddy, right? But that's a smaller percentage. So, you know, rejection is going to be higher. Yeah, there are girls who will reject you just for your age. And the older you get, the more common that's going to become. But you just have to understand that that's fine. Day game teaches you to deal with rejection, and that's fine. I don't think there is difference in results that a guy who's maybe in the mid 20s to very late 30s can get. I think they can kind of get more or less the same results, assuming that the guy in late 30s has good game. The guy that's younger will require a little less game, but they're still going to get  \", \"segments\": [{\"id\": 0, \"seek\": 0, \"start\": 0.0, \"end\": 4.039999961853027, \"text\": \" I have one
