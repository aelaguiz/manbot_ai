Whereas with an online dating situation, you're there, you're on a date, if things go well, it's like, bam, things have escalated quickly. But the other tough thing is, is your social circle is it's a little bit harder sometimes to tell is this person into me or are they just being friendly because I'm friends with their friends, right? So it's a little bit of a gray area. So that can both help and hurt.
