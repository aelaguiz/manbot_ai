Nobody who's high status is going to see a new random person at 7.30pm on a Friday, right? And if you ask for that date, that's going to be a red flag. If a girl tells you that she's only free on a Friday or Saturday, that's usually a pretty big red flag too, unless you really are looking for a relationship and even that's the wrong mentality and the wrong mindset. The only girls that are going to be free on a Friday or Saturday are girls who are extremely busy with work, have nothing really socially going on. The other thing I see with her a lot is just somebody wants a free dinner. Like saying 7.30pm on a Friday, take me to a restaurant.
