There's a lot of lingo that gets thrown around like one night stand, late night booty call, hook up, friends with benefit, what's a rotation girl, what's the difference between a player and a hook boy. I had one of the guys in the leverage group say that he was kind of confused about a lot of these quote unquote simple terms that really aren't that simple. We just kind of take for granted that everyone knows what these things are, but there's a lot of nuance with these sort of terms and understanding what they are can really help you on your path to becoming a more attractive guy, better with women and able to get some of those late night booty calls and those things that you might want in your life.
