It's really only stubble or scruff. Anything more than scruff I think is heading into Zach Galifianakis territory, it's a little too much. Nails are important, I noticed yesterday that Robbie had dirty nails, he never has dirty nails, as soon as he had dirty nails I noticed it and I asked. Hair, like don't let it, don't let this stuff get out of control, like you always have to keep this nice and trimmed and it might require you to do it in between haircuts, that's the problem. Most guys only get that done at each of their haircuts and then it grows out and it's all like nasty looking in the in between. So there's that. I brush, I don't know about you, but I brush my teeth like three times a day. If I ate something and I feel like not fresh after it or before I go out, always in the morning obviously, sometimes four times a day. I always notice if he's wearing a nice cologne that I like and if he's generally like well put together, I'll always pick up on that and that makes me think that he's a put together person, that he pays attention to stuff like that, small details, I might even comment on it. If he has really nice white teeth, that's hot. If he has B.O., I will for sure notice and when you have B.O., you can't always smell it on yourself. So if you're one of those guys who doesn't wear deodorant, make sure you're actually a smell-less guy who doesn't need deodorant, which they do exist, but I know some peeps who might end up watching this video who have been stinky a few times, not gonna name names. \", \"segments\": [{\"id\": 0, \"seek\": 0, \"start\": 0.0, \"end\": 12.640000343322754, \"text\": \" So, in my fashion guide I
