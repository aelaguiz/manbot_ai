But that's the thing. If you take time to understand the rules, you're going to be a way better player. Yeah. I mean, I'll give a golf analogy, which always pisses people off because no one likes golf except for me. The rulebook in golf, you know, it's multiple hundreds of pages and almost zero amateur golfers bother to really learn the rules because it's like very nitpicky stuff. But one thing that my college golf coach made us do was like learn and study the rulebook, because once you know the rules and the intricacies, there's all of these ways you can take advantage that you would have never understood. So I think the analogy works here is there's like the basic understanding of the rules. And then if you take it to the advanced level, that's when you can really have a leg up on. \", \"segments\": [{\"id\": 0, \"seek\": 0, \"start\": 0.0, \"end\": 2.799999952316284, \"text\": \" When you're reading the laws, there's always something that's going to point you toward\", \"tokens\": [50364, 1133, 291, 434, 3760, 264, 6064, 11, 456, 311, 1009, 746, 300, 311, 516, 281, 935, 291, 7361, 50504], \"temperature\": 0.0, \"avg_logprob\": -0.22718755900859833, \"compression_ratio\": 1.8316062688827515, \"no_speech_prob\": 0.1702968329191208}, {\"id\": 1, \"seek\": 0, \"start\": 2.799999952316284, \"end\": 6.079999923706055, \"text\": \" the direction that you could actually use to your advantage.
