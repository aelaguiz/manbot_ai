In the movie, they actually make a comment about how as a man, you should go 90% of the way and let the woman go the other 10%, which I think is pretty good advice.

You don't always stare at just one eye or the other eye because it becomes creepy. You're just a staring guy. But if you switch your vision from left eye to right eye and then down to lips and you change like every five to ten seconds, that can create a lot of attraction. \", \"segments\": [{\"id\": 0,
