And what I ended up getting out of it was realizing that all of this thought that I had put into basically everything that I was doing was really unnecessary, and that it's really simple, and all you have to do is just be grounded, and if there's anything weird going on or anything, somebody else is probably feeling it too, and you can call these feelings out, and it just breaks everything down, and all of the people that you talk to, these interactions are awesome. Basically, what I would say is I would definitely recommend Interconfidence to anyone who wants to come off as a genuine person and to connect with people in a whole new way where you're not talking at them, and I had a realization that I was talking at people a lot. So if you wanted to learn more of a skill about being comfortable with yourself, then I would say to come to Interconfidence. \", \"segments\": [{\"id\": 0, \"seek\": 0, \"start\": 0.0, \"end\": 10.0, \"text\": \" All right, my name is Gary Kinezny, and I came to Interconfidence so that I could learn how to approach people and not be scared of them.\", \"tokens\": [50364, 1057, 558, 11, 452, 1315, 307, 13788, 591, 533, 89, 1634, 11, 293, 286, 1361, 281, 5751, 47273, 370, 300, 286, 727, 1466, 577, 281, 3109, 561, 293, 406, 312, 5338, 295, 552, 13, 50864], \"temperature\": 0.0, \"avg_logprob\": -0.33001068234443665, \"compression_ratio\": 1.5416666269302368, \"no_speech_prob\": 0.10324431210756302}, {\"id\": 1, \"seek\": 0, \"start\": 10.0, \"end\": 20.0, \"text\": \" And what I ended up getting out of it was realizing that all of this thought that I had put into basically everything that I was doing was really unnecessary,\", \"tokens\": [50864, 400, 437, 286, 4590, 493, 1242, 484, 295, 309, 390, 16734, 300, 439, 295, 341, 1194, 300, 286, 632, 829, 666, 1936, 1203, 300, 286, 390, 884, 390, 534, 19350, 11, 51364], \"temperature\": 0.0, \"avg_logprob\": -0.33001068234443665, \"compression_ratio\": 1.5416666269302368, \"no_speech_prob\": 0.10324431210756302}, {\"id\": 2, \"seek\": 2000, \"start\": 20.0, \"end\": 30.0, \"text\": \" and that it's really simple, and all you have to do is just be grounded, and if there's anything weird going on or anything,\", \"tokens\": [50364, 293, 300, 309, 311, 534, 2199, 11, 293, 439, 291, 362, 281, 360, 307, 445, 312, 23535, 11, 293, 498, 456, 311, 1340, 3657, 516, 322, 420, 1340, 11, 50864], \"temperature\": 0.0, \"avg_logprob\": -0.20965078473091125, \"compression_ratio\": 1.6542552709579468, \"no_speech_prob\": 0.2972932457923889}, {\"id\": 3, \"seek\": 2000, \"start\": 30.0, \"end\": 39.0, \"text\": \" somebody else is probably feeling it too, and you can call these feelings out, and it just breaks everything down,\", \"tokens\": [50864, 2618, 1646, 307, 1391, 2633, 309, 886, 11, 293, 291, 393, 818, 613, 6640, 484, 11, 293, 309, 445, 9857, 1203, 760, 11, 51314], \"temperature\": 0.0, \"avg_logprob\": -0.20965078473091125, \"compression_ratio\": 1.6542552709579468, \"no_speech_prob\": 0.2972932457923889}, {\"id\": 4, \"seek\": 2000, \"start\": 39.0, \"end\": 43.0, \"text\": \" and all of the people that you talk to, these interactions are awesome.\", \"tokens\": [51314, 293, 439, 295, 264, 561, 300, 291, 751, 281, 11, 613, 13280, 366, 3476, 13, 51514], \"temperature\": 0.0, \"avg_logprob\": -0.20965078473091125, \"compression_ratio\": 1.6542552709579468, \"no_speech_prob\": 0.2972932457923889}, {\"id\": 5, \"seek\": 4300, \"start\": 43.0, \"end\": 53.0, \"text\": \" Basically, what I would say is I would definitely recommend Interconfidence to anyone who wants to come off as a genuine person\", \"tokens\": [50364, 8537, 11, 437, 286, 576, 584, 307, 286, 576, 2138, 2748, 5751, 47273, 281, 2878, 567, 2738, 281, 808, 766, 382, 257, 16699, 954, 50864], \"temperature\": 0.0, \"avg_logprob\": -0.1779767870903015, \"compression_ratio\": 1.5433526039123535, \"no_speech_prob\": 0.22512246668338776}, {\"id\": 6, \"seek\": 4300, \"start\": 53.0, \"end\": 64.0, \"text\": \" and to connect with people in a whole new way where you're not talking at them, and I had a realization that I was talking at people a lot.\", \"tokens\": [50864, 293, 281, 1745, 365, 561, 294, 257, 1379, 777, 636, 689, 291, 434, 406, 1417, 412, 552, 11, 293, 286, 632, 257, 25138, 300, 286, 390, 1417, 412, 561, 257, 688, 13, 51414], \"temperature\": 0.0, \"avg_logprob\": -0.1779767870903015, \"compression_ratio\": 1.5433526039123535, \"no_speech_prob\": 0.22512246668338776}, {\"id\": 7, \"seek\": 6400, \"start\": 64.0, \"end\": 74.0, \"text\": \" So if you wanted to learn more of a skill about being comfortable with yourself, then I would say to come to Interconfidence.\", \"tokens\": [50364, 407, 498, 291, 1415, 281, 1466, 544, 295, 257, 5389, 466, 885, 4619, 365, 1803, 11, 550, 286, 576, 584, 281, 808, 281, 5751, 47273, 13, 50864], \"temperature\": 0.0, \"avg_logprob\": -0.2064896672964096, \"compression_ratio\": 1.201923131942749, \"no_speech_prob\": 0.09662488102912903}]}"}
