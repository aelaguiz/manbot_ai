Step one is you're just like a beginner and you're in total scarcity. Step two is you're an intermediate. You can get leads, get dates, you know, kind of get laid. And step three happens is when you can get women to actually chase you. It's difficult because obviously the whole game is set up as men as the pursuer. So at some point in the interaction, we've got to go from chasing to being chased. Approaching a woman is by default like that's chasing her, right? You're going up to her, you're chasing her, right? So that it needs to happen after that, where all of a sudden in her mind, it flips from like, oh, this guy's chasing me to, oh, I need to chase this guy. And if you don't give them the opportunity to do it, they'll never do it. And that's the hardest part because, you know, it's all push pull and it's all pull away strategy, right? And the more you push, the more she's like, oh, this guy's just going to like do everything. I don't need to do anything. \", \"segments\": [{\"id\": 0, \"seek\": 0, \"start\": 0.0, \"end\": 1.559999942779541, \"text\": \" There's like three stages of game.\", \"tokens\": [50364, 821, 311,
