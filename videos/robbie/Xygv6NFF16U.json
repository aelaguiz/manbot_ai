Art director? Yeah, at an interactive agency. Nice. So what about you? I play professional poker I do some internet marketing I'm like a hustler I moved here from LA about five months ago. So you're all about the risk. Oh yeah, I'm a fucking gambler. So then, running after a girl that you randomly see is probably not something completely out of your personality, right? I'm a Gemini and they say that actually I know nothing about this shit but but yeah I like I don't know I just like thrive off of pressure and excitement it's fun. That's cool. I've never played poker, never gambled. You never played blackjack or anything like that? Well, not for money, no. For fun? That'd be so boring. I'll tell you a screwed-up story. Okay. So I've got three little siblings well you know I'm the oldest of four and two three cousins like two twins and their older brother we're all within like an eight-year gap okay so we used to play like family poker or not poker a blackjack and I'd be the dealer and they didn't realize the dealer had an advantage and I would also say that the dealer won on ties which is not legal so I'd win like their $7 and they'd go crying to their parents. I'd hustle my siblings. I'm such an asshole. Well, yeah, but I guess, you know, you're pretty young so that's kind of smart. You can't hustle your own siblings, right? Exactly. Who can you? Who are you going to hustle? Because you know they'll forgive you. Exactly. Better them than a stranger, I guess. Exactly. Where are you from originally? I'm from Jersey. Jersey? Yeah. Like real Jersey. Not like Jersey Shore Jersey. I don't know anything about Jersey, really. I've been to AC. Yeah. Went to AC when I was, I don't know, 15 with my parents. What brought you out here to New York? My sister lives here. She's been here since she graduated from BU and one reason was that she had a room opening up and but I mean the real reason was I figured everyone had to like I think everyone has to live in New York at least for like a year of their life just to know what it's like. Yeah, New York is great. There's no place like it. How do you like it so far? You know, for the first two months, I moved. Well, I came out in May. I was here from May 1st to June 15th and I loved it. It was warm. Everyone's out. You go to the park. And then I went to Europe for three months doing some traveling, some business over there. And I came back and I wasn't like sure if I was going to stay. So for the first two months I was kind of like I miss LA. I miss the weather. I miss my car. I miss all the LA shit. But then once I made the decision to stay, I was like this place is awesome. And now I'm hooked. When did you move out? Well, I'm from here. Well, from Jersey. Yeah, from Jersey. I actually still live in Jersey, but I'm moving to New York in April. What part of town do you know? Yeah, Chelsea. So kind of all the way on the west side, which is good. But yeah, I mean, I've lived kind of in a bunch of different places. D.C. for a while, then Florida and then moved back here. So I can't say what. Yeah, New York's just too good. It's true. Anyway, I do have to get going. My friend's probably going to be like, where the hell are you? Yeah. So let me get your number. Well, how about you give me your number? Well, how about this? See, tell me now. If you weren't sold on the date, then I won't bother texting you anyways. OK, but if you're middle sold, I'll text you some witty shit and maybe you'll get more sold. I'm I'm kind of sold, but but not not entirely. OK, so what do I have to say to sell you? My favorite color is blue. I like candlelit dinners. We'll just grab coffee. No pressure. It's fine. I don't want to go out with anyone who hates me. What fun is that going to be? Totally. We'll grab coffee like Starbucks here or something. All right. Here, go ahead. Put it in for me. You're a tough cookie, Tanya. I like it, though. Got to make it make a guy work for it. Seriously. You know, no idea. You have to forgive me because I've completely forgotten your name. Robby. Robby. Yeah. OK, so send me a text or something. I will know who this strange number is. Strange random guy that hit on you in front of the car lot. Yeah. All right. Give me a hug. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. Thanks for saying you like me. I did, actually. I didn't know it was gonna happen, but I did. I guess I'll give you what you owe me, an hour an d a half. I think. OK. So I will let you know. Thanks.
