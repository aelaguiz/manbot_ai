From France to Austin, Texas, I am a converted cowboy. You brought that hat all the way from France, huh? Yeah. They tested it for drugs at the airport, but I got through. You made it through. That's shocking. So Guillaume here has been in the group for, since what, 20? I'm pretty sure October 2020. October 2020. Maybe even September, because I joined a bit earlier before the immersion. So almost three years, yeah, two and a half. We just finished the Austin immersion. He was my assistant coach, and he earned that duty because he's a beast. And you've gotten to that beast level at a very fast rate. Obviously, you didn't start with the group. You had done some things before that, but your story is really inspiring. Your game is incredible. It's every, basically every night, there's a new girl here. I'm not exaggerating. I think for the last five nights, just revolving door of new, young, beautiful women that love Guillaume. So it wasn't always like that for him, and that's kind of why we decided to do this little interview or ask me anything. Some of the guys in the group will be asking questions towards the end. So have your questions ready. But yeah, why don't you kind of take us back to pre-cool, pre-Good With Women Guillaume. Pre-everything, yeah. So for me, I want to start because I was writing, thinking about what I should write in the Discord. So for me, it started in high school. The first love ever got when I got from girls was when they wanted my math homework solutions. So then that was when they were like super, super nice to me. And then only till I gave it to them. And it was like, oh, thanks. Bye. But I go back to the other guys. Yeah, back then I would have been happy with like a four or just like any girl for me. It was just there were a few girls kind of wanted to talk to me, but they were so, I don't want to say ugly, but they were so ugly that I would have felt like painful if I would tell my other friends, oh, this is my girlfriend. I would feel like such a shame that I was rather alone than with that girl. So zero girls in high school. And then it took me, I think one year in university. I met Daniel was also in the group. I met him way before we both became members of the group. He was studying at the same university and through a lucky coincidence, a mutual friend of him through a mutual friend of Daniel, I found out that Daniel was in this local approaching group where they were just approaching girls. And I felt like, well, I'm at zero, so I might as well join. And then that was, I think, 2016, something like 2016 till 2018. I was just kind of like learning a little bit about the approaches, doing that, trying to overcome my anxiety. It was not really with a strategy. It was more like. So it's basically like a bunch of guys at a similar level pushing each other. Yeah. Was there any one guy who was like head and shoulders better that we were coaching? Yeah. Yeah. There were two guys which were much more experienced who were coaching. They also had for a brief time company called like Gentlemen's Codex. It was kind of funny. No. So they were having like just like some talks. Okay. And yeah. But I think the core part was more. It was like a group of guys who could talk about stuff. You could approach together. Guys were pushing each other. So you would have these like going out sessions where guys would send each other to do approaches basically. Right. I felt even now, but especially at that time where I had a lot of anxiety and it was so new, I felt like doing it alone to me felt a hundred times harder. Right. Than doing it with Daniel. For example, like it could have been anybody, but Daniel and I essentially became friends because we were just like walking around the city talking and then occasionally approaching girls if we saw one. How often were you approaching? That's interesting. It varied, but I would say at least twice a week. It was usually the weekends. We had a bit of time and Saturday was always a very good day because people would come in the city just for shopping. There's a huge pedestrian zone where I was studying. So twice a week you go out there and how many approaches would you typically do in a session? So I would say somewhere around three to ten. We were going out like so the Saturday was longer, but sometimes we would literally walk around two to three hours. The city where I was in was a bit smaller. So, you know, sometimes you had to walk just to see girls. So if you had to do the math, it sounds like call it, we'll say seven per day, 15 per week. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. For 40 weeks. So that would be 600 a year. Okay. If my math is correct. For a couple of years? Yeah. Okay. So I started in 2016, right? Yeah. I did that at least till like December of 2017, where I will come later to where I had my first sort of kind of like boot camp when I was in the UK. Yeah, for two years it was just that. What did you see about your results after doing all those approaches for those two years? So I saw a lot of my approach anxiety vanish. And every now and then there was a girl who was like super flattered that I approached her. It was something which never really happened to her before. Maybe it was, but it was just something so out of the box cool that I would get a lot of attraction just by that, even though I was still not confident. I probably had many, many fuck ups, many things not optimal, but I would get away with it because of that initial attraction. So I remember, I think the second girl I slept with, it was funny because I think it was two years ago where like Daniel and I were just like talking about our friendship and how we started. And I think we went through like who were the first girls and the second girl, Daniel was like, oh wow, she was way cuter than expected. And she was like an exchange student. So I guess it's also less telling if it's, we were like speaking English and I feel like if somebody's from the same country, you can always very well tell and what sort of, how good they are socially. But if you go to a different country, I think for people it's way harder to kind of like judge you, put you in a box. Yeah. Because they don't have that reference experience. So I guess that was one of the factors, but. Yeah, it's an important, interesting and important point. It's when someone's a foreigner, you don't necessarily pick up on all the subtle social cues. And therefore, yeah, you have more leeway for sure. Yeah, exactly. Especially if there's a language barrier, right? Because if you were to speak poor local language, being an actual local, people are just going to think you're really stupid. Yeah. But you're clearly not from there. Don't know the language as well. You get a huge leeway. Okay. So you're approaching, you're doing that. Doing that with Daniel. What was kind of like the next big turning point in your game? Yeah. So yeah, doing these approaches, I would sometimes hit and have a girl who kind of liked me, but I always never knew why she really liked me. I felt like, okay, I got really lucky with this one. I was like, okay, cool. I wrote with it. I learned a little bit more how to sort of like set up dates and how to escalate. I think that was the big next thing I learned. And that was just going on a lot of dates and getting more comfortable with escalation? No. So that was actually very interesting. Back at the time, I think it was 2017. There were a lot of coaches selling online programs, like how to get women. And one was kind of in particular where many people in that local group kind of vibe with. So we even had like a kind of like Netflix session where we would all come together and just watch videos. And it was a lot about how you would kind of convert dates because I'm a very logical guy. I totally didn't know anything. And it was a little bit about how do you escalate? How do you take next steps? Because I think if you start, and especially me, I was such a nice guy, I wouldn't take any risks. Like I would never know when to kiss a girl. I was always like fearful of rejection. I also didn't understand what women were attracted to. So just watching that, at least for me, was at least a starting point to learn about basic female psychology, about attraction and about escalation, how you take things forward. Because I think that's very important because otherwise you just end up in the friend zone. And I think that's a major challenge for many guys who are starting. They want to become friends, but you kind of have to risk a few girls hate you in order to have a few girls love you. You have to be polarizing. Exactly, more polarizing. And also just when you get signals to act on them, to escalate and not to just be like nice back and not do anything. So if a girl, even if it's by luck, gives you signs of attraction, then like to act on them because the window is closing and at some point it's closed and you're in the friend zone. And she's like, okay, this guy doesn't get it. Right, okay. Okay, what happened next? Yeah, so next, me and my friend, we decided to do a boot camp which is, I guess for the guys who don't know, it's like a super, super small scaled, best quality version of an immersion. It was only two days really. It was kind of like two and a half days, but it was basically only a Friday and a Saturday. And kind of all we did, it was in London, was things to get over our anxiety so the coach would make us do ridiculously uncomfortable things so that afterwards we would feel so much better just doing normal approaches because it's this sort of like, often we judge things in a relative way. So if you do something that makes you super, super uncomfortable, then doing something like approaches which is still uncomfortable just feels much easier because in comparison to what you did before, it just feels less uncomfortable. So that's what we did during the day and then during the night all we did was go to a nightclub in London and the guy would film us and our interactions with girls. It wasn't, I think it was even without audio, but it was like a really high quality camera. You could see a lot even though it was dark. And then all we did the next day was talk about how we thought that interaction was going and we had to kind of give a pre-rating like how do we think how much this girl liked us and then we would watch the footage from a third person perspective. And it was super eye-opening to me to actually see the reality and see myself from the third eye's perspective. So yeah. Was it uncomfortable watching yourself? Was it like, did you like the guy that you saw through the camera or no? Medium. So on the one hand, I saw how awfully wrong my perception of reality was. So I would always say, well, that girl didn't like me that much. And then you would literally see on video all the like clues and hints she got. And that was like massively eye-opening on the other. So she likes you more than you. Yeah. Yeah. Got it. Like, I mean, some girls just outright didn't, but some girls liked me much more than I thought they would. And then the other thing was, it was really interesting to see me from a third eye perspective because from the outside, I looked horrible just because, so for me in particular, I was tall and what I used to do to talk to smaller girls is literally like bend down. So I was literally like, I guess you couldn't see it. But if I turn from the side and talk to girl, I would go down like this to see her. And I was like a tree, almost like falling. And it looked just so horrible. That tall guy bend over syndrome. Yeah. I've seen that a lot. And that just looks so horrible from the outside. So just one thing which I learned is literally keeping my body straight up. And what then I would notice is that girls would like go on their tiptoes to talk to me to be closer to my ear. And that became like a pretty interesting thing where you could just correct one thing in your posture. And it really, nobody ever told me this before and it really took just somebody to observe me in person and see it. It's like nothing I would have ever figured out in like a write up or anything. Right. Yeah. Some of those body language mistakes are such killers. When you're doing things like that, you're disqualified so quickly and you might not even realize you're doing it until you see yourself on video or someone can point that out. That's the power of coaching and seeing that because you could have been doing that for years before. Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. Okay. So you take that bootcamp and that was mostly day game, night game? It was both. Uh huh. It was both actually. And were you more comfortable in day game or night game? Did you have a preference? I would say back then I was more comfortable doing, to do day game because I kind of, even though it was hit and miss approaches, I kind of did that for two years. And then day game I felt more comfortable because I didn't have any competition. And night game I don't think I still felt like the cool guy. I was always like, ah, there's all these other guys, you know, I didn't know what to do if any other guy would just even come in and talk to my girl, just be like, okay, bye. Yeah. Okay. And then, so what was the next kind of major turning point? So that was 2018. I think the major turning point at that is that I kind of started to have success with a few girls. I built that inner confidence. I went on a festival with my friend and what I learned there a lot was to generate attraction in a very short amount of time and also pushing for kind of like quick escalation because things are just like crazy on a festival. But I remember when... Was that Ziget? Yeah, exactly. It was in Budapest, really great festival. So literally what you do is you stop girls. It's always like chaos, people running around so you can... People running from this stage to that stage and this, you know, it's just girls running around everywhere. It's nuts. And they're always like on their way to somewhere and maybe they're looking for their friend or whatever. So you can... You literally can't be a nice guy and be like, oh, we're going to go on 10 dates and then if you don't hate me then by accident somehow we'll end up... No, but it was great and I learned the power of venue changing, which then I learned a lot more through you why that is a good thing. But it's literally stopping, taking girls to different stuff so that it feels like you have so much experience together. Also, you're more in this leading masculine position, which I think is attractive to many girls. How would you stop the girls in the festival? Do you remember any of the methods you used? I think I literally, I mean, I didn't do the hook and swoop back then. But it was something like, hey, one quick thing before you run off, whatever. And then just like make up something or I think it was even, I think I was way less direct back then. I just stopped them and I felt like girls would stop because I guess I was tall. My Daniel was also there. He didn't have any problems and he's like shorter than me. So you're tall, you're 6'5\\\", and that's obviously a big help when it comes to dating. Women will choose height over beauty because women want to feel small in a guy's arms. Guys who are short can also make women feel small, but they have to take up more space and they have to be more physical and they have to be a bigger sort of presence. When you're tall and you're big, that's kind of built in. So that can be a big leg up, but you were mentioning to me prior that you were getting basically nothing out of your height when you were, before your game was any good, right? Yeah. Oh, for sure. It almost, it sounds so stupid, but it never occurred to me that height was a strength. When I was in my soccer team, I was like, oh, I was nicknamed the lighthouse. I was like, well, I, I, I don't know, it was, I never really felt anything special. And you know, sometimes bump my head through doors and so on. And I remember even like some of my female friends, like either actual friends or just even girls who would, I don't know, just not want to date me and be like, oh yeah, we can be friends, blah, blah, blah. They would say like, oh, girls like tall guys. I'm sure you'll find somebody. And I always thought in my head, well, I don't really believe the truth in that statement. So it just showed me, because sort of nothing matters without confidence, right? And you need to build it to just play your best hand. And sometimes you have a little bit better starting position, sometimes not. But some of my friends who are shorter than me, they look way better in the gym. So there's always many things that you can change. It's not the one thing that like changes everything. So you're doing the Ziga thing, you're getting more comfortable with, with, you know, making things happen faster, trying to meet girls in a non-dating sort of environment, getting a lot of approaches and it sounds like. Was it just around that time where you and I linked up and did that day game session with Daniel or? Yeah, I think, I think that was a year later. So sort of in that, in that timeframe. So I remember in Ziget, I was, I stopped counting, but on average I was making out with something like eight to 10 girls a day. Wow. That's impressive. Yeah, all the festivals. So that like, how? Because I mean, it's, it's a, you know, if you're listening to this, you're like, oh my God, how is that possible? It's, it's very possible because it's a, it's a festival. Girls are going to make out. Basically you can kind of just like try to make out and they'll make out, you know, like at Carnival, you know, down in Brazil, like making out, isn't that big of a deal? Like how many did you actually hook up with? Exactly. Zero. Okay. Exactly. Like I got one in my tent, but then I ran away and my friend got one. So that was what I was about to say. Like making out was way less big of a deal than actually hooking up, but it was really good to learn it and to kind of go for it and to make that experience and to just get more comfortable and easier with kind of escalating, taking things to the next level. And I remember it helped me a lot on the other dates because I would notice like indicators of interest. So like girls flicking their hair or other tales and then I'd be like, okay, well maybe I should go for make out and often taking risks would really pay off. And even if the girl like dodged a kiss, like you have a great line, like, oh, great kiss dodge. A plus. Yeah. A plus kiss dodge. A plus kiss dodge. I'll try again in 10 minutes. Stay on your game. Yeah. Yeah. So. Just not being reactive, not letting it get awkward. Exactly. You can say anything except don't just stand there and be like, ugh. Exactly. If you make it awkward, then it will be. But so often it was like zero deal. And the girls would respect you way more doing it and dodging a kiss than you not doing it. Right. Because at least you're going for it. Okay. So then what made you want to. Well, so for backstory. So Daniel, who was your wingman, he joined the group back in like 2017. He was like a broke college student. So I feel like he was in the group for maybe, you know, four or five months. And then he was like, you know, it's expensive and I can't afford it. But maybe when you come to Europe, we can do some one on one, you know, day game work. I remember him asking. So I was in Europe and I get a call from Daniel. He's like, hey, I'm with two of my wingmen. One is Gyeom and the other is, I forget the other guy, but, you know, they wanted to do a day game session. I miked them up, you know, got them on camera and then gave them feedback. And when I showed up, you know, Daniel was, he was so awkward with his, you know, like the way he was stopping girls and most of them weren't stopping. He was, you know, he's very nervous, very awkward. I remember you weren't as nervous, but you were, you were like severely balding and you looked like your fashion was whack. And it was actually the other guy who I felt like was all around probably, you know, getting the slightly better results. But, but you guys were all like, you know, everyone, I think we, we spent maybe like only 15 minutes each, like getting, getting footage because there were just so many girls to talk to. Yeah. Right. We maybe got seven or eight videos of each guy. It didn't take very long because it was just like one after the other. And then we went back up and we watched, watched the videos. So what was your, what do you feel like kind of changed from that experience? That was our first meeting. Anything you want to highlight about that? Yeah. So before that, I felt like I was okay stopping girls, but that one meeting, it was also very short. It was, I think only three or four hours and it was literally because we could split the cost by three guys, that's why we did it. But it was amazing because you showed us our approaches and then how to do the hook and swoop properly. I remember that. And I remember that we were there staying one week. And in case people listening don't know what the hook and swoop is, the hook and swoop is, is a technique to stop a girl who's walking down the sidewalk. Right. Yes. This idea where you kind of like run and swoop around her and get her to stop. And it's, it's the least sort of intrusive and comfortable way, but still powerful enough where they will stop and they will acknowledge what you're saying. Because I think the most painful thing that can happen on a day game approach or any approach in general is the girl just completely like ignoring you, giving you that cold shoulder. You know, that's because like you, you've dealt with the anxiety enough to do it, but then she like literally doesn't like acknowledge your existence as a human being. You feel like you're this small, you know, so no, for sure. I've seen a lot of techniques and I felt that this was really just the best practice. Also I, I still remember, I think yesterday I went out and one, I tried to just do from the front cause I was in a moment and she was like, no, I'm busy on the floor, literally through me. And I was like, why did, why did I even try to stop her from the front? I was like, I can do it, bam, blew up in my face. So no, that was super helpful, super helpful. And I remember because we were there a few days more, I, my like stopping a ratio went from, I don't know, something like 50, 60% to like 95 or something. And it was, it was, that was the biggest improvement from that one day game session. And I think it. paid is used like the two years after it so that was super helpful and then also I remember you gave us a list of bars and nightclubs in that city which were really good and I think that was very helpful and I think it's also very powerful the thing in the discord for example now in Austin right I don't know anything about Austin which are the good places clubs but we have like our friend Amir here who lives here who knows which the good places are and then you can just ask him like hey which bars are the best which websites should I look events up to is there like an Instagram page I think yeah especially if you like traveling and I want to encourage many of the guys traveling because it kind of like gets you out of your normal environment and you can do something else and maybe even you're more comfortable to try riskier things in a different place because you know okay you will I don't know not be judged or not run into the same girl like two months later or two weeks later or something and just as a side note that was what you did back then there but what I think also is really helpful being in the group yeah being able to just get that information run with it versus having to you know how to figure it out yourself over a long period of time yeah yeah so that was how many months before you came to the immersion I'm pretty sure that was at least eight months before it was eight to twelve months because I remember we did that one session yeah which was super helpful then we all went back home and then I remember when I had my internship that Daniel went to the immersion and I didn't even oh yes right I did too and he's Daniel went to the first one right and you want to the first one so I mean I think I think we gave him the nickname the Terminator approaching well which is like the one of the one of the guys Nick from Minnesota or Montana he was like blown away and this guy Nick he's like a bill like he's like a sheriff now actually and he was like so impressed by Daniel cuz like this guy just approaches every single girl he's like the Terminator and he actually Daniel the first day we were out approaching he took a girl like straight from the street back to my flat where I was having everyone staying I had the Airbnb business in that city and during the next like section of the course he was hooking up with her in the room and the walls are paper thin and you know it was pretty good I was impressed she was actually it was like one of those perfect timing sort of thing and that's it yeah that's the benefit of you know doing a lot of day game is sometimes you'll just you know the stars will align and you'll get a perfect situation this girl was was like not from there and she was there just to like have I think a surgery done like the following day yeah the following day and she had nothing to do knew nobody in the city just kind of like walking around being a tourist and then here comes Daniel and well you got nothing to do let's uh let's go here he basically ran the dating protocol right did a couple different venues and then brought her back and yeah so that was a that was impressive but I digress no it's really great that you say that because so I I don't think even I knew exactly that Daniel was going to an immersion I knew that he was in the group and sometimes he would tell me these gold nuggets yeah and you know kind of sharing advice that you gave in the group and I was like damn this like really good I remember sometimes like oh this is like such an emotional concept which for me I felt hard to grasp but so well explained logically and the reasoning behind it so I remember that we were talking sometimes about like advice that you gave in the group but then we were in different cities in that time because I had my internship and during that I think it was a summer he did the immersion and I just like kept getting voice messages from him and pictures from girls it was really like I felt like I was missing out yeah exactly and I think at that time I was pretty comfortable approaching and generating new girls that were sixes maybe a seven every now and then I was comfortable with kind of like doing the steps I roughly had a plan but I felt like my really biggest wall was getting harder girls right and that was kind of always my dream goal to get harder girls or like one really hot girlfriend he felt like you'd kind of hit a plateau where you were able to attract a lot of women but you were consistently failing with what are you on calm eights and up or exactly the ones who you you know were really intimidated by yeah well and do you think it was simply because you were intimidated and they could they could smell that fear do you think it was more like an inner game issue or just the fact that you hadn't had success with enough of them yet to really believe that you were worthy yes yeah it was totally that I think so the biggest thing I think it was in confidence issue obviously I would I would also feel more nervous or just kind of be more chasy over text like fuck I really want to do something with this girl and then I kind of knew I was doing the some things wrong but I was like well I still really want to talk to her so kind of knowing it's it's bad but still doing it's like smoking you know you know it's bad but you can like still do it sort of this sort of thing I was for sure nervous on the day but I think the biggest thing was I I didn't believe I could get with them because I had so far like zero success like one and I was like well that was super lucky and there was one thing oh yeah I I just didn't believe I was good enough for them because I was coming from this logical thing I was like well I view myself as at that time I still had hair I was balding I was always trying to sort of hide it never find any good way to do that I just felt like I was maybe a seven and I felt I like at best and I felt like well the eights and up were just out of my league and I just didn't feel worthy so you felt like a seven from a how I look scale or a seven as the overall package scale I think seven from a look scale okay yeah and you felt like because I'm a seven I don't deserve an eight exactly you know it's funny I felt like that too because I think as guys we make the assumption that women are attracted to the same things we're attracted to we're attracted to the physical first and foremost right so it's like if she's a nine right then it's like oh she's not gonna want me unless she thinks I'm a nine physically but it's totally not the case because women are much more attracted to the whole package or attracted to the man not just how he looks but how he carries himself his body language his confidence how he speaks his tonality the way he moves through a room and then even more importantly status which is do other girls pre-select him and want to be with him and even if he's really ugly and short and bad-looking if the other you know eights and nines and in the room are good enough now if he's good enough for them then guess what they're like oh who's that guy like she must he must be you know something else to be pulling these sorts of girls and it's like that status is what unlocks you know the all of those opportunities for guys but until we realize that we're just like oh I'm just no good good looking enough or maybe like I have one client who's you know he's not he's not really in the group he's just a guy where I work with one-on-one he's very wealthy and you know professional poker player but his mindset is totally screwed up he wants to actually get the surgery where they lengthen your legs oh I heard about that oh my god yeah and he's not that short he's like five eight five nine and he's like well if I had two or three more inches I'm like dude first of all you can buy the shoes that have the insoles he's like well I want to do that and the other thing I'm like you're breaking your legs like there could be serious serious complications from that you might never walk again but he's so fixated he just can't understand this this concept of status and pre-selection yeah even though I you know I've taken him on trips before where it worked but like he he has everything to have the status right yeah he's already a celebrity like how much more he's uh you know he's a little on I think on the autism spectrum so some of these concepts you know he's quirky some of these concepts are very difficult and yeah and that's a challenge and I'm you know trying to to really drive that point home but you know some some of us take longer to realize than others I guess you can say yeah yeah okay so Dan goes to the immersion you're foam owing yeah nine months later you come back and yeah do the next immersion which was well so why did you want to go to that what was like oh it's because they get the hotter girls right yeah it was mainly to get harder girls yeah and I saw that transition in Daniel so on the immersion but also and you weren't later you joined the group like when you came into the immersion I remember a couple two months before I think yeah yeah I think that it was exactly because I think you were trying to set up the immersion and you know we were like confirming it before so once we confirmed it I joined but there was some time before that yeah and my main motivation was because I felt like Dan and I were was sort of like equal he was for sure better looking and like getting also I thought at that time just naturally like better girls from that but also the immersion and later I saw him improve a lot and understand things a lot better and I just felt like well if it worked for him then it could also work for me I guess that for me there was it was a lucky coincidence that he did it before me but that's how it was and then I decided yeah I should do the immersion well that was a pretty special immersion because we had five that's the most advanced group I've ever had you it was you Dan Nick Adam and Jacob and all of you guys were pretty much like doing very well when it came to generating attraction right basically what we did most the time was just a lot of day game and then I wanted to really kind of shock you guys with bringing hot girls around in a sexual environment and I think the the night you showed up in the beginning I had yeah I had Igor come in and and have the he brought two girls and we did a whipping and spanking and live squirting demonstration you know that was possible back in my old place of place of living which was fun but I remember you said you had a pretty insightful aha moment from that yeah so the two girls they were shockingly hot blonde dressed up in these tight leather pants and then I remember there was this one girl she we kind of like locked eyes and were just smiling and then the other guys I felt like didn't really spank her that hard or I don't know like I just tried to do exact the exact same thing that Igor was doing and I felt like nobody else was really actually paying attention to the details so I was whipping her so good that she was like oh you're lying you did this before well it generated like a shit ton of attraction I and I could feel she would like me but I was just so in my I I just felt like she was so hot that she was like three times out of my league that we went to the club together and nobody was kind of talking to her and I just felt even too afraid to talk to her because I was like fuck I'll fuck this up so I'll feel bad and then you told me the next day well like she'll like you and one totally could fuck this girl like single it's just like having a great time that felt so bad I I still remember it to this day it was like so bad so painful emotionally but I didn't forget it I was like fuck so next time I really will just go for it and take that risk and I think just this one huge where I was there and then you pointed it out I was just like I missed this huge opportunity and it felt so painful that then afterwards I was really motivated to go for it because I was like damn I don't want to miss this opportunity again right Yeah, it's often those moments of, you know, narrow misses, or I, you know, it slipped through my fingertips. Those are the ones that hurt the most, but also provide, I think, the biggest learning, because it's like, it's so painful that you're like, I am not going to let that happen again, right? And that's the inspiring sort of, that's the thing that creates the inspiration for massive action following. So yeah, was there anything else that, obviously, you know, that was, I think that was a shorter version that we typically do, that was just like a Thursday through Sunday. Was there anything else that you got out of that experience that, like, were you able to make that? Well, I know you kind of stayed in town with the other guys and, and basically, like, you know, went, went crazy for the next couple weeks, but like, just from the actual event, was there anything else that really stuck out? Yes, there were two really big things. So one were, I learned a lot about the social circle, which was completely new to me, or somehow I kind of like, would feel like I read it somewhere, but then couldn't really create and believe this image in my head. But it was, I think, something what I had to experience actually in person and to see to really believe in it. So I think that was really amazing that you got all these girls, and obviously, like, I knew none of them, but then I could, I could see how the dynamics change when you stack an environment in your favor. And I think also going just a glimpse of the future, I think that experience gave me a lot of confidence to host these events and parties, because I always would feel, I think, a little bit shied out. And I was like, oh, what if I invite three girls, and they know that I kind of try to talk to all of them? What if I'm getting found out? What if they all know you were hitting on them? Exactly. So that was one huge thing. And then the other thing... And not caring, realizing, like, who cares, right? Exactly, exactly. No, I was super afraid of that. So that's why I never really did it. I always wanted to have my safe one-on-one date, trying to hide from girls that I was also talking to other girls, maybe even lie about that, and, you know, which is bad. So that was the one thing, to see the dynamics change. And it was such a big change, I couldn't believe it, just from one-on-one attraction-wise. The other thing was, which I think was one-of-a-kind, playing these games like Sexy Jenga. So the Jenga games with the wooden blocks, and then you write things on the stones, which kind of help you get things forward, you know? Yeah, so that I can explain that a little bit better. So I found over my, you know, journey through this stuff, that there were some fun games you could play in a group environment that would encourage people to, like, push their boundaries and have a good time, and, you know, everyone in a social situation, like, if they're a little drunk and they're having fun, like, they want to do something memorable. They want to do something, like, a little bit crazy. So I actually remember, I was traveling in Germany, in Dusseldorf, and my wingman was being like a loser, he didn't want to go out that night, so I went out alone and started talking to one girl at the bar, and turns out she was with four other girls and four other guys, so a group of nine, and they needed one more guy to play this game. And I was that number ten, right? So they had a bottle of whiskey in the middle of, like, a circular table that we were all standing around, and then one girl, and we lined up girl, guy, girl, guy, girl, guy around, and then the girl was just like, okay, don't drop the ice, and she just, you know, puts a cube of ice in her mouth, and she passes it to me, you know, so we, like, kiss to exchange the ice, and then I kiss the girl to my left, and then the ice keeps going around, and when the ice either melts or someone drops it, you have to take a shot. And I'm like, this is the greatest thing ever, I just made out with two girls. And then we, like, rotate, right, so by the end of the game, you've made out with every girl there, and the way that they pass the ice is very obvious if they like you or not, right? So they're, like, really fast, like, trying to pass it, so there's, like, no, like, actual kiss happening, versus, you know, they'll pass it really slow, and it'll get a lot of tongue in there, or they'll, like, intentionally, like, let it, like, you know, bite it, chew it a little bit so it, like, dissolves in your mouth, and I'm like, this is fucking genius, like, I need to be playing this game all the time. So I started, you know, always trying to build that ice game into my sort of parties and my repertoire, and then I was like, all right, well, what else can we do that's, like, a fun sort of social thing where that allows people, you know, it gives them the option to, like, push themselves, but it's, you're not forcing anyone. You can opt out of the game. If you don't like the game, you don't have to play, right? So we made this Jenga, sexy Jenga, I guess you can call it, like, you said, you write things on the blocks. You write, like, kiss the person to the left, kiss the person to the right, exchange shirts with someone, like, a different gender, right? Give a spanking, get a spanking, give a lap dance, right? So you don't know which block you're going to pull, but you pull that block, and you got to do something. And then we created, like, an X-rated Jenga where we put a little black dot on the really bad, you know, Jenga blocks. You pull one of those out, and it's like, you know. I can give a fun one. One was lick a girl's pussy, and that's, I remember what I had to do, I think it was the immersion or the week after we had a party, and yeah, I mean, sure enough, it worked. Well, the game escalates, like, in the beginning, it's like, oh, a little kiss here, a little kiss there, you know, then people are making out, and then it's like, lap dance, and it's like, naked lap dance, and then it's like, lick a girl's pussy, and the game is escalating, it's like, okay, this is what we're doing, this is, like, the new normal. And then, to take it even a step further, I developed this other game called Spin the Bottle, Truth or Dare. So obviously, everyone knows Spin the Bottle, you spin the bottle, you kiss the person it lands on, right? But Spin the Bottle, Truth or Dare is, you spin the bottle, and whoever it lands on decides truth or dare, and then the group as a whole gets to come up with that truth or dare. And I've played this game so many times that whenever I play, people are just like, Robby, you choose all the truths and all the dares, because I'm able to, like, use my social awareness to be like, all right, clearly, they like each other, so I'm gonna involve her in a dare with this guy, and maybe this other girl, like, one example, I'll be like, all right, you're gonna close your eyes, and three people are gonna come and kiss you, and then you keep your eyes closed, and then you have to say who was who, right? And so I'll be like, you know, you go second, this girl goes first, and that girl, you know, goes next order, right? So then all three people do it, and then they guess, and you can obviously, you know, have that escalate, like, feel this person's boob, or do this, like, when you get people involved, people love it, it's just like so much fun, right? It's juvenile, but it's fun, it's sexy, and if you're able to quarterback a game like that, you can literally, like, get people, you can kind of be like the sex Cupid role, like, I was, people would love to come to my parties, because everyone would get laid, right? Like, the girls would love it, the guys would love it, because it's like, if they could just show up, and Robbie's gonna basically, you know, be the puppet master, and be like, I know I like this guy, or, it's very obvious when you're playing the games who likes who. And you can, you know, got my cousin laid during that game in Berlin when we did this. You know, nothing would have happened with the girl, had I not, and Maria, my wife, helped to orchestrate that. So you experienced, we played a lot of Spin the Bottle, Truth or Dare, Jenga, that week, right? Yeah, it was, the biggest surprise was, I think I would have, like, if you explained it to me on a Zoom call, or like, hey, you have to do this, I would not do it, I would feel uncomfortable, I would not believe that it would work, and then, because I would have probably a lack of social awareness, creativity, and just, maybe this is a little bit like, I don't know if this is gonna work, girls would pick up on that, and I would have totally fucked it up. So, just, I think, being there, seeing you orchestrate it, and seeing how much the girls loved it, how much it was totally fine and normal for them, and, you know, they even like love it, it was so astonishing to me how much girls are into that, and then once I saw it, I was like, okay, I actually saw this, this works, I had this belief that it worked, and then, when I stayed longer with a few of the guys after the immersion, then we pulled it off very successfully because of that. Right. And I've never been able to, like, explain this to some guy and have him successfully pulling off, pull it off without seeing it first. Yeah. Like. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, maybe they, it's usually just because they don't try, because they feel like they can't do it, or, you know, there's anxiety there, I don't know, but I'm guessing almost zero have tried, because they're like, eh, it seems weird, it seems awkward, I don't know, I don't get it, right? So maybe I'm not explaining it as properly as I could, I feel like I did a pretty good job right now, so maybe someone who's watching this at some point will be like, Robbie, I tried that, and it worked, and I didn't need to see it, so hopefully that's the case, but yeah, you're hearing it from the horse's mouth, like, it fucking works, it's fun, and the girls like it more than the guys, that's the crazy thing. Yeah, for sure. They, like, my wife loves to be the one playing the game, and when she's the one telling people what to do, and she's the one telling girls what to do, it just gets way out of hand really quickly. Yeah. I remember in Bel-Air, it was like, two girls were like, you, take off your pants. And that girl took off her pants, her underwear, so. Did we have one girl, like, flash the street, and then, like, run down to the street, and like, do something crazy, and shoot, yeah, anyways. For another day, guys. Yeah, so, all right, so getting back to the story, that next week, or was it two weeks, you and the guys stuck around, and just, you know, rented a spot in Airbnb, and just tried to throw parties, and approach girls, and you expressed to me that that was, like, a huge, like, you know, learning curve. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Yeah, we were, I mean, you build so much momentum and flow in the immersion, I felt like, and the other guys felt like it would have been, like, a waste to just, like, go back to a normal environment, or whatever, to, like, cut off that momentum, so we both stayed two weeks longer, and we really acted on everything you said, and we had a three-bedroom apartment, so each of us had his own room, and then, we had one small, kind of, living room area, which was perfect for, sort of, the party setup, I remember, like, some of the girls there were really into, like, hookah shisha, I guess it's, like, different in every city, but that was a thing, so we always, like, had one there, because we knew the girls would love it, I personally hate smoking, I never smoke, so it was not for me, it was just for the girls, for the environment, and we had the sexy Jenga there, the truth was there, and all we did was, every guy tried to bring at least two girls, or, like, two girls was usually, kind of, what we were going for, two girls to actually show up, so we had a two-to-one ratio, at the very minimum, one girl, which was still, kind of, fine, and then, we were, literally, just trying to do all the things we learned about the week prior, with you. And after that, is that when you, kind of, feel like you hit, like, your stride, like, because, I mean, from what I remember, yeah, you got really good by the end of that time, and you've continued to improve, it's not like you're putting as much focus time into it, I think, as of late, because, you know, you're in a pretty decent school, doing a lot of studying, and, you know, but I'm impressed after seeing you here this week, you know, certainly, you haven't digressed at all, I think you've definitely gotten better, you've gotten more confident, you own your, you really own, like, your physicality, your size, your body language, like, you do a really good job of making girls feel comfortable, but also, like, using your physicality to create attraction, and that's always cool to watch. So, what, kind of, what changed, I guess, after that experience, and up until now? So, once I did it with you, it was in a different city, I always had this mental block that, like, the place where I live, where I had, I had my apartment, I had all my setup, technically, like, I could have so much more, because, like, I just have my apartment, my setup, right, when we went to the immersion, it was a different city for me, so some of the things I have at my home, like, a really good sound system or something, or, like, lights that I could purchase, like, we didn't really have, but in my head, it was like, oh, in my city, I can't do it, it's like, the girls are like this, or that, or, I just can't do it because of X, Y, Z, but then I did the immersion with you, in a different city, and then I, I also like traveling, so whenever I had, like, two weeks off, I would, like, I traveled with some of the guys in the group, since I made more friends, I got to know more people. It wasn't just Dan and me, there were always other guys involved, so we got to know each other. The biggest thing is, once I did it in at least two separate locations. I think it wasn't necessary to do it in two, but for me, I just felt like that was what it took. I had the confidence to be like, okay, I can do this anywhere. It's not like bound to one spot or one environment. So then I think the biggest change was when I got home, that I could successfully incorporate everything what I learned. I think I went less crazy on the party and house party thing, because for me, I do zero online dating, game zero. So it was just involving more time, I guess, on a regular basis. I love that you do zero online dating. It doesn't mean you do zero Instagram, and that's an important point. No, Instagram I tried to do a lot, but I do zero of these Bumble, Tinder, the traditional dating apps. You just found the quality sucks, right? Exactly. I found I did at least two, so on a beauty scale 1 to 10, at least two numbers down than I would do in day game. So then I was like, well, it's just not time efficient for me. I'd rather work Monday, Friday, not worry about all this stuff and girls being flaky. I have a friend, you met him this week. He's way better looking and ripped, and I see him having to deal with all these flaky girls. And then I'm like, at day game, I have zero competition. It's very obvious to me when a girl texts back, it's usually, I can tell, but it's also you have a much higher response rate. And if a girl is like, hey, let's do it, I have a really low flake rate. And I felt that even with guys who are much better looking and online game, I feel like it's all about looks and really high quality pictures. Maybe even more about the picture quality or having a great set of pictures together. But definitely I would say looks, for obvious reasons, is a bigger factor than personality because you just can't really talk. And I just felt I rather have my non flaky, better, hotter girls for day game. Well, this guy we're speaking about, your buddy, yesterday his flight was delayed. So instead of leaving at 6 p.m., it got bumped back to 6 a.m. the following day. And he's on his phone, sitting in the living room, triple texting this one girl he went out with the night before, trying to get her on a date so he can smash before he leaves. And we went out to get coffee. He met a girl. I pushed him to approach a girl in the coffee shop. He got her number. She was cute. So I'm like, dude, why don't you just go out with her? And in the meantime, while you're waiting for her, do more day game. Why are you sitting here on your phone texting girls on Bumble when there's beautiful women walking around in real life? Get off of your device. And he did. And what happened? So, yeah, I think he joined us approaching because we were trying to get him out. So he joined us approaching and he approached one girl, which was actually really, really nice. She had great walk, nice body language, very sweet. He approached her and it was a Monday. So it was not even like Saturday or whatever. It was a Monday afternoon. And he approached her and I think she was going somewhere. But fair enough, they changed Instagram and then they scheduled for later that evening. He even told her like, hey, I'm leaving in the morning, but I want to see you. And she was like, well, he's leaving, but still I want to meet him. So they met up at 1030 and they went to... Usually we say, never say you don't live there. Say, oh, I might move here. That sort of thing. Because a lot of, you know, a lot of girls like, oh, this guy's leaving tomorrow. He's just trying to get it in. So that's the point. But if you're actually leaving tomorrow and you know for sure and you're just going for that Hail Mary, then... I mean, you should do it. Yeah. I mean, he had nothing to lose because he's going tomorrow anyway. So better to be confident upfront about it. And, you know, she had something to do, but it was like, hey, I'm free after 1030. So they met at 1030 at this really great lounge, vibey cocktail place, which another friend of the group who lives here recommended. So he had a great setup there. He had a date. And then I'm pretty sure, I don't know if he had the second venue or not. Because he didn't have time to talk about it. He still has to write up the message. He ended up going back to her place. Exactly. He ended up going back to her place and then fucked her and stayed there even till 4 a.m. And it seemed like... Went straight to the airport. Yeah. He almost missed his flight because he wanted to stay longer. But yeah, and I literally told him like, hey, please write up the story in the Discord and then tell me how much better was that than you're trying to do Bumble Game. Right. Last day leaving Bumble Game. It's like, yeah, guys get so, you know, just kind of like in these bad habits of just like, you know, going on Bumble, swiping for way too much time every day. Because, you know, these apps are designed to hijack your brain. They're the same way that a slot machine works in Vegas. It just keeps you there. You just keep swiping because it's addicting. You know, the machines know. So anyway, so in terms of like your overall growth, is there anything else that you wanted to highlight? And I guess like, what do you want to work on going forward from here? What's the next step for you? That's a great question. Can you keep that question in mind? So we were at the immersion year after Riot. I could incorporate many of the things in my normal life. I honestly think my next really unlock was the Berlin immersion. I wasn't a participant, right? I was an assistant coach. So I felt that I could teach a lot of the guys kind of the basic things that I felt really, really helpful. And also I could share some insights from the immersion before, which I had with you. And I felt like some of the guys found that really helpful. So that made me proud. But even myself on that immersion, I felt I learned a lot about the drug game, which was very new to me. But I realized that some of the party girls, like I never did to that point, never did any drugs in my entire life. I guess if you're in Berlin, I mean. Exactly. In Berlin, it's like super, I didn't smoke Mariana just because I hate smoking. I can't smoke. So I didn't even do that. But exactly, we were in Berlin and I just felt like... Seems like more people do like, less people drink alcohol versus doing MDMA or whatever party drugs, which I think alcohol is the worst drug on the planet. They've actually done studies to show that that's the case. In the US, right? It's just this booze, booze, booze, booze. And that's normal. But Berlin's a little different scene. Yeah, exactly. So yeah, I also think alcohol is one of the very few drugs which make you aggressive, which you drink too much. So yeah, even in Germany, which you would... Yeah, right. Because we were in Berlin, even in Germany, there were these discussions about legalizing now this stuff and a lot more open. I think from the outside, it's kind of like viewed as a more strict country or whatever people were, but even there, it's getting more loosely. Anyways, what I found out is that a lot of the hot girls who also like to party, they just naturally get exposed to these things. And I just felt sometimes I couldn't share anything. When girls would talk about drugs, or maybe even taking one, I felt like I was like, okay, I'm like, really out of the place. I don't know anything about it. So that was really helpful for me to learn about that. And for me personally, I think, so I took once MDMA on that Berlin immersion, I just felt it helped me very much with vulnerability and things that I tried to hide from girls of my past. And I just felt... And this is, MDMA is a drug designed specifically by therapists, psychologists to help people access those emotions. And it gets a really bad rap, I think, in the media. Like, no one's ever died from taking MDMA, as far as I know, maybe one person for who knows what. But you compare it to alcohol, it's a silly comparison. But that was also my experience when I tried those substances back in the day. It was very much a way for me to kind of connect with my emotions, and become more vulnerable and express myself in a different way. And had a lot of fun. Yeah, exactly. I mean, I read obviously about it. And it's also used in PTSD treatment. So post traumatic stress disorder, if you're like a soldier, you saw so many, you know, maybe traumatic events to help you get over them. And I just felt in the environment, really, really comfortable. And I think that was like, the main and only reason why I decided to do that the first time. And I just felt I could really open up to girls and connect on a much deeper level. And going forward, I think I've only did it twice in my life so far. So it's not like, oh, I'm doing it every weekend, whatever. No, it was just for me to go through this experience to then learn that I can be much more open and vulnerable when the time is right with a girl. And that would lead to a much deeper connection and more trust. Obviously, that is more like when you already know a girl a little bit more, you don't do it at the very beginning. At the beginning, you want to have attraction, but then it's also very attractive to girls, or at least I made the experience that it forms a connection if you can then also open up about other things later. Yeah, and have that experience together. Exactly. So that was the main thing. And then what I did again, I stayed longer with a few of the other guys in Berlin. And we again tried to do the social circle. And I think it was three weeks and I've never been in Berlin before in my entire life. So I knew zero people there. And then me and another friend, we brought 10 girls each to a party. And we had a huge party. And I saw how girls were like, really going out of their way to talk to guys. Because obviously, we had way more girls. I remember there were like two girls hitting on you like crazy. Like, oh my god, I love the dogs and everything. And then the whole next summer after that, I still got messages from girls like, hey, when are you back in Berlin? Because it was so good that they saw it once and they felt like, holy fuck, nobody else ever did this great of a party. So it's a just making the girls have fun. But then obviously, also, they enjoy being with cool guys, competing for them. It also feels much more an achievement for them, I think. Yeah. So I guess to kind of like hit the major points along the way for you, it seems like you found some local guys, you started approaching, got over your anxiety. You got some coaching to kind of pinpoint some of the things you were doing wrong. Body language correction. Sexually, like you talked about at the going to that ZGIT festival. And then learning a little bit about drug culture and not really drug culture, but just partying in general, like what beautiful women are exposed to. And then not wasting your time with online dating, using Instagram to showcase your lifestyle, posting consistent stories. So girls are like, when are you coming back? Or I want to come to this cool thing you're doing. They stay top of mind and remember who you are and reach out to you. Yeah. And then doing it for yourself, helping other guys as a coach. And it's been a really cool sort of experience for me watching you because you've been so, like, very much a validation for me that what I'm teaching works. It's awesome. Because I'm like, well, to be honest, I can pull it off. Right? It must work. Because when you came to me, I was like, oh, my God, this guy. Dorky, bald, poorly dressed, like, you know, and now you're just a total, like, machine beast, you know, so it's been a very cool journey to watch, and I appreciate you allowing me to, like, you know, be your mentor and coach and, you know, along the way, so that means a lot. No, yeah, same. I felt really thankful that my other friend somewhere found you out, because I think you were really hard to find back in the day, so. Yes, I'm trying to become more easy to find by, you know, making this sort of content, but yeah, definitely was, still am a little bit hard to find, unfortunately. So let's, let's open it up, we've got a few guys on the call. I think the last question you asked was what my thing is for the future. Oh, what's your next step? Yeah. I thought about that a lot, and I think I kind of came down to three things, so one, which I learned at this immersion, so I'm, I'm really thankful that you invited me, because even though, you know, I'm helping, I also learn a lot, so, so one thing, what I want to do is use Instagram much more, because I felt I've been decent, but, you know, there's a lot to optimize, and I felt that we discussed this a lot, you're probably going to make more content about that, I have a feeling we have guys who are really good at that, we convinced, like, one of our friends, Ford, to do it, just because he saw the power of it, to use Instagram much more, and I already tried this the last few days to, you know, always upload three, four stories, and sometimes film something, and I kept in my head, okay, I'm going to post that later, I'm going to post that tomorrow, where I know I'll work the whole day, it still looks like I'm doing some cool shit, that's the one thing, the other thing, what I also tried this week, hilariously failed, was to do something more like three sums, because I haven't done too much, but I was also never, I think, that I got into it, maybe because I was also, I don't know, maybe not comfortable with that a few years back, but right now I think it's just naturally something I just want to do and see how I feel, and get it off of my bucket list, or, you know, have, like, one main goal, who's maybe, like, also bisexual, and then see where that goes. You were pretty close the other night. Yeah, exactly, exactly. I got home after walking the dogs, and I, you know, peek around the corner, and Guillaume's out there on the balcony with a girl, and, you know, like, it looks like they're about to hook up, so I, like, scamper away, and then I guess you guys did hook up, and after you're like, well, why don't we go try to find another girl for a three sum, which you almost successfully pulled off. Yeah, we almost did it, yeah. She wanted to call her friend, because she was like, well, my friend is down, she wants to fuck me, so, but then her phone completely died, so then we were just on the street trying to find another girl, you know, that girl... Throwing Hail Marys on a Monday night. But yeah, that was, that, for me, I remember, I had a huge sort of period of growth when I started being, like, just owning my lifestyle, my desires, my sexuality, I found a girlfriend who was very much into other women, and we went threesome hunting four or five nights a week. We maybe had, I don't know, before we got into, like, the swinging scene, because we had so many threesomes that eventually we were like, this could be probably a lot easier if we just go to, like, sex parties and do stuff like that, but, like, it was much different, because all those people who had, that we met at the sex parties, they had, like, never, they didn't have those skills to, like, go out and create threesomes, we just got lazy after a while, like, let's just meet couples and hook up, but that period of growth was insanely eye-opening for me, and, yeah, that's interesting, I feel like you're kind of right on the precipice of that. You're a lot younger, I was doing that stuff when I was, like, 30, 31, so you're 25, right? So, yeah, but I think that's a good next step for sure. Yeah, that would be the main thing, and the last thing to kind of host more parties, kind of by myself, I felt like... Or be the one generating, not by yourself, like, but be the one in charge, you could say? Yeah, exactly, because right now, always it was somebody else kind of owned the environment in the group, but I think it will be easier going forward if I have a job and everything, but what I find, kind of looking back, what I find I'm really grateful for, that I could kind of do almost all of this with basically zero money, like, broke student, like, right now, also through you, and you have a lot of successful clients, it's, like, really great to see other people, they can, like, it just gets easier setting up an environment and so on, if you don't have to, like, worry that much about money, but it's really just something which is reinforcing your game, so if your game sucks, you'll just be a bigger sucker, you'll get scammed by girls on, like, girls who just, how do you say, seeking, you know, sugar babies, you go to strip clubs, you just lose 1k and got, like, nothing out of it, you'll just get horribly scammed, but if you have confidence, if you have game, then it just unlocks and makes a lot of things easier, you can, like, hire people to set up your party stuff, to go shopping, like, I always found it painful to go buy all the booze, carry the bag, I was so fucking sweaty, I always had to take a shower, and it's always planned, like, that extra pair of clothes, just to go fucking booze shopping, you know, so it's always, like, waste of time, no fucking car, like, nothing, so, but you can do everything of this without money, so I think, looking back, I'm really grateful to do it, because now I'm in my head, like, okay, like, I don't need money to do it, but obviously going forward and also seeing a lot of the other guys who successfully coached, it just gets easier and it reinforces your game and the skills you have, so I think that's kind of the natural last thing, which I want to do to just, yeah, do cooler environments, make it more funny. Well, I remember I got advice from an older guy, and he's like, you should, you should experience life as a man with money and game before getting married, because there's nothing like that experience, I'm like, I think I heard that when I was, like, 31 or 32, and maybe I was in a relationship, I'm like, okay, I'm out of that, because, like, when you hear something and you know it's true, like, you do that, and so, you know, I really started making pretty good money at the age of, like, 33, and from the age of, like, 33 to 38, you know, I mean, guys who follow the podcast have seen the party trips on yachts and villas and crazy stuff that I did, and with money, it just unlocks an amount of abundance that's stupid, but if you don't have the game, forget it, like, you will get none of that, and it's just that having the money, like you said, can unlock those, like, you know, mega, mega experiences, but without the game, you have zero chance, and you're just gonna get, you know, totally screwed, so. Exactly, that's, just hearing those stories, it's like, okay, I really wanna have it, it's on my bucket list, so, you know. I highly recommend it. Oh, for sure. Well, cool, let's open it up to questions. I've got a question, if no one's going. You talked about your height, and you're not recognizing it as an asset until you started doing this, and I relate to that a lot, because, same for me, like, I sort of, I was like, yeah, people would tell me I was tall, but I was like, I'm not getting results, so it must not be as important as they're making it out to be, and, yeah, so here, I relate to that, and then seeing you go out this week, going out with you, sort of seeing you take that confidence, and be very direct in your approaches, and just sort of have that, like, you know, very, almost like bare bones, deep voice, masculine, just sort of approach, like, hey, like, even at night, you know, just like, hey, what's up, this is me, kind of thing. I was wondering, like, how long did it take you to get over that anxiety, and to be comfortable in that, like, very masculine sort of frame of mind, where, let's say you go up at night to a bar, and you're just like, hey, guys, what's up, kind of thing. I just got a lot of sort of positive reinforcement from girls, so I remember one night, I was going out to a bar with my wingman, Dan, and I opened to girls, and I literally said, hi, I'm Johannes, this is my friend Daniel, and then these girls were, like, super open, and everything, and then they told us the, like, day later, when we had a date, and everything, that, oh, that was so cool how you, like, approached us, and I was like, okay, cool, well, maybe I'll just do that more often, and then I feel also like girls are really, really good at telling if you have confidence or not in very, very few seconds, so, yeah, I mean, it's hard to say, I just, I also felt like the hotter girls I got with, especially after the immersion with Robbie, they would just love it so much more when, when I was, I feel like, a more masculine version, and I feel like, right, that's also, yeah, I feel like, right now, in, like, the media, or in general, you know, it's, there's a lot of this, like, toxic masculinity stuff, and I feel like it's sometimes away from reality, where, like, girls actually like masculine guys, so I just felt like I was owning it more, because I felt that girls who were submissive and feminine, which are the girls I'm into, would love it much more, so I was like, well, it's just a natural filter, I could still kind of go up and try to be the clown, but it also, I think, just is more of a mismatch with just how I look and how I naturally am, so I just made a really good experience to be less gamey and just be like, hi, I'm whatever, what's up, this is my name, and then, you know, they will either love you or hate you, yeah, I don't know, like, during, I would say, less than six months to get over it, it was just, it was just kind of, like, more owning myself, getting positive reinforcement from girls, but it was just also just being comfortable myself, and it's just like, hey, I, like, I remember, maybe, like, three years before, I sometimes tried, like, a technique I heard, or say something which wasn't really me, but I was like, well, I'm gonna use this, because I think it will work, but then I just realized, no, I can just be myself, I can get away with almost anything, and I made those experiences, because over time, I just transitioned from doing something, because I think it would work, to just say or answer something in a way that I think is true, you know what I'm saying, it's just like, sometimes, for example, like, girls would say something, oh, this is such a cool movie, blah, blah, and then I was like, well, this girl's really into this movie, so I'll just be like, oh, yeah, that's an amazing movie, do you also know this other one, and just kind of try to build on this positive thing, because I think it would work, because, you know, it's something we have in common, or it'd be like, okay, cool, but now, if it's something which I generally find uncool, then I would just be like, no, that's a horrible movie, oh, my god, how can you watch this, exactly, like, disagreeable, I just, like, make fun of her, and then she will be like, no, no, no, and start, like, justifying herself, and come back, and it's just like, if I'm true to myself, I could just see through experience, through time, that I could just get away with so much, and girls would almost respect it more, if I'm just, like, true to myself. Yeah, that's a really important point, and that's the difference between, like, consistently generating attraction, I think, a lot of the time, versus guys who are kind of doing the nice guy thing, they're way too agreeable, they, you know, they want that connection, they're forcing the connection, instead of just being like, I'm gonna entertain myself, like, if she says something stupid, I'm all over that, like, I'm gonna call her out, yeah, what, are you kidding me, like, is your brain broken, you know, and it's, it's, most men, like, never do that, and especially to beautiful women, so when, when a beautiful woman gets, like, called out, and put on the spot, it's, like, you know, very unchartered waters for them most of the time, so they're gonna remember you, like, one little comment, I remember one of my girlfriends, I, literally, the thing that got her attracted to me was, she, I was having an after party at my place, I had met her earlier at a night club, and, you know, but there was so many people there, and, like, I had some status, and we knew each other's mutual friends, but, like, I didn't really try to talk to her, anything that's too I knew if I tried to do that, I'd be over-investing. I knew I was having the after-party. She came back. She was writing people's names on those red Solo cups. She wrote Robbie on it, but she spelled it R-O-B-B-Y instead of I-E. I looked at it, and I threw it. She's like, what are you doing? I'm like, you spelled my name wrong, and I walked away. The look on her face, she was just like, I can't believe you just did that. That's what got her. That was the thing. We ended up like, she started following me around and giving me love. We ended up like, she had a boyfriend, but we ended up hooking up that night. We didn't have sex, but I did some tongue magic, some countdown magic on her, and got her to have a few orgasms, and then she pretty much sticking around after that. After she broke up with her boyfriend a few months later, blah, blah, blah. But yeah, just as an example of breaking rapport. It's actually funny, because even my first girl was through approaching. I was that bad. I couldn't even get one girl without it. That's kind of how I went in there. It's hard to tell. Like your very first sex experience? Yes. Really? Yes. So you were a virgin up until you were in the game? Yes. That's crazy. Yes. That's crazy. It was a one-week trip to Bulgaria. We were literally, I think, 12 dudes. It was the whole approaching thing. We did this one trip there to go to a different city, because we felt like where we were all staying, there wasn't that many girls, so we tried to go to a different city. The reason why we chose Bulgaria was totally just because of the cost. We flew there Ryanair, like cheap ass. We had a big place, but it was really cheap, divided by 13, and also the price is way smaller. It was kind of like, we just wanted to approach for one week, and it was during that week that I met a girl, and then went on a date with her, and she liked me, and then we at some point hooked up, and I remember I tried twice and I couldn't fuck her, because I couldn't get my dick inside, and then I had to ask one of the other guys, like, fuck, I suck, and he was like, no, buy lube, and then try it again. That's how I lost my virginity, so I don't know. I think it was maybe, before that trip, something like maybe nine months or something, but to be really honest, I was horrible at doing the approach, it was zero structure, it was shooting a shotgun without aim, hoping that somewhere I would hit something, it was, yeah, it was bad. I think even, like, after, if you ask me, like, a year in the game or something to get a new girl, I don't know, it depends on how many approaches you do, but maybe at that point, like, 50 to 100 approaches to get one new girl, like, I don't know, I would say, yeah, maybe, like, 50, it depends, it's obviously harder to get a hotter girl, but if you just count the approaches where they actually stop, you know, some of them have a boyfriend, some will just not give you your number, some might go on a date, but not do anything, I would say something like 50 or 60 approaches, and then whatever time you need to get those reps in, like, if you can do that in a week, then I would say it takes a week, if you need, like, a month, then a month. For me, it was just, no, I mean, I had a week where I would get 40 rejections, and I was like, fuck, I suck, and then I would take a week off, not do any approaches, maybe even two weeks off, but then, you know, I was just like, okay, well, then I would kind of get to my senses and be like, well, I'm at zero anyway, so might as well go out. I think what helped me a lot is to have a wingman, which I also think why the group is great, because it can, like, potentially find wingman or, like, maybe in your city, there's also, like, other groups or something. I remember when I started, I felt it was easier to do it with somebody else than on my own. The other thing where I just felt I was stuck is I couldn't really get with eights and above before doing the immersion, to be honest. I just didn't know how, and I didn't believe it, and I think it takes a bit of just taking risks and really just forcing yourself to kind of, like, punch through that wall, because once you're through it, you have, you just naturally build that inner confidence. If you're, like, hooked up with, like, four or five girls who you think were insanely hot, then it just, like, builds the confidence, like, well, like, going from five to six or from 10 to 11 is a lot easier than from zero to one hot girl. Those are the two things where I felt stuck. I remember, just to give my two cents, I remember feeling really stuck before I learned day game, because when I got into it, like, no one was really doing day game. I was just going out to the bars, and it was very similar to the sort of bar experience here in Austin, Texas, which is fucking terrible. It's so difficult, because there's just, like, so many dudes, and the girls are drunk, and it's cock blocks everywhere, and, you know, it's just, like, very hard to, like, create attraction and then get that interaction to, like, move forward. There's, you're just getting, girls are just, like, vanishing out of thin air all the time. Like, you have to be really, really good to get anything to, like, stick, and that's what I was doing. I was out a lot in San Diego. I was chubby, and that wasn't helping, because, you know, you're competing against, like, a bunch of frat boys and crazy dudes, and they know each other, and a lot of people are going out in their social circle, like, you know, like, and it wasn't until I started doing day game and getting consistent dates, that's when I kind of had that, like, breakthrough, similar to what you were talking about, was, you know, being able to escalate, knowing when to go for the kiss, and having that recurring, sort of, like, you know, building that roster, I guess, of girls, so. Roster. That's my favorite U word I learned this week. Roster. So, when I started, I preferred day game, because I didn't feel confident enough during night game. Right now, I really like night game, because, so, I think right now it's 50-50, but I think I really enjoy myself when I go out during the night, because it's just kind of like a, how do you say, more fun environment, like, especially if it's really good music, I enjoy myself, I feel very confident, I feel like you can have, I feel like if you're good, you can, you just have a higher probability of a same night late, so it's like, day game, it's like, yeah, you can also have a same night late, but it's, or a same day late, but some, it also kind of depends on the girl's schedule, if the girl's already out, you know, taking her to an after party, having, she's already going out to have fun, meet guys, so it's, I feel like it's easier to, like, pull a girl home the same night, so. Especially if you're doing what you're doing, which is a hybrid night game social circle thing, because, you know, it's like you have a dope spot to take girls back to, guys who are willing to, like, set up a party out of thin air, you know, so it's like, it's not just pure, I have a one bedroom apartment, I'm going out to meet girls at bars and try to pull them home alone, you know, that's a much different thing than what you're doing, yeah. I mean, also, I enjoyed myself this week, because we obviously have a great view, and I have that on my Instagram, and then sometimes, it just, in the conversation, I always make sure to exchange Instagram in the middle, not at the end, when she's leaving, it's kind of like a chase move, always naturally comes up somewhere in the middle of the conversation, I'm like, oh, I'm going to accidentally show you this story where I have this dope view, so that she has the picture, and it's like, well, I want to see that view, so then, you know, she's like, well, and literally, if a girl's like, I'm not sure, I'm like, look, you can leave at any point, but how about you come and make a story of the view, and then like, oh, yeah, sure, do you have tequila, I'm like, yeah, we have all the booze there, whatever. So, to answer your question, I started not liking Night Game, and now I start really liking it, but I also recognize, I think it takes maybe more confidence. It's harder, for sure. It's harder, because you have more competition. Yeah, and you've got a lot of competition from groups, and girls going out with their own social circle, so I've seen this, both with myself, and with all the guys I've successfully coached, it's like, Day Game is easier, because there's less variables, the simple equations, you and the girl, you meet her, you meet her later for a date, you take her through a series of dates, and you kind of book those wins when you have those experiences. With Night Game, there's just so many different variables and things being thrown at you. If you don't already have a pretty solid level of confidence and ability to be present, stay in that moment, know logistically how to pull things off, you're just not really going to get much results out of it, and you're going to spend money and get fat, and want to eat a lot of late night food if you're drinking. Not that Day Game is easy, especially at the beginning, you still have to work through that anxiety, but... Totally. Nothing's easy, unfortunately. It all is difficult until it's not. Only the hard things are valuable, that's why they're hard to get. So how do you make the transition from going out to do Day Game sessions, and that's how you're doing it, to making it a normal part of your life? I think if you hit a certain number of approaches, you lose your anxiety to a point that, when I walk down the street, and I want to go shopping, or I'm on the way somewhere, and then I see a hot girl, I just feel really motivated to just say hi, because I know I can do it, and before it was like, oh, I have this sort of anxiety, I need five warm-up approaches to come up with something witty. Just after a certain time, you just feel so confident that you're like, hey, I can't talk to this girl, I don't need a warm-up, so I literally do the whole consume, I'm like, hi, two seconds, I'm going to the mall right now to find a pair of new white pants, but you're really beautiful, so I just had to come and say hi. It's literally the exact same thing as Day Game, it's just that I felt more comfortable doing these one-offs randomly when I saw a hot girl. I also think it's important for you to also set times where you're like, okay, I'm not going to force myself to do something. One of the questions I had to that other coach was, well, how do I know when I pussy out of an approach, or when I'm not doing one? He actually recommended for the beginning to do sessions, because then it's like, okay, you have to do approaches, and then your normal life, you're just like, don't approach, because if you're actually running somewhere and you have an appointment, you don't want to be late just because you saw a hot girl. But obviously, if you're just walking around, then you should approach. I think it's just getting to a level of comfort that even if it's your first approach, it's still good enough. Yeah, I would agree. I think you got to start with the sessions, you got to make it a thing that you're going to do, and then it slowly just becomes your lifestyle, because you start to realize after doing enough sessions, when you're past the overwhelming anxiety stage, when you're really just like, please, just give me a hot girl to approach, there's no one here, and it's frustrating. When you're just out in your everyday life, and you see a beautiful girl walk by, you're just like, I'm not going to let this opportunity pass myself up, because I've spent so much time waiting around for it, so you're just going to like, hell no, I'm not going to let her walk by. I'd be an idiot. That was really the transition for me. It was like doing enough sessions eventually unlocked the ability to just kind of do it all the time. Guys, Guillaume, it's been amazing.
