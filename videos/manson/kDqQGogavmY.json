He asked, Mark, what would you say are the five best personal traits that you could have in your life? And I was like, huh, that's a pretty damn good question. I might have to go stare in the mirror and think about that for a few minutes. Hmm, what are my best five traits? I do have a pretty strong chin. That's a good one. What about my cheekbones? People never notice my cheekbones, but they're pretty underrated, I think. Could be the luscious pandemic hair. Oh, wait, fuck. I don't think he was asking about my five best traits. He was asking about the five best traits for anybody to have in life. God damn it, I'm gonna have to do another fucking life advice video. So it took me about a half a day to figure out what the guy was actually asking. That's on me, that's my fault. But before we get into the best five traits that you can develop in your life, you should know that one of them is to like this video and subscribe to the channel. I mean, everybody who subscribes to this channel is like fucking killing it. Haven't you noticed? I mean, it's like nine out of 10 single mothers say that this channel is why they're a single mother. Anyway, the point is subscribe to the channel and you'll kick ass at life. So moving on, number one, to me, the most important trait that anybody can develop within themselves, period, is self-awareness. Self-awareness is like the operating system of your psychology. Without it, nothing else runs correctly. If you don't have self-awareness, you don't realize all the mistakes you make. You don't learn from your failures. You don't adjust and optimize certain skills or habits. Moving through life without self-awareness is like driving a car blindfolded and then blaming everybody else when you get in a car accident. But perhaps the biggest importance of self-awareness is it's required to develop emotional maturity. I know, I know, nobody wants to fucking talk about their feelings here, but you kinda have to if you wanna be a well-functioning human being throughout life. Because no matter how smart you are, no matter how badass you are at cooking or coding or whatever it is you do, if you can't relate to people well, if you can't stop being a narcissistic dick face for 10 seconds, then nobody's gonna wanna work with you. Nobody's gonna wanna hang out with you. Nobody's gonna wanna date you. People tend to hate the self-awareness advice because self-awareness, it's such an ethereal thing. It's very abstract. You can't just like go take self-awareness lessons. There's not like a self-awareness coach hanging out on every street corner. Self-awareness, it's a very personal thing. It's something that you literally have to sit and do yourself. There are all sorts of cool tools that you can use to build self-awareness. You can meditate, you can journal, you can hire a therapist, you can talk to a family member and ask them, hey, in what ways am I a fuck face? And then actually listen to them and take it to heart. But mostly developing self-awareness is a constant skill and practice of simply questioning your own thoughts and feelings. Asking yourself, why am I so angry in this moment? Should I be? What could I have done better? Is that problem my fault? Is it my responsibility? By default, we tend not to ask these questions. They are mental habits that we have to build within ourselves. If you wanna learn more about self-awareness, I have a number of articles on the website. You could check out a link in the description or just go to markmanson.net slash self-awareness, motherfuckers. All right, trait number two. And this one might surprise a few of you. I think it's risk tolerance. See, everything in life is a trade-off. There's no such thing as a free lunch. You know, we all learned that in economics class. So if everything in life is a trade-off, that kind of implies that everything has a little bit of a risk to it. Every career you pursue, you have to give up other opportunities. Every person you get to know or hang out with, you have to give up opportunities to know and hang out with other people. Any skill you invest in, any practice you take on, any vacation or relaxation, you are always giving something up. Even if you're not doing anything, even if you're playing it safe and staying in the same job and living in the same place for 20, 30, 40 years, there's a risk to that of investing too much in one job or one place or one group of people. So everything has an associated risk, even if we aren't particularly aware of it. Now, with that in mind, the way I see life or I guess being successful in life is finding asymmetrical trade-offs where there is a lot of reward for a small or modest amount of risk. Now, the trick is, is being willing to take those risks because most people, as soon as they're aware that they're taking a risk, they fucking chicken out and they run home and play Minecraft. A simple example of this is talking to somebody you're attracted to. To me, this is like the best risk reward ratio that you're ever gonna find in your life. Like, let's say that you are hanging out in a bookstore and you just see a smoking hottie across the way. Now, the best thing that can happen is you go talk to him or her, you totally hit it off, you have an awesome relationship, very loving, very healing, very transformative. You spend years together, have a fucking wonderful time and becomes one of the most important experiences of your life. The downside is you might make an ass out of yourself for like 10 or 15 seconds. That's pretty good risk reward, if you ask me. Instead of risk tolerance, perhaps what I'm really saying is it's a tolerance for failure and a tolerance for embarrassment. All right. Trait number three, skepticism. We live in the 21st century, in case you didn't notice. There's a lot of bullshit out there, a lot of bullshit on this website, a lot of bullshit on other websites. Most of what you're seeing most of the time is probably bullshit, some shade of bullshit. Some bullshit's a little browner than others, but everything's got a certain tinge of bullshittiness to it. We're all aware of this in the abstract, but I think very few of us are aware of it from minute to minute with every video we watch, every article we read, every person we follow on Twitter or Instagram or whatever. In this day and age, skepticism has to be your default. It has to be your starting point. You have to assume it's bullshit until proven true, and you have to live and die by evidence, evidence in clear, rational thinking. Now, a lot of people hear this message, and I've been preaching this for years on my website and in my books, a lot of people hear this message and they're like, yeah, skepticism, yeah, fuck the establishment, fuck traditions, yeah, check out this conspiracy theory I found out, and they don't get it. It's not about disbelieving what most people believe, it's also disbelieving the shit that most people don't believe too, because that's also probably bullshit. I'm consistently amazed at the amount of people who have a raging sense of skepticism when it comes to, say, mainstream news or newspaper articles or whatever, things politicians say, but then as soon as you get some crank with a tinfoil hat in his mom's basement telling you the moon landing was fake and the earth is flat, it's like all skepticism goes out the window. They're like, oh yeah, that sounds about right. Your skepticism needs to be constant, it needs to be a persistent practice. Every video of mine that you watch, you should be asking yourself, in what ways could he be wrong? Is he full of shit? Maybe, maybe not. The tricky thing with skepticism is that it's not being anti-something, it's being neither. It's like these people might have part of it correct, but not all of it, and these people also have part of it correct, but not all of it, and you know what? I'm not an expert, so I'm not gonna decide who knows what or who's completely correct. I'm gonna live with uncertainty, and fuck, that's probably a better word for this trade, being able to live with uncertainty. Skill number four is compassion. I know it's touchy-feely, and we don't like touchy-feely things. We like to be hard, fucking stay hard, motherfucker, but you need compassion in this world, because look, I'm gonna tell you something. We're all fucked up. All of us. We're all fuck-ups. You're a fuck-up, I'm a fuck-up. The fucking, the guy who did the lighting in here is a fuck-up. Spoiler, I did my own lighting. The guy who delivered my pizza is a fuck-up. Like, everybody's a fuck-up. All of us, we all fuck-up all the time. Most of those fuck-ups, we need to be willing to empathize, and to see past the fuck-up, to understand like, okay, yeah, that guy was trying. There's a thing that I believe very strongly called Hanlon's Razor, which says, never attribute to malice what can be explained by ignorance or stupidity. And the truth is, is that most of us are pretty ignorant and stupid most of the time. Most of the evil in the world, it's really just people thinking that they're doing good. Whenever I see a situation that really upsets me, or somebody who does something incredibly incompetent, I try to ask myself, in what way do they think they're doing good? And most of the time, it's in a way that I can relate to, that I can empathize with. It's not the pizza guy's fault that he tripped on the curb coming in. Like, I'm a fucking clumsy dumbass too. Shit happens, and we're all turds in this swirling world. This is the reason that I preach against the, you know, you can be great and amazing, and everybody's a special fucking snowflake, rah. Like, I don't believe that because I think it creates false expectations that certain people should be the way we expect them to be. Which, by the way, ties into the harsh truth of the day. \u266a\u266a People are shit. We're all shit. Everybody. We suck. I mean, if you look at history and psychology and sociology, politics, we fucking suck. Like, we are terrible creatures, and that's okay. That's why we should love each other. That's why we should take care of each other because, fuck, we need it. And finally, the last skill, skill number five, I would say patience. There's a lot of research showing that our attention span is dwindling. We're becoming worse at delaying gratification. We're becoming more impulsive, more demanding. And I just think, as always, the tortoise wins the race. It's the people who have the longest time horizon are ultimately gonna make the best decisions. And that's a difficult skill to cultivate within yourself is that patience to wait through the shitstorm, to wait through the drama, to understand, hey, this might suck now, but in five years from now, it's gonna pay off, and be willing to wait that five years. That's gold, man. If you can find that within yourself and harness it, you're gonna be ahead of 90% of the crowd because the crowd's impulsive. The crowd does dumb shit because the crowd is shit. People are shit. And I guess this is why my motto and my work is helping people to be less awful. The only thing that makes us less awful is that patience, is that compassion, is that risk tolerance, that ability to accept failure, the ability to accept uncertainty, and that self-awareness to know when we're doing a good job and not. And my chin's pretty fucking chiseled if you didn't notice. All right, that's it for me, guys.
