There's a gray area in dating that so many people get hung up on, where intentions are unclear or one person has stronger feelings than the other. This gray area then causes people to try to manipulate someone into liking them, to chase after someone who isn't really into them. Fatality. And to stay in a bad relationship for far too long. Well, that shit ends today. Introducing the law of fuck yes or no. Because if you don't feel fuck yes about somebody, it should be enough. And if they don't feel fuck yes about you, it should also be a no. But the law of fuck yes or no doesn't just apply to dating, it can apply to any major life decision. Whether it's taking a new job, moving to a new city, or buying a fancy piece of furniture. Fuck no. The idea is that if you aren't sure if you want something or not, then you probably don't. So stop giving everything to people who give you nothing. After all, if it's not a fuck yes, then it should be a no."}
