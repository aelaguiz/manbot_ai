Scott, it's great to have you here. Mark, it is so good to chat with you again. One of the, the first guests on the new podcast, the old friend of mine. It's a, it's an honor to have you here. Speaking of honors, you were recently named by Stanford in the top 2% of scientists. You know, I've been a scientist for a long time, but I've never been in the top 2% of scientists. You know, I really don't like to make a big deal out of it, but technically my ranking put me at 0.05%. Who's counting. I didn't want to be like douchey about it. Yeah. I just said I did technically make the within the top 2%. Okay. So we'll, we'll edit that top 0.5%. 0.05. Oh, oh, oh five. Okay. Oh, 5%. What's interesting about that though, and you mentioned this on Twitter, you were put in a special education class. That's right. And I've actually never talked to you about this, about your childhood. And I'm curious to, to open up with that and talk about it. Thank you. I mean, it is linked to this ranking thing. Cause it didn't, it really didn't feel real at all, you know? And it's like, I wonder like what point in my life am I going to feel like a, you know, I didn't like fake it in some way we're all wondering about me. Way to make me feel better. You're like, we've all been worrying that. No, that's good. It makes me feel better when I hear that. Cause like, uh, I had friends were like, oh, we believe it. It was like, I wish I didn't need to hear that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know, for the first couple of years of my life, I had a warning to say I had basically a lot of fluid in my ears and it made it very hard for me to hear anything. I was effectively deaf for the first three years of my life. I was screaming, you know, crying a lot, crying. I don't know if that's funny. It's not funny. I couldn't express what I wanted to express. And that was super frustrating. And teachers thought I was stupid. And also they said I was immature. Um, they had me repeat third grade and, uh, I was bullied a lot and, uh, kept in this kind of remedial classroom until ninth grade. And what changed? Well, this teacher who had never seen me before, she was coming for the regular teacher. It was the start of high school. So by the way, it was like a fresh start. I love fresh starts, you know, I love when people like view you a new, you know, fresh eyes. Especially when you're not the cool kid. The fresh started. Yeah, that's right. A godsend. This special ed teacher took me aside. I was taking this on time test. They take you out of the regular classroom and they put you in the special room. And I remember how frustrated I was. And I think I made a stocky comment, like I have the rest of my life to finish this on time test. So what's the point, you know, what's the rush. She took me aside after class. Everyone was leaving. And she, um, so she won't talk to you for a second. And she's, she like kind of told her head and she's like, I think I see you. And I was like, Oh, she's like, why are you here? You know, I see your frustration. Um, and I went in my head and I was like, why am I here? And then I, I, I replayed the, the, the question in my head and then it really got to like, yeah, why am I here? It's crazy how there are moments in our life where we are just kind of waiting for someone to ask us the right question and then it can just activate everything. You know, and I, this like surge of inspiration, you know, when the search through me and I ran to the pay phone, called my mom and I was like, I'm not reporting back to special ed tomorrow. She's screaming, freaking out. She's like, what are they doing to you over there? You know what happened? But I became the first one in my school's history for the kid himself to break out of special ed. Yeah. I mean, I was the first one for it to dawn on me that, wait, I can take myself out. I mean, it was nice to be prompted and to be asked why am I still here? Yeah. But I said to her, you know what, what you're right. Like, I want to see what I'm capable of. Wow. And then did you excel in, in high school? I did. Um, I won't say I excelled in everything, but what I did is I really, um, became, fell in love with learning and with just, I almost, it almost became like a challenged, a fun challenge for myself to see, well, what can I handle? Because I went through so many years where I didn't think I could handle anything. I mean, I was in all remedial classes. It was so boring. And so I was so curious, like, what could I handle? So I signed up for like some things I did well, like Labkin Aladdin Scholar. Yeah. That was from my senior year of high school. I, um, I signed up for a West Side Story, the musical and that I did not do so well. I dropped out. I, I said, I can't handle the dancing. It's just, I couldn't handle it. Um, the orchestra. Um, so my grand, I asked my grandfather if he would teach me how to play cello because he was a cellist in the Philadelphia orchestra and he was retired at that time and he was delighted to teach me how to play and I learned over a summer how to play, how to play cello well enough to join the orchestra, at least play the downbeat of every measure in the beginning. But I quickly, the crutches came off quickly and I've realized I had a knack for music, um, must've been in the jeans, uh, somewhere with my grandfather. And I also joined the choir. Um, joining the choir was actually a fluke. I was hanging out with my friends in the choir room after class one day and I was making fun of them. And I was like, you guys sound like this. And the, and the choir teacher heard me and she said, what do you like to join our choir? Are you, I think you are really talented. And then I ended up becoming a professional opera singer for a short period of time. Wow, wow, man. So given your history, what, what's your take on standardized testing? That's been in the news a lot again lately. Uh, it's kind of a controversial topic within educational circles. What's your take? Great question. Um, standardized testing, like, um, we're talking about academic standardized testing and K through 12 is actually very highly correlated with IQ tests. In a lot of ways, they're really thinly disguised IQ tests. So if you don't have the kind of mind that ACEs, um, abstract reasoning and working memory, which a lot of people on the neurodivergent spectrum do have trouble with working memory, that's kind of their defining thing is they have trouble with organization. They have trouble, um, keeping lots of things in their mind at once. You know, they, then you'll have trouble on standardized tests. Um, uh, not deterministically, but there's a probability that you'll have, you'll have trouble in standardized tests. So I think that we need to, first of all, call spade a spade in some circles, it's even controversial to say that they're thinly disguised. You know, the SAT is a thinly disguised IQ test. It is. I have research data proving they don't prove anything in fact, but showing that to ensure highly probable the, you know, the SAT, the board, they don't want to say that. You know, they don't, they want to think that if, if rich people put in enough money, then, you know, for tutoring, then they can improve their scores, but no, it's a thinly, which is part of the controversy, right? Because if you do have a very highly intelligent child from a poor socioeconomic background, that test can actually be the thing that kind of pulls them out of that or, or maybe sorts for the excellent point. Yeah. A lot of people don't realize that, that doing well on standardized tests can actually be a golden ticket. For people who are living in poverty and can't demonstrate their intelligence in any other way. By the way, I'm not one of these people who is anti-IQ. This is how I phrased in the past. I'm not anti-IQ, but I'm anti comparing everyone on a single step standardized metric. And that's different because there are people who are generally a high IQ minds and they are not winning either. And no one's winning in education system, intellectually gifted kids from an IQ perspective are not winning. You know, you put them all in one room and say, go be gifted together, you know, buy, and then the teachers go drink coffee, how's that winning for them? Either. Yeah. So does that make sense? There's a certain level of nuance there. I like to bring to the table. Well, you brought up this term of neurodivergence and. You were actually the first person I ever heard this term from, like maybe five or six years ago. And I love that it's starting to catch on and I'm starting to see it in a lot of different places, but talk about what is neurodivergence? How does it differ maybe from other definitions of, you know, the previous categories that were, are common in parts of psychology and why is it important? Yeah. I was just on a panel in New York on what is neurodiversity. And I think no one could agree to really could agree on a definition. Classic psychology. Yeah. It's become one of those things where when a term becomes so it's starting to mean anything, it's like a rubber band it's going to snap and not mean anything. And I fear that's what's starting to happen with neurodiversity. It started off pertaining mostly or really just exclusively to the autistic community. And I'm happy that it expanded to things like dyslexia and other learning disabilities, ways of learning in a school system, it has expanded even further and I'm, I'm still okay with that to certain forms of mental illness. You know, I think bipolar, you know, it really does give you a different way of experiencing a world that puts you kind of in an extreme modality. But right now where we're at with it is I feel like it's, it's, if it hasn't snapped, it's very, very close to snapping that rubber band, because if you go on TikTok, everyone, every kid on there on TikTok has, is neurodivergent. Now the neurodivergent and trauma, you know, the two biggest buzz, they both, they now, you know, you can't even say one without the other, you know, there's almost become like a, now it's like super cool. Whereas back in my day, I was bullied every day for it. Right. There's status attached to it. I wish I grew up in 2023 because I just want to say in my day in the eighties. Yes, that's how old I am. I wish I could have gone on TikTok and get like, and for my peers to be like, Oh, that's so cool. You're neurodivergent. You're weird. You're quirky. Yeah. You're slow. That's so cool. Be part of our group. But instead I was, you know, just bullied every day. Why do you think that that status has been associated with things like trauma, neurodivergence, gender identity, things like that? I think that these kids are having identity crisis. I think that we were living in an age of identity crisis and there's so much unknown, you know, whenever your environments where there's so much insecurity around you talk about, you know, the pandemic to talk about people tend to cling more to bullying and finding somewhere where they belong. And teenagers throughout the course of human history, it's no big shocker that teenagers are the prime identity crisis age, right? So you just compound that with such great uncertainty and such a craving for belonging into some group. Personally, I think we need to help children and all of us learn how to belong more to ourselves, to our unique selves and lead from that sense of confidence and self-esteem. But I don't think that's what's happening. People are so desperate to seek belonging to a group and they've forgotten to belong to themselves. Sometimes I feel like teenagers unconsciously, they find the thing that is going to upset the older generations, the most instinctively latch onto that. And if you look back through the generations, you see that happening repeatedly, you know, like in the sixties, it was free love. And then in our generation, it was sex, drugs, rock and roll. And then, you know, with this generation, it's social media and identifying with all these different ways of life and everything. But it's interesting because it's almost like now that I am one of the older generations, I think if I saw kids doing what I was doing when I was 16, I'd be like, ah, he's 16, of course he's doing that. He'll be fine. You know, it's like, they need to find that new limit to test and get everybody, all the old people freaking out. I agree with you that adolescence period is, is just an extended identity crisis. It's the first time in your life that you are discovering who you, who you're going to be in the world and who you want to be and who you're going to associate with, I also feel like that, you know, just on a more macro scale, there's kind of this like cohort identity seeking process of like, who are we as a generation? I wish the kids didn't feel so much pressure to lock in their identity. Yeah. I wish we had cultures that really valued exploration. You know, think how many years it'd take for me to feel like I know who I am. Answer. I still haven't figured it out. Yeah, you never totally know. I'm still like, I mean, I'm much clearer than I was when I was 17, but I'm still not quite there, you know, cause I've like, there's so many sides of me, you know, and, and what I've learned to embrace is just that fact. There's so many sides of me, but I don't feel like we encourage kids to embrace that fact of being human, being a whole person. Instead, I feel like they put so much pressure on themselves and I think we put pressure on them too, to like figure it out so you can write it in your college essay and get into Harvard. Interesting enough, I think we're actually rewarding the kids the most, who like are the most fragile. So that's an interesting one. You know, you sort of, you get so many points in college essays now for the more vulnerable you are, you know, that you have all these vulnerable identities, you know, you're as fragile as possible. Do you know, please take pity on me in a 500 ways. Therefore I shouldn't get into college. Whereas in my day, I feel like we had to like write in our essays how strong we were, but I think that setting off like a process where we allow kids to show over a longer period of time, as they're trying to pursue their self-actualization, you know, being vulnerable is great. Being vulnerable is wonderful. But then also what do you do with that vulnerability? I have a phrase I coined called confident vulnerability, you know, where you can be vulnerable, but you can also have self-belief as you're being vulnerable. And also I'd like to distinguish between lowercase V and uppercase V. So lowercase V is vulnerability just for the sake of vulnerability, for getting attention, for getting something else. Capital V vulnerability is like being vulnerable in the service of realizing a future goal you have and dream growth in the service of growth versus in the service of, dare I say, narcissism. Sure. Sure. You know, I think there's a difference between lowercase V and uppercase V and I think we should reward uppercase V more. I wrote my dating book Models 12 years ago. Which was about statistical models, right? Yes. Those models. Did I read the right book? The right book. Yeah. But that book talked a lot about vulnerability and it was specifically directed at men. And I remember at the time, you know, vulnerability was much, it wasn't as common. It was much more taboo back then, especially among a male audience. And I went through great pains in that book to point out that this is not wallowing on the floor in a fetal position saying, Oh, poor me. Look at all the horrible things that have happened to me. It's actually, it's the opposite. It's being comfortable and sharing and expressing, like not being owned by. pains or struggles that you've gone through. Your book is about confidence and vulnerability in so many ways. It really is. Developing a confidence in your vulnerability. Yes. Because, you know, when you, with someone, a guy who's shy approaches a woman and is vulnerable, it's a very vulnerable thing, right? It's a form of vulnerability. To say, like, you know, hey, like, you're cute. I like you. Yeah, yeah, exactly. And then, if you're rejected, the question is, what happens? What do you do with that? I have taken, actually, consent courses. I know it sounds really, not courses. I've been part of, like, there's cuddle parties. Maybe this is too much information, but I've been to these parties where you actually- It is LA, so. Yeah. They do a whole practice where you approach someone and you say, hey, would you like a hug? And if they say, no, I'm good, then you say, thanks for taking care of yourself, and they smile and walk away. And you just practice. I don't think young people really practice that, you know, and really being able to still stay confident in who you are. Well, I will say there's definitely much more awareness around it than when we were young. That's true. Actually, that's true. Yeah. I loved your book, by the way. I was joking about statistics. No, I know. I read your book. And your book resonated with my soul a lot more than maybe some other how to pick up chick smokes. Yeah, for sure. At that time. You know, it's funny. When I wrote that, I think Brene Brown had just come out, like, that year. And it's funny, because the whole vulnerability thing, I was not aware of her when I wrote models. And then I became aware of her stuff around the same time that models came out. And I remember at the time, I was ironically being very vulnerable, like taking a big chance in my industry by saying, like, hey, the path here is not to be more bullheaded and more aggressive and less sensitive. The path here is to actually be more aware of your emotions and your flaws and your issues and become comfortable with them, develop a confident vulnerability. It's been weird over the last 10 years to see vulnerability to come and kind of dominate the culture in so many ways. I never would have predicted that it would get kind of turned into this toxic status signifier that it has become. And I remember in the early days after models came out, guys would email me. And they would say, hey, man, I tried your whole vulnerability thing. It didn't work. I, like, told this chick about this horrible thing that happened when I was a kid, and she still didn't hook up with me. I'm like, that's, dude, that's not it. There's so much there, right? Because what you were selling is different than what the pickup artists were selling. And I don't mean to go out of the rabbit hole, but there's, like I said, I won't paint all the pickup artists with the same brush, but I'll say some of them really were, their pitch was foolproof method to getting laid in five seconds upon meeting a girl. And so they already put in guys' heads some unattainable, and also, I would say, psychopathic way of thinking about women in the world and that you should be entitled to anything. So that reeks of entitlement when someone says, hey, man, I was vulnerable and I didn't get laid. That's like the nice guy syndrome, right? You think if you're a nice guy, you should be entitled to get laid, and that's not how it works. I can assure you, that's not how it works. You're like, I've been trying for 20 years. It's interesting because I feel like a lot of the stuff that I see online now feels like a permutation of that. It's like, I was so vulnerable about these things that happened to me. Give me attention. Give me likes. Give me, share my Instagram or whatever. The social media question is interesting in general. I'm curious, what is your take on the supposed link between social media and mental health crisis? What I've seen on that data and from talking to my colleagues about it, social media has had a very significant impact on mental health, and especially young girls, like 13-year-old girls. It has really magnified the pressures we already put on young girls, right? Boys aren't winning either there, right? So there's a lot of anxiety. I think that's cool that Jonathan's calling it the anxious generation, because there really is a lot of anxiety to keep up, to be as cool, to get as many likes as this person. It creates a whole comparison game that is already, since the dawn of human teenagers, has caused anxiety, that game of comparison, and it's put it- Puts it on steroids, basically. On steroids. Yes, yes. Amplifies it. And I'm 44, and I feel 17 when I'm on Instagram. I feel 17 all over again, where I'm like, oh my gosh, Bobby Shmuel gets so many likes for that post, and I don't get any likes for my post. And I try to curb that. I mean, I have better self-regulation skills than I did when I was 17, where I am like, ah, don't worry about that, Scott. It's hard. I find myself getting sucked into it sometimes as well, and it's hard in our situation as people with online platforms and online businesses, because like, let's say we post something on Instagram and it bombs, it does terribly, and I'll get really annoyed. And I always justify that annoyance or that being upset about that by like, well, it's bad for the business. You know, this is reflecting poorly on the brand, and it's going to lower conversions and all this stuff, and you know, and if there's a bunch of bad posts in a row, I'll get mad at my team. But then sometimes like when I'm sitting alone quiet at night, I'm like, am I really mad about the business? Or is it just, am I like that 15-year-old girl who's like, well, Susie is getting more likes than me. Like, what does she have that I don't? There's something really profound there, so I want to double click on that. You know, I feel as though sometimes like I ask the question, do I exist if I have no social media presence? It's the weirdest thing where we come to the point where like the extent to which a person exists is the extent to which they have a big presence. There's this one guy, and I'm not going to mention his name. He's like my arch nemesis, and he has, you know, like he can say the dumbest things, and immediately it gets like 4 million likes with 4 million comments saying, you're a genius. He'll say something like, to have confidence, you must be confident, and I'll look through like hot girl, hot girl, being like, you're amazing, you're amazing, you're amazing. Okay. I'm not jealous. I'm not jealous. I'm not jealous. I'm not jealous. Are you? But it's a fascinating phenomenon, so I sit back, and I'm like, wow, does that motherfucker, does he, does he, can I curse here? Yeah. On your old podcast called the Go Fuck Yourself Podcast. Yeah, it's the Fuck Yourself Podcast. We'll call it the Fuck Yourself Podcast. I just like renamed your podcast to the Go Fuck Yourself Podcast. This is the special edition of the Go Fuck Yourself Podcast. What's crazy too is that, I mean, at this point, at a certain level of social media following, like half the stuff that's going out isn't even created by the person whose face is on the profile picture. You know, I have a team that like goes through my 300 articles and sources different quotes and creates lists and, you know, all sorts of stuff. So at that end of the spectrum, it gets, it gets weird in that way. And then I guess, you know, on the lower end of the spectrum, if you're like a teenager and you're probably living and dying by a dozen likes, right? Like it's, you post and your best friend posts something and gets 10 likes and you post it and get four and you're like, oh, he's so much cooler. The cooler part is there, and I also think the existence part, I can't get away from that question, I just keep thinking about, yeah. If a tree falls in the forest and nobody hears it, if a social media profile has no followers, does that person exist? It's exactly right. That's exactly right. I remember the time when, like I was in grad school and there was no pressure at all to signal or showcase anything that I was doing. I was proud of whatever I was doing. Like during the course of my day, if I read a journal article, I was, and I understood it, I was proud of myself and I was good. Now there's this just feeling constantly, like it doesn't matter if it's not for everyone else to see. So, okay. I'm glad you brought that up because doesn't this happen a little bit in academia with how often you get published or what's the score on- H-index. H-index on Google Scholar. That's what the rating was. That's what this ranking was just- Oh, look at you. See? You know, maybe you're not crushing it on social, but your H-index is fucking through the roof, man. I have a big H-index. I should put that in dating resumes. I don't. That's why I have a big iPad. You're nice. I'll compensate for my low H-index. Nice. But seriously, I mean, some of this, like humans will always play status games. You're right. And I think there's this tendency, and this happened when I was a kid with different things. Whatever the new technology is, that becomes the organizer of the new status game. And then people blame the technology. They don't blame fucking humans being human. My personal opinion is I'm a little bit more skeptical of the social media stuff, but I think if there is anything inherently problematic with social media, it's that it accelerates and amplifies the status game that's already there. It makes it way more legible. It makes it way more widespread, easier to communicate, easier to reference. When we were in high school, if you were kind of a dork or if your friend was cooler than you, nobody really noticed except maybe like the 10 kids in closest proximity to you. Maybe the 10 kids that knew both of you. I think the problem now is it's if your friend's cooler than you, the whole school knows because the whole school sees they have more followers. It's so true. You know, so it's like, it's almost like ranking people instead of ranking people by grades. It's like social media is like a never ending high school and we're all stuck in it. It's exactly. That needs to be a social clip. Yeah. What you just said. Okay. Yeah. That's so true. Clip that. It's so true. It's so true. But you feel cool if you're winning in that world. You feel cool if you're winning in that world? You're winning in that world, Mark. Well, I mean, you're cool. We both are. We tend to justify and sympathize with the status schemes that we win and we blame the status schemes we lose. You know, Mark Leary, the social psychologist, has this idea of the sociometer. It suggests that our self-esteem riser falls to the base to which we're perceiving that we have social value or he calls it relational value. But I feel like social media has created a sociometer where our self-esteem rise and falls based on how many likes we get. And I think part of the trickiness there is that there was no legibility for that, right? So you could easily kind of easily convince yourself that you were much cooler than you are. You could easily convince yourself that people like you more than they actually do. Whereas with social media, where everything is being measured and the numbers are public and it's all there, completely legible for anybody to see, it becomes much harder to kid yourself. Like, if you're posting things into the void and nobody's responding, including your own family and friends, it's really hard to convince yourself that you're actually a really interesting person. It's so sad. It is fucking sad. I feel really sad all of a sudden. It is fucking sad. It is fucking sad. For people who, but also, you know, I think that even add more complexities to this conversation. There are some people where I, they have huge audiences, but I don't want that audience. Like I wouldn't feel cool if I had neo-Nazis, you know, like being like, Oh, we like your stuff, Scott. I think who your audience is matters as well as just the metric. Do you have a big audience? A hundred percent. A hundred percent. You took a break from Twitter for about a year. You're giving me way too much credit. Yeah. I mean, two months. Two months? It felt like an eternity, Scott. My feed was so empty without you on it. It might've been four months. No, it wasn't a year, but it was less than six months. So we'll say half a year. Half a year. Half a year. The break from Twitter. How did that affect you personally? I was more in touch with my body. I noticed that I was more, I felt more, my actions in my everyday life felt more authentic. I felt like I didn't, I wasn't worried or thinking about, you know, if I do that or that or that, you know, like, how am I going to be judged? Which is weird because it's not like I broadcast everything I do anyway when I am on Twitter. So it's, it's not like, but for some reason when I'm, when I'm online, I feel like every single thing I do in my life, like has a different layer of, it's like a black mirror episode that we're living in. I can't really describe it. Is it, is it like the potentiality of sharing something? Yes. Everything has the potentiality to get likes. So it's like you're at a dinner conversation, you say something really clever or funny and you're like, Oh, that'd be a killer tweet. I absolutely do do that. You know, I'll be in situations where I will say, Oh, that would make a good tweet. Hold on. Like I'll be in a conversation with someone like, let me tweet that out. Yeah. There's something extra in life that it brings me that I'm not sure it's a good thing. But someday I just want to be like, Haribo and I'm taking a break from public life. So that, that would be the big one, you know, someday where I have enough certain number of books. I'm like, you know, I'm good. Like I'm good for a year or two, you know, like I want to just say, I'm taking a break from public life and see what that's like. So in one of your earlier books, you talk about mastery goals versus performance goals. And I think this relates to social media. And by the way, I selfishly really like this concept because it maps really well to one thing I've long talked about in the relationship space, which is that there's two ways to approach relationships. One is through authenticity and the other one is through performance. And approaching relationships through performance, seeing people as kind of algorithmic, if I say or do this, then they will like me, they will give me the affection I want. When you see it in a transactional way, it, that's actually what undermines the intimacy and the health of the relationship. And so when I came across the mastery versus performance goals, it struck me how similar, the way you were describing how people's attitudes develop towards their pursuits is very similar to that. Like when people are too performative, they become overwhelmed with anxiety, they start struggling with self-judgment, they feel lots of shame. And I was like, wow, you can have a toxic relationship with a goal. You know, it's such a good point. You know, a lot of people talk about the growth mindset. They're like, they go crazy over growth mindset. Some research shows that more educators have heard of growth mindset and they've heard of the name Freud. Wow. So it's, it's big in education circles. I know it's also kind of concerning that there are teachers out there that who've never heard of the Freud. Yeah. That's also a problem. "}
