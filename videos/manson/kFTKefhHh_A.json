Do you have trouble getting any of your work done? Do you feel lethargic and uninspired to exercise? Then you need the do something principle. The what principle? The do something principle. That's right. The secret to all of your procrastination problems and working life woes is as simple as shutting the fuck up and doing something. Wow, tell me more. You people have it all backwards. You think that you're supposed to get motivated and then take action. No, it works the other way around. Action creates motivation. Motivation is not an on and off switch. It's not something that you just wake up with one day. Motivation is a snowball. It starts teensy tiny and then you get it rolling downhill. Eventually it takes no effort at all. You do a little and that inspires you to do a little more and that inspires you to do a little more. Eventually you reach the point where it's more difficult to stop doing your task than it is to start in the first place. When you're intimidated by a big task, break it up into smaller bite-sized tasks. Don't focus on writing the whole book. Write the first paragraph. Don't focus on getting an insane shape. Just focus on having a single good workout. It's the do something principle. You do something, anything and good things happen. Wow, it's magic. But don't take my word for it. Listen to these other guys. I used to think writing a book was difficult but with the do something principle, I wrote an orange book with fuck on the cover and I sold 13 million copies. Thanks do something principle. The do something principle saved my marriage. Now I'm willing to clean toilets all the time. The do something principle, now I read good, I talk good and I fuck. Help. Fuck, help. Do, do, do, do, do, do, do something principle. People assume there's some big secret to procrastination. There's not. It's just about momentum. And if your momentum is constantly being interrupted by stupid fucking YouTube videos like this one, then you're not doing something. So get the fuck off YouTube and go do something. All right, just, just go. Don't tell anybody, I never fucking cleaned toilets. Oh my God, I think I pulled a muscle."}
