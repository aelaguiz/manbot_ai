People are always asking me, what are your favorite books? What books should I read? What are the best books for somebody who is in my situation? And you know what? Today I decided we're just going to knock all these out in one go. These are 14 of what are, in my opinion, the best nonfiction books for everybody to read. And I'm going to go through all 14 of them and I'm going to give you brief one minute summaries of each of them. So buckle up because here we go. Book number one, it's called The Body Keeps the Score. It's by Bessel van der Kolk. Dr. van der Kolk is one of the founding fathers of trauma research. I believe he coined the term PTSD. He's been studying trauma since the mid 1970s. This book is all about how, not only how trauma affects you psychologically, how it affects your life, but as the title would let you know, how it affects your body, how it affects your neurology, your physiology, how it affects how you live and breathe and do things every day. And on top of that, he goes through all the different therapeutic practices, what works, what doesn't, why it works, when it works, et cetera, et cetera. So anything you could ever want to know about trauma, this is your guy. Next book, Paradox of Choice. Now, if you follow my work for a long time, you've definitely heard me reference the Paradox of Choice. The Paradox of Choice is a simple psychological finding that is actually incredibly profound. It's basically this, psychologists found that when you are given more choices, you become less satisfied with whatever you choose. Now, why does this matter? Well, this matters because modern life is full of infinite amounts of choices. I mean, hell, you got on here on YouTube, there's fucking 800 videos for you to choose from at any given moment. So any video you choose from, you're probably always sitting there looking at the sidebar being like, well, maybe that one's better, maybe that one's better, or fuck, maybe I'm wasting my time. I should be watching this dude instead. Welcome to Life in the 21st Century. We are all subjected to the Paradox of Choice. The subtitle here is Why More is Less. It is a very strong and profound argument for why we should simplify our lives, limit ourselves in various ways. Check it out. Did I break something? The next book is called The Blank Slate by Steven Pinker. It actually came out in the 90s, but it's probably more relevant today than ever before. The Blank Slate is basically this philosophical idea that comes from John Locke. And it's this idea that the human mind is born a blank slate, a clean sheet of paper, and that anything good or bad that arises in our personality or who we are is due to our influences in our environment or in the culture. Now, this line of thought has been extremely popular for centuries, and it's taken various forms. Back in the 1600s, you know, it was part of Locke's humanism and empiricism. More recently, in the 20th century, it was part of Marxism. And these days, we vaguely refer to this stuff as like woke culture. This idea that your identity can be anything you want it to be. The only thing that's confining you is societal pressures and definitions preventing you from being who you want to be. Pinker attacked this with fucking 600 pages worth of research and notes. And he basically pointed out that this is an illusion. It's a fantasy. Like we would love the idea that all the bad things about us aren't our fault. It's evil society that made us that way. What Pinker shows us is that, no, genetics play a major, major factor in all of our identities of all of who we are. There's only so much you can change of our inherent biology. And he does this in a very thoughtful way, a very fair way, very rational way. I think it's for anybody who's interested in these sorts of topics, a lot of the controversies that are going around these days around gender and sex and race and so on. This is a must read. Getting the Love You Want by Dr. Harvel Hendrix. Cheesy book title, fucking mind blowing content. Look, anybody who's fucked up in their relationships, which by the way, is all of us, should read this book. This book basically dives into the psychology of why our relationships are the way we are. You know, we've all heard the cliches of like, if you're a boy, you marry your mother, or if you're a girl, you fall in love with your father or whatever. It always kind of sounds like this woo woo hocus pocus that came from Freud or something. This book actually breaks down why that those patterns happen. And it essentially comes down to a thing that Hendrix calls our love maps. When we are children, we basically develop mental maps of how loving relationships operate. And it's just what we know to be true. So it makes sense that once we become adults, we naturally gravitate towards others with similar emotional maps. As we do. Or did I call it love map? What the fuck did I call them? Love maps? Mental maps? Whatever. You get the point. Read the book. The Denial of Death by Ernest Becker. I've referenced this book so many times in my own work. There's a whole section in Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck about this guy. This book is absolutely incredible. Becker's argument is really, really simple, but quite profound. And it's basically that most of our motivations in life, most of the things that we find purpose in, it's because we're terrified of dying. In fact, we want to deny or avoid the reality of our own mortality. And the way we do that is by undertaking massive projects. Projects that will outlive us, whether that's writing a book, whether it's raising children, whether it's putting our names on buildings or creating a project that's going to change the world. These are all goals that give us a sense of purpose. But really what that sense of purpose is, is the ability to forget that we're going to die. Influence by Robert Cialdini. If you are at all in marketing, sales, publicity, this is a must-read book. This book is based on decades of psychological research into how people are persuaded and influenced to make various decisions, whether that is to help somebody else believe a certain thing or most importantly, to buy a certain product. And it's actually pretty incredible the amount of triggers that we have in our psychology that make us susceptible to making certain decisions. Not only is it useful for any sort of marketing profession in terms of understanding how to get people to buy things, but it's also important as a consumer to understand how you're being manipulated by all these marketing messages. Atomic Habits by James Clear. This book is fucking everywhere these days and there's a reason for it. It's great. I think the reason that this book has stuck around and become so popular, whereas other habits books have kind of drifted after a while, is because James actually really focuses on what really determines habit change. And that is understanding the underlying emotions of our behaviors. It's not enough to just write down a series of goals, create a three-week action plan or whatever. If that was enough, we would all fucking have six packs and be balling out at the beach. But we're not. So what James understands is that most behavior is driven emotionally. And so if you're going to change those habits, you have to address the emotions underlying them and change the emotional behavior first, and then the physical behavior follows. The other really cool thing about this book that's really profound is that he really demonstrates how tons and tons and tons of little actions accumulate and compound over time, kind of the same way it's like saving 10% of your paycheck makes you a millionaire by 50 or whatever. And he shows how that's true about your habits as well. The Elephant in the Brain by Robin Hanson. There are a lot of books I could have picked to kind of fill this niche. I picked this one because I think it's the most readable and enjoyable, but basically this book is about how ultimately we're all animals at heart. We all have very dark base impulses and a lot of our conscious mind is designed to rationalize away those base impulses, you know? So it's like basically like we're all a little bit selfish and impulsive and overly emotional, but we can't really admit that to ourselves. So we develop all these kind of belief systems and mindsets and attitudes that allow us to continue to believe that we are fully rational, altruistic, wonderful beings. This book dissects all of those, that whole network of attitudes and beliefs that kind of point out where we're fooling ourselves. Nonviolent... The fuck is this called? Nonviolent Communication by Marshall Rosenberg. I read this when I was in college. Look, there's a woo-woo warning here. This book gets a little woo-woo. He talks about how we can all love each other forever and ever and nobody ever has to be hurt ever again. Obviously, that's bullshit, but the reason I'm recommending this book and I've recommended it so many times over the years is that this book breaks down how much subtext and meaning is embedded in our language when we talk about feelings. So just to give you a simple example, it's a very, very common statement that most of us make. We'll say, you made me feel angry or you made me feel ashamed. Well, what Rosenberg points out is like, wait a second, nobody made you feel anything. They did something and as a response, you decided to feel angry. That's a very subtle but important difference. Another example is like, sometimes we'll say like, oh, my day was going great, but then traffic ruined it for me. Well, did traffic really ruin your day or could it also have been part of what was going perfect? There's all these like little subtext and meanings that you don't consider, but he breaks it down line by line, gives tons of examples and even gives you exercises to understand how the way you're using language, just particularly around your emotions, is perpetuating a lot of, well, how shitty you feel. Coddling of the American Mind by Jonathan Haidt. Sorry, Jonathan Haidt. I met him once. He got very mad at me for mispronouncing his last name and Greg Lukanoff, which probably mispronounced that too, but sorry, Greg. Anyway, this book, you know, it's got a little bit of that historical, uh, historical, hysterical sky is falling feel to it, but I think it makes some very, very important points about culture in the last couple of generations. Every generation looks at the younger generation and is like, you have it easy, you're spoiled, you're fucking grateful for nothing. Fuck you. When I was your age, I was like walking to school barefoot in the snow, but this book actually presents a lot of psychological research and what I like about this book is that they kind of point out, it's like, look, if the kids are fucked up, it's not the kid's fault. It's the parents and teachers fault. And so a lot of it looks at how the education system has changed over the past couple of generations, how parenting styles have changed over the past couple of generations, how technology has changed over the past couple of generations and how that is leading to a more mentally and emotionally fragile population. And obviously that's bad for everybody. So Good They Can't Ignore You by Cal Newport. Cal has a bunch of good books, but this was his first and this is my personal favorite. The reason I love this one, you know, those of you who follow my work for a long time, you know, I write about purpose a lot. People always have this misguided assumption that purpose is something you just find. It's like you just wake up one day and you're like, oh, I'm supposed to be a piccolo player in the local orchestra. And it's like, boom, lightning struck. You found your purpose. Everything's solved forever. What Newport shows very convincingly is that it actually is the other way around. You don't find what you're passionate about and then become great at it. What happens is you get great at something and then you become passionate again, kind of referencing the Robin Hansen book about us being animals and very selfish. It seems that we tend to fall in love with things and activities that bring us a lot of validation, that we get to feel superior and feel like we're better than other people. Now, it doesn't mean that like you have to actually go be better than people at something to love it. It just means that you have to feel like you're good at it. You have to feel like you're competent, like you're accomplishing a lot of things. And that's what gives that sense of passion. That's what provides us with that infusion of purpose. And so, if you think you're getting it backwards, check it out. So good they can't ignore you. The Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel. I love this book. It's hard to sum this book up in just a few sentences. But basically, Morgan comes from the finance world. And it's interesting because a lot in finance is presented as a science. But the more you learn about finance, the more you realize it's just kind of art. It's kind of like people just making shit up and choosing to believe in certain things, certain philosophies over other philosophies. Sound familiar? It's humans being human. So basically, he kind of goes through a lot of popular assumptions about money, wealth, what it's like to be rich, what you should spend your money on. And just shows how like nobody knows what the fuck they're talking about. One of my favorite moments in this book is he's got a great line where he says that people who want to be wealthy, what they actually want is to just spend a lot of money. And ironically, it's by spending a lot of money that you're never going to be wealthy. David Brooks, The Second Mountain. This is a really, really beautifully done book. It kind of charts a life course. I think this is a life course that Brooks himself went through and was very profound for him. And I think that's what makes this book good is like you kind of feel how personal it is to him. But basically, Brooks has this little theory or model that he came up with, which is like everybody's life has two mountains that they want to climb. The first mountain is the mountain of worldly success. You know, you want to make money or you want to gain prestige or you want to build a good career or be popular at the school dance or whatever. And that's your first climb and you hit the top of that mountain. And what inevitably happens is you hit the top of that mountain and you realize there's just another gigantic mountain behind it. And that second mountain is a feeling of purpose, is a feeling that like this meant something. You know, it's one thing to build a successful career or make a bunch of money. But then what does that mean? What's the point? What are you going to do with it? Who are you going to share it with? And that's the second mountain. And to get to that second mountain, you often have to go into a valley of nihilism and despair. The whole book is kind of an allegory for this process that people go through in life. You know, I could relate to a lot of it. I think it's just it's a particularly profound book for people who are in their 30s and 40s or experiencing success for the first time and experiencing that feeling of like, what's the point? I worked so hard. Like, why? What was this all for? So check it out. Last book, the most depressing book, Democracy for Realists. This is a little bit of a denser book. It's a little bit more academic, but man, I hate to break it to you guys, but this book is all about how the more democratic certain cities, states, societies, nations, whatever, the worst choices they make. It's basically just a bunch of research looking at like why people are so fucking stupid. They ultimately make an argument of like, look, authoritarianism is horrible, but giving all the people a voice for every decision is also terrible. And this whole book is just, it's hundreds and hundreds of pages of examples of that. And so there's gotta be some sort of compromise. There needs to be some sort of structure of like where people with expertise and knowledge and experience, people who are good managers, good leaders actually make their way to the top and authority is kind of delegated to them. Basically like what a republic is supposed to be, but so often ends up not being. This is one of the most sobering and eyeopening books I've ever read. It's one of the few books I've ever read that changed my political views. And it's something that I think everybody needs to read and understand, not because democracy is bad, but it's just like, if we're gonna support it, we need to be fucking real about it. So those are my 14 books, check them out. And if you want more book recommendations, I've got plenty more on my website, markmanson.net. And I've got a whole thing in my school. It's called the library. I've got a bunch of specific book recommendations there for all sorts of different topics. So be sure to check that out as well, school.markmanson.net. I'm getting the fuck out of here. Go read some books. Now let's assess the damage. Sorry guys, my beautiful books, I'm sorry. I think they're okay. You're gonna be fine, baby. You're gonna be fine. Daddy still loves you."}
