One of the misconceptions that I think is really sort of powerful is this notion that the time when we are gonna have everything sorted out is forthcoming. In a few weeks time, or maybe it's a few years time, or when you find the right system, or you finally find reserves of self-discipline that you've never shown before at any point in your life, like the moment of truth will happen and things will be kind of smooth sailing from then on. And I think that totally screwed me up for a long time, that notion that I wasn't there yet, but I was gonna get there. And it's not that you don't change or reach milestones or transform certain aspects of your life, because you do, but you don't get them by imagining that meaning is in the future. You get them by finding ways to bring meaning to present."}
