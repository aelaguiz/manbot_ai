Learning a skill is an effort. Mastering anything is a fucking up-hill battle not many people win.\n\nToday I invite you to watch this 10-minute breakdown of the exact steps you need to take to become a total legend at what you do. They\u2019re simple, but they\u2019re not easy. But no self-improvement is. \n\nHere\u2019s a summary:\n\nStep 1: The 20/80 Principle 01:42\nThe 80/20 Principle states that 80% of the output or results will come from 20% of the input or action. For example, in time management, businesses often found that 20% of their time created 80% of their productivity, and that 20% of their employees created 80% of the value.\n\nStep 2: Get Feedback  04:57\nNailing anything in life requires a lot of trial and error and getting feedback from people. Coaches. Tutors. Teachers. The guy across the fence. You won\u2019t know if you\u2019re any good at something unless someone besides yourself tells you.\n\nStep 3: Practice  07:40\nWhen you look at the people who have mastered anything throughout history, the most glaringly obvious commonality is that they simply worked their asses off more than most people, and for longer than most people. Practice literally makes perfect, motherfuckers.\n\nIf you liked this video, make a point of it. Hit the like button and subscribe to the channel.

And you know, everybody wants to be great at something. In fact, people come up to me all the time. They ask, you know, Mark, how do I become great at this one thing? I totally get why they asked me because I'm pretty fucking amazing at like everything I do. Is that lettuce in my teeth? These fucking nose hairs. They really spring up on you. God, my sweat smells like onions. And the fact is I've broken down how to be great at anything. Yes, anything into three easy, repeatable steps. Just one, two, three, boom. You're a world-class performer at whatever you want to be. For a limited time, it's only $9,000, $999. Wait, 9,000, I can't even get the price right. Just watch the video. Before we dive into how to become great at something, this video is brought to you by Mark Manson, an up-and-coming personal development author whose books have sold more than 10 million copies. Mark Manson was a popular blogger and now has a weekly newsletter called Mindfuck Monday. You can sign up at markmanson.net slash newsletter. Mark Manson was kind enough to pay for the camera, the lens, the lighting, the chair he's sitting on, pretty much fucking everything in this room. Mark Manson even tried to set up said lighting, but even after three months of trying, still pretty goddamn terrible at it. All right, back to you, Mark. Ah, thanks, Mark. Please support our sponsor, subscribe to the channel. You know, he's doing his best. He's trying pretty hard here, even if he kind of smells like onions. All right, so three-step process, how to get great at anything. Step number one, learn the fundamentals. Figure out what the 20% is that drives the 80% of results. There was this economist who lived like a long time ago named Riccardo Pareto, and he had this principle that he discovered, which was that essentially 80% of economic output was generated by roughly 20% of the companies. Similarly, within the companies, about 80% of the productivity came from 20% of the workers. This became known as the 80-20 rule or the 80-20 principle, and it applies to nearly everything. 20% of the customers will make 80% of your purchases. 20% of the population pays 80% of the taxes. 20% of the politicians are responsible for 80% of the corruption. I mean, you can just, you can go on and on. What's interesting is sometimes it goes beyond the 80-20 principle. Sometimes it's the 90-10 principle or the 99-1 principle. For example, in music, 1% of the songs account for 99% of what people listen to. In sports, 1% of the athletes make 99% of the money. In publishing, 1% of the books are read 99% of the time. So the first step of entering any field or developing any skillset is figuring out where the 80-20 is. What is the 20% that's gonna create 80% of the results? Think of these like leverage points. Where are the actions and effort that you can get a disproportionate amount of returns? For example, in writing, if you read some books on how to improve your writing, one of the first things that you'll notice is that everybody says that editing has a disproportionate effect on how good the writing is. Editing is the 20% that drives the 80% of results. Ernest Hemingway once famously said, the first draft of everything is shit. And I can tell you from experience that is completely true. Nobody writes a good first draft. Everything is full of inconsistencies and bullshit and run-on sentences. It's only through the revisions and the edits and the rewrites that you actually get a sparkling, clean, beautiful piece of writing. Similarly, in music, you find that there's only a handful of chord progressions and concepts of harmony that account for like 80 or 90% of the popular music that you hear. So if you're able to simply learn a few of those chord progressions or understand the harmony behind those chord progressions, you're gonna immediately be able to play the vast majority of music that people wanna listen to. Or like in chess, if you study chess at all, you will quickly find that there are many repeatable patterns that come up consistently game after game. There are opening patterns, there are mid-game patterns, there are in-game patterns, there are forks and pins and different concepts around pawn structure. If you're able to focus on those patterns, that will help you be a better chess player than 80, 90% of people. Generally, this first step, it requires taking an introductory course, reading a couple books, maybe hiring a coach, but the focus should always be what is the 20 that's driving the 80? A lot of introductory courses, especially in university, they don't tell you what that 20 is that drives the 80. You have to figure that out yourself. A good coach will point that out to you, but a bad coach will not. So this is something that always needs to be in the forefront of your mind when you're taking on a new pursuit. Step numero dos, arrange a system so that you receive feedback consistently and reliably. You can't improve on anything unless you receive feedback on it. Now that feedback could take many different forms. It could be a teacher telling you that this term paper you wrote was terrible. It could be a coach telling you that your basketball shot is all off and you need to move your elbow or something, whatever basketball players do. It could be putting your music online and hearing what your friends and family members think about it. But whatever it is, you need a consistent system of feedback. You need evaluation on your performance so that you can adjust your performance and you can begin to iterate. Iteration is the fundamental basis of all improvement. Now here's the problem. People make two mistakes with step numero dos. They either don't receive feedback, they just write in their bedroom for years and years and years and never show it to anybody, or they shoot baskets in a gym and never play against anybody. And it's because they're afraid of criticism. They're afraid of losing. They're afraid of being embarrassed. They're afraid of being made fun of. Or the second problem is that they receive the feedback and then they refuse to listen to it. In either case, if you don't accept the feedback, then you're not gonna improve. This is where ego comes into the process. You know, it's the people who are afraid of feedback, it's because their ego's a little bit too fragile. They need to protect themselves. Whatever they're pursuing, it's too fundamental to their identity so they can't allow themselves to threaten it. That's not a healthy way to pursue anything. If the thing you're pursuing is the only meaningful thing in your life, you're not gonna get very far. Similarly, a lot of people, they think they're hot shit before they're hot shit. They're sitting there publishing short stories online and nobody's reading them and they're like, man, you know, it's just because I'm just too fucking brilliant. People don't, you know, people don't get it. If you're ever telling yourself that, you're probably full of shit. Step number two also kind of explains why coaching is a thing. Because, you know, it's easy to ignore your friends, but if you're paying an expert to give you feedback, it's kind of hard to ignore that feedback. I mean, otherwise, why the fuck are you paying this guy? The other great thing about a coach, they can point out when you're protecting your ego. They can point out when you're diluting yourself and ignoring the proper feedback. So while this step sounds very simple, like, oh yeah, I get feedback all the time, it's actually very difficult. It's very difficult for most of us to listen to criticism and be realistic about it, be honest about it, actually taking it into consideration and changing what we do. Step number three. Now that you know how to iterate, wait, where's my microphone? Now that you know how to iterate, iterate for 5,000 to 10,000 hours. Ha ha ha ha ha. I know what you're thinking, right? Three steps, wow, that's easy. 10 minute YouTube video, here we go, all right. You get to step number three and it's like, 10,000 fucking hours? Are you shitting me? Who has that kind of time? Ha ha ha ha ha. All right, all right, this is, hold on, this is the harsh truth. All right. Harsh truth of the day. There are no fucking shortcuts, okay? There's no short, nobody took a shortcut. Anything you hear about the overnight success you heard about in the paper, you read about on Facebook, it's bullshit, don't listen to it. You gotta put the time in. You gotta iterate, man. Like, one way I think about this is that if I'm gonna try to become excellent at anything, I need to fail 1,000 times. And the faster I can get those 1,000 failures out of the way, the sooner I will start experiencing success at that thing. As a culture, we love, we love, like we get such a fucking hard-on for these overnight success stories. There's no overnight success, it's absurd. You take like the Beatles, right? It's like one of the most storied, important music careers of the last century. In people's minds, it's just these like random 20-year-old kids from Liverpool just show up and have all this amazing music. The Beatles fucking grinded. They were playing five to six hours a night in Germany, like old dank German bars in the red light district for like no fucking money. Nobody was listening. Six nights a week for like a year. That's so much fucking time. One of my favorite interview moments ever, I remember I saw an interview of the Facebook co-founder, Dustin Moskowitz, and the interviewer actually asked him, what does it feel like to be an overnight billionaire? And he like just laughed and he was like, if by overnight you mean working all night, every night for seven years, it was really tiring and stressful. That's what an overnight success is. I ran into this stuff with my own book. You know, when I started doing TV interviews and press interviews, people were like, oh, this came out of nowhere, right? It's like, no motherfucker. I've been blogging for eight years. I was writing shit online, dealing with fucking hate mail and trolls since 2007. This did not happen overnight. This was nine years in the making. All right, so that's it for today. Go out and, you know, become excellent at something. Let me know how it goes 10 years from now. And, you know, by then I'll probably forget about this video and I won't care anymore. So, peace. Step number three. No, no, please don't use that."}
