I'm going to die now. He weighs 320 pounds and lives in his mom's basement. Give me five more. This is me. Let's go, Will. I flew out to his hometown to help him get his life together. But right about now, he's probably regretting that. How are we doing? Try not to puke. Will is from a small town in Indiana. And after dropping out of school and suffering through some severe depression, he ended up back in his mom's basement. I've struggled, actually, most of my life with anxiety and depression. When I talk about being at a low, I literally just got to the point where I wanted to end everything. I was drawn to Will's story because I, too, struggled a lot with depression after school and, at one point, even had to move back in with mom. Nice to meet you, man. I wanted to show Will that unfucking your life doesn't require some transcendent peak experience, but rather simply doing small, basic behaviors on a regular basis. And how long have you been down here? Been in and out of this place since graduating high school, essentially. Gotcha. So I devised 10 simple challenges that could have an outsized impact on the quality of his life. And we're going to do them together. OK. Some of them might be, there might be some resistance. I think you severely are underestimating how much of a fool I'm willing to make myself. The first challenge, join a fucking gym. How do you feel right now? Well, I'm about to go to the gym, so, I mean, there's that. It was the first time Will had been inside a gym in about a decade. And as you would expect, he was completely out of shape. Ah! Given Will's obesity and history of anxiety and depression, exercise was non-negotiable. Did you think you could do this two hours ago? Yeah. Next up was the important skill of meal prep, but unfortunately, neither of us knew how to cook. Trust me, I'm going to be doing a lot of YouTubing while I do this. Now, how to cut the perfect pepper. Start from the top and slice all the way around. So far, so good. If you're struggling to eat healthy regularly, then meal prepping an entire week's worth of meals beforehand not only will save you a ton of time, but it will save you money as well. The only catch is, you need to know what the fuck you're doing. Not bad. No, it's really not that bad at all, all things considered. After eating, we went out to buy some books. Uh, is there any, like, historical figure you're super interested in or a fan of? I thought that was like a Dolly Parton. We tried Turkish food. Similar to a corn dog. And Will said that he always wanted to know how to line dance. So I signed us up for a line dancing class. But first, I needed a new outfit. Going to get me some boots. I don't even know where to start. Ha ha ha. Hoping for a white. I mean, here's an off-white. Got some bald eagles. Hell yeah, brother. Hell yeah, brother. Ah! Oh, dude. Oh, dude. I think we found a winner. Hell yeah, brother. Hell yeah, brother. Funny thing is, when I say hell yeah, brother, you say it jokingly. I'm being honest. Like, that's authentically something I say to people. Hell yeah, brother. Hell yeah, brother. Indiana bound on a Friday night. My sights set on some neon lights. I want to cut up a rug, burn a hole in my boots. I'll run a pool table if you give me a cue. I don't mean to alarm this Indiana town, but there's a high chance I'm burning it down. Hell yeah, brother. It's a simple thing. It's no right or wrong. You better hold on to your hats if standard comes on. Get back up and give me another can to keep it down. Hell yeah, brother. So you hold on with one arm. Hold on to that fucking rope as tight as you can, as close to that bowl as you can. OK. Squeeze with your legs. Yeah. Try to lean the opposite direction of the bowl. OK. It's a simple thing. It's no right or wrong. You better hold on to your hats if standard comes on. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. All right. I'm good. Nice. Woo. Hell yeah, brother. I'm going to die before the end of this weekend. Physically going to be deceased. It's all right. We'll give you a nice immemorium in the video. Break through the night. Similar to a corndog. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. Oh, man. That's some fun. Yeah, it was fun. Boom. The funny thing about exercise, like, if I came up to you and I was like, there's a pill that reduces anxiety and depression, helps you sleep better, improves mood, improves focus, makes you better in bed, makes you more attractive, and it's free. That's this. It's fucking this. This is what it is. This right here is called redneck recovery. We went to a tractor supply store and bought a horse truck. Let's go get our shrinkage on. Bought some ice from Walmart. Filled that son of a bitch up with some hose water. I told Will that he needed to soak it in for at least three minutes. But what I didn't expect was that mom was going to get involved. Why are you doing this? Because I want to connect more deeply with my son. That's a good mom. You guys ready? Yep. 3, 2, 1, go. I've got to go all the way under. You ready? Get under. Get under. Yes. Yes. You've probably noticed by now that nothing I'm doing with Will is particularly extraordinary. In fact, it's the opposite. And that's by design. How you feeling, Will? Yeah? How are you feeling, mom? You good? Toasty. If you're going through a rut in your life, if you're feeling unmotivated or even depressed, simply doing something productive, no matter how small, is a good enough start. Coming up on halfway. Doing it two days in a row is even better. And after a week or a month, you're going to make it. You're good. You'll look back, and you'll be shocked at how far you've come. It really is that simple. 3, 2, 1. That's it, three minutes. Who's going to move first? It's just me and you. It's just me and you. It's just me and you. Woo! Woo! Hey. Good job. Get around here. Good job. Hey. Hey. Hey. We hit it. Oh, come here, you. Aw. Oh, you're cold. Get off me. That night, to help with his social confidence, I told Will we were going to go sing karaoke. We were going to sing the best song ever recorded. We're no strangers to love. You know the rules, and so do I. I just want to tell you how I'm feeling. Got to make you understand. Never going to give you up. Never going to let you down. Never going to let you down. Never going to let you down. Never going to let you down. Never going to let you down. Never going to turn around and desert you. Never going to make you cry. Never going to say goodbye. Never going to tell a lie and hurt you. Hello? Broski. Yo, what it do? What it do? What it do? When unfucking one's life, it's not sufficient to simply improve upon one's body or one's mind, but you must also address your relationships. Basically, I just want to say that I really appreciate everything you've done for me as far as, like, since we met in Michigan and started working together. And all that shit, you've just fucking really helped me to become a better man and a better person. You've helped me so much with mindset. You've helped me so much with, like, continuing my education on that kind of stuff. I just basically want to say I appreciate the hell out of you, man. I appreciate you too, bro. Ain't no thing, brother. Yep. Whatever you need, you know I'm always here for you. Yep. I'll let you get back to doing whatever you're doing, but I just wanted to say that, man. Okay, brother. Love you. Love you too, man. Bye. All right. Fuck yeah. That's great. Yeah, he's a really cool guy. That's really great. Yeah. How often do you hear, like, two construction dudes? Talk like that. Like, I love you, man. I love you too, brother. Like, that's special. That's amazing. And he didn't stop there. After years of tensions with his mom, I convinced Will to finally sit down and say something that had long needed to be said. For everything that we've been through, I've treated you like shit. And I know my priorities haven't been in the right place. And this weekend's done a lot to help me not only figure that out, but figure out how to get them in the right place. And I just... I'm sorry for everything that I've put you through in the last year or so. Moms are always there. I'll always be in your corner. You know that. Thank you. Thank you. It's the boring, routine activities that we do each day that keep us feeling good about ourselves. And for Will, just having a taste of that this weekend has hopefully set him up for long-term positive change. But before I left and went home, there was one last person he had to get right with. Himself. Do you mind reading it? Yeah. Yeah. I know you think you're a burden. I know you hate yourself. I know you can't seem to find love anywhere, even inside. I know you're lost. I know you don't want to be here. I know you want to end it all. That's okay. It always will be. You had to go there to get where you are now. Five years from now, I'll look at me hopefully the same. What I'm getting at is that it always gets better, even when it seems like it can't. It always will. You just have to remember to stay hard and work through the shit. Behind every strong person is a story that gave them no choice. Never let anything stand in your way. I love you. Stop worrying so much. I forgive you. That's beautiful, dude. Thank you. I'm proud of you, man. Hey, man. Catch us all up. What have you been up to? Just the time since we shot the video, I've lost 30 pounds. I've been able to maintain that. I have a goal of to lose 50 more, which I have no doubt in my mind I'll end up getting there. I'm more comfortable with myself than I ever have been. I'm more competent than I ever have been. So what's the current status of moving out planned? Should be able to get out of here within the next three to four months. Amazing. What would you say to anybody who's in the same situation you were in, say, six months ago or eight months ago? Everyone is capable of doing this. It really boils down to just focusing on the behaviors, having the discipline to do it. Yes, it's painful. Yes, it's scary. But at the end of the day, this is some of the most fulfilling work you'll ever do on yourself."}
