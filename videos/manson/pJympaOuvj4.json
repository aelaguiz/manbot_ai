And I remember hitting that milestone and just being like, this is unfathomable, like $5,000. Because it's just the gap between what you had and what you have now that brings happiness. And for me, going from $100 to $5,000 felt so much bigger than going from $1 million to $2 million to whatever it would be. Because just in percentage terms, it was so much different. So I think people are always just chasing the gap between what they used to have and what they have today. There's also a thing in the stock market where all of your success as an investor in the stock market is just not panic selling. Your whole lifetime success is just don't freak out and you'll be fine. So everything that I do for my own money is kind of geared around that. Because everybody, including myself, my net worth went down 50%. It might change how I think about my long-term plans."}
