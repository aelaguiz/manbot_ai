If you've been on YouTube quite a bit, you've probably come across these videos where experts explain a particular concept in five different levels. So they start out explaining it for a child, then they go to explaining it for a teenager, and then explaining it for a college student, and explaining it for a grad student, and then explaining it for an expert. I believe Wired started this. Things that you assume are kind of simple topics or simple concepts, there's just kind of this infinite amount of complexity underneath them. So I wanted to try to do that today, simply for the concept of self. Yes, the self. There's five layers of complexity, simply to our understanding of self. So stick around, because I think the last one is gonna blow your fucking mind. All right, so level one, explaining the concept of self to a child. It's actually very simple. Whatever you feel or control in your environment is a part of you. So I can control my hand. That is part of myself. If you can control your foot, that means it's part of yourself. If you can feel something that happens to you when it pushes against your chest, that means your chest is part of yourself. And your self is separate from the rest of the things in the world, because you can't control the chair without touching it. You can't control the light without pressing the switch. So anything that you can't control without touching it is not a part of yourself. Does that make sense? God, what an idiot. Level two, explaining for a teenager. So by now you've grown up a little bit. You've got some hair on your woo-woo or your wee-wee, and you probably are starting to understand that your self isn't simply limited to your physical body. There are certain abstract concepts that represent yourself that are untouchable or intangible. So the fact that you're compassionate, or you're a good friend, or you're good at biology, or that you're musically talented. These abstract concepts come to define you the same way that your height, or your weight, or your physical appearance define you as well. They're also kind of more socially-based abstractions. I am born in Austin, Texas. That is part of myself. I like video games. That is part of who I am. I live in New York City. These are all socially-constructed identifiers that determine who our identity is. Once you discover these abstract points of self, they are a source of obsession. They are something that you constantly worry about. Do they think I'm smart? Do they think I'm nice and a good friend? Maybe I was kind of a dick. Maybe I'm not as smart as I thought. These thoughts start to consume us around our teenage years because so much of our sense of wellbeing is based on how others perceive ourselves, right? And so in this sense, the self, it's not purely physical, it's not abstract, but it's something that is socially negotiated or tested based on how other people react to us or how the world comes to see us. I can think I'm smart, but if every single person I come across treats me like an idiot, then that puts a lot of stress on me because it brings up the question that perhaps I don't actually know myself. Level three, explaining the concept of self to a college student. So we discussed how there's this tension between our self-definition and how the world comes to see us and how this can drive a lot of stress and anxiety in our lives. We also have certain psychological defense mechanisms that protect our sense of self. So if I believe that I'm smart, but everybody treats me like a moron, then I will start telling myself stories to protect my self-definition. I will say, these people are, I'm not the moron, these people are all the morons. Or if I see myself as a compassionate and kind friend, but my friends all treat me poorly, then I will tell myself stories of like, well, maybe I'm not compassionate enough. Maybe I just need to be even kinder because that's the type of person that I am. This is Freud's definition of the ego. The ego is basically our definition of ourselves for ourselves. And then we tend to protect that definition by either pushing other people away or simply lying to ourselves about what other people are saying. The word ego has gotten a bad rap over the years, but it's, you know, we all need a little bit of healthy ego to some extent. A healthy ego means that you know who you are, that you are very comfortable in the traits that you have and who you are as a human being in the world, and you're not afraid to stand up for it. We all need a little bit of a healthy ego. Where the ego becomes unhealthy or becomes very toxic is when our definition of ourselves deviates quite a bit from reality. If I start thinking that I'm a short trapeze artist, even though I've never been on a trapeze, that's not a very accurate self-definition based on my actual experiences or what I do in the world. But if I believe that strongly enough, I will start defending that with all sorts of lies and coping mechanisms and emotional outbursts that cause me to be dysfunctional in the world. So what Freud accurately pointed out is that a lot of emotional dysfunction in the world and a lot of people who struggle in their relationships and struggle to get along with others, it's because they have a poor definition of themselves and they are simply protecting it from reality. This was a very profound insight, and it's kind of why Freud is such a big deal. And then he went off and talked about penises all the time, so that's kind of why we make fun of them. All right, level four. Explaining the concept of self to a graduate student. So the concept of self, it's actually just an arbitrary definition like anything else. You know, it's like, I kind of have my definition of what friendship is. You maybe have a definition of what friendship is. Somebody else has a different definition of what friendship is. We all develop these definitions of these principles based on our experiences, our environment, the culture we grow up in, and things that we're exposed to. There's no correct definition of friendship. We all have slightly different definitions based on what we've been through in life. The same is true for the definition of self. There's no correct definition of ourselves. We all just kind of make it up as we go along. And so this fluidity of self is actually just another psychological mechanism to keep us stable in the world and stable in our environment. The brain probably needed to invent a concept of self or invent an ego because an ego helps us function as a social species. It helps us determine, are we treating each other fairly? Is somebody taking advantage of me? Am I being threatened by a group somehow? If we didn't have an ego or if we didn't have a sense of self, it would be almost impossible to determine these things. And so in that sense, the ego is just an evolutionary adaptation of our minds. It's something that we just invented at some point and isn't even really real. Level five, expert. There is no self. You do not exist. And the belief that you exist is just an illusion that is spun up by your mind and that is almost impossible to stop for any long period of time. Nothing particularly exists. It's all merely an unceasing interflow of information change happening at a subatomic, atomic and biological level. Trillions of bits get processed and spun into patterns that generate this illusion that the self exists, that anything exists at all. You can train yourself to see this, to feel this, to inhabit this. You can train your mind to see through its processes, to start experiencing reality, not as the self or the ego, but as yet another manifestation in this infinite sea of existence. All that you love or care about is merely a temporary cessation of this imagined separateness between things. Life is transitory and ill-defined. There is no such thing as death. Nothing lasts, yet nothing is lost. That is because all is present and has always been. You are this, and this, and this. Be sure to like and subscribe, fuckface. \u266a\u266a"}
