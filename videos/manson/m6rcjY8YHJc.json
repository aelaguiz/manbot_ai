Anxiety alerts us, primes us for action in many cases, helps us avoid painful events or failures. But sometimes, anxiety is debilitating and can hold us back.\n\nStudies find that people who are confident or who perform well under pressure still get anxious. They still register similar signals in their body, their adrenaline still pumps. What\u2019s different is their ability to manage their anxiety in the moment so they can accomplish what they need to accomplish.\n\nIn order to reorient what makes us anxious, we must practice new behaviors. Teach ourselves new tricks. And it\u2019s worth remembering here that there is no lost cause. The brain is capable of rewiring itself. Everybody is adaptable to a certain degree. Even you. While we may never be perfect, we can always improve our current state.\n\nThis video helps you do that. It has five quick tricks (and one slow) to overcoming your anxiety:\n\n1. Utilizing Breath Techniques 3:18\n2. Meditation 6:30\n3. Talk to somebody 8:29\n4. Negative Visualization 10:24\n5. Err... uhh, never mind 12:48\n6. (The Harsh Truth of the Day) 13:20\n\nDon\u2019t forget to like the video and subscribe to the channel.

Hey. I'm back. I've got another back I got a hey guys mark here, and I'm back with another Fuck hey guys. I'm back. I've got a we're talking about anxiety That was stupid god damn it. Hey guys mark here, and it's It's a video Fuck fuck fuck fuck shit. This is not going well. Hey guys. Hey guys. Hey guys That was dumb Okay, breathe relax. Don't judge yourself. Whatever fuck this intro I got a video about anxiety ready to give you five quick ways to help you deal with your anxiety including one Slower long way to deal with it. I'm actually gonna go fucking deal with it right now myself, so catch you after the intro About 75 years ago Wh Auden the famous poet wrote a book called the age of anxiety Now clearly Auden did not live in the age of Instagram or Twitter Because if he did he would know that now is the age of fucking anxiety look everybody's got anxiety these days I've got anxiety you've got anxiety the fucking dogs got anxiety everybody's mom's got anxiety like everywhere you look anxiety anxiety anxiety We're all freaking out. It's kind of hard to figure out why sometimes as we'll discover the why isn't Necessarily so important what is important is how you react to the anxiety so this video is gonna Give you five quick ways to help you deal with anxiety, and then we're gonna discuss a slower way Towards the end so the first thing to understand about anxiety or any emotion in general is that our emotions are inextricably linked to our Physiological state it's basically just a fancy way of saying of you experience your emotions in your body And we don't always recognize this I mean sometimes we kind of understand like you've got butterflies in your stomach Or maybe your arms are a little tingly or your vision gets a little bit red when you get angry But we vastly underestimate how much our physiology changes when we're feeling certain emotions now Here's the catch if we experience certain emotions often enough or if we experience them frequently when we were young Our body the same way your body habituates itself to any activity whether it's running or jumping or learning a skill your body can Habituate itself to experiencing certain emotions And so in that way our emotions kind of develop like a muscle memory where you can actually train yourself to feel anxiety Frequently or you can train yourself to feel angry all the time people who struggle with a certain emotion Essentially what they've done without realizing it is that they have habituated that Physiological state as a response to whatever they experience now the trick to counteracting that it's like Counteracting any bad habit when that experience comes up in the future you have to consciously force yourself to do something different than you normally Do so that's like the high-level abstract explanation of why we feel shitty things frequently Let's talk about a few things that you can do in the moment that you're experiencing anxiety that can help you relax a little bit how can we affect our body our physiological state to chill the fuck out technique number one and this is by far the most popular is Utilizing breathing techniques a lot of people don't realize but when you're anxious your breathing changes and you start taking shallower lighter breaths more frequently and this has all sorts of Domino effects throughout your body and it makes you feel like shit And so one of the easiest go-to things you can do when you start feeling a lot of anxiety is simply adopting some basic breathing Techniques now the most popular one is something known as the four seven eight technique four seven eight techniques Very simple you take four seconds breathing in hold for seven breathe out for eight it goes kind of like this I Fucking a man Some good shit the thing about these techniques. I'm gonna be honest. The numbers don't really matter I think the four seven eight is just kind of like a general rule of thumb that most people find comfortable But the most important about these techniques is that you're breathing in through your diaphragm So basically what that means is when you're breathing in you get like a big fat Buddha belly going on. Oh Yeah. Yeah, look at that Look at that shit. Yeah. Oh, yeah, that's good one thing. I actually learned recently So I'm here in New Zealand right now, and I took a free diving class free diving is for those of you Don't know it's people who scuba dive without fucking scuba gear So it's like people who just hold their breath and swim like 50 meters down So I took this class with this guy and he was Taking me through all these breathing techniques to increase how much oxygen you can hold and he taught me breathe in for five and then breathe Out for five It's kind of a way to like prep for like a big breath hold when you go under and the funny thing he was telling Me is he was like you actually have to be careful because by doing these breaths you relax yourself so much it actually kind of like makes you a little bit lazy and Lethargic and he even said that it's a nice way to combat insomnia So if you have trouble falling asleep, or if your mind's racing in bed You can implement these breathing techniques to help you chill out in bed. I actually tried it about a week ago It was fucking amazing big thing is big breath through the diaphragm Hold it for a few seconds breathe out very slowly when you slow down your breath and you utilize your entire lung It gets better blood flow around your body It helps your body chill the fuck out not freak out all the time And you know life will go on the last thing I should note about the breathing techniques Is that in a small minority of people probably less than 1% these breathing techniques can make you feel more anxiety They can make you feel worse. So obviously if it starts making you feel bad Don't fucking do it do something else as always the thing that works for me is not necessarily gonna work for you and vice-versa So when it comes to all this stuff, you just have to try out different techniques and see see how it goes So technique number two and this actually ties in very much to that Buddha belly breathing through the diaphragm. Oh, yeah It's meditation So if you haven't meditated before there's a bazillion videos on YouTube that will teach you how to do it for free You know people get all worked up like oh, what's the best form of meditation? Like how do I what's the right technique blah blah blah There's no wrong way to start, you know Like once you get going once you've done it for a few weeks or you start doing it every day Then you can start looking at different schools and different practices and different techniques and whatever But it's like if you're just starting just fucking do it for five minutes. It doesn't matter what type doesn't matter Who's guiding you what the video is where they're from? Whatever any meditation is gonna be better than none now Obviously meditation is great for relaxation a big reason for that is the breathing that we just talked about a big part of meditation Is having slow controlled breathing, but the other beneficial part of meditation is developing the ability to watch Your thoughts and feelings without reacting to them when we're going about our daily lives when we start freaking out or getting upset about something We just instantly react, you know It's just like a knee-jerk like boom we go and then it's not until after we've done a bunch of heinous shit that we look back and say like hmm Maybe that was a bad idea The beauty of meditation is that it starts developing a separation between the thing that happens and your experience of it Your awareness of it you start realizing how to be like, hmm I've got some fucked up thoughts in my head, but I don't have to act on them or I'm feeling really angry right now But I don't have to do anything about it meditation is it's essentially just a practice of letting things be and It's a beautiful thing once you get good at it because it has this Incredible ability to kind of infiltrate all these different areas of your life. You become less judgmental and biased at work You become more relaxed at home. You become more accepting and more patient in your relationships It's a wonderful thing. So check it out. If you've never done it quick technique number three Talk to somebody I know I know it's like so fucking obvious and lame But let's get serious for a second human physiology is such that we rely upon one another to stabilize ourselves Now that sounds a little bit crazy, but it's it's actually true Imagine like you're like a boat on the sea and a storm comes, you know if you've got ropes tied to other boats, you're not gonna like tip over as easily That was kind of a shitty metaphor, but let's just go with it And if you've got connections to a lot of different boats Not only do you stabilize each other the storm can bring you closer together Right, is this working see when we're isolated when we're alone We have this funny tendency to like amplify things that are going on in our heads. We've all done it You know Let's say you are at the coffee shop and you say something like the barista is kind of cute you like try to make a joke But it's not really a funny joke and there's like this awkward moment where you just kind of look at each other and nobody laughs And then like you leave and go on about your life and you're walking on you're like stupid stupid stupid What the fuck am I saying? whenever we feel something that Goes unexpressed our mind has a tendency to just keep looping it and every time it loops it it grows it expands It's just to dominate more of our mind space The irony is that if you could actually like go back to that barista and be like, hey That was kind of a lame joke, right? They'd be like, yeah, but hey you tried, you know, whatever like you're like, oh, it's cool Nobody cares. There's something about speaking to other human beings and sharing a little bit of that Amplified emotion that's going on inside your head that the other human beings like oh, well, yeah I mean I felt that way last Tuesday, but it's not a big deal And then you actually feel like it's not a big deal So don't underestimate the power of just picking up the phone and talking to somebody technique number four It's called negative visualization this is the thing that comes from stoicism is it's gonna sound kind of fucked up and counterintuitive, but it's basically just Imagine the worst-case scenario imagine that anything that can go wrong is gonna fucking go wrong and it's gonna go wrong in a spectacular Fashion now, that's the easy part because you know anybody who's anxious you kind of do that Anyway, here's the hard part imagine how everything can go wrong and then imagine how you can be okay with it Now that's the hard part that requires a little bit of creativity because now you have to think like not only like, okay Maybe my girlfriend will leave me But then you got to think how would I be? okay if my girlfriend left me and that forces you to like think two or three chess moves ahead on the board and Generally, what happens is you start discovering things you realize you know what? I'm alright. I'm a cool guy I can meet other people and then that makes you feel better. You feel less insecure You feel less needy like less clingy less creepy stocky Boyfriend ish type person and this applies, you know, this could apply to anything I used to run into this all the time when I started writing and posting online. I'd write something I'm like man, am I an idiot? Like are people gonna hate this shit? And then I would think to myself Okay, what's the worst thing that can happen if I just wrote a horrible thing? Well, yeah, I get like 200 hate comments or whatever doesn't really change my life much Doesn't life goes on can always get on and edit the fucking thing eventually when you start thinking that way it gets easier and this Is very counterintuitive because we're always told to think positive But thinking positive actually makes the anxiety worse because it raises your expectations instead of saying hey people might hate this video But I'll live with it now I'm saying this is gonna be the best fucking video ever is gonna go viral and get eight million billion hits I'm gonna be the biggest thing since fucking PewDiePie now that like my Standards are up here. So I the camera can't even see it now Anything I do is gonna feel like failure and so it's just gonna ramp up my anxiety and my insecurity more and more and more so the negative visualization has this like paradoxical effect of bringing us down the earth and lowering our expectations so that we can actually behave and work more freely and Do better shit, that's awesome. All right technique number five And this is personally my favorite if you're feeling really worked up and really stressed out over something I recommend hosting a tequila orgy, you know You just get a bunch of like really hot people in a room start pouring tequila on each other Do we have any b-roll for this? I don't think we can have b-roll for this you get the idea Depending on where you are. It might be expensive anyway Let's move on. So those are the five fast and easy ways of getting rid of anxiety here's the one slow and totally unfun way of getting rid of anxiety, which is Well, you know what? Let's just let's make this the harsh truth of the day You don't get rid of anxiety you just get better at dealing with it There's all sorts of fascinating studies with anxiety and high performers and what researchers found is that actually people who perform extremely well under pressure are Not any less anxious than people who perform poorly under pressure The only thing that differentiates them is that people who perform well have more confidence and beliefs in themselves so it's like the difference between Michael Jordan taking the game-winner shot and Me taking the game-winning shot is Michael Jordan knows. He's really good at taking game-winning shots, and I'm Well, I'm me so we know how that's gonna go so the way to battle anxiety in the long run It's not to try to feel less anxious. It's not to try to control your emotions or get rid of your emotions It's to improve yourself It's to get better at stuff get better at life get better with people get better at your job Get better at handling conflict get better at handling disappointment Get better at failing at things being rejected by people as you get better at those things The anxiety is still there. It just ceases to matter I mean I still get nervous every time I turn this fucking thing on I still get nervous when I talk to somebody new Or I get in front of a crowd to give a speech that voice is there in my head It's just not as loud as it used to be it used to be deafening It used to be the only thing I could hear now It's just this like obnoxious thing in the background so the anxiety never really goes away You just build better stuff on top of it so that about wraps it up good luck getting your shit together Let me know if you have a tequila orgy, you know where to find me and stop freaking out, dude It's gonna be fine.
