I have to admit something. I kind of hate talking about Elon Musk. Why? Well, for one, I'm pretty sure that whatever I get done in a full week, he probably gets more done before he takes a shit in the morning. But two, there's something about people who expand our conception of what's possible that creates this like love and hate reaction with them. On the one hand, they inspire the hell out of us. Like, holy shit, this guy's doing something unbelievable that I didn't know could be done. On the other hand, you're like, fuck, what am I doing? What have I done recently? And then you feel a little bit pathetic about yourself. If you don't know what the fuck Elon Musk has done, I don't know where you've been lately. He's founder, CEO, and CTO, and chief designer of SpaceX. He's the CEO and product architect of Tesla Motors. He's the co-founder of SolarCity. He's co-founder and former co-CEO of PayPal. He's the co-founder of Zip2. He's the co-founder of Neuralink. Founder of The Boring Company. He's the co-founder and co-chairman of OpenAI. He's done all this while having seven kids, four different marriages, three divorces, two to the same woman. The dude was worth like $200 billion a couple months ago. A lot of experts suspect that if there's anybody who's going to be responsible for solving climate change, it's probably going to be him. Fucking smokes weed on podcasts, doesn't give a fuck, buys Bitcoin. He's total meme lord. And to top it all off, Musk says that his primary goal in life is to, quote, die on Mars and not from impact. This fucking guy, this fucking guy, man. We're going to talk about Elon Musk and we're going to talk about four life lessons that we can all take from his career. These are lessons that I've already taken. I've already improved my life, my work habits. Hopefully they'll help yours. So stick around. So the first, and in my opinion, the most important life lesson we can glean from Elon Musk is that it's not about money. It's about solving problems. This was actually something that I learned in business quite early. And I'm very, very grateful because if I didn't, I probably would have wasted like 10 years of my life. Most people approach business in a way of how can I get as much money as possible? What can I do to convince people to give me a bunch of dollars? Whereas the proper way to look at business is to actually ask yourself, how can I solve as many problems as possible for as many people as possible? And then they'll just want to give me money anyway. It takes a lot of people their entire careers to figure this out. But Musk intuited this at a very young age. In his autobiography, he talks about how when he was in college, he sat down and wrote down the three most pressing problems that he thought he could solve with his life's work. The first one was computerized payments and online banking. The second one was electric cars and renewable energy to solve climate change. And the third one was space exploration and helping humanity become an interplanetary species. He attacked online finance first, because out of those three, that's probably the easiest one to do. He co-founded PayPal in the 90s, became co-CEO, got kicked out of the company because he was kind of a dick, ended up making about $180 million from that deal. But what's incredible is that Musk took that $180 million, he took $100 million and founded SpaceX. He took $70 million and used it to get a controlling stake in Tesla. And then he took the $10 million to finance and take a major stake in SolarCity. According to him, he spent most of the early 2000s living month to month and even borrowing money to pay rent. This is a dude who just cashed out for almost $200 million and he's literally crashing on friends' couches and sleeping on floors because he fucking put all the money into his next projects. This is something that I talk about in chapter one of the subtle art of not giving a fuck about how it's generally the people who don't care about money or material success who generate the most of it. Why? Because they actually leave that bandwidth to care about things that actually matter. Which brings us to life lesson number two, optimize ruthlessly for what matters. If you read Musk's biography, there's a lot of insane stories of him being a ruthless asshole in efforts to optimize his businesses and work as efficiently as possible. My favorite actually came from his personal assistant. She had been working with him for like four or five years. She'd been handling all of his meetings, all of his flights, all of his routes and everything going between SpaceX and Tesla for years and years and years. And she finally came to him and was like, Mr. Musk, I've been doing this for a long time. I think I do a very good job. I'd like to ask for a raise. So most bosses in this situation would say, yeah, of course you worked your ass off. You're great. I love you. Blah, blah, blah. Here's a bunch of money. Not Musk. Musk said pretty much the opposite. He said, why don't you take a week off? And in that week, I'll do everything that you do. And then I'll see how much you're actually worth. Sure enough, she took the week off. Musk did everything that she did. And when she came back, he said, you know, I actually discovered that what you do isn't very valuable. So I think I'm going to fire you. Yeah, that's fucking hardcore, man. That's next level shit. Musk's career is littered with crazy stories like this. So apparently, Musk just scrapped his entire public relations and media department at Tesla. Most large corporations spend tens of millions of dollars on publicity and media relations. Musk, he was like, I don't know. I got Twitter. Like, fuck this shit. Everybody go home. We'll use this money for something else. The most hilarious part is that a couple of months ago, the Washington Post actually reached out to him for a comment by emailing his personal address. And he replied, give my regards to your puppet master. The dude's just fucking trolling them. This brings us to life lesson number three. And this is the question that everybody wants to fucking know. If you look at interviews of Musk, everybody asks him this. Everybody wants to know. It's what I wanted to know. It's like, dude, how do you run like five companies at the same time with like seven kids and all this shit going on? Like, how do you do it? There are not enough hours in the day. Well, obviously he works like a crazy person. He works six days a week, sometimes seven. He works long hours. That's a given, right? But when I watch interviews with him, the thing he says that I find to be very profound that he points out is that he minimizes task switching. So he's got a block of days in the week that it's all Tesla. And then he has a block of days in the week it's all SpaceX and there's no crossover. People know this too. You know, the people at Tesla know that like he's not available until Thursday. And then when he's at SpaceX, they know that he's not available until Monday or however it works. It turns out that through his ruthless optimization of his own productivity and time, Musk came across something that's pretty important and backed up by the research, which is that our mental energy isn't necessarily drained through pure effort. It's drained more through the sense of switching tasks. So let's say you have two different work days. One day you're working on one work project and it's just one project for eight hours that day. And the next day, it's eight different projects for one hour at a time. Now, what the research shows is that the day that you're working on eight different projects one hour at a time, you're gonna be way more mentally exhausted than the day that you spent the entire day on one project. There's just something about switching focus from one thing to the next, to the next, to the next, that wears us out. And that makes us feel a sense of mental fatigue that a deep focus on one thing for a long time doesn't cause. I eventually discovered this in my own career as well. Years ago, when I started writing books, I would work on my website for a couple hours and then try to write the book for an hour or two and then do interviews for an hour and then take meetings with my agent for an hour. And it was a total clusterfuck. Eventually what I came across is that you need to start batching things. So like these videos, for instance, I do these videos in batches of three or four. I block out like two full days. I just fucking hammer on the videos. It's all I do for those two days. And then I move on. I'd spend like three, four weeks not thinking about it. It's the same thing with books. You know, it's when I'm writing a book, I block out three days a week. That's book day. Like I don't do anything else on those days. And it's by batching these projects into short-term bursts of focus and attention that you're able to leverage your energy the best. Now the final life lesson I wanna talk about with Musk is just go bigger than anybody can possibly comprehend. You know, there's that cheesy old saying, it's like shoot for the stars and you'll land on the moon or whatever. I feel like with Elon, like what he mastered was like, he started building the technology for the 2040s in the year 2000. And we basically gone through 20 years of people thinking he's a crank, thinking he's fucking insane, thinking he's nuts. And he's just now transitioning to that point where like people are like, oh shit, whoa. He's actually, no, this is some pretty important stuff. And I feel like, you know, by 2030, he's going to be the mainstream. It's like everything his companies do is what people are gonna emulate. I think this is just something that people don't understand. Like Tesla, right? It's not just a car company. Like if you wanna solve climate change, it's not just about electric vehicles. The bottleneck of solving climate change is scaling affordable and efficient batteries. But you can't scale affordable and efficient batteries unless you produce fucking millions and millions and millions of batteries. But to do that, you need a lot of money. So where do you get that money? By having rich people pre-order really, really nice cars. In a sense, Tesla's not really a car company. It's a battery company. It's simply using luxury cars to scale and finance the production of all the batteries the planet's gonna need to beat climate change. And so right now it looks insane. It looks selfish, but give it 10 years and people are gonna be like, oh shit, he just solved a massive worldwide problem. It's similar with SpaceX. I mean, he's been criticized recently by like Bernie Sanders and some politicians saying like, oh, why are you so focused on Mars if we still have like starving people on the streets and on earth? What people don't understand, it's not about Mars. It's about building the technology that can get us to Mars because it's that technology that is gonna create multi-trillion dollar industries in space transportation, space tourism, space mining and minerals and materials, opening up the frontier of space and developing the technology to harness the power of space. Like that's gonna generate trillions and trillions and trillions of dollars of global wealth that's gonna bring up everybody. It's gonna bring up the poor people, the middle-class people, the rich people, everybody. All these people are arguing about, you know, Elon Musk has too much of the pie. He has too much of the pie and he needs to give that. He should be giving billion dollars poor people and all this stuff. And like what they don't realize is he's spending that money to enlarge the pie for everybody. We're all gonna be wealthier because of these technologies. We're all gonna be better off. It just goes to show that no good deed goes unpunished. Perhaps that's the harsh truth of the day. Haters always occur proportionally to audacity. The more audacious your ambition, the more you try to do something special or amazing, the more people are gonna come out and drag you down. And look, it's not because they're bad people. It's just human nature. We tend to react negatively to things that are shocking or unexpected to us. And so when we see somebody doing something so different, thinking in such a strange way, our natural inclination is to react negatively to things that are shocking or unexpected to us. Our natural inclination is to try to bring them down to our level, try to force them into the box that we've created for ourself, for how we see the world. And you see this with all people who have done incredible things. I mean, look at the hate that Bill Gates gets. I mean, the dude's literally cured diseases, wiped polio off the earth, like fucking saved hundreds of millions of lives. And the dude just gets shat on constantly all over the internet. At some point, it just becomes funny. It becomes amusing. Like it's, I love the conspiracy theories of like Bill Gates is tracking you through, you can take the vaccine, there's a microchip that's gonna track your every move and Bill Gates is gonna know what you're doing. You know, as if like some fucking neck beard in his mom's basement, who's like jerking off the hentai every three hours and lives off of the all you can eat shrimp buffet, as if Bill Gates gives a flying fuck what that guy is doing on any given moment. Bill Gates doesn't care. Elon Musk doesn't fucking care. Nobody who's doing anything widely impactful and important for humanity gives a fuck about what you say or what I say. And that's the beauty of it. That is the subtle art of not giving a fuck is you find something more important than what people on the internet are saying. Anyway, I'm rambling now. Be sure to like and subscribe to the channel, leave a comment, say like what you find particularly inspiring or what lesson you've taken from Musk or any other person, I don't know. Who's like the most inspiring figure for you. And if you'd like me to do a video on somebody else in this same style or fashion, let me know in the comments as well. So until next time, this is Mark Manson saying, hasta la vista, baby. Transcribed by https://otter.ai"}
