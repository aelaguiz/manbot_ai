One of the reasons this occurs is like, if you are that successful in your career, if you're Bill Gates or Elon Musk, your life is very, very complicated. I think for me and for a lot of people would read that and say, I don't want that life. I don't want a life that is so fundamentally imbalanced that it's gonna come at the cost of my children knowing me and my wife wanting to leave me. That sucks. And I think that's why there are so many divorces among those people. Bill Gates went like 30 years without taking a single day off. He worked seven days a week for 30 years. There are some people who might aspire to that. I'm definitely not one of them. There's no amount of money that would ever make that worth it to me. And he probably doesn't regret it. I assume that's true, but there's a cost to all of that and just making your life very, very complicated. That I think if most people, if they got that kind of money or had a career that was gonna pay off that kind of money, would realize the downsides that are so easy to overlook. One way to think about this."}
