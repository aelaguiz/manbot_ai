So really cherish and appreciate the moments you have with people. Everything gets lost at some point. Everything ends, including life, including the life of all your loved ones. And this is actually a very important thing to understand, because it is that loss or that potential for loss that makes certain things more valuable or meaningful than others. Everybody has a finite amount of time that they're alive and they're conscious. I think it's then morally incumbent on each of us to improve the quality of that consciousness as much as we can, as consistently as we can. And the reason that's morally incumbent on us is because consciousness ends. Life ends and because it ends, you should make it as good as possible."}
