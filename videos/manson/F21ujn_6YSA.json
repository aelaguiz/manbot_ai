Could you do it? Would you even know where to start? I decided to find out Somewhere in this courtyard right now. There's somebody from Saskatoon, Canada. You need to find them and meet them Okay, this is Melinda she laughs when she's anxious and that's the thing she's always anxious All right, Mark, let's go Now I'm on my own. Oh shit Melinda has struggled with social anxiety all of her life. It just feels like an Overwhelming build-up of emotion and feeling completely out of control of my circumstance Nothing she has ever tried has worked. I've tried therapy Medication many other different things and I'm still just anxious I've been working with people and writing about anxiety for the past 15 years So when Melinda came to me for help, I decided to try something completely unconventional I came up with five social challenges that will take Melinda across Southern California over two weeks These five challenges embody the five principles to overcoming social anxiety by learning and practicing these principles Anyone can overcome their fear of socializing no matter how deep-rooted it is The catch is that these challenges are totally awkward and uncomfortable Especially for someone like Melinda and that's why to make sure she actually does them if you complete the entire scavenger hunt You'll get $10,000 But first she needs to find this guy from Saskatoon Dude I think we're gonna be here for a while. She's nervous. She's very nervous. The point of the first challenge is simple Desensitization get outside talk to some strangers realize the awkwardness is not going to kill She's got to stop thinking about it and just pull the trigger this is gonna take forever Shit I think she's going no chickened out. Oh Oh She's doing it are you from Saskatoon, Canada? I'm not. Okay. Sorry. You look like someone I knew like years ago from there Never mind. Thank you. Never mind one down like 30 more to go you look so familiar Yeah, are you from Saskatoon by chance, Canada? I was on a trip there years ago and like ran into someone who look exactly like you I was like is that the same? Sorry about that Is she on her phone? Oh my god, who are you talking to? Talking to nobody Are you from Saskatoon, Canada? Okay Are you guys from Saskatoon by chance like Canada, okay. Oh Shit she's walking. She's walking towards him. She's walking towards I'm so sorry. I feel like I are you from Saskatoon, Canada? The Cure to anxiety is not courage But curiosity when you train yourself to be curious about others and new activities you remove the constant focus away from yourself And you create opportunities to learn about others When we get anxious we tend to kind of start word vomiting Start at like level two or four I didn't love before I didn't love before throughout the day Melinda and I spent hours with various instructors And as time went on she slowly got better at asking them questions about themselves and their craft What's your favorite thing to bake? Do you do other kinds of art? Do you know the name of the one in Hawaii the more questions? She asked the more you could see her taking the pressure off of herself. Do you ever watch the Great British Bake Off? So, how do you keep it moist? How many layers are in a croissant? How long does it take you to make a bowl? And so how big is that gonna get? What am I even afraid of as Melinda found out the more you focus on someone else the quicker you find common ground with? That person I have a lot of anxiety and find that it's really helpful to be in tactile and have muscle memory Feels really good and safe. It's very grounded. You feel like okay Like this is something that I can focus on and not be so in your head. Yeah How did that feel because you prompted me to ask questions I was just listening more and I was like, okay, what else can I say about this or ask about this? Yeah But then I found after a while that I wasn't Thinking so much about like what to ask if the first challenge got Melinda to talk to strangers The second showed her that those strangers weren't so different from her They too were anxious and self-conscious and in many cases They fell in love with their craft because it saved them from their demons My biggest fear was public speaking This realization would eventually be profound for Melinda with two challenges down She was on her way to that $10,000 reward But first she would have to confront some public embarrassment and revisit a childhood experience. That's haunted her her entire life I Most people who struggle with social anxiety have some deeply painful event in their past as a result They spend their lives associating strangers with fear pain and ridicule I had an event where a girl threw up on me on a school bus and that triggered this huge Years and years long like I was diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive Disorder that morphed into like eating disorders and all kinds of other stuff that is like manifested in different ways throughout my life It might sound simple but a huge part of overcoming social anxiety is rewiring that association Showing her that strangers don't have to be scary. They can be fun We won't make science offering free hugs How anxious are you feeling I've been like weirdly Bodily it's just today. I felt a lot of just sort of like, uh, like Body anxieties like fast heartbeat and just like feeling nervous. I mean I feel that a little bit too Yeah, because this is not a normal thing that This was the first moment that I noticed a shift in Melinda before she approached every social activity with dread But as we made the sign for free hugs, I noticed that despite being nervous She saw the challenge as an adventure and not something to simply suffer through I'm just sorry to see things as a set of opportunities for something to go wrong It's an opportunity to have a fun and meaningful and rewarding experience My best friend That Was actually really fun I was nervous as we were walking just because like a lot of people were looking at us But once we started getting hugs from people, it was really nice. It's just good vibe Yeah, isn't it? One of those things that you feel stupid for being nervous about? Yeah, like you're just like, wow I've not laughed so hard and like just how Happy it made people As we talked in the car afterward Melinda's entire demeanor had changed There was a joy that had never been there before instead of talking of her anxiety in terms of suffering She was talking about it in terms of excitement and humor and what most people don't get is that this is what getting over anxiety Actually looks like it's not getting rid of the anxiety. It's learning to play with it She seemed to be getting it But if she was going to complete the last two challenges and win the $10,000 I knew that Melinda wouldn't be laughing for very long There's a beautiful concept in social psychology that I call the going-first principle It's simple when two people are talking whatever one person is willing to express or disclose about themselves The other will then feel free to express or disclose in return It's this disclosure that then creates a sense of friendship and intimacy for people with social anxiety like Melinda They often spend their entire lives Waiting for other people to go first to give them permission to express the things that they think and feel For this next challenge, I put Melinda in a room with strangers and through prompts written on notecards Forced her to go first with them. Oh, man If you can magically fix one relationship in your life, who would it be and why oh My gosh at first Melinda struggled with this exercise and spent most of her time agreeing with whatever was said to her But then she sat down with Rick And after a little initial small talk She finally took the leap and went first and something incredible happened I wouldn't say that I was addicted to alcohol in any way, but I heavily relied on it and it was The sort of thorn in my side for most of my adult life where I felt like I couldn't function socially without it at all and so I think I Quit like a year and a half ago almost Yeah, yeah It was a big deal for me and out of that came so much emotion Just like because it was all there like I had nothing to numb it with at all anymore I was just dulling that down like, you know, whacking it with a hammer like whack-a-mole for years It's a very strange feeling to actually feel like you're alone with yourself always You know and with no numbing What about you? That's like that's like I mean, it's a far longer conversation. We probably have time for but the bottom line is You know, I have a history of drug addiction. I have a history of homelessness. I have a history of trauma emotional trauma But I'm also a parent, you know, I'm a dog lover. I'm an animal lover I'm like I have both sides of that spectrum of light and dark like swim around inside of me, you know And from my experience, you know, it's good to be heard It's good to be seen because you feel invisible. Yeah, and just real simple like like Conversation can really do a lot. It really can do a lot. Yeah, absolutely Well, I went there. That's yeah, that's incredible. Thank you for sharing that. Yeah Yeah, that's really a vulnerable thing and just really powerful to hear that For the final challenge and for $10,000 I surprised Melinda was something that just two weeks ago She never would have imagined herself capable of doing what's up guys? Looking back over our time together. I felt that she was ready. I think she felt it, too Whoo, so you just spent about two hours revealing every detail every detail of my private life What changed in this whole experiment for me is in my mind I Always saw it as a test. It was always am I saying the right thing? What's the right thing to say here? And it's all about me I didn't see it as an opportunity to give someone the gift to share their story and to share you know who they are Do the guests what's happening? I have guests so many things I Was there a lot of people that I was like, oh, I'm gonna be like, oh, I'm gonna be like, oh, I'm gonna be like Oh, I'm gonna be like, oh, I'm gonna be like, oh, I'm gonna be like, oh, I'm gonna be like, oh, I'm gonna be like I have guests so many things I I was thinking like a weird like speed dating type of thing where I'm like talking to random people around like some kind of a restaurant or some kind of buffet event karaoke When we started this you were visibly And As we've gone along you can see visually watching you relaxed so much You're having fun. Yeah Come on Oh Welcome to your final challenge, your challenge, we have a room full of people. Your final challenge. I want you to give us all a brief history of your anxiety past, present and future. Wow. Okay. So whenever you're ready, lean up to the mic. This is not anything that I expected. So thank you all for being here and hearing a brief history of my anxious past, present and future. I said something recently about how I came out of the womb anxious. There's this amazing classic picture of me at an airport. I look so upset. And that's basically like been me ever since I can remember. I was like diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder in fifth grade, put on Paxil, Prozac, every like medication under the sun. And then that morphed into an eating disorder in sixth through college. And then that morphed into heavy binge drinking to deal with just being around people. Without alcohol, it's really brought into forefront how much I use that as a crutch to deal with this crippling anxiety. How confident do you feel about returning back to your regular life? I feel very confident in doing it because I've seen that I can do it. If I'm approaching a social situation and feeling anxious about something, I know what perspective to come at it from. Here's the goal of curiosity. That's your only intention for this. Like nothing else matters. I feel like there's a couple of things that are different about this time. I feel like I've tried to get help in the past, but this time I actually really wanted. And I didn't before because my fear was stronger than that curiosity and like wanting something better for myself. Working with Mark and his whole experience, he's basically helped me to shift that lens from people are scary and like I should be fearful to coming at social interactions through a lens of curiosity. Every social interaction up until, you know, recently has been just kind of like, how do I get through this as fast as possible? It's ruined every relationship I've ever had. And you know, I want to keep this one. That has been a big motivator for me to get over this. And in doing that, it's been, you know, I realized, hey, this isn't just good for us, it's good for me. One of the biggest lessons I've learned is that we can't do anything on our own. And everything that we have in life is a result of other people, like every single thing. That's something that took me way too long to learn. And I'm just really grateful that I know that now. I'm grateful for every single person who has been there for me. And that's all I'll say. I have no words, like that was not at all what I expected. Since this is a YouTube show and everything, I went to a printer and got a big fucking check. Seeing people who I care about who came out to this, knowing that there are other people who feel like this, and maybe they see that there's a way out of it, and if you just keep working at it, that it can change. And your perspective can change, I think is what the most important thing is to me. I want people to know that your perspective can change."}
