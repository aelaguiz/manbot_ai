Doctors believed that making someone bleed everywhere would cure disease. Scientists believed that fire was made out of something called phlogiston. And women believed that rubbing dog urine on their face had anti-aging benefits. When I was a kid, I used to think that mediocre was a vegetable, and I didn't want to eat it. As a teenager, I told everyone that I didn't care about anything when, the truth was, I cared way too much. We all admit that we were wrong about so much in the past. Yet we never stop to consider what we might be wrong about right now. Life isn't about being right all the time. It's about figuring out all the ways you might be wrong. Because being wrong opens you up to the possibility of change. Being wrong means you can learn and grow and be better. It means not cutting your arm open to cure a cold, or splashing dog piss on your face to look like Ariana Grande. So ask yourself, what could you be wrong about, and how could you be better?"}
