For me, it was starting my first business. I distinctly remember falling asleep with my laptop on my stomach only to wake up 6 hours later and immediately get back to work where I left off. In a world that glorifies hustle culture and emphasizes the grind, it's easy to make the assumption that hard work must fundamentally suck. It's not supposed to be fun, we're told. After all, if it was easy, then everybody would fucking do it. But what if it didn't have to suck? What if it wasn't painful? What if it was actually kind of fun? Today, I'm talking to Ali Abdaal, a former medical doctor, turned YouTuber, and author of the new book, Feel Good Productivity. Ali graduated near the top of his class at Cambridge and went into practicing medicine full-time in his 20s, when he realized something both dumb and profound, that it wasn't very fun. So Ali decided to make it fun, and as a part of making it fun, he created a YouTube channel to share some of his ideas around making it fun. Today, he has more than 5 million subscribers and runs one of the largest educational channels in the entire world. Ali has achieved incredible success in two of life's most intensely demanding and challenging domains. Yet, he claims that his success stems less from his hard work and willingness to suffer, and more from his creativity and ability to make even the most intense drudgery fun. In this episode, we're going to talk about how productivity got its bad reputation, how most of the so-called productivity advice actually makes it worse. We'll discuss why working more hours isn't always more productive, and how sometimes the most useful thing you can do is not work at all. We'll hear Ali explain why the optimal number of distractions is actually not zero, and how he chooses goals in his life to make failure impossible. We'll also learn how the biggest thing holding most people back is that they actually take their work too seriously. This episode is more than just a conversation, it's a journey into rethinking how we view work, time, and our lives. It's about breaking down the barriers of conventional productivity myths and discovering a path that leads to genuine happiness and balance.

So, without further ado, let's fucking get into it. Brawl. Do you even podcast? Like, brawl. This is the subtle art of not giving a fuck podcast, with your host, Mark Manson. What do you think is the biggest thing most people misunderstand about productivity? I think one of the big misconceptions about productivity is that it's about hustle, it's about grind, it's about work, work, work. You know, people sometimes are like, oh, but don't you want to be unproductive some of the time? And I guess it's somewhat semantic, because if people are defining productivity as efficiency of getting work done, then okay, I can see that. I think I choose to define productivity in a much more holistic sense. To me, productivity is using your time in a way that's intentional and effective and enjoyable, ideally. For example, this evening, I have an evening of alone time where I'm going to play Baldur's Gate 3 on my MacBook, and I might even go and pick up a gaming laptop for myself, because I've been salivating over the Razer Blade 16-inch, and there's a store in LA that has it in stock. That to me is productivity. It's using my time intentionally and effectively, because I'm playing on hard difficulty, and enjoyably, because it's going to be fun. And having that one evening a week where I play video games, to me, is like, that's the dream. That's what I've been trying to optimize for my whole life. My 13-year-old self would be, you know, having a field day if he knew that this is where I've ended up, where I can play video games. That to me is also productivity. And I think if we expand out the definition, then we can start applying the principles of productivity, like, you know, the stuff that you and I talk about, the stuff that Tim Ferriss talks about. You can start applying the principles of productivity to anything in life. So I love optimizing my relationship, and using principles of productivity in my relationship. It's like, how do we do this in a way that's more intentional, and effective, and enjoyable? And reading books about what makes relationships work, and regular rituals, and check-ins, and routines. And we have a Notion page for our relationship reviews, and have done for the last two and a bit years. That is applying productivity to real life, rather than just to work. And so I think people almost focus down too much on just the work thing, or the how do I get better grades, and not enough on, hang on, I'm learning a set of skills here. Let me just make my life better. I feel like people, there's a tendency to fetishize suffering and sacrifice. You know, we tend to love hearing other people's stories of all the shit you went through, how much you struggled, all the setbacks you overcame. Like, that's very entertaining when it happens to other people. And we really admire that. And so I think we kind of romanticize that in ourselves. And we think to do something great, you have to struggle and suffer immensely, and be miserable, and force yourself through all sorts of awful shit. So what I love about this is it's the first productivity book I've come across that treats emotions as one of the fundamental systems within an overall productivity framework. And this is something that I, like, I would try to write this for years. I would try to explain to people that any sort of productivity problem is fundamentally an emotional problem. Like, the reason, if you're not doing something, it's because you don't feel like doing it. It's not, there's no, it's not a software issue. It's not like a lack of tools, or it's not because you didn't get up early enough. It's because there's some sort of emotional resistance or anxiety that's preventing you from taking the right actions or modifying the behaviors you need to modify. People don't like hearing that. They like hearing, they want the tool, they want the system, they want the morning routine. Why do you think that is? Yeah, I think the emotional piece is so, like, I remember the first time I really came across the idea was reading Steven Pressfield's The War of Art. And he calls it the Resistance, with a capital R. Yeah. And like, when I read that book, it just sort of hit me like a ton of bricks. I was like, Oh, my fucking God, like, this is this is the thing like he's just describing in like this whole book exactly what I feel when I procrastinate. It's this resistance. And what it took for me to kind of get over that was a recognition that the resistance is an internal emotional thing, and almost treating myself like a system. Whereas I think when it comes to kind of like, even even hearing you say that right now talking about emotions, like the part of me that was reading Lifehacker back in the day, is thinking, Oh, come on, emotions like bullshit is this. Get over it. And so many people I speak to, you know, there's that thing of, if I could just find the right tool, if I could just find the right technique, then I wouldn't procrastinate so much. Or if I could just find the right meds for my ADHD, or whatever the thing is, it seems to go in waves in terms of what people think the magic bullet is, but fundamentally just comes down to this thing of you're unproductive, because you don't feel like doing the thing. No one ever struggles with procrastination watching Netflix or hanging out with friends. Yeah, that's not a thing. We struggle with procrastination when it comes to writing that blog post or like studying for that exam or like doing that slightly boring, annoying PowerPoint at work that we don't really want to or like asking our manager for a raise the stuff that feels we feel that resistance. Yeah. And so part of the part of my goal with the book was to try and figure out, okay, cool. We know that's a thing. So therefore, what are the tools that we can use to kind of treat emotions as something important, treat them sincerely, rather than thinking of it as like, oh, I'm just a pussy, because I'm not like grinding like David Goggins does, or whatever the narratives sometimes are. I think it also kind of taps into so I think the big epiphany for me that I had, I think I had it writing my second book. So my attitude in my first my first book was very much bro, you got to fucking grind. You got to suffer. You know, you did nine hours yesterday, let's do 10 today. Let's finish two chapters this month. And I noticed that it started to backfire, that essentially, I would get four really, really good high quality hours out of myself. And then every hour past that would be low quality, or it would be a very mediocre output. And then I realized that when you're writing a book, mediocre output is actually worse than no output, because you have to go back and either heavily edit and revise it, which is just adding work for yourself, or you have to make a bunch of very difficult decisions of whether to cut it, delete it, and so on. So I had this weird realization, probably way too late, that at least in the context of book writing, four really effective hours was actually more productive than 10 moderately effective hours. Yeah. And when that unlocked for myself, I started wondering where else that applied in my life. Where else in my life is that the production curve actually, not only is there diminishing returns, but it's actually turning negative at a certain point. I totally vibe with this. I think I am always on the lookout for areas of my life that have that diminishing return, sort of kind of where the curve goes down afterwards. I'm also always on the lookout for areas where there's kind of compounding returns. Like for example, but things like starting a YouTube channel, the difference between making one video a week and making two videos a week, it's actually, it's a step change because if you're able to do two videos a week, you have twice as many chances for one of them to pick up. And generally putting twice as much effort into a single video does not, depending on the channel, doesn't yield as much value as putting that effort into two different videos. And so there comes a point where maybe it takes you 20 hours a week to do one video, but like you could do 30 hours to get two videos and actually that extra 10 hours then unlocks an extra step change in output, which then improves your odds at succeeding in the thing rather than diminishes your odds at succeeding on the thing. And so I think there are, there are some areas of life where we have the diminishing returns and others where we have the compounding. But I think there are far more where we have the diminishing than the compounding. And like balance is good. It's like all writers fundamentally like ultimately arrive at the four hour number as well. Like I've yet to meet a writer who writes any more than four hours or has done it for a long time who has landed on number more than four. It seems to be a thing. Yeah. Well, I think there've been a lot of studies too on just your average worker, laborer. It's the vast majority of their productivity comes in the first four or five hours. When they do studies on how much people get done in like the corporate world, hours five through eight, it's not much. And then if even the first four hours are like filled with multitasking and distractions and like, oh, grabbing a coffee with someone here and there and the whole day goes by. And you know, I have this these days where the whole day will go by and I'd be like, I've written maybe 300 words and I was aiming for a thousand today. But like, how did I write 300 words in eight hours? Like, what the hell? Like, how did this happen? And it turns out because well, distractions and lack of focus and you know, all the things that everyone struggles with. Do you think the optimal number of distractions is zero? Do you think this, this concept that we're talking about of how like having that day to just play video games and like let your brain wander, does that also apply on a micro basis with say checking your phone? Yeah. We, we found a really cool study about this. That's in the book. And we weirdly there's a graph and it's sort of like a, an N shaped graph. You know, there was a study, I think it was, you know, they got people to solve a Sudoku and also to like on a different tab, do some other puzzle and also in a different tab, do some, some other puzzle. And they looked at like, you know, they were allowed to switch between the puzzles and they found that there was actually a sweet spot that like some amount of switching between tasks is actually good for you rather than the traditional narrative, which is that you must focus on one thing at a time and exclusively that one thing at a time. And so there is there, there does seem to be some kind of, some kind of optimal number. So, so, you know, this is why like if I'm, if I'm working on something and someone will come along and talk to me, I don't really let it phase me. I think of these as welcome distractions in a way. If I get a notification of like some news site that I wasn't really, I didn't really care about and that derails me, that to me is an unwelcome distraction. Yeah. But one thing I used to do at university is prop my door open at all times with a little shoe door stopper thingy. And so if a friend would come by and, and disturb me and distract me for a few minutes, that to me is a great thing. Like the point of university is to hang out with friends, not really to study. And maybe I was marginally less efficient, less productive, but like those, those like hallway conversations sometimes led to hangouts, led to plans, led to interesting things. Like that's kind of the point of life. So I'm all about trying to find, find ways to leave the door open or like work in a communal area or something that allows surface area for serendipity when it comes to interactions with people. Interesting. Yeah. I used to be one of those people who was a little bit religious. I went through a phase, I should say, of maybe three years that I was very religious about those blocker apps that like block out social media and news sites and, you know, all the riffraff that you try to avoid on a day-to-day basis. And I guess, I don't know, a year or two ago, I just kind of came to a conclusion that it was, well, to the core premise of your book, it was, I was feeling bad. You know, I was, I was almost like over-invested in being hyper-productive all the time. And so at some point I just turned them all off and I'm like, well, I'll turn them on if it's ever a problem. And 90% of the time, it's not really a problem. What you said there really resonates with me because, you know, I'll change it if it's a problem. Yeah. I think that's like just a pretty chill way to approach life. That's like, I'll change it if it's a problem. So you've achieved two things that are very difficult to do. You've become a doctor and you've become a successful YouTuber. Those are also two completely different things. One is a very creative, entrepreneurial pursuit. One is a very traditional, bury your head in the books, memorize a million things. What are the skills that crossover between those two things? What are the skills that crossover between those two things? sort of YouTube cover artists that would sing covers of popular songs. Right, guys, today we're going to talk about five ways to do well in your medical school entrance exam. I think the other thing that both medical school and being a YouTuber teach you is the ability to just stick with it for long enough. And again, finding a way to make it fun was the real hack for me, even when I was in medical school. Similarly, YouTube, most channels don't succeed unless you consistently make videos every week for like two years. And then at that point you start benefiting from the compounding and honestly I think it all comes back down to feel good productivity. If you find a way to make your work feel good, you're more likely to be patient with it for two years. It also helps solve that conundrum of how do you know when to stick with it and how do you know when to quit and give up and stop chasing a pipe dream. Exactly, yeah, it's fun. You're doing it for the sake of the thing itself rather than the outcome that you're getting from the thing. You said to me over lunch the other day, if it's not fun, I'm not going to do it. The thing is I need to find a way to make it fun, otherwise I'm not going to do it. You know what's funny about me is I think I had that early in my career and I think it's a big reason of why I became successful. I was very uncompromising about what I would write, the way I would write it, the particular tone or style, the subjects I would address. Part of what kind of fucked me up after subtle art became so popular was just very big, impressive corporations, name brands, celebrities, all these people started interacting with me and wanting to do projects with me and I didn't feel that liberty to, I was like, oh man, I'm doing a feature film with Universal Pictures, I can't fuck this up, I can't say these things. I lost touch with that for a number of years and as your book correctly points out, I got burnt out because that's what happens when you stop having fun with something. If you're not completely aligned with why you're doing something, you lose the joy and you lose the momentum that keeps you going through the hard times. I want to ask you really quick, while we're talking about medicine versus YouTube, how is the production function different between creative work and say kind of rote memorization, studying, science, learning? All of it is creative work. This is another thing that students always get wrong. This is my biggest piece of advice for a lot of students. Sometimes you do have to rote memorize the Krebs cycle and one way to do that is to just continue to drill it again and again. The other way of doing it is to create a mnemonic or something fun or a cool way of thinking about it. Before starting medical school, I read loads of books about memory. World champion memory people who memorized decks of cards and 18,000 digits of pi and all that shit. Basically all of them were like, yeah, you just need to create a really strong association, like a strong visual association in your mind. The more absurd that association is, the more likely you are to learn the thing. When me and my medic friends get together, we'll joke about the ways that we used to memorize things. Like isoniazid gives you peripheral neuropathy, because isoniazid, the drug, sounds kind of like ISIS, and ISIS famously chop your hands off if you do bad things. Imagine peripheral neuropathy is like isoniazid. I don't know, ethambutol sort of makes your wee orange because ethamb has the word ham in it. If you think ham, it's sort of like pink, and pink is sort of like orange, but you get like orange wee. And that was how me and most of my friends got through the rote memorization of medical school, which is a highly creative task. Or like making cool mnemonics to memorize all 12 cranial nerves. There's various rude versions of them. It's like on, on, on they traveled and found various something and horcruxes. It gives you all the nerves of the face and stuff. It's shit like that that makes it fun. It's a creative act. Finding a way to, another kind of tip if any student's listening to this, to categorize things. You know, hematology is like, you know, the study of the blood. It's like a huge field. But like if you look at all 100 conditions in hematology, you can basically categorize them into three things. Great. That simplifies it. Now within those three things, you've got categories for like four things. And the textbooks won't tell you this because they're sorted in fucking alphabetical order for no reason. So you just have to like look at the shit and be like, okay, what's a sensible categorization of this? Oh, great. There's like anemia, there's malignant heme, and there's like a nonmalignant heme. So three categories, bang, bang, bang, tree structures. And it's also creative and also fun. And, you know, now when I speak to medical students, the ones who are like, oh man, medical school is such a grind, but once I be a doctor, it's going to be fun. I'm always like, oh, we need to talk. Because if you're finding medical school a grind where going into the hospital is optional, you are not going to find being a doctor fun where suddenly going into work is no longer optional. And I will always try and encourage students, find a way to make whatever you're studying feel good, find a way to make it fun, because that is an attitude that will help you learn the thing better and also mean you're less stressed and also make you enjoy life more. I'm just like massively. It's remarkable that you still have the recall of all that stuff, you know, 10 years later. Visual metaphors and imagery. The fun thing for me, I find it in my own life, particularly useful around fitness and health. Because like most people, I think I found fitness to be just a fucking bummer. I'm struggling with this right now. Like, help me, help me figure this out. Yeah, so it's, the thing that unlocked it, and I'm not a huge CrossFitter, but I visited a couple CrossFit classes and it completely, I mean, it's like the first section of your book could basically just be kind of a guide to like why CrossFit works. Because they gamify everything. They put you in teams and they track scores and help you, you know, try to best get new PRs and do all this stuff. And it was the first time, you know, my associations with fitness and working out, it was always this drudgery. It was like, oh, well, yeah, I'm doing this today because I don't wanna fucking die when I'm 60. You know, all the stuff that you read about, or I wanna lose 10 pounds before summer. And it never felt good. It was never fun. It felt like an obligation. It felt like a chore. It felt like a lot of it was shame-driven or judgment-driven. And then I went to some of those CrossFit classes and I had the hardest workouts of my life. Like I was literally laying on the floor, you know, like world swirling above me, barely remaining conscious. And I'm like giggling with how much fun I had. And it was such an epiphany to me of just like turn it into a game, turn it into a little competition with yourself, invite friends over. Like I used to be so rigid and structured about like a workout program, right? Like I'd go online and find like this, oh, this is the workout program that's gonna help you build 10 pounds of muscle in the next three months. And I'm like, oh man, I gotta do this. I gotta like show up every day. And again, back to that point of, you know, I used to think you had to hit every workout exactly the way it's listed at exactly the day that you're supposed to do it. And I realized like if you miss a day or if you have to push it back a day or maybe a friend is coming into town and he's got a workout program and you're gonna do it together or maybe like he likes to run. So maybe I go running with him instead of my workout that day. It keeps it fun and interesting and novel and that keeps the motivation going. It keeps the excitement going. Tracking was another huge unlock for me. I never tracked my workouts in the past. I was just kind of, again, I would download some list off the internet and just like follow it to a T like a fucking robot. And when I got a tracking app and I started putting in all my lifts and all my weights and how many reps I did of everything and every single week when I open up that app, when I start my workout, I'm like, okay, last week I did three sets of eight at this weight. Today I'm gonna try to do three sets of nine and see if I can do it. And just that little bit of competition with myself gets me through that set, gets me excited about it. When I hit it, it feels good. Yeah, it's been incredibly profound. And again, it's one of those fucking obvious things. And I hate shit like this because it's when you have to take your own medicine. It's the advice that you've written about for years that you never applied in your own life. But it's been really transformative the past couple of years, for sure. So I've been struggling with motivation or consistency on the fitness front for literally years. And again, when I was reading the audio book for this a few months ago, I was like, my God, literally, I have not thought about applying this principle to fitness. And just find a way to make it feel good. And if you've tried all the things and it doesn't, then change it up and try something else. So I've been thinking in the back of my mind, I really wanna try CrossFit because there's so many examples from CrossFit of how they use all these strategy stuff. And I've yet to try CrossFit. I didn't stick with CrossFit. I actually found CrossFit too intense, which a lot of people run into that issue and a lot of people get injured and things like that. What I noticed when I was doing CrossFit is I would go so hard that I would feel exhausted for the next 48 hours. And it actually dampened my energy because I was overexerting. So in many ways, it's almost like the problem with CrossFit is it's too effective. It gets you going too hard. It is such a worthwhile experience just to go experience the community. The community is amazing. People, they're so positive there. It's very, doesn't matter. There'll be a dude next to you who's lifting 400 pounds and you're struggling to get the bar off the ground and people are cheering for you just as hard as they're cheering for that guy. There's no judgment. Everybody's super positive. So thumbs up CrossFit. Yeah, I would absolutely check it out. So this is something that comes up a lot with my readers and fans. And I'm curious, it just occurred to me that there might be an analog in the productivity world as well. But I've actually, over the years, I've come to the conclusion that in kind of the self-help personal development space, there's actually secretly two separate categories that are going on. And I think a lot of people get them mixed up, which is, the first one is advice that takes you from bad to okay. So it's like, if you're depressed, here are some things you can do to help you not be so depressed. But then there's also advice that takes you from okay to great. If you're just kind of a normal person going about their life, but you wanna do something really amazing and special, here are four things that you can try to make your life way more effective. And I find there's so much confusion in my world and readers and people who follow other people in this space. They see the bad to okay advice and they mistake it for okay to great advice. They'll be like, oh, well, that's obvious. Everybody knows that. I'm like, well, yeah, it's not meant for you. It's meant for the guy who can't get off the couch. Or it's okay to great advice, but it's misconstrued by people being like, well, that's not gonna help me get over my crippling anxiety. I can't even do this or that. I wonder if there's an analog in the productivity space because a lot of what we're talking about is mitigation. It's almost like mitigating unproductivity rather than maximizing productivity. It's like making sure you're not falling below 80% rather than killing yourself trying to get to 99%. I really like this. I've not thought of it in this way, but I think there are definitely analogs. One thing that comes to mind is like bad to okay is often about the basic obvious things and often about the hardware, like sleep, exercise, nutrition. If you're depressed, just like, you know, people have done the studies on this, sleeping eight hours a night, doing some exercise every single day, having some social contact and like, that's about it. And like eating well, it's like- That solves 80% of it. It solves 80% of it. The other 20% is like whatever. So for someone who's depressed, worrying about maximizing their typing speed or keyboard shortcuts or bashing and all that shit that we have to talk about, it's kind of meaningless. But to go from okay to great, you still have to have the basics done because the basics will derail you immediately. You can have the best productivity hacks in the world, but if you're sleeping three hours a night, obviously it's not going to work. And so you have to do the basics well, the basic fundamentals, the boring fundamentals, and then you can start adding stuff on top of that. But recognizing that like, I think, like that point you made at the start, like the people with billion dollar businesses are not really working that much harder than the people with million dollar businesses, even though there's a huge difference between billion and a million."}
