I don't believe anything anyone else says. I think that everything I say is questionable. Maybe it's right, maybe it's wrong. I think it's right when I say it, but we don't know ourselves that well. We think we remember things in the past perfectly, but we don't. And so I just operate through life this way, choosing what beliefs serve me best. Meaning like, any particular ways you could look at things. One way just makes you sad and just makes you want to just stay in bed. Another way makes you jump up out of your chair and take action. Well, then I'll choose the way that makes me jump out of my chair. I'll choose the perspective that makes me take action. If it's a useful belief, I'll choose it because nothing's true anyway. I mean, except for some physical realities, almost nothing in our social world is true. Meaning absolutely, necessarily, inarguably, objectively, repeatedly true. So I'm just choosing the beliefs that serve me best."}
