My friend got married and there was no alcohol at the wedding, which I didn't know beforehand. I was upset because I had spent money on a hotel room and transportation expecting to drink. During the cocktail hour, I asked the couple where the booze was and the bride explained that her family doesn't drink and they were paying for the wedding. I voiced my frustration and the bride did not take it well. Gee, I wonder why. And implied that I might have a drinking problem. The groom called me an asshole and the bride asked me to leave. Dude, you spent money on a hotel room, you spent money on transportation. These people spent tens of thousands of dollars on the most important day of their life and invited you to be a guest, that is not about you, to come witness this special day and you made it about yourself. This is almost by definition what an asshole is."}
