You may not have realized it but your Economics 101 class taught you, \u201cthere is no such thing as a free lunch.\u201d\n\nThink about it, if you\u2019re eating an awesome cheesesteak, you\u2019re giving up the chance to eat a hamburger. If you\u2019re eating a hamburger you\u2019re giving up the chance to eat a double-stacked burrito. And if you\u2019re eating a double-stacked burrito, then you\u2019re giving up the ability to ever respect yourself again.\n\nEverything you do in life is a trade-off. Anything you say, do, or pursue has a cost and a benefit. Those costs and benefits may not always be immediately apparent \u2014 sometimes the costs and benefits are dislocated in time, the benefit being immediate and the cost in the distant future. Sometimes the costs or benefits are subtle and psychological. But nonetheless, there is always a trade-off.\n\nIn this video we\u2019re looking at how decisions in life come down to trade-offs. And how it just so happens we\u2019re really bad at evaluating trade-offs. Watch it. Like it. Comment on it.

These are all things that we need to know to get through life in one piece. That's why this video is dedicated to learning how to make better decisions, and you could start by deciding to subscribe and like this video. Our understanding of human decision making has evolved a lot over the millennia. The ancients believed that your decisions were mostly based on your inherent character. You were either born a piece of shit and did piece of shit things, or you were born virtuous and did virtuous things. Later on in the middle ages, people's decisions were seen as a cosmic struggle between good and evil. People believed that angels and demons and spirits would take control of people and force them to do horrible things or great things. It wasn't until the enlightenment that personal agency started to figure into these things. People realized like, oh hey, people have free will. They can do whatever they want. They can choose to be good and evil. They can change as life goes on. These ideas particularly started with the work of John Locke in the mid 1600s. Locke said that we were born a blank slate or tabula rasa. He said that all of our experiences that happen to us etch into our personality what we will seek into the world. So if I grow up to be a total shit for brains, that's probably because my parents were shit for brains or the people around me were shit for brains. Basically Locke correctly identified that many of our values and beliefs throughout our life come from us from our environment. But the ultimate philosophical fuck fest of personal agency came from everybody's favorite capitalist Adam Smith. It was with the rise of capitalism and international trade that people really started to understand that individual motives and decisions when taken in aggregate can be better for all. Early economists began to see society in terms of everybody making individual decisions based on rational cost and benefit. Everything became an economic decision. The choice to leave my hometown and go live in the big city became an economic decision. Are the benefits better than the cost? So the prevailing view was that ultimately everybody behaves in a rational and confident manner. This idea that everybody is quietly subconsciously weighing the cost and benefits in our head is something that's known as cognitive cost benefit analysis. It's very simple. Like, let's say I'm laying on my couch and my trash is overflowing. I don't want to fucking take out the trash. That's a drag. So in my head, there's a little scale that's going on. Benefit of sitting on the couch all day. Benefit of taking out the trash. Which one weighs more? Now everybody has a different threshold where at some point the garbage starts to stink, starts to make your house all smelly. You start to get really annoyed at yourself, feel like a waste of a human being, and suddenly the scales tip and you get off your ass and you take the garbage out. You can visualize most basic human behaviors in this manner. The problem is, is when you get some major life decisions. Let's say I'm trying to decide whether I'm going to quit my job as a writer and become a monk for the next five years. I can kind of do the cost and benefit thing, but the problem is, is that the repercussions are so massive and so ambiguous. It's impossible to objectively know like, what is the value of quitting my career? What is the value of moving to a cave and staring at a wall for the next five years? What is the cost? We don't really know. We vaguely know. We think we know, but we are very bad at extrapolating large scale events over long periods of time or events that have vast repercussions for the rest of our life. So it was around the 1970s and 1980s that economists and psychologists started to finally pick up on this. Like, wait a second, this shit's actually really hard to judge. It turns out that humans are terrible at predicting the actual costs and benefits to their actions. We are consistently wrong at guessing how things are going to make us feel. Things that we think are going to make us really happy turn out to only make us a little bit happy. Things that we think are going to make us miserable turn out to not really make us miserable. Things that we think are going to be okay end up being the best thing that we ever did in our lives. And so in this sense, it becomes very, very hard to gauge accurately what a good decision is going to be for ourselves. What these psychologists discovered is that we're basically all operating on a best guess pretty much all the time. And a huge part of this is because we are easily swayed by various biases and prejudices. Or take for example, every Christmas shopping season on Black Friday, there are videos of people fist fighting in Walmart over like toasters and televisions. I mean, what the fuck? What toaster is worth getting clocked in the eye for? So this is one of those cases where it took science like 300 years to catch up to common sense. Of course, people behave irrationally. Of course, we spend money on stupid shit. Of course, we have no idea what's actually going to make us happy and what's not. Even low stakes decisions about business or career or whatever will be petrified. I spent two years thinking about starting this YouTube channel. I've been on television multiple times. I've done hundreds and hundreds of interviews. I've been on camera. I even owned the equipment for like six months and I didn't fucking do anything. Why? I don't know. I was just always making up reasons. Oh, I'm too busy. Oh, I don't know what to say. Oh, nobody's going to watch me. It's just stupid. I was anxious. I was nervous. It was a new thing. It was challenging. I didn't know if it was going to work. But when I sat down and actually thought through things strategically, removed my own emotions from the situation, I'm like, yeah, there's no reason not to do this. Why are you whining and freaking out and making noises? Maybe people will see that I talk to myself. Well, what's wrong with talking to yourself, Mark? I don't know. You talk to yourself all the time. I mean, writing is kind of a form of talking to yourself. You do that all the time. Yeah, people seem to like that. What's your problem? What's your problem? Fuck you. Fuck you. Where was I? Ultimately, economics is right. We do have this balanced scale in our head. The problem is, is that we're not objective about what goes on each side. Our emotions and our bias perceptions put a finger on the scale on each side in different ways. So the first thing to understand is how those biases and prejudices weigh on our mind, how our perceptions of things get slanted, how we get messed up and misjudge what is actually involved in a decision. So there are a few books that I really encourage you to check out that can teach you these kinds of things that help you understand how your mind is just messing these calculations up all the time. The first one is called Predictably Irrational by Dan Ariely. The book is full of fascinating experiments where subjects consistently make poor choices simply by altering how a menu is laid out or if the more expensive prices are at the top versus the bottom. There are all sorts of subtle things like this that affect our sense that something is cheap or expensive. There's another great book called Influence by Robert Cialdini. It shows you all the ways that we are persuaded and manipulated into thinking things are right. Or better than they actually are. There's one interesting experiment in the book where they found that people who cut in line piss everybody off. I mean, fuck line cutters, right? But people who cut in line and then give a reason for cutting in line, people don't get mad at them, even if the reason makes absolutely no sense. So in the experiment, they had people cut in line for something and then turn around and say, oh, I'm sorry, my dog died last week. And people are like, all right, yeah, go ahead. What the fuck? Another great book, one of my personal favorites is Stumbling on Happiness by Daniel Gilbert. Stumbling on Happiness has all of this interesting research around emotion, how we misremember our emotions, how we predict our emotions poorly, how we think we were way more upset last year because dad missed our birthday than we actually were, how we predict we're going to be way more upset this year when dad misses our birthday. Stop missing my birthday, dad. And then finally, the classic by the Nobel laureate, Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman. It is a dense, comprehensive look at many of the cognitive biases and heuristics that fuck us up in our decision making. And it's eye opening, to say the least. So that's the first step, is to educate yourself on how your mind fucks up. Step two is to utilize some tools to help you become more rational, to help you externalize your thought process so that you can remove those emotional forces that are putting their finger on the scale. The easiest way to do that is to write stuff down. There's something about writing your thoughts down that forces you to look at them as if they're not your own. So anytime in my life when I have a major decision to make, I just start writing about it. I start writing about my thought process. I start explaining all the evidence, all the reasons why I want to make this decision. And sure enough, pretty much every single time, I find that I'm overestimating things. I find I'm underestimating things. Another way to do this, obviously, is to find an advisor or a mentor or somebody you look up to, maybe even just a friend who isn't afraid to tell you you're an idiot if you need to hear it. Talk to them through your thought process and then actively ask them to challenge you on it. And then the last strategy is something a little bit less scientific, but also something I feel pretty strongly about. That is optimize your decisions for zero regrets. Ultimately, a lot of things are impossible to know if they're a good thing or not. But if you ask yourself, will I regret doing it or will I regret not doing it? That can often give you your answer. Many years ago, I had the opportunity to move to New York City. It was a daunting choice. I'd been living abroad for seven years. I had just gotten engaged. I wasn't sure if I wanted to live in the United States anymore. New York is really fucking expensive. I wasn't sure if I could afford it. I asked myself 20 years from now, if I don't do this, will I regret it? And the answer was, yeah, I think I would always wonder what it would have been like to live in New York City. Then I asked myself, if I moved to New York, do I think I would regret it in 20 years? And the answer is no, because if it sucks, you just leave again. Therefore, it became clear that moving to New York was the choice of minimal regret. And that's a tool that I've used in many of my major life decisions. I've simply asked myself, will I regret doing this or will I regret not doing it? And 90% of the time, I would regret not doing it. So I just fucking do it. And that brings me to the harsh truth of the day. The harsh truth of the day is that even if you make great decisions, you don't know that they're great decisions. In the moment, every great decision still feels really tenuous and scary. You're full of doubt. You don't know if it's going to work out or not. I think there's this idea that the right decision, it pops up and you're like, oh my God, it's like the fucking clouds part. And it's like, this is the answer to everything. That never happens. Good decisions, especially the best decisions. The reason they're the best decisions is because it's so difficult to see what the correct move is. So in that sense, the best decision should be scary. It should feel uncomfortable. It should push your boundaries a little bit because that's part of what makes it the best decision. It's a signal of the significance of the moment. So don't look for decisions that feel comfortable and feel easy. Look for the decisions that inspire the doubt, that inspire the insecurity, because that's where the real shit is.
