Why do you think that status has been associated with things like trauma, neurodivergence, gender identity, things like that? I think that these kids are having an identity crisis. I think that we're living in an age of an identity crisis, and there's just so much unknown. You know, whenever you're in environments where there's so much insecurity around you, people tend to cling more to belonging and finding somewhere where they belong. And teenagers, throughout the course of human history, it's no big shocker that teenagers are the prime identity crisis age. So you just compound that with such great uncertainty and such a craving for belonging into some group. Personally, I think we need to help children, all of us, learn how to belong more to ourselves, to our unique selves, and lead from that sense of confidence and self-esteem. But I don't think that's what's happening. People are so desperate to seek belonging to a group, and they've forgotten to belong."}
