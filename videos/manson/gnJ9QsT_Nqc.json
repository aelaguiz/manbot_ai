I dated John for almost a year, toxic free, but tensions arose due to my vegetarianism. I never spent money on meat, which bothered him. On his birthday, we went to a fancy restaurant and he picked the most expensive steak they had along with a bottle of wine. When finished, I asked to split the bill. He assumed that I would pay, and I reminded him of my rule. Angered, he stormed off. I paid for my part plus his wine and waited, but he didn't return. I found him later outside and told him he needed to pay, but he was shocked that I hadn't paid for his steak. He yelled at me, and I calmly insisted he go back and pay, but he scoffed and left. I drove home alone, and now he blames me for not being able to return to the restaurant. Am I the asshole? No, you're not the asshole. I mean, it would be one thing if you sprung this on him in the moment, but this was a clearly defined boundary. It sounds like A, he had too much to drink, and B, that there's probably some underlying resentments that he's feeling unappreciated or unloved, and it just came out in that particular moment."}
