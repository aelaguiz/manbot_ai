Stop thinking about the outcome. Open a fucking Word document. Be present. Click the button. Click the button again. Okay, write the title. That's done. Now write the first sentence, you know, and just kind of taking it little piece by piece, which when you do look at the Zen tradition or a lot of the Eastern traditions, it is very much like that. It's fetch wood, carry water practices. It's like when you read about monks and temples and stuff, like they're just fucking doing chores all day. And part of the practice of that is to only be focused on the next block of wood. Don't look at the tree. Don't look at all the log, like just focus on this one block of wood, split it now, focus on the next block. Again, as a tool, being able to access that state of mind, I think is supremely valuable and ironically productive."}
