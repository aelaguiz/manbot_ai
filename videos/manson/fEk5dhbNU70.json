And you know, a few months ago I did a author summary of my book, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck. And everybody seemed to love that. So I figured, why not do another author summary of the followup book, Everything is Fucked, A Book About Hope. Stick around, check it out. Everything is Fucked, A Book About Hope. Man, what a beast of a fucking book. It is thicker, it is denser, it's more intellectual, it's a little bit more challenging. You know, whereas Subtle Art was very much focused on me individually in my life, this book kind of applies a lot of the same concepts to the world. When I was doing media and promotion for the book, a lot of people asked me, is this a sequel? Is it a followup to Subtle Art? And I told everybody, I said, I don't really think of it as a sequel. I think of it as like the calculus to Subtle Art's algebra. Both are describing similar ideas, it's just that this one has greater depth and more, it's like a higher resolution of the same ideas. But it's also a more challenging read. So I know there's a lot of readers who were a little bit confused by it or frustrated by it. You know, I've gotten tons of emails over the years of people just being like, what the fuck are you doing in chapter four? I don't understand why this is relevant to anything. So hopefully this author summary will go through chapter by chapter and it will help everybody understand kind of what I was going for here and why I wrote some of the fucked up stuff that I did. But before we launch into chapter one, I do wanna talk a little bit about the overarching goal of the book. See, it's always hard coming off a massive best-selling hit because as an artist, you have like competing tensions within yourself. On the one hand, there's a piece of you who's like, holy shit, that did really well. Let's just keep doing that again. Maybe that's fine to do once or twice, but like, I don't wanna just be writing the same book for the rest of my career. And then there's another part of you that's like, fuck that shit, let's do something completely different. Let's keep challenging ourselves, keep pushing ourselves. On top of that, you're getting all this pressure from the outside world. Suddenly the publishers breathing down your neck. You've got media and press and fan pressure and all this stuff. So actually writing this book was a much more difficult process than writing the first one, strange enough. There was just a lot more external pressure compounding all the insecurity and anxiety that you deal with as an author anyway. So everything is fucked. It's kind of titled everything is fucked for a reason. Cause I was like, wow, everything is fucked. Like I don't know what I'm doing. But as the book went on, I settled on a few conclusions. One was I intentionally wanted to make this book deeper, more complex and more intellectual than its predecessor. This might be an insecurity on my part, but one of the most common criticisms of subtle art and of any self-help book whatsoever is like, oh, it's just the guy making this shit up. It's really not. Like I've been studying psychology and philosophy for 10 plus years. Like I'm not just pulling this stuff out of my ass. And so I really wanted to write a book that stretched my own brain muscles as far as they could go. The other thing I really wanted to accomplish with the book is I've felt for a long time, you know, as a literary genre, self-help books are generally short and cheesy and not well-written. Like, let's be honest, most self-help books, not the greatest reads that you've ever had. And so I really enjoy literary fiction. I really enjoy, you know, lots of the classics like Tolstoy and Dostoevsky and James Joyce and Hemingway and all these people. And I've always wondered, what would a literary self-help book look like? Obviously it would be kind of obtuse and difficult to understand, but that's part of the art of it. So after I'd been working on the book for a few months and I'm feeling all this pressure and all this tension, I said, you know what, fuck it. The only thing I can really control is am I writing a book I'm proud of? And am I writing a book that's challenging myself as a writer? I need to do that first. And then I can worry about the publisher and the marketers and the world and sales and all that shit later. For me, the big drive was to take a lot of the similar ideas that were presented in Subtle Art, apply them to a broader philosophical spectrum, and then also present them in kind of a literary way. And I understood when I did this that I'm gonna lose some readers. Like there are gonna be a lot of people who really dug Subtle Art who are just not gonna follow the thread through this second book. And I had to be okay with that. But on the other side, what I find is that people who love everything is fucked love it so much more than they love Subtle Art. It's a very polarizing book in my career. It's one of the most polarizing things I've ever done. Like people either are like, yeah, I didn't really get it, not my thing. Or they're like, okay, Subtle Art was cool, but like this is the real shit. So hopefully in this breakdown, we'll help transfer anybody from that first camp of like, I didn't really get it to the, this is the real shit. Like hopefully you'll understand kind of what I was doing, where I was going with things, why I made the decisions I made. All right, so first of all, the book is split up into two parts. The first part is called Hope, includes the first five chapters. And then the second part is called Everything is Fucked. And that's the last four chapters. Now chapter one is called The Uncomfortable Truth. This chapter is three sections and the sections are all completely different from each other. Most self-help books, they're very formulaic. You've got, say 10 chapters, each chapter is a specific idea. And then within that chapter, you have five or six sections and each section presents a story or something that builds upon that idea. And what I wanted to do just right out of the gate is present three completely different sections coming at the same idea of hope in like three completely different angles. So the first section is the story of Vito Polesky, it's a World War II hero. The only person who ever volunteered to go into a Nazi concentration camp and one of only like 100 people to ever successfully break out of a Nazi concentration camp. Just an all around badass. This is a guy I've wanted to write about for four or five years. I've been looking for a place that I could write about him and I never really had it. So I loved the idea of opening up the book with literally the most heroic story I could possibly think of. Pretty much the most heroic story I've ever heard in my life. The point I wanted to make is that heroism is born from hope. The thing that makes somebody a hero is that no matter how bad everything gets, they never lose hope and they never stop inspiring hope. And so Polesky was like the ultimate example of this. And I also just felt that a lot of the book is about how kind of fragmented and polarized society is today. And so I wanted to start by starting with a Holocaust story. I wanted to start with a story that I think pretty much everybody can agree is evil. Like there's no debate around the Holocaust of whether it was a bad thing or not. And so I wanted to get everybody on the same page, no pun intended, to get the ball rolling. And so after you're exposed to this incredibly heroic story, then I've got this whole section about the Starbucks coffee cup, about how I would write that we're all insignificant dust and that everybody's gonna die one day and nothing you do ever means anything. By the way, this is called the uncomfortable truth of life. Basically what the uncomfortable truth section speaks of is how we all have this existential dread within us. Like there's always this quiet voice in our head that none of this matters, nobody's gonna remember us when we're gone and what the fuck is the point? And I think everybody kind of has that thought occasionally. Some people have it a lot more than others. If you've ever experienced depression, you've probably had it quite a bit, but it's something that we all have to struggle with at some point. And in this section, I kind of construct the psychological construction of hope, which is that hope is having some sort of tangible vision of the future that is worth living for, something that is worth persevering through whatever our struggles are. Without that vision of some better future, everything becomes meaningless. Without hope, there's no reason to do anything. And then finally, the last section is kind of more of like a sociological analysis of how basically we live in the best time ever, whether you're looking at wars or violence or education or equality or technology. By pretty much every metric, living today is better than any time in the past. Now that's not to say that today's great. Like obviously we still got a lot of big problems, but everything has gotten so much better in the last 100 to 200 years, it's pretty fucking crazy. But at the same time, mental health statistics, things like suicides, happiness, depression, like all of these things are becoming more difficult. And generally if you map how like safe and comfortable and wealthy a society is, the higher a lot of these mental health problems are. I call it the paradox of progress, which is basically like the higher the quality of life in society, the more we struggle to find hope. To have hope, you kind of need things to be fucked. If everything's great, then you don't know what to hope for. If everybody's comfortable and happy, if you can get anything you want whenever you want, it's very difficult to think of something to hope for. But if you're dealing with like war, famine, starvation, disease, death, violence, then it's very easy to know what to hope for. Like it's crystal clear to know what to hope for. And so even though these are like three completely disparate, I guess, modalities of writing, one, the first section is very story-driven, the second section is kind of philosophical, and then the third section is very data-driven. They're all driving at the same point, which is this paradox of hope, that the better things get, the more we don't know what to hope for. And the more we don't know what to hope for, the more we desire a hero, the more we struggle with an existential crisis, not knowing what to do with ourselves, things like anxiety and depression. When you weave the three elements together, you kind of get this larger thesis of what's going on in society today. So to wrap up chapter one, I kind of present like a framework of hope. Now this framework is actually, basically I'm ripping off something called self-determination theory and psychology. You can check out the footnotes if you wanna learn about that. It's basically three elements are necessary. The first one is you need to have enough control over your life. You need to have enough autonomy and freedom to pursue something. If you're not capable of pursuing anything, if you're trapped in your life, then hoping doesn't help anything. You can't achieve anything in the future. So why hope for anything in the future? The second thing is you need to have something that you value more than yourself, something that you believe in, something that you actually can think of that makes life better. I loosely just call this values. Like you need to have something that you value highly that is worth pursuing in the future. And then three, you need to have a community or some sort of social support of people who share those values, who share that vision of hope. You can also experience that progress with. So autonomy, values, and community. And those three concepts are gonna make up chapters two, three, and four. Now, chapters two, three, and four all kind of go off the rails with like some pretty crazy fucking metaphors. And so you have to kind of have your literary brain open, but I think they do a much deeper analysis than I guess most people expect on those three concepts. So we'll jump into chapter two. So chapter two, I present this idea of the consciousness car. Really the consciousness car is just a really fun metaphor that I created to describe the research of neuroscientist Antonio Damasio. And basically the consciousness car simply finds that we're just fucking irrational animals. And all of the reasons and logic and stuff that we create for our decisions, they're usually created after the fact to justify the shit that we felt. And so chapter two is really, it's a fun metaphor to help people realize that all of these questions of like procrastination, self-discipline, building the right habits, breaking habits, these are emotional problems. We tend to attack them as though they are logical problems. We create spreadsheets and lists and programs and sign up for coaching. Fundamentally, they are emotional problems. Like the reason you struggle to create a habit around exercise is not that you don't know how to exercise or that you don't know where the gym is. The reason you don't create the habit is because you don't feel like fucking exercising. And so you have to look at what makes you feel bad about exercising. What are you resisting? What keeps you on that couch? For some people, it's fear. For some people, it's sadness or grief. For some people, it's low self-esteem, but whatever it is, it's an emotional problem. Any fundamental problem around behavior, failure to take action, failure to achieve goals, these are failures of emotion. This is bad news for most of us because emotional problems are really fucking hard to deal with. Like I wish it was as simple as just reading a book and then I would stop drinking old fashions on a Thursday night. I wish it was as simple as creating a spreadsheet and tracking all of my writing time to like get me to actually sit down and fucking write every morning. Doesn't work. Like ultimately, the thing that prevents me from doing these things is what I call the feeling brain. So the basic metaphor in the chapter is that we have a thinking brain and a feeling brain and they're in a car together. And everybody assumes that the thinking brain is driving and the feeling brain is like this obnoxious kid in the passenger seat and you have to like continuously tell them to shut the fuck up. I'm driving here, stop distracting me. Adults are talking. And it's actually doesn't work out that way. And it's funny because there are versions of this metaphor throughout history, all the way from Plato, all the way up through Thomas Aquinas, through the enlightenment. Like this has always been the assumption of how the human brain works. It's so ubiquitous that in the book, I call it the classical assumption. But what psychologists have discovered in the last 30, 40 years is that it's actually reverse. The obnoxious brat is the one driving the consciousness car and the thinking brain is in the passenger seat with the map navigating. Sure, you can kind of tell your feeling brain where you wanna go, but it doesn't mean it's gonna go there. As your thinking brain, you need to develop a way of communicating with your emotions and creating incentives for your emotions to actually get things done. And so the chapter talks a little bit about that, kind of these emotional-based strategies. Out of all the chapters in the book, chapter two is probably the one that people find most practical and helpful. Honestly, I mean, there are probably four or five chapters in this book that could have been books themselves, and chapter two is one of them. I mean, chapter two has been, there's a famous book called ''Thinking Fast and Slow'' by Daniel Kahneman. It's basically chapter two. It's a lot of dense theory and advice to take in, but I think it's an incredibly powerful concept, this idea that any problem of action is fundamentally a problem of emotion, and your ability to act towards your goals, to pursue your goals, is always gonna be proportional to your ability to manage your own emotions. For me, that's been absolutely profound to understand, and I think it's profound for a lot of other people as well. And just to remind you, the reason I wrote this chapter is because we need to feel as though we're in control of our lives to have hope. And so if you feel like you can't control your life, if you're stuck on the couch, you don't know how to get up, you're like scrolling on Instagram 24-7, these are emotional problems. There's no formula for you. You have to like deal with your shit. And speaking of dealing with your shit, that brings us to chapter three, Newton's three laws of emotion. It's kind of a play on Newton's three laws of motion, obviously. So Newton's three laws of emotion are, law number one is for every action, there's an equal and opposite emotional reaction. Law number two is our self-worth equals the sum of our emotions over time. And law number three is your identity will stay your identity until a new experience acts against it. And then I round up the chapter with something I call emotional gravity, which is kind of this idea that the mass of our emotion or like the accumulation of our emotion within ourselves will attract people with similar emotions and identities to ourselves in proportion to the amount that we've accumulated. So if you've accumulated a lot of trauma throughout your life, you will attract people who have also accumulated a lot of trauma into their lives. If you've accumulated a lot of gratitude and joy, you will attract people who have accumulated a lot of gratitude and joy into your life. I actually came up with these when I was writing Subtle Art and I absolutely love them. The way I originally wrote it, it was like a two or three page section. It was very cute and pithy, but it took a lot of thought for people to understand it. And so I was like, okay, if you're gonna do this Newton's law thing, you need to go all out. And at the time I just wasn't ready for that. You know, I wrote Subtle Art in 2015. I wasn't as good of a writer back then, didn't have as much confidence and it just didn't fit the book as well. It was kind of this big detour. So I just set it aside. And then when I was writing Everything is Fucked, you know, I came back to this thing and I was like, you know, not only do I write Newton's Three Laws of Emotion, but why don't I kind of like create a historical fiction about Newton's life to exemplify these three laws of emotion? You know, because Newton lived like a fucked up traumatic childhood, you know, he was bullied and he was abandoned by his family and he was just this cranky loner who happened to be a genius. And so I really got into it. I probably spent more time writing this chapter than any other chapter. Really what the Three Laws of Emotion describe is how our values form. We have certain experiences throughout our lives, especially our early lives, that were either rewarded emotionally or punished emotionally. And then we develop associations with those experiences. The significance of those associations is proportional to the intensity of the emotion. So if I experienced a horrible, horrible trauma on like a fishing trip with my dad, like I'm gonna have like irrationally negative responses to the idea of fishing. If I have an incredibly positive experience in my adolescence on a trip to Mexico, you know, I'm always gonna have this really positive association with Mexico and trips and things like that. These are the building blocks of our identity. Like when you take these associations and you start stacking them up on top of each other, like both positive and negative, like this is what creates Mark Manson. This is what creates whoever you are. And then when we bump into other people in the world, we either resonate with other people's emotional associations or we don't. You know, our emotional associations either clash or they attract each other. And that very much kind of determines the quality of our relationships or why, you know, people with similar values and similar identities are drawn to each other and people with opposite values and identities are very much pushed away from each other. The third law is incredibly important as well. It's something that I talk about in subtle art, which is that your identity will continue to remain your identity until a new experience acts against it. This is one of the most common questions people had after subtle art, which is how do I change my values? You know, people would say like, I know I have a really fucked up association with money, you know, and I've read your book and I understand like why it's unhealthy, but you know, I just can't stop. And that's the thing is like knowing is not enough. Your thinking brain is not driving your car. You have to live out new values to adopt new values. Let's say I have this like wonderful association with Mexico and I love Mexico and I go all the time. And then one day I get robbed at gunpoint. Suddenly a new experience has acted against my emotional association and it fundamentally changes my values. This happens to us all the time. In fact, a lot of what we consider the most significant moments of our lives are generally when a contrary experience occurs and completely shifts our value system, literally changing who we are. So you cannot change your values until you live differently. It's about behavior. You cannot get the feeling brain to drive to a different place until you live differently, until you actually go experience what it's like to not hold money as one of your highest values. So that's chapter three. It melds together with chapter two in kind of a tangential way. It's very powerful to understand how these concepts interrelate. And so that brings us to chapter four. You know, the emotional gravity is what determines how human groups come together under shared identities and shared value systems. And it's once we come together under shared value systems, that is the third key to building hope in our lives, which is feeling as though we have a community, feeling as though we're part of a tribe of people who believe similarly to us. Now, chapter four is where I lost a lot of people. You were the chosen one. So it's funny. Readers have asked me for years and years and years and years to write what I think about religion. And, you know, it's one of those, like, be careful what you ask for type things. Chapter four is, in many ways, it's my favorite chapter, but when I wrote it, I understood that a lot of people were gonna hate it. I showed the draft of this book to maybe eight or 10 of my friends, and about half of them absolutely hated the chapter, and then about half of them loved it. And I loved it, so I kept it in. But I understand that it's a little much for people. But basically, you know, chapter four is kind of a facetious step-by-step guide to building your own cult. And it's kind of playing or fucking with the self-help industry. I kind of came to a profound realization a number of years ago that in many ways, marketing and building a brand, you're building a religion. Like, you're essentially convincing people to believe and have faith in the value of something, even though they have no way of knowing whether it's actually valuable. You're convincing people to buy Coca-Cola products or support a certain sports team or be proud of their country, when there's really, like, no objective reason to feel any sort of emotional attachment to these things. It's fascinating to me that, essentially, where very, very good marketing and sales practices are exactly the same practices that build religions and build cults. You know, there's a reason that people describe things like CrossFit as a cult or Flat Earthers as a cult, or even certain political beliefs or political parties are often described as cults. There's this, like, religious fervor that emerges when you get a group of people and you're able to build their mutual valuation of certain things or certain ideas and concepts. So I kind of wanted to, like, create, like, a step-by-step process of, like, how you actually do that with people. Like, how do you actually get people to value something so much that it's the core of their identity and that their need to belong to a group who shares their belief is so strong and so powerful that, like, it can lead to, like, some really dark and fucked up places. I wanted to kind of create that step-by-step, but I wanted to do it in a way that kind of poked fun at a lot of the self-help seminars and infomercials and the direct marketing. You know, it's like, oh, I make $300 in my underwear working for Google. Like, you know, those ads that we used to see, because it's all the same stuff. Unfortunately, like, I just think these tendencies are very much baked in to the human psychology. It's why I use the word religion very, very loosely in the book. You know, what we traditionally think of as religions I describe as supernatural religion. So beliefs and things that are not provable or verifiable in the physical universe. So believing in God or Jesus or, you know, whatever. But then you also have ideological religions. Veganism is in many ways an ideological religion or libertarianism or Marxism. Like, these are all belief systems that people take on on faith based on their value system and then organize their life and their communities around it. You know, it's a very nihilistic perspective on human belief systems, but I also just think that that's an objective perspective on human belief systems. It's a very deep and uncomfortable chapter. And I also found it interesting, like, the coffee cup thing in chapter one, that is a deeply nihilist statement and people loved it. That thing has gotten shared on social media like so many fucking times. Like, there was a coffee shop in the UK that actually printed that on their coffee cups. The thing was a huge hit. But the thing is, is if you believe that part of nihilism, like chapter four is just like the logical conclusion, which is that humans organize themselves in systems based around arbitrary beliefs of what's valuable and what's not. And part of that is conventional religion. Part of that is, you know, political ideology. Part of that is our fundamental relationships and familial systems and friendships and things like that. My belief that my best friend is valuable, it's an arbitrary thing. That's a purely emotionally based thing. There's no like objective truth that my friendship is valuable in the universe. So it's a very uncomfortable chapter. I think it lost a lot of people because it's a philosophical depth that a lot of people have maybe not gone to before or are not comfortable going to. And it's also kind of just, I'm not gonna lie. It was a little bit convoluted. It was a little bit much. I'll admit to that. It was a little bit much. But I also thought it was important because as I explained at the end of the chapter, every human belief system is fundamentally flawed. There is no correct answer because the human mind is flawed. Every human belief system is fundamentally flawed. Therefore, anything we base our hope on is gonna be flawed. And this comes back to that paradox of hope in chapter one, which is that the same way hope needs for things to be fucked to exist, like you need there to be problems in the world because those problems will give you hope of not having those problems. Anything that you hope for, anything that you believe in or pursue will also cause things to be fucked in some new way. There is no utopia. Any vision for the future that we believe is better is simply gonna create and propel further problems for humanity. And so it comes full circle. You need everything to be fucked for there to be hope and you need there to be hope because that's what makes everything fucked. And so that takes us into chapter five, which is really just an homage to Nietzsche. Nietzsche was the first philosopher I read when I was a teenager. I've always really loved him and identified with him. So that chapter is kind of an accurate reflection of the end of his life. And it's also everything he says in that chapter is something that he actually wrote in one of his books. And I just love the guy. He's just been very influential in my life and everything that I'm saying about hope and things being fucked and how every human belief system is fundamentally flawed. It's basically what Nietzsche said. It's all straight out of his philosophy. He was kind of like the first modern nihilist. People call him the first postmodernist, which is postmodernism is kind of like a, I don't know, it's like a hip nihilism, I guess. I think postmodernism is kind of the idea that the realization that everything's a little bit relative and that humans are just fundamentally limited in our understanding of what is good and bad and what is worth pursuing and not pursuing. And so chapter five is just a really nice summary and kind of paying my dues to him through sharing his story and some of his brilliant, brilliant lines. He was also a crazy fucker. So Nietzsche had a number of incredibly brilliant female friends who were some of the earliest feminists in the world. And the funny thing was, it was like, Nietzsche was so sexist. He had like all these brilliant women around who took care of him because he was super ill and had a bunch of health problems. So they'd come and take care of him and like talk to him and were like basically his intellectual companions. And then he just wrote horrible, horrible shit about women. So I guess it's kind of like a little piece of revenge. I decided to write the chapter from his friend Medavan Solis. I wrote it from her perspective. And so that chapter wraps up part one, which if you want to zoom out for a second, part one, it starts with the paradox of progress. It starts with the paradox of hope, which is that hope seems to need things to be fucked. Then when we actually break down the constituent parts of hope, the fact that self-control is a little bit of an illusion, we're emotionally based creatures, that values are very much proportional to the emotional valence of our experiences, and that we tend to organize ourselves into groups and communities based on our values, and that we are inevitably very tribal and destructive towards each other, which by chapter five, we discover that hope is also what makes us dangerous, what causes these problems, what causes things to be fucked. And so we get this full cycle going of, hope causes everything to be fucked, but everything being fucked gives us hope of healing and promoting a better future. And so despite being called hope, the first part of the book is deeply pessimistic, extremely dark. I've gotten a lot of emails from readers over the years that are like, dude, I'm on chapter five. This is making me depressed. Like, this is so dark. Should I keep going? I'm like, yes, please keep going. It gets better. That's kind of the point if you imagine."}
