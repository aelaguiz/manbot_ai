Our family was well off financially, but because I was having to work for my pocket money and pay any small loans back with interest, I had no idea how much money we had until I was a teenager.\n\nI didn\u2019t realize it at the time, but my dad was working hard to not raise me and my brother as spoiled fucking brats. I learned so much about the psychology of money early on and for that I\u2019m grateful.\n\nCheck out this episode from my new Subtle Art Podcast. Here I talk with financial expert Morgan Housel, and we go so much deeper into raising children around money. Plus tons more insightful shit.\n\nGet the full episode on my YouTube channel.\n\n#MarkManson #Money #GetRich #Psychology #MorganHousel #PsychologyofMoney #Mindset #Finance #SameAsEver", "published_at": "2023-12-07T00:45:00Z", "channel_id": "UC0TnW9acNxqeojxXDMbohcA", "channel_title": "Mark Manson", "tags": ["mark manson", "markmanson", "finance", "learning finance", "money lessons", "money", "wealth", "savings", "interest", "money for dummies"], "category_id": "27", "live_broadcast_content": "none", "duration": 59.0, "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false", "view_count": 221423, "like_count": 15920, "comment_count": 200, "channel_info": {"title": "Mark Manson", "description": "3x #1 NY Times Bestselling Author.

My dad was a hard ass. He started each of us, my brother and I, started each of us on an allowance when we were five. If we wanted anything that cost money, it went into a ledger. I remember being like six years old and being at a restaurant and wanting to play like an arcade game, like Pac-Man or something. And I asked my dad for a quarter and he was like, well, I can give you a loan on your next allowance. I was six. I hated him for this for so many years. All my friends, they got new bikes, they got Nintendos. I had to fucking rake the yard, do the dishes, clean my room and get paid week in, week out for it. I had to take loans from him. I remember taking a loan to buy a Lego set when I was about eight and I spent about a month paying it off. He called it the Bank of Dad and he would calculate interest and we had ledgers and we had a notebook in the kitchen and everything. I thought he was a fucking psychopath. And then I got to college and all my friends were broke and I had like a thousand dollars in the bank. I was like, wow. I think it was around 25 that I finally went back to him. And I was like, thank you for doing."}
