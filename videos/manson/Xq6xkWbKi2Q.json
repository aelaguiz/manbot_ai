Look, we all have to deal with pain, hardship, loss, and just, you know, day-to-day bullshit throughout our lives. And while our first impulse is to avoid all the bullshit, to get away from our problems, the fact of the matter is, there is no such thing as a life without problems. There is no such thing as just being happy and go lucky and everything working out for the best all the fucking time. If you're gonna make it through this life, you have to deal with problems. In fact, I would say life itself is a process of dealing with problems or upgrading our problems from really bad problems to slightly better problems. Therefore, you could say that the quality of our lives very much hinges on our ability to manage problems. This course is all about teaching you strategies, techniques, ideas, concepts that will help you deal with various amounts of pain in your life, how to get through problems, how to deal with grief and loss, basically, how to be a more resilient person. Now, I would like to start the course off by teaching you two different metaphors that I think are gonna be useful and that we're gonna return to again and again throughout the course. The first metaphor comes from Buddhism and I talk about it in my book, ''Everything is Fucked,'' a book about hope. Now, the Buddha had this beautiful metaphor about pain. He said that pain is like being struck by an arrow. It actually strikes you twice. The first strike is the actual physical strike, the pain of the arrow piercing your skin and causing you to bleed and everything. But the second pain is the meaning that we create around the arrow strike. It's the person who got hit by the arrow saying, ''Why me? Why did I deserve this? I'm a good person. That guy's an asshole. Fuck him. I shouldn't have to be dealing with this.'' It's the psychological pain that comes along with being struck by the physical pain. Now, throughout the course, I'd like to refer to these types of pain as type one pain, the physical pain, and type two pain, the psychological pain. For example, let's say a family member gets cancer and passes away. Obviously, the loss of that family member, it's just fundamentally painful. That is a type one type of pain. If your mother dies of cancer, that is excruciatingly painful, no matter who you are or what you do, type one pain. But what tends to happen with most of us is we sit there and say, ''Oh my God, what could I have done differently? Why does she deserve this? I could have been a better son. I could have done this. This isn't fair. The doctors are terrible. I bet they fuck something up.'' That's the type two pain. It's the narratives and the meaning that we construct around that initial inherently painful event. Now, what's interesting about human psychology is that the more intense the type one pain, the more crazy our mind goes with narratives creating type two pains. It's very proportional. If you stub your toe against a table, you don't sit there and be like, ''Oh, why me? Why do I stub my toe? What did I do to deserve this God?'' You don't do that. You're just like, ''Fuck you table.'' And you like move on with your life. But if like an earthquake happens and you lose your home and thousands of your neighbors die and your dog gets lost, then you start coming up with all these different narratives of meaning, of where you are in the world and what is the cosmic significance and ''Fuck, my dog didn't deserve this. He deserved better. Come back Fido. I miss you.'' It's this constant running of the brain that often causes us to suffer more. And this was ultimately the Buddha's point. Often long after the physical pain of the arrow has passed, we still suffer from the type two pain. We hold on to the type two pain for years and years and years. We create these narratives of injustice and suffering and victimhood and all these horrible things that often come to define ourselves or define our identity for a long time. So this course is gonna deal with both types of pain. We're gonna be talking about how you can better bear type one pain, but this is not gonna surprise you. Most of the course is gonna be dedicated to type two pain because ultimately that is the more significant amount of pain that we feel in our lives. And it's also the thing that we have more control of. You can never prevent yourself from ever stubbing your toe again, but you can sure as shit prevent yourself from creating stupid narratives that make you suffer more. Now, the second metaphor I wanna use throughout this course just to help us kind of understand the nature of pain in our lives. I'm gonna use the metaphor of a muscle, which is essentially that a certain amount of pain is actually good for us. The same way, if you never exercise your muscles, if you never stress your muscles, if you never get out and run or pick up something heavy, your body deteriorates and it begins to fall apart. But at the same time, if you go try to pick up 500 pounds on your first day in the gym, you're gonna completely destroy yourself. There's kind of like a Goldilocks zone of pain that is actually healthy for us. If we're just a couch potato and everything's always comfortable, we actually deteriorate. We become lazy and compulsive and demanding and delusional and all these horrible things. It's a certain amount of stress in our lives actually keeps us grounded in reality and improves mental health outcomes. But if you kind of go along that curve of pain, there eventually comes a tipping point where adding more pain or stress starts to harm our health and it harms our ability to function well, both physically and mentally. And so ultimately our goal here in our life is not to get rid of pain, it's simply to maintain a manageable level of stress and pain in our lives. We wanna be challenged regularly. We wanna have invigorating problems that we're working on. It's that sense of sacrifice or that sense of overcoming that grants us a sense of meaning and purpose in our lives. If you have nothing to overcome, if you have no challenges, if you have nothing pushing up against you, your mind starts freaking out and looking for tiny little things to become neurotic and compulsive about. Now, if you go overboard and you go too far, your body starts to break down. Again, it's like if you go into the gym and you're picking up moderate amount of weights and gradually pushing yourself each time you go, you're gonna get stronger, you're gonna get healthier, you're gonna be able to do more and more each time you go. But if you go into the gym and you try to like squat 500 pounds, you're gonna break your back. And that breaking of your back is essentially what trauma is. There's a certain breaking point with pain and stress where your mind just kind of gives out and like loses it and it's like checks out and is like, fuck this shit, I'm going off the reservation. To extend the metaphor even further, let's say you go to the gym and you have a good workout and you feel sore the next day. Well, there are ways to treat that soreness. You get a little bit of extra rest, maybe you put an ice pack on, do a sauna, drink a protein shake, like these things will all help your body recover, but a protein shake and a sauna is not gonna help a broken back. A broken back needs a whole nother level of treatment and therapy. You need to go to the hospital basically and spend months and months and months going through intense recuperation and physical therapy. And so the same is true with trauma, right? If I'm just having a very stressful year in my career, that's like hitting the gym like five times a week and being sore and exhausted all the time. Like you can handle it, you can recover from it. At some point, you're gonna need to rest a lot to recover from that amount of stress and strain, but you're gonna be okay. And actually you're gonna come out the other side much, much stronger for it. But let's say you get in a car accident, you're in like a van with a bunch of like five of your coworkers and you were driving and it kills everybody but you, yeah, you're gonna need a long time to get over that. Like that's a whole nother process. And so I wanna bring this metaphor up for a couple of reasons. The first one is, is that this course is less about handling trauma. Trauma is a whole topic onto itself and there are many aspects of it that honestly, me or pretty much anybody else on the internet that you would buy a course from is not really qualified to deal with. Like if you're experiencing trauma or symptoms of PTSD, yes, a lot of these concepts can help and they can be useful as tools, but you need to be working with a professional one-on-one in person regularly. The other reason I bring this up though, I'm gonna mix my metaphors here a little bit. Most pain we experience is psychological. And so a lot of what determines whether we're trying to squat 500 pounds or not is also mental. It's the type two pain. We've started to see this a lot more often lately where if you define for yourself something as traumatic, like if you decide that Amazon losing your iPhone delivery is a traumatic experience, your brain will actually believe that. Your brain will actually be like, yeah, that's trauma. Let's have a traumatic reaction to that. And so you need to be very careful in terms of the definitions of pain and the significance that you subscribe to in terms of the different pain that you're experiencing because an event in your life can happen that is, in reality, it's like a 30 pound dumbbell, but in your mind, it's a 500 pound squat. You're gonna fucking break your back. Still, it's important to be careful with the narratives that you construct around your experiences, the significance you ascribe to different events that happen. Ultimately, a lot of this stuff is very personal too. Something that could feel like a 30 pound dumbbell to me could feel like a 500 pound squat to you and vice versa. Just to use an example from my own life, as I wrote in Subtle Art, my first girlfriend cheated on me and left me. And obviously that's a horrible experience. It fucking sucks. But millions and millions and millions of people have had that experience. That is not a particularly unusual experience in the human condition. But because I had come from a background of such an emotionally dysfunctional family and I'd come from an environment where I'd largely been deprived of intimacy and trust throughout most of my young life, I was particularly sensitive to that event. So it might not have broken most people's backs, certainly it would hurt, but it really fucked mine up pretty good. And it took me years and years to kind of work through that and overcome that. Obviously different pain throughout our lives, it can compound on one another. Like you can, to keep this fucking gym metaphor going even further, you can hurt your back squatting too much weight when you're like nine years old, because let's say your dad did something really fucked up. And then when you're 25, a very similar thing happens and it breaks your back and you have a traumatic response to it. There's a lot of complexity involved with what is actually experienced as just kind of run-of-the-mill pain or loss or grief and what is actually experienced as trauma. But the point of all this is this course is focused on type two pain because that's the type of pain that we have the most control over. Although we will talk about sustaining type one pain as well. And this course is very much focused on that process of lifting weights to get stronger mentally, dealing with regular life challenges that should improve our resilience, improve our sense of self, improve our ability to manage ourselves in the face of adversity. And we're gonna be focusing less on trauma. And again, a lot of the tools and concepts in this course can be helpful for people experiencing PTSD or traumatic reactions, but that is not what this course is designed for. So that's just a disclaimer. You might get something from it. A lot of people with PTSD and stuff, they read my work and they say it was very helpful, but it's not designed for that. So I just wanna make that clear and just get very, very particular about what we're gonna work on here. So I often joke that I'm an expert in dealing with like first world problems. If you have like a degenerative condition and you're never gonna walk again, I don't know how good I am for that. But like if your fucking boyfriend left you and you dropped out of school and don't know what to do with your life, like I'm your guy. Those life challenges that we all have to deal with from time to time, or even just kind of the day-to-day stresses of being overworked or having a shitty boss or being stuck in a toxic relationship or having a parent that treats you like shit. Like these are the things that we're here for and the tools and techniques in this course are designed to help. So with that, let's start off with our first exercise. There's a workbook available to download. You can print it out if you like. You can also just create a Word document and write this stuff yourself. To start off, I want you to write down a particular struggle or problem or source of pain in your life at the moment you feel like you need a little bit of help dealing with. This course is gonna work a lot better if you come into it with a specific problem in mind that you would like to improve upon. To begin with, simply write down that problem or that source of struggle that you're experiencing. And then after that, I want you to ask yourself two things. One, is this a type one type pain or type two type pain? Or chances are it's probably both, but write down what aspects of it are type one. I have a boss that is a total dick. Obviously that sucks. There's nothing you can do to control that. That's a type one type pain. But I've decided that this is a horrible workplace and I'm never gonna make it in this career and fuck, I'm gonna have to like lose my job or be miserable for the rest of my life. These are all type two types of pain. So write out like what aspects of the problem you're experiencing is a type one pain and then what aspects of the problem you're experiencing are type two. And then finally, just write down how manageable does this problem feel to you at the moment? Does it feel like a 20 pound dumbbell that is just gonna get you a nice little bicep pump to the gun show? Or does it feel like a 500 pound squat that's gonna break your back? Write that down now because hopefully over the course of this course, we're gonna revisit that assessment and hopefully by the end of it, it feels quite a bit lighter to you. So write those things down, take your time with it, be completely honest and open with yourself and I'll see you in the next lesson. \u266a Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah \u266a"}
