The idea is that seeking a positive experience can actually lead to a negative experience, while accepting a negative experience can bring a positive experience. Trying to be happy makes us less happy. Accepting unhappiness can actually make us happy. The more we try to make others love and accept us, the less they will. And more importantly, the less we will love and accept ourselves. But the more we try to feel confident, the more insecurities we will create. The more we accept our faults, the more comfortable we become in our own skin. The idea is to take the mind, this wonderful tool that we all have that has spent its entire life chasing goals and outcomes, and teach it to stop chasing goals and outcomes. And how do we do this? You do it by relinquishing control. By giving up. Not because you feel powerless, but because you are powerful. Because you decide to let go of things that are beyond your control."}
