Could you do it? Would you even know where to start? I created multiple social challenges to help people overcome anxiety. Then I had Melinda here attempt them all. And if she completes them, you'll get $10,000. Holy shit! The first task was simple. Talk to strangers, all of the strangers, with the goal being to find the one from Saskatoon, Canada. Are you from Saskatoon? Yes, I am. The next task was... Well... What? By having her give free hugs in a broccoli costume, she learned that nobody gives a fuck. Then we had her sit down with total strangers and talk about the most personal and difficult parts of her life. The history of drug addiction, homelessness. And the final challenge, to give an improvised speech in front of a room full of strangers. Everything that we have in life is a result of other people. And I'm just grateful that I know that now. Could you have done any of this?"}
