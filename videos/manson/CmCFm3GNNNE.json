These are false identities and we adopt them because we believe they will help us be accepted or appreciated by others. Well, fuck that. Life's too short to do things you hate just to win the approval of others.\n\nThe question is: how do we grow up out of this? How do we stop doing things we hate? Well, the first step is having the courage to accept that maybe you don't know who you really are. Maybe you don't know what you really want. Once you're able to live with that realization, then you are free to explore your life authentically.\n\nSo what person do you want to be? When are you going to stop doing the things you hate? \n\n\u2014\n\nSign up for my newsletter to receive three actionable pieces of advice each week that could change your life - free sign up here: http://bit.ly/3JRg3NX\n\nIf you are not already a member of my premium membership, get access to my courses and exclusive writing here: http://bit.ly/3LwHWfi\n\nI am Mark Manson, 3x #1 NY Times bestselling author of:\n\nThe Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck - https://mrk.mn/3svfxcu\nEverything Is F*cked: A Book About Hope - https://mrk.mn/2RNxVAD\n\nI share other types of content to make you a less awful human in these places:\n\nhttps://instagram.com/markmanson/\nhttps://twitter.com/IAmMarkManson\nhttps://facebook.com/Markmansonnet/\nhttps://linkedin.com/in/markmanson/\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@iammarkmanson\n\nThanks for watching.", "published_at": "2020-05-10T19:59:50Z", "channel_id": "UC0TnW9acNxqeojxXDMbohcA", "channel_title": "Mark Manson", "tags": ["How to Know If You're On The Right Path", "how to know if you're on the right path", "mark manson", "self knowledge", "self development", "self improvement", "self improvement tips", "life", "life choices", "life choices and decisions", "life advice", "audio articles", "blog", "emotions", "emotional intelligence", "self care", "routines", "habits", "identity", "life purpose", "life goals", "goals", "how to know if you're on teh right path", "How to Know If Youre On The Right Path", "How to know if youre on the right path"], "category_id": "22", "live_broadcast_content": "none", "duration": 323.0, "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false", "view_count": 143456, "like_count": 9543, "comment_count": 450, "channel_info": {"title": "Mark Manson", "description": "3x #1 NY Times Bestselling Author.

I went down to Costa Rica and like hired a teacher and all this stuff. It's probably like the most meditative physical activity I've ever done. And I think it's just because the whole sport is based on you reacting to the water, like you don't actually control what happens to you. You don't control whether you get good waves or not. All you can do is control how you react to the waves. It forces you into like a very kind of zen mindset. All I can do is show up today and do my best, and if that's good enough, that's great, and if it's not, then it's not. But I like the idea of being a surfer more than I like surfing itself. I think that happens to us a lot of times, it's like we want the identity of being something without actually having to do it. Because whenever you do something, there's like a bunch of bullshit involved. Like with surfing, you like crash and water goes up your nose and you fucking paddle forever and it's exhausting. It like looks cool, you watch like a movie and you see a bunch of surfers, it looks awesome. But when you're actually going out and doing it, it's really, really hard. You know, surfing was like kind of taught me that lesson of there's a difference between actually enjoying something and just enjoying the idea of something. Yeah, so like why do we do that? Like why do we want to adopt these identities? Like why do I want to be a surfer, but I don't actually want to have to surf? And I think sometimes when we want things, it's because we think that they're going to fix something in our lives. They're going to fulfill a need in some way. I look back and I think I had a lot of desire to be this like cool athletic dude. I don't know, that was like sexy and a beach bomb and all this stuff. And like, I thought that that was, there was kind of like a hole in me that I thought being a surfer would like fill that hole. But that's not the same thing as actually like enjoying doing something. And so I see a lot of people, you know, a lot of people, I get it with writing all the time. People come to me, they want to be a writer. They say, Mark, I want to write a book. How do I, how do I start? It's like the way you start writing is you fucking open up a Word document and you start writing. The only question is, is like what's preventing you? And I think in a lot of cases, people don't actually enjoy writing, but they like the idea of being a writer. They think it will make them look intelligent or smart or be admired. I think accepting that wanting the identity of something is not the same thing as the thing itself. It's a hard thing to admit. It was hard for me to admit that, like, I don't like surfing. I don't find it fun. And that sucks after you've spent a bunch of money in like a month of your life trying to be a surfer. And a lot of people torture themselves doing something they hate over and over and over again. And it's because they've adopted the identity of it. You know, it's like the lawyer that hates their job, but they get to be the rich, successful lawyer guy, you know. And so they don't, they're afraid to let it go. It's hard because when you let those things go, you go back to that place where you don't know who you are in this life. And that's fucking terrifying. It's really, really, really scary. And so there's a certain amount of courage that comes with it. And I think people mistake the courage for like the courage to live with less money or the courage to not be approved by your family or something like that. And like there is that courage. But like the real courage is that courage to be willing to not know who you are, to be willing to not know what the fuck you want to do. That takes a lot of courage. So I guess I would just ask people, like, what is it in your life that you're doing not because you love doing it, but you're doing it because you love the type of person it makes you or the type of person that you appear to others? Generally, it's those things. If you can spot those things in your life, those are the things that are causing the anxiety or the misery or the dysfunction. It just kind of has a ripple effect throughout other areas of your life. It creates unnecessary turbulence. It creates unnecessary fighting. You become defensive about this thing because it's like, no, fuck you. I am a surfer. I promise. There's some area of your life that you're not wholly aligned with. You're in it for the benefits, not for the thing itself. Life is all about doing something for the thing itself. I think it was Seneca who said that like, a rich man is not a man as everything. A rich man is somebody who wants nothing. And the more stuff that you want that you don't have, the less happy you're going to be. And the more you let go of those things you don't want, the happier you become. And so it actually, like, it was like lifting a burden of like, oh, I don't have to be like this badass surf dude. I don't have to be a beach bomb. I can be a nerd behind a computer. Like, it's not a big deal. There's a certain kind of liberation and comfort that comes with that, of letting go of those parts of yourself."}
