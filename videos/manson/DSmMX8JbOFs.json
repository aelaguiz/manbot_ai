There is absolutely nothing you can do to prevent these things.\n\nWe cannot control the pain in our lives. What we can control is the meaning we ascribe to our pain. And it\u2019s that meaning that determines whether our pain causes us to suffer or not.\n\nIf we decide that the pain of our break-up means we\u2019re losers and unworthy of love, then we will suffer. If we decide that our break-up means that our partner wasn\u2019t the right person for us, then we will be better off for our pain. If we decide that the pain of losing our job means we\u2019re doomed to be a broke failure, then we will suffer. If we decide that losing our job will be the catalyst that changed our attitude towards work and responsibility, then we will be better off for our pain. Whatever the case, we can choose to avoid our pain or choose to engage our pain. When we avoid our pain, we suffer. When we engage our pain, we grow.\n\nThis is all to say that pain is good for you and I\u2019ve made an awesome video to explain exactly why, So watch it. Like it. Subscribe to it.

I'm sure you haven't heard of him. Now Dabrowski, he was your run-of-the-mill psychologist back in the day. He worked with crazy people, studied in Vienna with people who worked with Freud, and he wrote long books about asinine subjects that nobody really understood back then. But what's interesting about Dabrowski is that during World War II, he took part in the Polish resistance. Yeah, that's right, he fucking fought Nazis. I mean, not literally like fought them, but you know, he was part of the resistance group that resisted Nazi occupation. And this landed him in a prisoner of war camp. Where rumor has it, he was tortured for many years, and many of his family members were killed. Now what's interesting about Dabrowski is that these experiences inspired him to study trauma and pain in a way that they had never been studied before. And his conclusions are what I want to talk about in this video today. What's up everybody, Mark here, and today I want to talk about a mental game that we're all very good at playing with ourselves. In fact, we're so good at this game that usually we don't even realize we're playing it. What's that game? Let's call it the, if I just do this, then I'll be happy That's right. We all do it. We all think to ourselves, man, if I could just finish school, things are going to be great. Man, if I could just get a raise at work, I'll be so happy. Man, if I could just get laid this weekend. No, that's, that's probably not going to happen. Like me, the game that I play is I say, man, if only I had more YouTube subscribers, I'd finally be happy. So fucking like and subscribe so I can finally be happy. We all create these goals and visions and achievements for ourselves that, you know, it gets us up in the morning. It gets us excited. We think to ourselves, man, if I could just have a jet ski, all my problems would go away. Meanwhile, not realizing that having a jet ski presents all sorts of problems. You got to find somewhere to store and haul your jet ski. You got to pay maintenance for your jet ski. You got to worry about your drunk sister writing off in your jet ski and never coming home is a constant of the human condition that we only seem to see the benefits of our goals without seeing the problems or the sacrifices of our goals. I mean, if I could just be a genie and snap my fingers and give you everything that you wanted, I mean, you'd probably be happy for like 12 hours. Maybe it wouldn't take very long before you started complaining that your golden throne wasn't high enough off the ground. And, you know, these sex slaves all smell like old fish. Don't ask. You know, and it's God damn it. I asked for champagne waterfalls. How much do I have to give you people to get me a fucking champagne waterfall? Jesus Christ. Before you know it, you would be complaining about everything. And sadly, this just seems to be the constant of human nature. We are perpetually dissatisfied with what we have, and we are constantly idealizing what we don't have. Call it grass is always greener syndrome. I prefer to think of it as we're always fucked syndrome. Why does our mind function this way? Well, it's actually pretty simple if you think about it. I mean, go back a couple hundred thousand years and imagine you've got two types of monkeys. You got one monkey who is perpetually paranoid, doesn't trust people, is always dissatisfied with the bananas that he has, and is constantly looking for something better. Now, the second monkey, he's pretty chill. You know, he's just like hanging out on the branches, eating his bananas, looking around, being like, man, life's good. He's grateful. He's sincere. He trusts everybody. He's just satisfied with life. Now, that second monkey is going to get killed really quickly because he's too complacent. You know, he's just, he's not going to notice the tiger in the bush waiting to eat him. He's going to be like, oh, it's fine. You know, it's just the wind rustling the leaves. It's the paranoid monkey who is constantly dissatisfied who is going to survive. Not only is he going to survive, but he's going to thrive. He's going to invent tools. He's going to come up with better ways to get food. He's going to fucking beat up the monkeys around him and make them do what he wants them to do. I mean, this is why human nature kind of sucks is because suckiness is good for survival and being happy isn't. We are perpetually dissatisfied because we are evolved to be perpetually dissatisfied. It is the dissatisfied monkey that gets shit done. Now this idea of perpetual dissatisfaction, this is, this is nothing new, right? So like the, the Buddha basically discovered this about 2,500 years ago. The Buddha was a fucking Prince. I mean, he had like gold and silver and elephants and like a harem of women and his father owned an entire kingdom and uh, he was not happy. And so he went and sat under a tree and he decided, I'm not going to get up until I figure what the fuck is wrong with me. And he sat there for weeks and weeks and weeks, and then he became enlightened. And basically what enlightenment was, was him realizing that, oh shit, my mind is playing this game. My mind is always dissatisfied with the present. No matter what I do, no matter how long I stare at this fucking tree, my mind doesn't stop playing this game. And so when the Buddha got up and started talking to people, he started explaining the game to people. He's like, hey, your mind is constantly attaching itself to things. And because of that attachment, you're always going to be dissatisfied. He called this samsara. And the whole philosophy that he built around this idea was designed to help people overcome it. Now he came up with a pretty cool analogy, if I do say so myself, and I'm about to steal it. So thanks Buddha. So the Buddha talked about, he said, when we get struck by an arrow, we actually get struck twice. There are two forms of pain that happened to us. The first one is the actual physical pain, the arrow hitting our body, piercing the skin. That's a physical pain. But he said the second pain is the mental pain. It's our decision that this should not have happened to me. Why did I deserve this? Will I ever get better? Why does that person who shot an arrow at me hate me so much? What did I do to them? It's the constant meaning that we construct around the arrow that actually causes us to suffer. And the Buddha made the point that the physical pain dissipates, it goes away on its own. But the mental pain, if we let it, it will stay with us forever. And so a lot of what the Buddha taught was teaching people how to let go of that second pain of letting go of that mental pain. This is originally what meditation was designed to do. You know, back before yoga pants and, you know, cute soundtracks that helped you fall asleep. Meditation was designed to train your brain to not play that game, to not be constantly dissatisfied with whatever pain or struggle you have in your life. And it turns out that this is a super practical piece of advice. It's still very applicable today. Let's say your partner breaks up with you. That hurts, but you can decide what that hurt means to you. Similarly, I mean, if you have chronic health problems or you get hit by a car or something, I mean, you can sit there and be like, why me? Why did I deserve this? This is unfair. Life fucking sucks. Or you can decide, hey, this is an opportunity to become more resilient, to become more disciplined, to take care of my body, to be more aware of what's going on in my life. We're making this choice in every moment. We just don't realize it. Again, we're playing the dissatisfaction game. Instead of recognizing that choice that we're making, instead most of us think, well, shit, if I just had a jet ski, this would all be better. So this brings me to the harsh truth of the day. The harsh truth of the day is that sometimes you need to suffer a certain amount to change and grow. And in fact, this is what Dabrowski concluded. After suffering all those years in Nazi prison camps and then later in communist prison camps and spending his life studying World War II survivors and Holocaust survivors, he came to a very profound conclusion. He realized that pain and suffering wasn't always damaging the people. In fact, he found that most survivors of the war years later would look back and credit the horrifying things that happened to them as part of what made them better people later. Dabrowski came up with a theory called positive disintegration, which basically he saw human character as a kind of a chrysalis that in order for a beautiful fucking butterfly to come out, you needed a certain amount of pressure and strain and pain on the person to free them to become who they really were. So whereas most Western developmental models looked at growth and potential as something as removing pain from one's life, Dabrowski went completely the other route. He said you need a certain amount of pain and suffering in your life to bring the best out of you. Now, the interesting thing about Dabrowski is that he was stuck in Poland. It was the Cold War. He was behind the Iron Curtain, and academics in the East and academics in the West weren't communicating with each other. So over the next few decades, Western psychologists were focused on self-esteem and giving kids gold stars and, you know, making everybody happy forever and ever and ever. Meanwhile, Dabrowski was like, hey, we need to be realistic about pain here. Pain can be very helpful. Trauma can actually cause some benefits if you leverage it correctly. You know, these were all revolutionary ideas that were hidden behind the Iron Curtain. And it wasn't until the 1980s, after Dabrowski's death, that his work started seeping into the wider world. And today, much of what Dabrowski pioneered is generally known as post-traumatic growth, a new area of psychology that looks at our pain as a source of greater character and better well-being. Now, most people haven't heard of Dabrowski. He's kind of an unknown figure. In fact, I think I'm the only one who just doesn't shut the fuck up about him. But if you want to learn more interesting tidbits from other obscure thinkers and ideas that can change your life, fucking like and subscribe so I can finally be happy. I mean, Jesus Christ, man.
