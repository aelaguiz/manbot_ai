Or are we actually chasing something much deeper? These are just a couple of the fun ideas that I toss around in this episode with Morgan Housel, the New York Times best-selling author of the smash hit, The Psychology of Money, which has sold more than 4 million copies worldwide. Morgan is a partner at the venture capital firm, The Collaborative Fund, and he sits on the board of the Markle Group. He's been a columnist for The Motley Fool, The Wall Street Journal, and in 2022, MarketWatch named him one of the 50 most influential people in the world of finance, which is way more impressive than anything I've done. But what I love most about Morgan's approach to money is that he digs deep to uncover the emotional and the irrational relationship that we all have between our wealth, our self-worth, and our happiness. So put away your spreadsheets, step away from the credit card, and for God's sake, stop trading crypto and settle in for this one. Who knows? We might just make you filthy fucking rich. Wait, are you allowed to say fuck in your podcast intro? Oh, fuck, I just did. This is The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck Podcast with your host, Mark Manson. Morgan, dude, it's so good to have you here. So good to finally see you. Thanks for having me. I'm really looking forward to this. We've been pen pals for many years. We're fans of each other's books, but we've never actually spoken face-to-face. So it's great to have you here. Great to have you as one of the inaugural guests on The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck Podcast. Excited to see your fucks not given. It's so mutual, Mark. I'm thrilled to be here. There's few people I'd rather talk about this topic than you. All right, so I figured I'd start with the easy questions. My first question is, why do humans attach so much moral value, both positive and negative, to wealth? This is starting with the easy question. This is like the deepest as it goes. I think it's very true that humans are wired for status and not for happiness, and wealth is just the most tangible form of status that exists. There's lots of forms of status. Another example here is, why do we put so much emphasis on a college degree, particularly in an era where the vast majority of undergraduate degrees, you can learn everything you can, even at a top school, on YouTube? I don't think there is virtually anything taught about economics or philosophy or psychology, even at Harvard, that you can't learn on YouTube. But we put so much value in the degree because it's a very tangible, easy-to-identify form of status. That's really what it is. So since we're all geared towards status, money is just the scorecard for so many people. And the problem here, the right word is definitely problem because it's the cause of so much anxiety in society, is that people measure their status and their net worth relative to people around them. There is no such thing as an objective measure of wealth where it's like, once you hit X dollars, you're wealthy. Everything is just relative to those around you. If you pull up to a traffic light in a Lamborghini, nobody cares because there's six other Lambos right there. And they cost more than yours. So it's all just a relative gain. And so in a world where, by and large, in most capitalistic societies, things get better over time. People get richer, get wealthier. It's this never-ending treadmill of things are actually getting better and no one feels any better for it because they're all chasing the status of money and the only scorecard is relative to other people who are also doing well around you. Right, things can objectively be getting better for you, but if they're not getting better at the same rate that they're getting better for the people around you, you still feel like you're losing. It's always been an issue of comparing yourself to others. Social media in just the last 10 years has increased it by, I think, literally an order of magnitude. Yeah, when I was coming up with this question, I was thinking of counterexamples, right? Because there are a lot of other things that denote status within society. Having a lot of friends, having a great marriage or family, or your kids are super successful at school, that denotes status. There are a lot of very intangible ways that we judge status of each other, but you don't see people making these vast moral judgments of like, oh, he thinks he's so good because he has so many friends. What a dick, right? But if somebody has a billion dollars, we feel completely justified in making statements like that. I mean, two of the traits that I most value out of my friends and family and coworkers are humor and wisdom. That's what I really like in people. But how do you measure that? You can't quantify it. And even when you said like number of friends, what counts as a friend? A casual acquaintance or your spouse? Whereas net worth is just so easy, you can measure it literally down to the cent and compare yourself against others. I think that's the only reason. Most people I think are closer to me where what they really value are things like humor and wisdom and love and compassion, but they don't actually chase those things because there's no hard number around it. It's funny, I was just about to make a joke when you said like, how do you measure a friend that I measure friends by Instagram followers? But then it made me think that actually, you're starting to see that. You're starting to see people shit on people with millions of Instagram followers for being shallow, for being vapid, for being a sellout. All the same criticisms that people have leveled at millionaires and billionaires for decades now. And it's so true on social media. I see this on Twitter all the time where someone will figure out how the Twitter algorithm works and they'll be like, oh, if I tweet a thread or if I tweet like this, I'm gonna get a zillion likes and a zillion retweets. And they use that quantification to be like, see, it's good, they like me, it's working. And for a lot of those people, it's like, no, you're just tweeting bullshit that's so cringeworthy, but it tickled the algorithm correctly so you got a bunch of distribution, you got a bunch of likes on it. I think there's analogy there with money too where it's like, if I have more money, I'm gonna be happier, my life's gonna be better. So people end up chasing that even if it's not what they actually want. What they want is a great spouse and great friends and control over their time, but it's so hard to get feedback on those things and measure the progress of those things that they just chase what's so easy to measure. I like this analogy a lot and I think we can even extend it a little bit further because fundamentally, that example that you just gave, somebody kind of figures out the Twitter algorithm, they start posting a certain type of content, they get, say, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of followers. On one level, you could say, that's great. This person has figured out how to give hundreds of thousands of people value that they value enough to give him a follow and continue to follow him and read future stuff. That's the system working as it's supposed to. I think where the moral judgment starts to creep in is when you get this idea of what some people call audience capture, which is, as the creator, you start putting your own interests and values aside and you're like, let me just reflect back to the public whatever they wanna hear and then I'll socially and monetarily benefit from that practice. And I think the same applies to money as well. Where we get really judgmental about money is when people do the business equivalent of audience capture of like, well, I'm just gonna put a bunch of random garbage and pills and market it on an infomercial because that's what people wanna hear and then that'll make me wealthy. Or I would say another example of that is people who got rich trading meme stocks. Okay, you made money, but there's nothing impressive about it. There's nothing noble about it. And to me, what a lot of this comes down to is I'm not interested in anything that's not sustainable. Not friendships, not investing strategies, not careers. If I can't do it indefinitely, I'm not interested in it. And I think that's like a very simple rule of thumb to guide your life. And a lot of people in audience capture on social media, cool, you got a lot of followers and you got a lot of likes, but you're now beholden to the algorithm that might change tomorrow. It's not a sustainable thing to do. Whereas I think if your audience really loves you and they like you and they're willing to buy your work and maybe you have half as many followers as the other guy, I'd much rather be in that situation than just pandering to something that's out of my control. The most successful stock of all time in the history of the US economy, and there's nothing even close, not Berkshire Hathaway, not Microsoft, not Tesla, it's Philip Morris. And what's so interesting about that, of course, it's addictive. So we could just end the story there. But the other thing about that is that they make the same product today that they did a hundred years ago. It's just a product that people like. Now, of course, they might like it for reasons that we're not thrilled about, but I think that's good products win in the longterm. Products that people like, and you don't need to change them. It's not a constant iterate on this cycle to figure out how are we going to advertise this. It's just build a product that people want to buy and just keep it going. And other examples, the most successful stock market industry and sector are consumer staples like toilet paper, soap, toothpaste. That's what works forever because people want toothpaste today as much as they did 50 years ago, which you can't say that about iPhones or AWS or anything like that. That might be gone tomorrow. It makes sense too, because it doesn't matter how bad the economy gets, I still got to wipe my ass and brush my teeth. It all just gets back to what's sustainable is what you should be chasing. That's such a broad-based rule of life. So does earning or losing great amounts of money, do you think this fundamentally changes a person or does it simply expose parts of them that was always there, but maybe wasn't seen before? It's different on either end. Earning a ton of money just always exposes what's there. Just recently, Elon Musk's biography by Walter Isaacson came out and Walter Isaacson was interviewing Elon Musk's first wife. I think her name is Justine Musk. And she was saying she met and started dating Elon when he was a nobody. They were still in college. He hadn't started any company. He was just a broke nobody from South Africa. And she went into detail about how much money and fame completely changed him and utterly changed who he was. And I think you've even seen that if you look at who Musk was 10 years ago when he was a mere single billionaire compared to the centi-billionaire he is now, very different person. Another thing that I think is really interesting is look at some of the interviews of Donald Trump from the early 80s, very calm, very measured, very balanced, very polite, very respectful. And you see, because he really wasn't that famous back then, if it's in the early 80s, and you see what fame and more money did to him. And there are a lot of people like that. Back to memes, there's a meme of Jeff Bezos in 1999. And he's like a skinny dork with a horseshoe. And then after he became the richest man in the world, he's jacked and he's got a half billion dollar yacht and whatnot. So I don't think any of us, not me, not you, anyone, if we stumbled across a billion dollars tomorrow, we would be different people. I think there are so few exceptions to that. There might be some, but there are so few to that. And I think it's because in a very good, healthy way, the fact that I rely on other people in society to help me and to maybe employ me to buy my books means that I'm gonna be measured in what I say. You know, of course this is true. When I'm alone at a bar with my friends, I say things that I would not say on this camera when I know a lot of people are gonna, of course that's the case. But once you have fuck you money, and not just fuck you money, but fuck you status, then I think it all just comes out. Now losing money in the other direction is a completely different thing. Here's a great example that you are gonna know because you may have actually written these words. In Will Smith's biography, he writes that becoming famous is amazing. Being famous is a mixed bag, and losing fame is like the most painful thing you can ever experience in life. You may have written those words, so I need to give you credit there too. And I think that's very true for money. Like becoming wealthy, gaining wealth is amazing. Having wealth is okay. And losing wealth is absolutely chaotic to your soul and your personality. It's just gonna rip you to shreds. Because it's just the dopamine that we're chasing. It's not even the money that we want. We just want the dopamine of like, oh, I used to have $100, now I have $200. It's just the increase that you want. And going in the other direction is just an absolute catastrophe for most people. This is why in investing, I think most people take too much risk because it's so easy to underestimate what a 50% decline in the stock market is gonna do to you. And it's not just to your portfolio, for a lot of people, it's gonna really shatter their identity and their personality and their confidence. You really see like a form of national depression when you have a big stock market decline. Like it was called the Great Depression for a reason. I think that was a very apt word to use. It was just like, it's shattering for people to go in the wrong direction. Do you think that's because the hedonic treadmill in our mind, no matter how much money we make, our default expectation rises to meet that amount? And at a certain point, even if you have $500 million, it feels as normal as when you had 50,000 or 5,000. And so losing all of that, in a way it feels even more catastrophic because not only are you losing all of your money, but you're also losing that status, that prestige, the reputation that you've built up over, like nobody who has $5,000 is like, their social identity isn't built around their $5,000. But if you have $5 billion, a huge percentage of your social identity is built around your $5 billion. So losing that is like, almost like a traumatic ego experience that happens. For sure. I mean, there's the joke from Chris Rock. He says, if Bill Gates woke up with Oprah's money, he'd jump out the window. And I think that's so true. Like even though, because Oprah's worth like 3 billion or something, Bill Gates is worth 100 billion. When Bear Stearns, the bank, went out of business in 2008, the chairman was a guy named Jimmy Cain. And Jimmy Cain, before the Bear Stearns went under, was worth a billion dollars. And afterwards, he was worth a hundred million. He lost 90% of his net worth. And he had a quote in the newspaper where he said, when you go from a billion to a hundred million, it's only your heirs who suffer. Like, it made no difference to his life. He kept his apartment. He kept his private jet, et cetera. It was just his heirs. And I remember reading that and thinking like, that is a very rare response. Maybe he didn't actually feel like that because there's almost no one that would actually believe that, to go from a billion to a hundred million and be like, ah, whatever, it doesn't matter. It's only my heirs. I think it had to be, and have been so tied up in his identity. Not only the net worth, but using the net worth as a scorecard for his career success, for his ability as a CEO and a manager that was now completely shattered. And sometimes I think about, I think the wealthiest I ever actually felt in my life is when I had $5,000 in the bank. And I remember hitting that milestone and just being like, this is unfathomable. Like $5,000 and happy to report, I have quite a bit more than that now, but I felt the wealthiest back then because it's just the gap between what you had and what you have now that brings happiness. And for me, going from $100 to 5,000 felt so much bigger than going from 1 million to 2 million or whatever it would be. Because just in percentage terms, it was so much different. So I think people are always just chasing the gap between what they used to have and what they have today. And when what you used to have is more than you have right now, I think it just shatters people. And there's also a thing in the stock market where all of your success as an investor in the stock market. is just not panic selling. Your whole lifetime success is just don't freak out and you'll be fine. And so, everything that I do for my own money is kind of geared around that because everybody including myself, if my net worth went down 50%, it might change how I think about my long-term optimism and my long-term faith in the US economy and whatnot. So, it's just like trying to avoid what a catastrophic loss does to your psyche in those situations. I started having enough money to invest 2012, 2013. There was a pretty sizable dip in 2016. I remember I shat my pants. I was like, oh my God, the bear market's coming, panic sell, freaking out. Obviously, that was stupid. There was another big dip in 2018. There was 2020. I've lived through a couple of crypto markets. I remember in 2020, I kind of hit this point where I remember just watching those red candles and I was like, I'm young, I'll be fine. But I feel like I needed to go through those early panics earlier in my investment career to understand that they're like, yeah, don't be an idiot here. Just you're young, stick with it. How much of it is just simply getting used to the pain? I think it's a lot of it and not only just living through it, but understanding the long-term history of the stock market where if you look over the last 100 years, on average, the stock market falls at 10% or more every 10 or 11 months for the last 100 years. So when the stock market falls 10%, the headlines on CNBC and the Wall Street Journal will be like dark clouds are here, catastrophe on the horizon. That is something that happens every 10 or 11 months for the last century. And even like a 30% decline is something that historically happens every three or four years. And so even something where it's like, it feels really, really bad. If you look historically, it's perfectly normal. And to understand that and contextualize that is probably the most important investing skill to deal with it. And you're definitely right that the more you deal with it, the easier it becomes. Although I would say every big decline is for a different reason. So in 2008, it's easy in hindsight for us to say now, oh, you should have just kept the course and it was a great buying opportunity. And that is the right takeaway. But there are so many alternative histories in which 2008 could have turned into something way worse than the Great Depression. So there's a lot of hindsight bias and looking back and seeing what you should have done. But it's definitely true that the more you've been through it, the more rodeos you've been through, the easier it becomes to hold on. But it's also true that people overestimate their ability to hold on. And when times are good, as they pretty much are now, it's very easy for people to say, oh, if the market fell 30%, I would be a buyer. That'd be an odd buy, a buying opportunity. You're not. Turns out you're not Warren Buffett and you're shitting your pants too just like everybody else during that moment. Yeah. As Mike Tyson famously said, everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face. That's the one. This ties into your upcoming book a little bit, but I'm curious what you think. Do you think social media has affected our understanding of investing or money given the rise of meme stocks, crypto, the intense pessimism, constant pessimism that seems to always be present in the financial news media? I'm curious if this feels different at all or as your book title says, is it same as ever? I think what's really true is that for most information, not just in investing, but political news, whatever it is, people don't want information. They want their views validated by somebody else, their preexisting views validated. And what social media does is no matter what you believe, you can believe anything about the economy or the stock market. There are a thousand other people who believe the same thing, gladly welcome you into their tribe. And it's such a difference from 20 or 30 years ago. And now you look at it today and it's infinite. And so virtually 30 years ago, not that long ago, like when my parents were our age, virtually everyone was getting the same investing information and listening to the same opinions. And now it's just choose your own adventure for whatever you want to hear. And I do this as well. Like I curate my Twitter followers and I bet you, I don't do this intentionally, but I bet you if you went through, I follow people who say what I want to hear. And I think virtually everyone does that because you don't want new information. You want to reduce uncertainty because reducing uncertainty feels great. It just turns a confirmation bias into something that is orders of magnitude greater than it was even 10 years ago. The meme stock bubble, which really began and thrived on Reddit, that's something where you like historical information about shorting stocks in the 1940s, like it does not matter at all anymore. We're in a completely different world where it is now. And I think a lot of hedge funds really got fucked because of that, because they had based their entire career on studying historical evidence that just in a matter of 10 years became completely invalidated because of social media. It just seems like the velocity is amped up, right? Like you used to get bubbles, you used to get groupthink, you used to get, you know, people would all hop on a bandwagon together and then get screwed down the road. It just seems to happen so fast now, given all the access that we have to each other. I think that's really true. Like the Great Depression started in 1929 and didn't really bottom until 1933. It was a four-year process. And even in 1999, the stock market peaked in March of 2000 and it bottomed in, I think, the summer of 2002. That took quite a while. That took two years to wash everything out. Whereas I definitely think we saw this during COVID. We went from everything's great to the world is coming to an end in like three days. It did happen pretty quickly. And because of that, like in COVID, from the time that people first heard the word COVID to the time when it was actually like the economy was starting to perk up and the stock market was perking up was less than 90 days. Like compare that like four years in the Great Depression to 90 days during COVID. And a lot of that is so much, not just some, but the majority of trading on the stock market is our bots and algorithms that are scraping the news feeds in milliseconds. And before you and I can read the first letter of a press release, there are 10,000 computers that have already traded on that news. There are stories of Warren Buffett back in the 1950s and 1960s where he was buying stocks at two times earnings, which if you're not familiar, it's just like as cheap as it possibly gets. And he was like digging through the library archives to like dig out these old dusty papers to find it. And that's how he could find those opportunities. Now when everything literally happens in, it's measured in millionths of a second, there's even some traders that trade in Pico seconds, which is a billionth of a second. And compare that to what happened in the 1950s when you're digging out dusty papers from the library, it's totally different world. Do you think there's any point in trading at all? For individuals, absolutely not. Zero. It gets back to like, is it possible that you could trade successfully for six months or 12 months or even three years? Unlikely but possible, yes. Is it possible that you as an individual can day trade successfully for 30 years? It's not a hundred percent, but it's so close to a hundred percent that you might as well give universal and just make it universal and say, no, no, you can't. And here's the thing. I think there are individual traders that would say, no, I've outperformed the S&P 500 by one percentage point, whatever it would be. And my response to that is like, A, awesome, congratulations, but you also need to subtract all the effort that you put into it. So if you are working 80 hours a week to formulate your trading strategy, that's the cost that you need to subtract in it versus in an index fund, if you can literally just do nothing and go to the beach and sleep in and hang out with your family and have no input in it and still earn a really great return, then I think even like the after-tax, after-effort profits that you're going to earn trading are round to zero, even for the successful traders. Yeah, that makes sense. It sounds like it's akin to deciding you're going to start a career as a blackjack player. You might do well for a month or a year, but in the long run, the house always wins, right? And what's so hard about trading too is that the barriers to entry are so low that everyone thinks they can do it. Like if I said, I want to be a heart surgeon, you're like, all right, that's going to take me 20 years of education to get there. But if I say, I want to be a day trader, great, open a Robinhood account in 60 seconds and have at it. There's no barrier to entry. And because of that, every young man thinks they can be the next George Soros and just open up an account and just start going at it. It's also one of the few skills where like you actually have a pretty good chance of succeeding based on luck. So if I were to perform open heart surgery on someone tomorrow, there is a 0% chance it would be successful. There's a 100% chance that person would die. If you are 19 years old and you open up a brokerage account, you might by luck do very well early on. So because the possibility of luck exists, it just like entices so many people. The worst thing that can happen to you as a young investor is to do well early on by luck because it increases your confidence more than your ability. And you're just going to keep on taking bigger risks until it blows up in your face. I think the best thing that happened to me as an investor, I started investing when I was 19 and I started like everyone does as a day trader. That seemed like the cool thing to do. And what the best thing that happened to me is I lost a lot of money. And then I was like, I was like, okay, I'm going to pick stocks and hold them for like a month, which seemed like a long time for me. And I lost a lot of money doing that. And that was so great for me because by the time I was probably 25, it had pushed me towards what I now think is a very sustainable and proper long-term investing strategy of just buying and hold a diversified portfolio. But if I had done well day trading based off of luck, I may have kept trying to do it for 10 years and been in a way worse position than I am right now. So you wrote Psychology of Money. It came out 2020. I imagine you probably wrote it 2018, 2019. I imagine you had a stable, well-to-do career. You were doing fine before the book. Obviously, since the book, you've sold millions of copies. You're probably doing the speaking circuit. You've probably gotten very good book deals for future books. I imagine you have gone from respectable middle class to scummy rich bastard. So I'm curious, now that you've made the leap yourself, by the way, welcome to the 0.1%. We've got caviar, champagne, some jet skis if you want them. But I'm curious, now that you've made that leap, has there been anything that surprised you, first of all? And second of all, is there any of your own advice that you have struggled to take? Both really good questions. I don't know. Here's what I would say because the book's success was a complete and utter surprise to my wife and I, never planned for it. And we were very happy and satisfied with our income and our net worth before the book. So all of this in the last three years has been like total out of the blue. And I think we're still to this day trying to process it and what to do with it. First thing I would say is, without giving any numbers, we haven't spent really any of the book money. We live in the same house. We drive the same car. And that's very intentional because the biggest challenge is how do we raise kids? Our kids are four and seven. How do we raise kids who are not spoiled and who will grow up to have their own ambition and realize that they need to work hard and build their own path? That's been the hardest thing to deal with. And that's the reason we live in the same house and drive the same car. If we didn't have kids, that would probably not be the case. But you realize how quickly kids can become spoiled and how ruinous that can be to their long-term success. And I think the goal of every parent, certainly us, is not to raise good kids. It's to raise good adults. I want my kids to be good, functioning adults. And the only way to do that is if they really value a dollar. And they're not going to do that if we just spoil the hell out of them. So, that's been the hardest thing to deal with. And the biggest barrier to our spending is not wanting to raise little pricks. That's really been the hardest thing. The other thing, I probably saw this coming, but the extent of its truth has probably been surprising, is that we are no happier whatsoever. We're plenty happy. We were happy back then. But it's really done nothing to our day-to-day happiness. And I could have seen that coming because what makes people happy, at least for us, is relationship with my wife. Are our kids thriving at school? Do our kids have good friends? Do we have good friends in the area? Am I sleeping eight hours? Am I healthy? And for the most part, money is not going to change that at all. Now, I'm probably more content. I'm more independent. And those are great feelings, but it's not happiness. Happiness is not part of that. And what I just said, I wrote in the book. But the irony is like after making money from the book, it's really just been slammed in my face how true that was. I'm there with you, man. After Subtle Art blew up, money, in a lot of ways, actually made me less happy for a short period of time. I think it complicated my life quite a bit in ways that I didn't expect, I wasn't prepared for. And then it was funny because as I kind of worked through and navigated all those complications, I realized that most of the advice that I needed to overcome those issues had been written in my fucking book. And I just had never thought and applied them to this new life experience, right? It was like when I wrote everything in that book, I was looking back and applying it to all the challenges that I had already overcome. And it had never occurred to me to look at the potential future challenges that I might overcome. But I think this topic is really interesting. And it's funny because it's something that when I go on podcasts, I get asked about a lot. And I've started to deduce it's just because maybe I'm the only person who really talks about it. But I feel like you're probably the perfect candidate to also talk about this. And I guess this is the, I don't want to call it downsides, but maybe like the hidden costs of wealth. When you don't have money, there is this very idealized, rosy picture of like, man, if I could just have this car or this house, like everything would be great if I could send my kid to this school. And yeah, there's definitely truth to that. But I think there's a lot of unexpected social and psychological challenges that come with wealth that most people don't know that they're signing up for. And then when they happen, they don't really know how to navigate that. I do think for everybody that with every dollar of wealth that you gain comes probably a few pennies of what I would call social debt. It's not actual debt. It's not credit card debt. But it's like with every dollar of wealth is this little bit of whether it's social debt could be an increase in your own expectations in life. That's going to like whittle away at your wealth over time. It could be friends and family members asking you for loans and expecting you to pay at dinner. There's all this social debt that comes with every dollar. And people who make a lot of money have a lot of social debt. I've told the story before, but two or three years ago, I did a consulting session with a group of NBA rookies. And the purpose of it was everybody knows that most professional athletes, including the NBA, these guys go broke. They go bankrupt. They have a three-year career where they make $20 million and they all go bankrupt. And one of the players, he was 19 years old. He said something that I thought was so astute and so smart. He said, when you grew up in inner city poverty, and then you signed a $10 million contract when you're 19, he said, that's not your money. That is mom's money, dad's money, cousin's money."}
