During dinner, my wife's friend insisted on hugging my seven-year-old son despite his refusal. She looked at me for intervention after several attempts, but I explained that he had been in a fight at school and was feeling upset. She said, come on, you're just gonna let him disobey like that? I said I raised him to build his own boundaries and say no when something violates them, and I would never make him break them for somebody else. You sound like a good parent. She laughed and said that he's lucky he's not her kid and that behavior would be fixed fast. I had my son go to his room and asked her to leave. I made it clear that I wouldn't tolerate my son being treated as a pet instead of a person. Fucking good parenting here. She called me an asshole and left. Despite my wife's disappointment, she understood my actions and couldn't scold me, admitting she probably would have reacted in the same way. Am I the asshole? No, you are absolutely not the asshole. If anybody disrespects your child's boundaries, I don't care how old they are, if somebody's trying to make your child do something and they don't wanna do it, fuck that person. Well done."}
