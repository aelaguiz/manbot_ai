He also beat both of his wives and abandoned one of his children. 30 years later, Trent Reznor from Nine Inch Nails wrote a song called Love Is Not Enough. Despite being famous for his shocking stage performances, he embraced sobriety and prioritized his family. In our culture, many of us idealize love. We see it as a lofty cure-all for all of our lives' problems. However, relationships are not so simple. Without things like respect, trust, and vulnerability, love is just as likely to hurt us as it is to help us. When we believe that all we need is love, then like Lennon, we are more likely to ignore these fundamental values and hurt others. But, if like Reznor, we believe that love is not enough, then we understand that there are things more important in our relationships than simply being in love, and we're all the better for it."}
