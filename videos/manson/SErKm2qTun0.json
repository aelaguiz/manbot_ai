Do you feel like you're constantly doing things that don't feel valuable? Do you get anxious that your to-do list only seems to get longer and you only seem to get older and the world is speeding up and holy balls, it's already 2024? Yeah, of course you do. We all do. And like the rest of us, you've probably tried to figure out a way to manage your time better. Like with to-do lists or time blocking your calendar or creating an Eisenhower matrix or some fancy schmancy new app that promises to remove all stress and anxiety from your life by automatically ordering your toilet paper and installments. And yet there's still that nagging voice in the back of your head, whispering to you that it isn't enough. It's never enough. But of course, you've got to get more work done. You got to spend more time with your partner, with your family. You got to nurture your friendships. You got to save more whales and save more children and save endangered salamanders and change your profile picture to whatever sociocultural political trend is happening on TikTok. It's a lot. It's a lot. But what if there's a way to escape the doom loop? What if you could actually get more of the important things done, not by defeating father time once and for all, but rather surrendering to him? Are you wondering what the fuck I'm talking about? Well, that's because we're gonna get into it in today's episode. We're gonna look at how our perception of our time shapes our sense of self-worth. How it's often advantageous to choose to be bad at something or just to not do something at all. Yes, I hear the overachievers screaming in horror when I say that, but please stick with me here. To help me out with all this, we will be joined by my friend, Oliver Berkman. He's the author of the hit bestseller, 4,000 Weeks, Time Management for Mortals. Oliver is a renowned journalist and author known for his unique ability to seamlessly blend philosophy and psychology and bring fresh and counterintuitive takes to classical personal development subjects like this one. So strap in for this one because it's gonna get a little mind bendy. And we're about to embark on a journey that promises to enlighten, inform, and most importantly, inspire you to see your life, your choices, and your time in a completely new way. But before we get started, I do have one small, simple request. If you're listening to this, please take a minute, leave a rating or a review. It's a new podcast and so I'm trying to grow so we can record more episodes and get bigger guests and do just a bunch of cool ass shit. And between now and the end of the year, I'm running a promotion where if you send me a screenshot of your review, I will send you my 2024 Life Audit PDF for free. This PDF takes you step-by-step to document how you're choosing to spend your time, how you could be choosing to spend it better, what you could invest more time in, and of course, what you should say fuck it to and cut back in the new year. So go to markmanson.net slash audit, that's A-U-D-I-T, and get more info and send in your screenshots. Trust me, it will be well worth your time. Come on guys, you know you fucking love the dad jokes. That's why you're here. You love the dad jokes. Let's get started. 20 million books sold. Zero fucks given. It's the subtle art of not giving a fuck podcast with your host, Mark Manson. Going back and looking at your book again, I kind of had this feeling that productivity or time management, it's almost, you're almost making a bargain with yourself without realizing it, which is when you choose to measure something, say a goal or an objective that you have, say a New Year's resolution, when you choose to measure something, you objectify it. And when you objectify something, you kind of inherently remove yourself from the present. You basically say, okay, I'm going to increase my chances of accomplishing this thing, but the cost of doing that is that I'm gonna enjoy it less and appreciate it less as it's happening. I think if you were to distill kind of the revelation of your book for most people, I think it's that, is that we've been making this bargain our entire lives without realizing it. And I guess it's just that sense of meaning or fulfillment was like never put on the balance sheet when we were like making our calculations or whatever. I guess, you know, right at the bottom of this, there is this distinction that I try to draw in the book between being sort of alienated from time versus seeing yourself as part of time. Maybe we should go straight into Heidegger. It's a fan favorite here at the Subtle Art Podcast. Just this idea that like all these conversations, we talk so often about like having a relationship with time. Maybe it's a relationship where you're fighting time or maybe you're succeeding in like winning the day or whatever it is, right? But it's always this kind of, it's this thing where there's you and then there's time and either this relationship is going well or it's going badly. And I sort of make the case that in pre-industrial times, certain other contexts in history, that whole notion that there's you and time and you've got to make the most of your time just falls apart if you just see yourself as being like in the flow of life. If you feel that you are a bit of time rather than that you have this time, you've got to try to make the most of. So that's like at the bottom of all this, it's just this notion that like this idea that it's inherently a struggle or a fight and we've got to try to dominate or master time and that a good life would be one where we squeezed the most value out of it. Sounds like it would be right, but if the moment when that value gets enjoyed is always in the future, then one day you die and you never got to be present in your own life. On a practical level, like what does that look like? How does one say work week differ between one approach and another? I think it's fundamentally to do with facing up to the realities of one's limitations, right? The degree to which you are limited by time, the fact that you only have so many hours in a day, the fact that you're gonna have a finite number of years in a life. And instead of being in a constant struggle against this to try to somehow sort of achieve escape velocity from your own situation, you're working with it. I think one of the things that means is getting more comfortable with working sequentially on things, being willing to neglect almost everything for large chunks of time while you work on a small number of them. It's about being willing to neglect some things perhaps entirely because you understand that your situation is finite person in a world of infinite possibilities and that trying to get your arms around all of them or get so efficient that you could do all of them is kind of like a, it's a denial of the truth of what you are, which is a finite person in the world. And so even though that sounds at first like a kind of defeat, right? It's sort of like surrender. So I'm gonna get less, gonna do fewer of the things that I'd dreamed I might do. It's actually a way of really concentrating your energies on a few things, not being perpetually distracted and made anxious by the fact that there are all sorts of other things you could in principle be doing and sort of entering more and more fully into the state of being a finite human. I like the name that you came up for this in the book as well, which is strategic underachievement. I think for a lot of people that just instinctually makes them bristle, makes them uncomfortable. What is the strategic under, is that that consciously choosing things that you're willing to fail at to make energy and space for the things that are most important? Yeah, I mean, this phrase originates not with me and as a joke, right? Originally, I think this idea was, this is like, if you don't wanna be the person who has to change the, ever has to change the toner in the printer at work or the photocopier in the office, like then just do it once really badly and you'll never get asked to do it again. So there's that kind of strategic underachievement. I sort of expanded the idea in the book to the idea that if it is the case, which it is, that there are always far more things you won't be doing and won't be excelling at than any that you are, that's just math. It's not, it's no criticism of you. Then it actually makes a lot of sense to get conscious about that and to be sort of willing to have the guts to face like, okay, this domain of life or maybe these friendships that aren't as important to me as these other ones, right? I'm actually gonna like take the conscious decision to not focus my energies on nurturing those, on developing those. Just because you're going to be choosing anyway, right? This is a point I associate with your writing as well, right? You're always choosing what to do with finite, in a finite situation anyway. The question is, are you gonna face up to it or continue to kind of deceive yourself that somehow in a while, never right now, but sometime in the future, you're gonna finally be sort of omnipotent and capable of doing it all. One aspect of this that I think is really important and immediately practical maybe is just that being willing to work sequentially and seasonally even on things, right? So to say for this period of my life or of the year, it could be all different kind of lengths of time, right? But say for this next few months, I'm gonna put all these things on the back burner, not because they don't matter, not because I've managed to convince myself that they're irrelevant, that I don't need them, but just because something's gotta be on the back burner if I'm gonna really move the needle and I'm mixing metaphors terribly here, but move the needle with something on the front burner. So strange. Moving needles on burners, yeah. A strange cookery is going on there. It takes a lot of trust, right? I feel like we often go through life thinking that with this sort of implicit notion that if we don't address all these things now, we might completely forget that we cared about a certain friend or that we were really interested in a certain sport. So it's like, it's strange. It's like, if you don't do it now, you're worried that you might just like wake up decades later and have never done it. So you have to sort of trust yourself that actually it's gonna get its time. I feel like, you know, you mentioned a writing project. Like I feel like I had to really learn to do this with books because just writing a book is so all-consuming for minimum six months, often a year or more, that with my last book, I actually very explicitly kind of went to everybody in my life and was like, hey, I'm about to go into the bunker with this book. I'm not gonna be around a whole lot. Told my wife that, told my team that, told some of my friends that. I'm just gonna be in my little writing hole trudging away at it for, and I'm gonna come out in six or eight months and I'll be like a happy, fun person again that will be enjoyable to hang out with. But until that moment. So I feel like a lot of it is setting expectations with people. One thing I hear from people a lot or that I've noticed from talking to readers is that the people that I've seen who really, really struggle with this seems to be people pleasers. It seems to be the people pleasers who don't give themselves space to fail or underperform at anything. The driving motivation of that seems to be this fear of judgment or disappointment. Yeah. What I've noticed with people is that they tend to be more comfortable with the idea of failing themselves, but if it comes to failing a family member or a coworker or a friend, for a lot of people it's just unmanageable. Yeah. So I'm curious if you've run into that and what you would say to those people. Yeah, I've totally run into it. I totally encounter the same experience talking to readers, but also it feels closer to home than that. I feel it feels like in my character as well. I think one really useful thing, there's this kind of move that I often find myself making in the arguments that I make in writing, which is that path to liberation in some given area is realizing that the situation is worse than you think it is, right? So if you think this is a kind of a Zen idea, I guess in many ways, but if you getting through your whole to-do list is gonna be incredibly difficult, that is super stressful. If you see that it's logically, systematically, whatever, intrinsically impossible, that's much, there's much less suffering involved with that because you've seen that actually you were trying to do something that isn't within sort of human capacities. Where this applies in the people pleasing case, I think is it's been really useful for me anyway to realize that it doesn't really please people, right? To be a people pleaser, right? It doesn't work on its own terms. I feel like I've spent a lot of my earlier adult life turning every kind of opportunity that came my way into a kind of onerous obligation that I didn't really want to do just because I signed up to it. And then spending my whole life feeling like I just had to fulfill my obligations to people I'd agreed to do stuff for or that I was in a relationship such that I had to do stuff for them. And people pick up on that and they don't like it, right? I mean, and it leads to all sorts of kind of weaselly behavior on one's own part that isn't really helpful. I wrote in a newsletter recently about like, where I was working on one assignment and I'd been asked by an editor if I could take on this other assignment and I didn't know if I had the bandwidth. So I had delayed giving her a reply. And eventually I sort of went over and had a kind of sheepish conversation about how I didn't think I would be able to do it. And of course, by then it was more annoying to be pulling out of it. And I recall her saying to me, if you can't do something, it's often just easier for everyone if you can just say no when you realize that. And it was just a sort of mundane comment, but actually kind of really eye-opening in hindsight. Because the people-pleasing urge is an urge to be able to do everything, right? To be able to meet all demands, to never have to make that uncomfortable decision that you're gonna let somebody down or risk disappointing somebody for all sorts of childhood reasons. It turns you into someone who doesn't do good work for the people you're trying to please or who isn't a good relationship partner for the people you're trying to please. It's just like, it doesn't actually help anybody. And I find that realization that something is just no good on its own terms is always a lot more powerful, I think, in affecting change, at least in me personally, than just sort of telling yourself that you should be different. I think that's a really good point. And I don't think I've ever heard it put explicitly like that. It's funny, my wife has this... thing. And I always just thought it was kind of a pet peeve, but I think it's actually very healthy, which she has this thing where she would rather I not go to something than go and not enjoy it. So, you know how most marriages, you always have these situations where your partner is like, well, we got to go do this thing with my friends or my mom or whatever. She's like, if you're not excited to go, just don't go. Because I'd rather go alone and just tell my family that you're busy than have you show up and spend the whole evening on your phone and miserable and wanting to go home. And it's very jarring for a lot of people. It's even jarring. I mean, I've been married to her for forever and it's still jarring to me sometimes, but she's like very, she's a stickler about it. And I think it actually ends up netting out much better because so many of us, and I'm guilty of this a million times, you get roped into things. You feel bad. You're like, well, my brother's friend's roommate's birthday and I turned down the last two invitations and I don't want to be the asshole who turns down three invitations. So, you go. And what people don't realize is you're bringing the mood of the party down itself. You're actually potentially a net negative. And then, as you pointed out, in a professional situation, when you take on too much work, you're potentially a net negative on that work you're taking on that you don't really want to do anyway either. Mason Right, exactly. That sort of guilt feeling where you go along with the thing because you feel like you should. It doesn't serve anybody involved. And also, usually, the consequence of, in an upfront way, declining. It's pretty rare that people are going to be extremely offended. Obviously, that's situational and circumstantial, but there is a kind of egotism in the notion that I've got to say yes to a social invitation. Otherwise, that social event is going to be terribly bad in my absence or something, right? There's that notion that the world sort of orbits around myself in a way that it obviously just doesn't. And then, as soon as you put this into practice by not getting roped into certain things, or even pulling out of things that you've originally let yourself get roped into, the consequences never really seem to be as calamitous as on some level I'm imagining. Geoff Or if they are, like if the person makes a big drama and fuss about it, then that tells you something about your relationship with that person. It's so simple, but we get so caught up in kind of mind games and status games of like, oh, well, you know, Susie won't like me if I say do this. And she came to my thing, so I feel like I have to go to her thing. And that's because I don't want to look bad and, you know, blah, blah, blah. I think sometimes we just complicate things unnecessarily. And like you said, make ourselves the center of the universe. Mason Yeah, I think that's right. I mean, the difficulty with this kind of trade off and prioritization question comes when you just have competing values in yourself, right? I mean, not when you don't want to go to the social event at all, but you're going to pretend to because you just don't want to make people feel bad. But when you just legitimately do want to say, you know, be the kind of person who supports this kind of organization and be the kind of person who spends this amount of quality time with your kid and be the kind of person who spends this amount of time on meditation retreats. That's where you get into this situation where, yeah, something is going to have to give. And I think that the understanding that something is always going to have to give, as I said before, is actually really liberating, because then you don't at least need to beat yourself up for not having found a way to fit it all in. You have a bit of a spicy take. I don't know if I disagree with you, but I definitely want to discuss it. You have this point of don't try to change the world. Don't kind of build up these grandiose expectations. As I reread this, I thought Steve Jobs is rolling in his grave. My counter argument to this, and it's funny because this is something I've wrestled with myself. You know, first of all, the classic Steve Jobs quote, you know, it's the people who are crazy enough to think they're going to change the world who actually do. So first of all, explain that. What is the motivation behind the, you know, don't try to change the world? What does that get us? And then we can kind of talk about the... It's not that it's bad to be Steve Jobs creating the iPhone, but that it is really bad to have a definition of a life well spent or a life meaningfully spent that only people like Steve Jobs get to qualify for because they do something absolutely huge that affects millions of people. That is kind of astounding and impressive. I really, this is where I don't feel ambivalent, right? I really want to sort of speak up for definitions of a meaningful life that are A, much less conspicuous, but also more transient in a way, right? I mean, we all know that it is meaningful to care for an elderly relative or to be in nature in certain contexts, to go hiking in wilderness landscapes. You know, these things are meaningful ways of spending our time, we feel intuitively. It's really hard to make a case that they are necessarily going to matter a few hundred years from now. I mean, you can always try to make that case about how your kid is going to be the one who solves this or that global crisis. But no, they matter in themselves. I was really influenced, I think, about all this by a book by a philosopher called Ido Landau, a book called Finding Meaning in an Imperfect World, where he just points out like, it's so weird basically to culturally adopt these definitions of the best lives that are just going to be, in terms of statistics or the distribution of talent and luck, just going to be closed to the vast majority of people. You know, beating ourselves up because we're not Shakespeare. I mean, it's a strange way to go through life. It's funny, on our previous podcast I had with Scott Berry Kaufman, we talked about having a toxic relationship with goals, how you can basically sacrifice your self-worth for a goal the same way, you know, people often sacrifice their self-worth to make their partner happy or to make a relationship work. Right. How it's ultimately self-defeating, it just makes everything worse. A lot of what you're talking about, it sounds like you can kind of develop a toxic relationship with time, which is you start basing your self-worth on efficiency and optimization, which as you point out in the book, there's no end to efficiency and optimization. No matter how optimized you get, there's always another level of optimization that you can achieve. But I also think it's interesting because this often happens to me, I think this happens to most people, it's like I'll have a big goal in my life, I'll work my ass off to achieve it and then I get the goal and I'm kind of disappointed. Like I'm like, wow, I thought this was going to be a lot better. I worked so hard for so many months and now I'm here and I'm just kind of like, now what? Right. Yeah. And I think this toxic relationship frame is kind of interesting because it's sometimes you're the kind of domineering, control-obsessed partner in this toxic relationship and then other times you're sort of spending your life placating time with all your activity and exertions. Time doesn't keep to the deal, right? The reward is not commensurate with the effort. As I say, I think that maybe the answer to this is to stop thinking about time as something you're in a relationship with, rather than to have a healthy relationship with time. I know that sounds kind of mind-bending, but I think this very strange kind of slightly stoned notion of time as something that you are is really powerful because it gets you out of that whole mindset of trying to sort of control the course of your life rather than to experience the course of your life. So I'm with you on the stone conceptual grokking of this idea of inhabiting time rather than being in relationship trying to control it. I lived in Latin America for four years, primarily Brazil, but also in Colombia and Argentina. Latinos have a very different understanding of time than us Anglo-Saxon people. When I'm in Brazil, I go back to Brazil once or twice a year. The thing that's amazing about Brazil is people are present. People are enjoying themselves. They're not worried about tomorrow. They're not worried about next week. If there's a dinner, they're in the dinner. If there's a party, they're in the party. If there's a concert, they're in the concert. But at the same time, nothing fucking gets done in Brazil. There are half-built highways that have been sitting there for 20 years. And it's funny because growing up in the States and particularly being interested in Buddhism, which I still want to get to Buddhism, I definitely had this very romanticized idea of being present. I remember when I was in my early 20s, I read The Power of Now. And like a lot of people who read Power of Now, for about a month, presence was the hammer and everything in my life was the nail. It's like, oh, I just got to be present. And living in Latin America for that amount of time, it changed my mind a little bit about presence. I think that's when it switched to viewing this orientation towards time as maybe a trade-off. And I almost feel like maybe the healthiest way to go about it is having a flexibility in terms of when you need to be present, be present. And when you need to set goals and systematize time, you can set goals and systematize time. Both of those things are skills that are not easy or natural to most people, I think. I wonder if you can go even further than just saying you need to balance or to be able to move flexibly between them and to say, there's something important here about understanding that the tools of efficiency and productivity and optimization are just tools. And I think even Eckhart Tolle says something along these lines, right? It's not that thinking is bad, it's that can you develop a relationship to thinking where you pick it up when you need it and put it down when you don't, as opposed to becoming fully identified with it or in the case of our tools, sort of governed by them instead of using them. So, something that I keep getting asked when I do media about the book and stuff is always like, well, you've said all these things about how productivity is nonsense, but are there any productivity tips, techniques you do still use? And it's always like, I'm going to reveal that actually I'm completely obsessed with squeezing every minute out of my time. And I'm like, actually, I kind of am obsessed with that. And that's why I wrote the book, right? There's nothing wrong with productivity techniques if what you're doing is just picking the one that seems useful for you right now and using it because it's useful and then stopping using it when it isn't useful. It's the kind of idea that there's some great meta principle or technique in the sky that you're going to use. And once you find it, you're going to run your whole life on it forever. That stuff will lead you down all sorts of odd pathways, but I don't think there's anything wrong with the use of tools as tools. And I think this goes to what you're saying because I think it is possible, at least on my good days, I'm not claiming any unbroken perfection in this, to centre yourself in that kind of presence in the moment and in life, and then use these kinds of methods of planning and of fitting more in and working faster when you need to and setting goals and defining outcomes without becoming totally identified with them. There's a whole idea that I've also been really impressed by in a lot of the Zen writing. And I came across it in a really interesting little book called The Art of Taking Action. Actually, it's possible to see those kinds of Eastern spiritualities as very much about action, not as about passivity and just sitting cross-legged on a mountainside meditating. And that in a way, there's almost this framing that says if you really truly were in the moment in the fullest sense, not because you're just hedonistically relaxed or something. You've got all your thinking out of the way. You're not impeding yourself. What would happen would be lots of action, right? You would do a lot of stuff. And maybe this is too obscure and not even fully formed in my own mind, but I think there is a potential way of seeing the switch here. Not from, you know, we spend our lives endlessly chasing these goals and being miserable in the process. So what we have to do instead is stop chasing goals and just chill out. But from that first idea of actions leading up to some future fulfilment and switching it to the idea that action is the expression of fulfilment, right? The way that you celebrate being alive, the way that you express joy is just by doing stuff. And if you're doing stuff that you enjoy, and if you love your work in some sense of that fraught phrase, that's a possibility for you, right? The idea that you could be really active and get huge amounts accomplished, but not because meaning lies at the end of a long slog, but because that is what's meaningful for you to do. Certainly, at least in theory, that's how I feel about my work, right? If I eliminated all anxiety I have about my work, if I had no need to do it for financial reasons, or for, you know, egotistical reasons, I kind of hope that I would still want to do it because I enjoy doing it. I think there was a really, really profound idea between presence and procrastination or anxiety about outcome. Because I think fundamentally what procrastination is, is it's a low level anxiety about outcome. It's I'm working on this article or working on this email because I'm worried it won't go well or it won't turn out as well as I think it will. And the only thing I've ever found in my life that defeats procrastination is adopting that presence of stop thinking about the outcome, open a fucking Word document, like be present, click the button, click the button again. Okay, write the title. Okay, that's done. Now write the first sentence, you know, and just kind of taking it little piece by piece."}
