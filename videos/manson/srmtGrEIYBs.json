It\u2019s all over the internet. It\u2019s what makes up today\u2019s pop culture. And it\u2019s the bane of the self help industry. How to be more interesting. But it's bullshit.\n\nOver and over we\u2019re sold this ridiculous idea that we\u2019re all somehow destined to do our own big great thing. We\u2019re all made of something special and all we need to do is discover what our super power is so that we can all become fucking superheroes.\n\nWell, I think it\u2019s bullshit. What I think is that we\u2019ve lost touch with the real metrics it takes to gage our success and how well we are doing in our lives. In this video I explain why it\u2019s totally okay to be average. And why some of the most important things in life are not extraordinary at all. \n\n\u2014\n\nSign up for my newsletter to receive three actionable pieces of advice each week that could change your life - free sign up here: http://bit.ly/3JRg3NX\n\nIf you are not already a member of my premium membership, get access to my courses and exclusive writing here: http://bit.ly/3LwHWfi\n\nI am Mark Manson, 3x #1 NY Times bestselling author of:\n\nThe Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck - https://mrk.mn/3svfxcu\nEverything Is F*cked: A Book About Hope - https://mrk.mn/2RNxVAD\n\nI share other types of content to make you a less awful human in these places:\n\nhttps://instagram.com/markmanson/\nhttps://twitter.com/IAmMarkManson\nhttps://facebook.com/Markmansonnet/\nhttps://linkedin.com/in/markmanson/\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@iammarkmanson\n\nThanks for watching.", "published_at": "2020-05-17T18:01:18Z", "channel_id": "UC0TnW9acNxqeojxXDMbohcA", "channel_title": "Mark Manson", "tags": ["how to be interesting", "mark manson", "motivation", "self knowledge", "self development", "self improvement", "self improvement tips", "self development motivation", "self development tips", "life", "life choices", "life advice", "markmanson.net", "blog", "emotions", "emotional intelligence", "habits", "identity", "life purpose", "life goals", "how to be interesting in a relationship", "how to be interesting in conversation", "how to be interesting on a date", "how to be interesting on youtube", "How to be interesting in text"], "category_id": "27", "live_broadcast_content": "none", "duration": 307.0, "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false", "view_count": 227849, "like_count": 13625, "comment_count": 393, "channel_info": {"title": "Mark Manson", "description": "3x #1 NY Times Bestselling Author.

Hey, I can't blame you. I do the same shit. But you know, it's funny, watching YouTube all the time or being on social media all the time, you're always exposed to the most extraordinary parts of human experience. For instance, I can get on YouTube or Instagram and I can instantly see a guy pick up a thousand pounds off the floor and he's got arms like the size of my toilet bowl. Or I can see an eight-year-old who's better at piano than I am at anything, really. You see this encouragement of the extraordinary all over pop culture. You see it in talk shows, you see it in inspirational figures, you see it in commercials, and you especially see it in the self-help industry. One of the biggest things that's sold to you in the self-help industry is that we all have this special extraordinary thing inside us and it's just waiting to get out. All you need to know is the secret to get it out of you. That unless you're doing something incredible with your life, then it's somehow wasted. I think this is bullshit. In fact, I think the problem isn't so much us, we've lost track of what normal good human experience is actually like. First of all, most of us are going to be ordinary at the vast majority of things that we do. Second of all, even if you are able to lift a thousand pounds off the ground or whatever, that doesn't necessarily make you a good father or a good friend or even a good person. These extraordinary things that we're exposed to while being super cool and entertaining aren't necessarily the most important metrics to be gauging our lives on. This is a bell curve. If you wanted to graph most human skills and activities and put all the people who are the very best on the right and all the people who are very worst on the left, what you end up getting is a nice bell shape. The vast majority of people are in the middle somewhere and as you get out to either extreme, there are fewer and fewer people at those extremities. When we see something like, I don't know, Michael Jordan slam dunking, he's in the 99.9th percentile. He's one of the best human beings that has ever lived. He's on this part of the bell curve. He's so far on this end of the bell curve that you can't even see what's over there. He doesn't even show up on the graph. And then you take somebody like, I don't know, this guy, he's so much worse than everybody. He's on the other end of the bell curve. What all this great technology and media has done to us is that we are constantly exposed to the extremes, to the tail ends of the bell curve while we go outside and our day-to-day life is in the fat, boring middle. But Mark, if I'm not extraordinary, what do I do with my life? And it's like, well, who says you need to be extraordinary to have a valuable and meaningful life? In fact, I would argue that some of the most important things in life are not extraordinary at all. Things like raising a kid well, things like taking care of your health, being an honest and good person to your friends and family. These are not extraordinary things. In fact, they are the most ordinary things. And I think they're ordinary things for a reason, because they're the most important. And there's a paradox to this as well. If you want to do one of those extraordinary things, the way you do it is by doing the ordinary extremely well for a long time. For instance, that dude who lifts a thousand pounds, I mean, he's probably been hitting the gym three hours a day for the last 25 years. There's nothing extraordinary about going into the gym and lifting slightly more weight than you did last time. When you compound that over the course of decades, you end up with an extraordinary result. But if you go into it looking for the extraordinary result, you're going to create false expectations and you're just going to feel like shit about yourself. And so there's this contrast. Our actual lived experience is I'm just like everybody fucking else. But our expectation is, is I should be jumping out of planes in a wingsuit and fucking landing on Mount Everest. It's one of those things that while the intention is very good, I think it causes more suffering than it resolves. So I say, fuck being extraordinary. Let's bring back the ordinary. Let's bring back being average. Because if we're being honest, we're all pretty average most of the time. And that's okay."}
