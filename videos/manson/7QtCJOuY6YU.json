This can sound like a super depressing conclusion, but in a way I find it very liberating because it says that no matter what path you take, there's struggle in front of you. So the logical conclusion is you should always take the right path, right? Like being unhealthy is painful. Being healthy is painful. Having no relationships is painful. Having relationships is painful. It's just different flavors of pain. So you might as well pick the flavors of pain that are gonna help you and give you a better set of life circumstances. And what's powerful about that is that once you choose the problem you want, something kind of magical happens in your head, which is you no longer perceive yourself as a victim. You perceive yourself as like a challenger, a competitor. Why are you not entertained? Everybody who's like facing the odds and is set."}
