Louis C.K. said when his marriage broke up, he was devastated at first. And then Andrew Dice Clay was talking with him in the parking lot outside a comedy club and said, why do you look so glum? He said, it looks like my marriage is done. He goes, oh, congratulations. And he said, what do you mean congratulations? And he said, nobody ever leaves a good merit. Those sorts of experience tend to precipitate very large identity shifts because you take something very, very dear and personal to somebody, basically something that they either took for granted or assumed was true and was always going to be there. You take it away from them and then it kind of forces them into that mindset of, I thought this was a sure thing, but clearly it wasn't. So what else in my life do I think is a sure thing it might not be? And they start asking questions. Do I actually like my friends? Do I want to go here or there? Hardship makes this process easier in some ways, probably creates more opportunities to ask these questions. Whereas success, when everything's going right, you don't want to fuck up the gravy train. So you don't start asking if you're headed in the right direction or not."}
