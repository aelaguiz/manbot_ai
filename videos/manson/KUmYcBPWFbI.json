Yeah, that's fucking weird. So there's a weird thing about attraction, which is that people of similar emotional maturity tend to be attracted to one another. And so when you see guys like this, guys who are in their 30s, 40s, even 50s, who are still dating fucking children, it says something about their maturity level. So I don't know what happened to this guy. It sounds like mentally, he's still thinking like an 18-year-old, which means he's thinking with his dick. So yeah, it's fucking weird."}
