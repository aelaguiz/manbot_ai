But if you do a ton of research on what drives happiness and wellbeing, and even things like physical health and longevity, interpersonal relationships come up over and over and over again. A better life means better relationships, means a good marriage, it means good friendships, it means having a strong community around you. And I was late to this party. Maybe growing up, I became very independent at a very young age, and I adopted a lot of stories and beliefs around being completely autonomous, not only financially, but physically, emotionally, psychologically. And I think I resisted this lesson for a long time. My commitment phobia caused me to resist it. I never wanted to stay in one place. I wanted to constantly be cycling through friends. By the time I got to my 30s, I realized how absolutely exhausting it is to constantly feel like you have to do everything yourself."}
