The problem is that we're all drowning in information, and this causes us to mistake a quantity of knowledge for a quality of knowledge. And that's where we all get into trouble. We pay attention to everything and believe that every opinion is worth considering. The result is an explosion in overconfidence and misinformation, making it difficult for people to navigate the sea of opinions. Having low expertise opinions is dangerous for two reasons. First, anything you believe can be confirmed with a Google search. Doesn't matter who you are or how fucking crazy your belief is, you'll find something online that tells you that you're right. Second, we're now influencing each other with our misguided views. In the past, if you believed something crazy, you were punished for it. But now, with all of the outlets for sharing opinions, thank you social media, misinformation can spread like wildfire, making it difficult for people to know what to trust. It's just so crazy."}
