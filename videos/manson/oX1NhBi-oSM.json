And I think it actually ends up netting out much better because so many of us, and I'm guilty of this a million times, you get roped into things. You feel bad. You're like, well, my brother's friend's roommate's birthday and I turned down the last two invitations and I don't want to be the asshole who turns down three invitations. So you go, and what people don't realize is you like, you're bringing the mood of the party down itself. You're actually potentially a net negative. As you pointed out in a professional situation, when you take on too much work, you're potentially a net negative on that work you're taking on that you don't really want to do."}
