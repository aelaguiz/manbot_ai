And one night, a new friend that you just met comes over and tells you about an idea that he had for a YouTube channel. You guys get excited and you decide to do it together. Now imagine these videos go so well that within six months, you and your new friend are getting millions of views, being flown to Los Angeles, meeting up with billionaires and tycoons and receiving massive checks to create as much content as you possibly can. Jump ahead seven years and you've made hundreds of videos, have millions of followers and become famous worldwide. Your videos have been viewed over 1 billion times. That is billion with a B. And yet at the peak of your fame and fortune, you decide to hang it up. This is the story of today's guest, Matt Dahlia. One of the co-founders of Yes Theory, one of the most popular YouTube channels in the world. A channel that began as four friends traveling the world, challenging each other to say yes to some of life's most crazy adventures. Matt and I will talk about how it's possible to have a codependent relationship with an audience. We talk about the perils of experiencing too much success too quickly and the courage that it takes to stand up for yourself even when it means giving up your life's dream. I'm excited for this episode, not just because Matt's a friend of mine and his story is so crazy and unique, but simply because it's so rare to come across someone who is so successful yet completely candid about their struggles and fears. What we'll discover is that at its core, Matt's story is actually a very common one. It's about someone who gave away too much of themselves to be liked and admired by others. And now as a grown adult in his 30s, he is desperately trying to get that back. So stick around for this one. It's gonna be fucking crazy. Bro, do you even podcast? Like bro, this is the subtle art of not giving a fuck podcast with your host, Mark Manson. So in a recent study, they asked six to 17 year olds what they wanted to be when they grew up. And the number one answer by far, probably don't even have to tell you, it's a YouTuber. The answer was three times more common than an astronaut or any sort of professional athlete. All the kids wanna become a YouTuber, that's the dream. You became a famous YouTuber at a young age, your early 20s, grew a massive channel and then called it quits. So what the fuck, dude, you're giving up the dream. What's going on here? Six year old me would be like, you idiot. You ruined everything. You had a plan. You had it all. What the fuck happened? That is a great question. To give a little bit of context, we started getting quite big in 2018 and we'd been living in LA for a year and it was like, holy shit, we're growing so fast. All these famous people wanna work with us and it's turning into this thing, like this dream that we had. Because up to that point, it was kind of just an idea. It was a big dream. And I actually went back and read my diary during that time. And there was one diary entry where I could see the first signs of not being able to continue for much longer. And it was essentially saying, I about four to five times a day introduce myself to new people in my own house. So we have people coming in constantly because we're recording, at the time we were doing three videos a week. So we were just recording constantly with strangers and people and throwing events and parties. And our channel was Yes Theory, saying yes to things. So we were just constantly saying yes, even when we didn't necessarily feel like it. And it was the first glimpse in that diary entry of like, I don't actually level this part or actually a lot of it. And at the time, I had no idea that I was more introverted than I thought. Like YouTube oftentimes requires this big extra version, or at least this kind of fake extra version. Like I, I don't know if fake is the best word, but you turn it off. You turn it off. I was gonna say talking heads, I didn't want to insult. I was like, but oftentimes, especially like comedian talking heads. Like I've met quite a few of them where on camera, they're like very expressive and loud and funny. And then you meet them in person, they're way more introverted. And for me, it's live events. It's like, there's a switch that goes on and it's like, okay, just get through the night. You could stay in the hotel quietly all day tomorrow. So you've got all these people coming into your house, shooting videos all the time. There are two things that stand out about that, that are potentially very stressful or difficult to deal with. One is the lack of any barrier between public and private. I think anytime you don't have like a clear me space or me time in your life, yeah, things just get bad pretty quickly. And the second thing I think is this feeling that you always need to be on and performing, right? The camera's always on. So not only are these people coming into your house, but you have to pretend to like them, even if you don't, you have to pretend to be having fun, even if you're not, you have to pretend to be excited about whatever they're talking about, even if you don't care. And I think it's just like basic human psychology that doesn't work for a long period of time. Was there any awareness around this at the time where you like, I need a week off or I need like space, I need a break. Can we do two videos a week instead of three? Anything like that, any conversations around that? I think YouTube attracts a particular kind of person, like this stat that you just shared of kids wanting to be YouTubers. Like the amount of people that I've met that have started to try doing YouTube, especially young people, and then quit pretty quickly because they realize it's not healthy for them, is actually quite high. So there's actually very few people I know who have kept creating and succeeded. When you bring up these questions, it goes back to psychology as well. It's like, how was I raised? What was I taught as a kid? And obviously my parents taught me amazing qualities and taught me to work hard, but there's a thing my mom would always say growing up is never say I'm lazy, not allowed in the house. You are literally not allowed to utter those words. And so the concept of taking a break felt very contradictory to how I was raised. And then the second thing is, I was also raised in an environment because we moved when I was quite young and both of my siblings are quite introverted and I was the most extroverted of the three of us. And so when we would go to parties and we didn't know many people in the neighborhood, I almost felt like this, like the diplomat, like I would show up and be this guy that would put on the show and bring people around him. And everybody loved Matt and Matt was the handshaker and like the joke cracker, I'll make fun of myself. You're the Fonzie of the neighborhood. And I think that honestly translated to YouTube and it translated to the way Yes Theory operated. It was actually a joke between Thomas Amar and I, like my two co-founders, because they're also quite extroverted, but they didn't have this need to please as much as I did. And so we would throw these like huge events and I would find myself at like two in the morning in this conversation that I didn't wanna be in out of just pure obligation and I couldn't find them anywhere. And they'd left two hours before to go to their rooms and just kind of take a breather or left the house entirely. And it became this common joke that if you were in a circle with Matt, he would keep the conversation up and you could just leave because he would take care of the social part. And I kind of prided myself on that for a long time, but I think that was a huge part of what made it exhausting because I don't know if you've experienced this with YouTube but it's so different from like being an actor. When you're an actor, there's this kind of understanding that you're playing a role, like this isn't actually you. You're on set. You're on set. Yeah, when you're off set, it's over. Be a dude. But with YouTube, there's this idea of like, oh, this is Mark and this is how Mark is always. And so if I walk up to Mark, and he does this parasocial things, he's gonna be just like he is in his videos. So there is this pressure to be that guy. Like I gotta be like, I'm fucking outgoing. I'm gonna listen to you. I'm gonna make you feel seen. And that is a true part of me. But after a while, I think the reason for the burnout, a big part of it was I just got super tired of that role. In everything that we just talked about, if you replace YouTube with, I think any sort of relationship, you would probably see a very similar result. Like when people grow up in family structures with maybe without strong boundaries in certain areas, they grow up in interrelationships without strong boundaries in those same areas. And it just so happens that your relationship was this massive relationship with a fan base of five or 10 million people. But it's the same core issue, right? It's like, it never felt appropriate for you to say no, I need me time when you were young. And so when you're put in a situation as an adult, very highly stressful situation, by the way, that I think most people would struggle to handle well, that same thing pops up. Like you don't feel okay saying no, backing off. Do you experience that? Because I mean, even we had this conversation, the size obviously of your YouTube audience, but also your newsletter is massive. Do you feel this obligation to sometimes overshare part of your life? I used to when I started. It's interesting watching, I'm gonna sound like an old man now. It's interesting watching your generation, the generation behind me coming up. Because I look back now and I think to myself, thank God I didn't blow up until my late 20s. Because I already had a lot of years to fuck up and make a lot of mistakes and figure myself out, figure out how to relate to people a little bit better. And even then the rate of my audience growth early on, like it was pretty gradual the first three or four years with the blog. Back then blogging grew much at a much slower pace than like YouTube does these days or TikTok or Instagram. So I had more time to kind of accustom myself to it and figure out like find some of these pitfalls and adjust for them. Whereas I look at you guys' story, like reading your book that's about to come out. Your trajectory was so insanely steep and at such a young age. To me actually what's crazy is that you guys are still friends. Yeah. It's crazy that there's still a yes theory at all. It's remarkable that more things didn't go wrong in you guys' case. It was gonna sound really bougie, but I was getting a massage and- Fuck yeah. Fuck yeah, dude. Treating myself. That's what we work for. Something I'm learning how to do. Yeah. And I had this moment in mid-massage where I was like, wow, I'm still, so much a part of me is still high school Matt. And in a way it feels like I started yes theory almost out of high school. Like I had done college, but that mentality had stuck. And when you're so busy making content, there is literally no time to pause, process, reflect. And so in a way you kind of stay in the mentality that you were in before you got famous. Yeah. And so I'm 31 now, but I have this feeling, and this is probably not gonna sound very inspiring, but I'm like, holy shit, I'm still like 19 year old Matt. And I've done all this crazy stuff and had all the success, but I feel like I haven't in many ways matured out of that guy. But again, and this isn't meant to like diminish your experience at all, but to me it's remarkable the parallel. People who get out of unhealthy marriages, let's say somebody gets married at 20, it's a bad marriage. They stick in it till they're 31, right? And they come out of it. They often have a very similar experience of like they still feel, they kind of go back to who they were at 19 before they got into the marriage. And I think a big reason for that is, I think comes back to the performing thing. It's like when you go into a bad marriage or a bad relationship, you kind of hide your real self and you start performing to keep the other person happy. And you're like, well, if I can just perform a little bit more, things will be okay. Things will get better. They'll be happy. Then I'll be happy. And it just kind of, it gets in this like ugly cycle. And then eventually it falls apart because that's not sustainable. But I've talked to at this point, hundreds, maybe even thousands of people over the course of my career who are like, I'm 30, I'm 40, I'm 50. I was in a bad marriage for 20 years. And I feel like I'm 20 again because I never lived for myself during those interim years. They kind of put their identity off to the side and then like pretended to be this other thing. And then when they come back, it's like, yeah, it's still the old 20 year old self sitting there on the sideline. And I think that's why a lot of times you see like middle-aged divorced people, like going to nightclubs and like- I'm not gonna be that guy. Smoking pot for the first time. I guess because you've seen so many case studies, what are examples of people learning to mature? Like how do they, how do the success stories usually unfold? It's easy to sit here and poke fun at, you know, 40 year olds going to nightclubs and taking Molly for the first time. But I do think there's a certain amount of that that's really important and healthy. You need to figure out who you are. And if you've, whether it's a marriage or a YouTube channel, if you've kind of spent the last eight years of your life, kind of putting on a front or performing all the time, you need to go back and finish that project of like, okay, who am I? Let me try all these things. Let me try out a bunch of activities and hobbies. Identities and relationships and see what feels right for me and And so I think just granting yourself the freedom to do that is like super healthy Mm-hmm and I mean what I love about what you've done with with the guys is that it seems like you've Really patched the relationships with the S series guys I get no sense of like bitterness or resentment like those friendships are still intact so you still have like great things from that period of your life that you can honor that period of your life with but I Feel like I'm like starting the cycle analyze you but Keep going no, but it's funny like hearing you and we've talked a little bit privately about your experience Yeah, like it really feels Like you had a codependent relationship with the YouTube channel and that on the surface that sentence sounds absurd But people have codependent relationships with their careers. They have codependent relationships with Their churches and religious groups they have codependent relationships with self-help gurus that people have codependent relationships with a lot of different things and I think it's Very easy to see especially somebody as young as you were when yes theory started Nobody knows who they are when they're 20, right? And so when you get this massive thing dumped on you It's very hard to stay aligned and stay true to yourself during that kind of Rocketship that takes off with you just like desperately hanging And you kind of have no choice yeah, cuz I mean Yeah, I was literally Washing dishes at 22 and 24. Um, you know, we're starring on Like we're gaining hundreds of thousands of followers and you know, it's like the first actual success of my life up to until that point Yeah, I'd gotten A's on essays and That's not success 50 year old successful businessmen that want to talk to us about what we're doing So you feel like it's this very fragile thing and if you let go of it Then you have to start like I have to be that that kid in the restaurant like scrubbing dishes at 3 a.m Again, I don't want to be that guy for sure. So there's this like deep deep fear of going back And so yeah, it's very similar to like say music or TV film You understand that it's like one in a million make it yeah, so if you start making it Yeah, you know top priority is like don't fuck this up Don't derail the train while it's moving. Yeah Yeah, it's like it's big wave surfing. Yeah, kind of the analogy I uses Oh, yeah, the last thing you want to do is jump off. Yeah, because you're just gonna crumble. It's gonna suck more Yeah, just finish riding the wave and then think about what just happened Yeah, kind of just like walk us through the timeline Of how quickly everything happened. So in 2014, I'm washing dishes in Montreal I'm a few months out of college and obviously like very confused about what I want to do with my life and I had started this Very small clothing startup the streetwear brand. It's like this is gonna be the thing. It's gonna blow up I'm gonna be a successful entrepreneur and Then after about six months, I realized that having a business is fucking Impossibly difficult And at the time I was looking for help so I found this class at the school I used to go to which was doing like marketing like consulting for local businesses and using their students to consult and one of the students that I that was consulting for my business was Thomas and Thomas had a small YouTube channel and I was noticing how Like YouTube was still quite new but I was seeing how brands were starting to come from these big audiences online I was like, holy shit if I just convince a youtuber to shout out my brands like that'll bring a lot of traction and So I eventually convinced Thomas to make a video with me. We make a video We do a shout out the end for my clothing company doesn't sell any clothes But we it's like wow We have this like really intense bond and it's really fun and so then we decide to do the 30 things in 30 days that we've never done before and Then very almost like like you said it happens so fast that even in the book It felt crazy to write it cuz it's like how do I make this sound real? fake like Amar literally the third co-founders walking down the street one night and here's this party upstairs Which Thomas is that so Amar sneaks up to the party out of curiosity says hi to everybody meets Thomas Thomas tells him about Him and I doing our YouTube thing. I'm ours like I'd love to help Mark comes in and we meet a fourth co-founder Darren serendipitously We filmed this 30 things in 30 days together in Montreal Like might as well continue after this because we had so much fun How many followers did you guys have at the end of the month probably 1500? Okay, so like it it was steadily growing. We were I mean when you cross a thousand you're like, that's a thousand I mean, it usually takes people. Yeah years. Yeah Yeah, and we had one big viral video like now on day 19, so it could feel Like oh, this is unusual like this doesn't usually happen this kind of traction and then, you know four months in we get this email from Liz Murdoch's team who are starting a channel with snapchat and they say we love what you guys are doing We want this kind of content to be on snapchat on the front page where millions of people are gonna watch you'll still be able to make your YouTube videos, but now you'll get this like extra boost from snapchat and On top of that we'll pay you 50k to film for four months wherever you want And again, dude, I mean the Mars when I think about it, I'm like, wow, he's 21 at the time Yeah, like imagine $50,000 to a 21 year old What and you guys haven't even known each other for six months not even for four months Yeah, you're getting offered 50k and basically and just continue being best friends. Yeah, just keep being best friends That's all that fucking matters. Yes your relationship and how much fun you guys are having together and So snapchat flies us out to LA We end up on the front page of snapchat millions of people watch us on snapchat within a year We have hundreds of thousands of people moving over to our YouTube channel So I think within like about a year and a half to two years. We had like 200 300 thousand subscribers Three years we had a million. Yeah, and so There was no moment of Hey, hold on this is not working. Let's pivot. Let's do something else It's like no, this is from the get-go is like everything. Holy shit So I actually don't even know I don't understand the struggle of like when I hear people talk to me about like, dude I've been grinding on this for three years and I just don't know what to do. Yeah, I can't relate I just don't understand that process so I can't really give advice but at the same time Yeah, I paid a price for that, yeah, you know, well it's interesting So Morgan Housel the finance writer was on this podcast a few weeks ago. Love it And he said something really great. He said that one of the worst things that can happen to an investor is they make a bunch of money really quickly because they mistakenly convinced themselves that they're really good and It gets them into a lot of trouble later on because they never they never develop the good habits From those failures that are necessary to make it sustainable in the long run. I wonder if there's a you know, there's a crossover there like if there's like an analogy there of Too much success too fast not learning. Maybe some of the necessary lessons Mm-hmm, and this kind of comes back to your question to me is like my audience grew slowly enough and I had enough Like bad decisions that didn't work that I think by the time I I did blow up I had developed a pretty good boundary with between myself and my audience like I understood like, okay This is the part of my life that I'm gonna keep for myself and I'm not gonna share it and then this is the part of my life that I'm gonna share and is open to everybody and For me, that was a very very important process. I actually watched the Morgan Housel interview and there was a I think he referenced what Will said about fame. Yeah, you know that there's nothing worse than losing fame. Yeah, and You know, he became obviously famous at a very young age and on a whole different Level, you know, so I can't even comprehend that. Yeah There does grow this like if this is all you've known as the success as soon as it starts to dip Not even like the views necessarily, but if people start getting frustrated with you or the criticism start coming in You're not adapted for that, you know because People love the rocket ship, but they don't love it when the rocket gets kind of steady And yeah, you know, they want to be part of the wave But as soon as it becomes this big thing, I think more criticism criticism starts to come in And so yeah, it became this like intense pressure to please like constantly, please Please please please at all costs and like you were saying, you know, you it's developed this codependent relationship It with it where the second you feel like you've made them mad or angry You almost change your whole personality to kind of yeah You know, you're like no wait guys. Yeah. No. No, really. I'm still fun Yeah, yeah and then the lack of boundaries thing I mean dude I look back on some of the shit we did is crazy Yeah one episode in particular To me is absurd to think about now, but Amar surprised me on this blind date to Rome with a girl it's like beautiful Australian girl and it was gonna be this like full day of adventures and the best blind date of all time and We filmed the episode and her and I have this actual connection and we start seeing each other I was in Europe at the time. She lived in Paris. So we spent a few weeks together and then I moved back to LA and There was this thing of like, how do we like what do we do who you know, yeah, what is this relationship now? And I hadn't given her an answer But in my mind, I was like, there's no way I'm gonna keep this up So it's like I'm just gonna let the audience know cuz there's so many people asking what happened to Matt and this girl Yeah, and so I made a post on our Instagram. She like a photo of me and her I was like, hey guys, just so you know, we're not seeing each other anymore. We had a really great time Yeah, obviously, you know long distance etc. And then the next day I got a call from her being like, are you out of your mind? Like wait and you told her yeah hadn't told her no Mentioned it Thousands of random strangers you broke up with a girl by posting on Instagram To like hundreds of thousands. Yeah Yeah, but that goes to show you how like almost the disease how skewed yeah, just how we're so lost in this world Where you're so obsessed with what these strangers think about you that this person that you have a connection with Almost like goes to the side. It's like I mean, I I remember actually even waking up next to her in bed one morning And the first thing I was I waited an hour until we crossed six hundred thousand subscribers, you know on social blade You should be able to see it I don't know if you still can but like I would I was just watching these numbers go up and I'm like in Paris With this girl and I'm like when I look back on it and this goes back to me being a high school kid now Going forward like those are the moments where I want to be like put the phone away. Yeah be present This is living like yeah, you're not this you don't need to perform you don't need to please all these people Do you think some of it was you were afraid to to have those moments to actually live your life? Like you didn't know who you were. So if you did put the phone away in that moment It was terrifying Horrifying. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and I now having done more inner work. I can see why hmm. I avoided it There's a lot of scary shit to look at and the performance is it's nice because it's familiar. Yeah, you know I bet there's a lot of Classic Hollywood Celebrity stories that are similar to that There was a little bit of that with Will's story cuz will I mean even reading the book you guys wrote like there's But he's like going from music to TV show and then TV show to movies He became an absolute workaholic and he could always justify it because you know he's on a rocket ship and nobody wants to Stop the rocket ship when it's going. But yeah, a lot of it was just avoiding dealing with a lot of No family pain and childhood stuff and stuff with his dad Do you feel like for you you dealt with that stuff in your 20s? like you were saying not all of it, but I think again, I I Remember very early on when I was blogging I was probably three or four years in the blogging and I really I noticed that there were certain things in my personal life that Felt very good to write about and there were certain things in my personal life that felt really bad to write about like just internally Yeah, I mean I never had an experience as extreme as the one with that that girl but there were definitely some things in my personal life that I wrote and after it went up and I started getting comments and Responses on it. I was like, wow, this feels terrible. Like I kind of wish I didn't write this I don't want to know what people think about because you hadn't fully processed it or it was too personal too personal too sensitive I don't remember exactly when but it was a few years in I just kind of came to this realization because it really started making Me miserable because I I felt the same thing early I think most creators feel this at some point early in their career of this fine trying to find that boundary of What what what parts of me am I going to share and what parts of me? Am I gonna keep for myself and I just noticed that it kept making me feel bad writing about certain things certain topics and then also sometimes people in your personal life read it and Send you an angry text message or an angry phone call and like wait, what the fuck like I didn't know you felt this way Yeah, but the views yeah, but the views I'm killing it So yeah, I just hit a point where I realized I'm like, you know, I think For my own sanity I need to get really clear with myself like what I'm willing to share and what I'm not and I think it was kind of I kind of made the decision that to really try to keep things to Stuff in my past so like I'm pretty comfortable sharing any sort of problem. I've had in the past any problem I'm having now in the moment That I don't share that because the act of sharing it complicates it, right So it's like I have a problem with my dad which I did for many years"}
