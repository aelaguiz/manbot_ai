These are three tactics that you can use to overcome any fear in your life. Exposure therapy is the progressive desensitization to anything that you might be afraid of. So if you're afraid of heights, don't start at the top of the Eiffel Tower, start at the second floor balcony. If you're afraid of snakes, don't just lay in a puddle of snakes, start with one snake. Tactic number two, treat your emotions as suggestions. We all tend to assume that our emotions are facts. When a snake crawls over your chest, your body suggests to you, this is dangerous. But just because it suggests that to you doesn't mean you have to actually take it seriously. And then the third tactic is to develop an identity of someone who embraces fear. When we think of ourselves as people who are incapable of handling fear, we create a self-fulfilling prophecy. You think to yourself, oh, I'm the type of person who can't handle fear, and so you don't handle it. Instead, adopt an identity of somebody who confronts fear head on. That way, any fear that you run into in your life is just yet another opportunity to prove to yourself who you are."}
