I decided to set up my friend Garrett to find out. What? There are two ways to approach your relationships. Performance and authenticity. People like Garrett who give way too many fucks, they tend to see the relationships in terms of performance. They see it as saying and doing the right things to make a person like them. Did you play any sports? I personally train people at the gym. I actually have a friend that does something similar to that. It's about halfway through the dates that he started to realize he didn't have to make every girl like him. This is what happens when you start approaching relationships with authenticity. By being unapologetic in who you are and living with the results, by realizing that you don't have to wait around for people to choose you, you can also choose them. So for the last few dates, he defaulted to authenticity, deciding who he was and what he liked and simply not caring what happened next. The results speak for themselves. I'll have to grab your number then. Okay, I'd like that."}
