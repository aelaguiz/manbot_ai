So I sat down with him to ask. So what the fuck, dude? You're giving up the dream, huh? That is a great question. At the time, I had no idea that I was more introverted than I thought. You know, our channel was Yes Theory, saying yes to things. So we were just constantly saying yes, even when we didn't necessarily feel like it. Like I would show up and be this guy that would put on the show. And I kind of prided myself on that. I think that was a huge part of what made it exhausting. I don't know if you've experienced this with YouTube, but it's so different from being an actor. When you're an actor, there's this kind of understanding that you're playing a role. This isn't actually you. When people grow up in family structures without strong boundaries in certain areas, they grow up in interrelationships without strong boundaries in those same areas. Your relationship was this massive relationship with a fan base of five or 10 million people, but it's the same core issue. It never felt appropriate for you to say, no, I need me time. When you're young and as an adult, you don't feel okay saying it."}
