Like, why having more options makes you feel less free? People have a tendency to confuse freedom with optionality. They think freedom is simply having more choices. But in many ways, more choices paralyzes us and actually traps us. Because the more choices you have, the more afraid you're going to be to commit to any specific one. And so choosing something to commit to, whether it's a person, a career, a place to live, a friend group, it liberates you in a really unexpected or counterintuitive way. Because it removes that paralyzing abundance of options. It removes the burden of choosing. It frees you from the pressures of having."}
