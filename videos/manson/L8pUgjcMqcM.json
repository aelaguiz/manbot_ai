I had a flight abroad from the UK to Germany to see a friend I haven't seen in ages. I knew my dad wouldn't allow me to go, so I didn't tell him. Wanted to leave while he slept. I left a note saying, gone to Germany for a week. Work has confirmed time off. Don't worry about it. It was an early flight, so I left a day early and crashed at a friend's place closer to the airport. Found out that he was arrested as he woke up, found my note, raced to the airport, kicked up such a ruckus that he was taken into custody before I had even left. Upon returning, I found that he had found my car at my friend's place and smashed the window. Now he's comparing me to my mother who left him two decades ago. I've decided to move out. Probably a good decision. You know, sometimes people who live among abuse, it's kind of like fish in water. They don't realize they're living among it until they leave. This is just straight up abusive. And yeah, you should be around this person as little as possible, despite the fact."}
