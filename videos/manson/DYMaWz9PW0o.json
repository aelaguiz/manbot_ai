Well, here's something to consider the next time you start pointing the finger. Pretty much every form of growth or improvement in your life is gonna stem from your ability to take responsibility for your current circumstances. People often retort to that with a bunch of arguments of like, well, here are the XYZ terrible things that have happened in my life and none of them are my fault. So what do you say to that, Mr. Smarty Pants? And my answer is always like, doesn't really matter. Like, doesn't matter if you got hit by a car, doesn't matter if a fucking meteor fell out of the sky and destroyed your house. You're still responsible for reacting to the consequences of that. You're still responsible for deciding what that means in your life. You're still responsible for waking up the next day and deciding what you're gonna do about it. And the more time you spend pointing your finger and blaming everything else in the universe for all of your issues and problems, the more you're just giving your personal power and agency away to all those things that you're pointing at."}
