You know, I grew up middle of the country, very religious environment. I was not a religious guy. I was very nerdy and music was kind of the thing that saved me. It's like, well, if I had a guitar in my hands, people were nice to me. So music very much became my identity. And so I started to believe that it's like, this is who I am. This is what I'm going to do. I went from being the best and most talented musician at a pretty small high school to literally just one of 30 dudes with a guitar and a ponytail. It took about a year for the story to unravel enough for me to actually have the thought of like, maybe I don't want to be a musician. And when I finally did allow myself to have that thought, it felt very catastrophic, like a death almost. I was like the music guy. And then suddenly you stop and think, well, maybe I'm not the music guy. And then the next thought is, well, then who the fuck am I? When I finally left music school, it was like a thousand pounds came off my shoulders. And so I guess that's a really good example of when letting your narrative be wrong."}
