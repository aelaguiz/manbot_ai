There's a lot of personal empowerment involved in that, and I think it's good to support that. But there's a blurry line that happens somewhere, where if you get enough people and enough encouragement and enough support, you start socially validating and handing out status to people based on victimhood, and you get kind of this victimhood Olympics effect. That's unhealthy, and I think that's actually counterproductive. It starts to encourage people to invent suffering where there wasn't any before. It starts encouraging people to sit down and think, well, what were all the horrible things that happened in my childhood, and how can I talk about that to people? It creates an incentive for people to create the suffering-based narratives, to create the second arrow when it had been dislodged long ago in the past."}
