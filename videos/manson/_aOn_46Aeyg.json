My girlfriend completed a visual novel game that she worked on for almost two years. Despite my disinterest in the genre, she pleaded for me to play it. Reluctantly, I gave it a 15 minute try and appreciated her effort. However, I grew tired of reading and decided to stop. She wanted me to finish the game and share my thoughts, but I made it clear that I had no plans to do so. I felt she was being childish, trying to coerce me into doing something that I didn't want to do. I still support her and recognize that she's talented. Am I the asshole? Okay, so this comes up in a lot of relationships. You don't need to be into everything that your partner is into, but you do need to be into your partner. And so I understand that you don't necessarily enjoy these types of games, but ideally you enjoy her and her talent enough that you would want to spend a little bit more than 15 minutes on something she spent two fucking years on. So I don't think the issue is that you don't necessarily like the game. This is a very, very important thing to her. And you basically gave it a half ass 15 minutes and say."}
