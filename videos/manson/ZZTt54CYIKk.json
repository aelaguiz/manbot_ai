That belief helped him become the biggest rapper in the world. But that same self-belief that helped him early in his career hurt him later in his career. \n\nIn this episode, I unpack the flaws with the human mind when it comes to our beliefs. We use Kanye as an example to support ideas that while a belief can be useful at certain points in our lives, it will unlikely remain useful for the entirety of our lives.\n\nThis episode will have you questioning everything you ever thought mattered. Check it out on my channel.\n\n#MarkManson #Beliefs #Mindset #Psychology #DerekSivers #kanyewest #kanye", "published_at": "2023-11-30T15:15:04Z", "channel_id": "UC0TnW9acNxqeojxXDMbohcA", "channel_title": "Mark Manson", "tags": ["mark manson", "markmanson", "paradox", "kanye west", "confidence", "over-confidence", "over-confident", "too confident", "narcissism", "kanye"], "category_id": "27", "live_broadcast_content": "none", "duration": 59.0, "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false", "view_count": 795827, "like_count": 62817, "comment_count": 567, "channel_info": {"title": "Mark Manson", "description": "3x #1 NY Times Bestselling Author.

You should make a documentary about me. And the guy was like, okay. And sure enough, Kanye became the biggest rapper in the world. What's so remarkable about the footage is that you see this mindset. It seems to be inherent in Kanye's mind the entire time. Like there's footage of him walking into record labels with his demo disc and saying, I'm gonna be the biggest rapper in the world. And they just flat out laugh in his face. And he's like, oh, okay, you're gonna regret this. And he like turns around and walks out. He's not deterred, he's not upset. But what's interesting is the documentary then kind of jumps to present day and you see how that mentality is hurting him. Kanye just has this overwhelming confidence and belief. He's very untethered to reality at this point. He's been way too rich. Everybody's kissing his ass. He's got yes men everywhere. You can just see how it's getting him into trouble. It's almost like a fascinating case study of the benefits and perils of overconfidence."}
