We think that working twice as long will produce twice the results. That caring twice as much about a relationship will make everyone feel twice as loved. That yelling your point twice as loud will make you twice as right. But this is almost never true. Most activities exist on a diminishing returns curve. That would mean that the more you experience something, the less rewarding it becomes. The classic example is money. The difference between earning 20,000 and 40,000 is huge and life-changing. But the difference between 120,000 and 140,000 means your car has slightly nicer seat heaters. Diminishing returns curves apply to sex, dating, travel, food, basically anything novel or exciting. But this is why the best things in life tend to be boring. That's because they get better the more you do them. You know, things like health, career, or your family."}
