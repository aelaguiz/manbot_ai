Now the spotlight effect says that we all tend to assume that people are paying far more attention to us than they actually are. Think back to the last time you got a terrible haircut. Chances are you walked around all day assuming that everybody was staring at that fucking tragedy of a mop on your head. But the reality was most people didn't notice. And if they noticed, they sure didn't care. But the problem is the idea by itself is not sufficient. You have to get out into the world and experience it. You have to get out and challenge your own spotlight effect. Now, does that mean you have to put on a chicken suit, walk down the Venice boardwalk? No, of course not. But it does mean you have to do something. You have to challenge yourself. You have to put yourself in the public and into uncomfortable situations and prove to yourself conclusively that nobody's paying attention and nobody cares."}
