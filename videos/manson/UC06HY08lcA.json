Ever think that your life would be so much easier if you could just change your mind about a couple things? Yeah, me too. That's why I reached out to my old friend Derek Simmers, the one person I know who is better at questioning beliefs and changing his mind than just about anyone I know. He's also a bonafide grandmaster at not giving a fuck. A former circus performer and professional musician, Derek went on to found several companies, including CD Baby, which he later sold for $22 million. He then gave most of that money away to charity. He is one of the most viewed TED Talks of all time, has written four books, and is currently working on his fifth, titled Useful Not True. In this episode, we're going to dig into the most fundamental aspects of our psychology and happiness, our beliefs. We talk about how to change them, which ones should be changed and which ones maybe shouldn't, and the wide-ranging effects that these beliefs have throughout our lives. I believe that you're going to get a lot out of this episode. See what I did there? I was like, it's an episode about beliefs, and I said, whatever. Just roll the intro. 20 million books sold, zero fucks given. It's the subtle art of not giving a fuck podcast with your host, Mark Manson. First of all, we've been friends for a long time, and so it's cool to just have my inaugural guest be a friend who I've known forever. Also, if I were to make a top 10 list of people I know who probably give the fewest fucks, you are up there, sir. You are definitely on that list. You're pretty high on that list, I have to say. Always surprise me every time we hang out, and we never fail to have super interesting conversations. So I'm overjoyed to have you here. Thank you so much for coming on and being my guinea pig. I get that reference. So I want to talk to you. You are currently working on a book at the moment about beliefs and this concept of useful, not true. I noticed that it was underneath all of my life philosophies, but never explicitly stated that I don't believe anything I say. I don't believe anything anyone else says. I think that everything I say is questionable. Maybe it's right, maybe it's wrong. I think it's right when I say it, but we don't know ourselves that well. We think we remember things in the past perfectly, but we don't. We think we know why we're doing things in life, but we don't really know. And we can talk about some colorful stories around that if you want. But then because I believe the same thing about everybody else, I believe that we live in a mostly social world, unless you're a scientist. And so I just operate through life this way, choosing what beliefs serve me best. Meaning like there are any particular ways you could look at things. One way just makes you sad and just makes you want to just stay in bed. Another way makes you jump up out of your chair and take action. Well then I'll choose the way that makes me jump out of my chair. I'll choose the perspective that makes me take action. If it's a useful belief, I'll choose it. Because nothing's true anyway. I mean, except for some physical realities, almost nothing in our social world is true. Meaning absolutely, necessarily, inarguably, objectively, repeatedly true. So I'm just choosing the beliefs that serve me best. It's funny, actually, years and years ago, I wrote an article similar to this idea. And so many people challenged me on it that I got kind of sick of defending myself. And I think I eventually just took it out of my archive, because I'm like, geez, people, all right. It seems to me that there's some sort of practical limit to this concept, right? So it's like, if I'm a couch potato, and I'm feeling lazy and depressed all the time, if I can manage to convince myself that I'm actually a successful person who's just had a bad string of luck, that's a very useful thing to believe. And that will probably help me get off the couch. So I'm with you there. I do think there's probably an extreme on the other end of the spectrum where, like, let's say I'm a super ambitious corporate guy, working a nine to five, and I'm climbing the corporate ladder. I start doing some pretty shitty things to people, because I justify to myself that I'm superior, and I'm more brilliant, and I'm better, and I deserve to be at the top. Now that is useful. But it's kind of a shitty thing to believe. It will definitely harm my relationships. It possibly might harm my happiness, depending on, I guess, how psychopathic I am. But there is a territory with this concept that I start to get uneasy or unsure of, like, where the limitations or boundaries of it are. Where would you say those limitations are, in your opinion? I'll tell you, but then I also want to ask your advice. Because the thing that you just said has been the most common response. No offense. When I tell people that I'm writing this book, basically, in short, their question is, but what about psychopaths? Yes. What about a politician believing they won the election that they actually lost? It's useful, not true, for them to believe that they won? What about people that believe that their enemy on the other side of the fighting line is subhuman and should just all be exterminated like cockroaches? It's useful, but not true. So far, the best thing I can offer is to say that I'm sharing a tool, like a driving instructor can teach you to drive a car, but doesn't have to keep addressing everybody. Now remember, kids, don't drive into a crowd of people. Don't use this to murder. Does everybody teaching everything have to say, now remember, don't use this for murder? Don't be evil. But I feel that I should address this early. So so far, all I've got is basically a paragraph in the intro before the book begins saying, just to be clear, this is a book about you being the person you want to be. This is not a book about other people and whatever they do. So that's all I got so far. I like noting it as a tool. And there are a lot of things within psychology or self-help that are like that. Goal setting is a tool, right? Goal setting is ethically neutral. Hitler had goals. Stalin had goals. He was really good at accomplishing them too. Goals are very ethically neutral. And I think developing this mental skill of adopting beliefs around what's useful rather than true is also ethically neutral. You can see people who get very good at it and very bad. You can actually probably see that within a lot of the same people. When I was reading some of your excerpts that you've posted on your website last night and the person that came to my mind was Kanye West, have you seen the new documentary about him? No, I didn't even know there was one. It's called Genius. It's on Netflix. It is absolutely fascinating. I would absolutely check it out, potentially use him as an anecdote for your book. So basically what happened, when Kanye was like 17 or 18 years old and he was still unfamous, nobody knew who he was. He met this young filmmaker, a guy a few years older than him, and the filmmaker met him and Kanye was immediately like, I'm going to be the biggest rapper in the world. You should make a documentary about me. And the guy was like, okay, sure. And so he started following him around with a little camcorder. This is back in like 2000, 1999, 2000, following around with a camcorder for like three or four years. And sure enough, Kanye became the biggest rapper in the world. And he like caught the entire rise. What's so remarkable about the footage is that you see this mindset. It seems to be inherent in Kanye's mind the entire time. Like there's footage of him walking into record labels and radio stations with his demo disc, walking up to people and saying, I'm going to be the biggest rapper in the world. And they just flat out laugh in his face. And he's like, oh, okay, yeah, you don't get it. All right. You're going to regret this. And he like turns around and walks out. He's not deterred. He's not upset. He's not angry. Like, it's just this very fundamental belief. But what's interesting is the documentary then kind of jumps to present day. Like the filmmaker comes back into his life maybe five years ago, and you see how that mentality is hurting him. Ah, brilliant. And how Kanye just has this overwhelming confidence and belief. He's very untethered to reality at this point. He's been way too famous, way too rich. Everybody's kissing his ass. He's got yes men everywhere. Nobody's looking out for his interests. And he just has this overwhelming confidence to do this or record that. You can just see how it's getting him into trouble. It's almost like a fascinating case study of the benefits and perils of overconfidence, I would say. So my second point, aside from I really like the tool thing, I think it only works if you're willing to change those beliefs. If you have a belief that's useful, but you're completely inflexible about it, it might help you for a little while, but at some point it's going to fuck you. And so if you're not flexible in your beliefs and willing to check in on them and switch them out for new ones, then maybe that's kind of where that threshold is where it's like it goes from helpful to unhelpful. Oh, good stuff here. The example you used at the beginning of the boss, I'd say that his beliefs were not useful because the difference between shallow happy and deep happy, right? So shallow happy is eating the ice cream now. Deep happy is being proud of yourself for not eating the ice cream. That's just a dumb example, but on a shallow level. We're all about the ice cream metaphors here. The boss might be short term happy like, yeah, I'm just stomping on everybody, getting what I want. Look at me. I'm crushing it. But that's funny that you said that word, like I imagine like stomping on, like crushing everything around you, right? Crushing it. Crushing everybody. Right. Right. You could say like, this isn't working for you. You're yeah, you're crushing everybody around you. You're being bad. You're making the world a worse place. And ultimately you're making your future worse. You might be on a short term selfish gain right now, but you're on a long term downward path. Right. Quick aside. When people say, what do you, when you say useful, not true. What do you mean? Useful? Yes. Uh, because yeah, somebody could use it for short term evil and say, no, no, to me useful. And I do define it at the beginning by saying useful means generally being who you want to be. It's something that helps you go where you want to go, ultimately be who you want to be. It's long term, not short term. So back to the point of changing the beliefs. I'm so glad you brought this up. Did you ever read the book? I think it was Marshall Goldsmith that wrote, uh, what got you here won't get you there. Never read it. Great title though. The book is written for CEOs, you know, built their way up to the top. So now they are the boss of people. And what he's saying is this guy's been like a corporate consultant for years. And he's saying from all that I've observed, the skills that it took you to get from say childhood or obscurity to being the boss of a big company were a different set of skills that you're going to need now as the boss. So you might've made it more about you on your way up. But once you're at the top, you need to make it about the people around you. A tiny example, he said, don't add two cents. That's the metaphor we use, especially like American slang. When somebody gives you an idea and they're like, you know, Hey Mark, I'm thinking about doing this podcast. What do you think? And you say, well, here's my two cents, you know, make sure that you do it outside. Right. And go, Oh, okay. Do it outside. Huh? So now you've added your two cents. But when people are your employees, what you've just done is you've made that idea less theirs because you added your two cents and because you're the boss, you're not just some random dude at a bar. They kind of have to include your two cents. Even if you just said, Oh, make that shade of blue a little bit darker. Well, guess what? They're going to feel less ownership in that because you added your damn two cents. So that was one example where he says, on your way up, you had a certain set of skills, but what got you here won't get you there. And that's the only book I've ever heard talk about this. It makes sense though, that useful is a moving target, right? It's like a useful belief for Kanye when nobody knows who he is, is no longer useful when he's the biggest rapper in the world. What's useful when you're starting out at a company is no longer, not always useful when you're the CEO. I do think a lot of this revolves around really just how you define useful. I think the ethical component of like, it can't be win-lose, it needs to be win-win or win-win-win. That strikes me as important. Useful needs to cast a larger net than just simply like what makes Mark feel like a badass today. And it's funny because I've always felt like I dipped my toe in the water on this concept and I never jumped in, but I always felt like it's a deep pool. You can go very, very deep on this and there's got to be so much value down there. I don't know, I was busy writing articles with fuck in the title to explore. Fucking useful or fucking true? Yeah, useful or fucking true. Wait, you know what? I just, this is a, I'm going to change the subject a bit, but I've just kind of been kind of like waiting to get this out. So you did this really sweet intro to me when you first hit record and said hello and we jumped right into things. I have to give a tiny reverse intro. You do not listen to all of these podcasts that I do when I'm the guest on other people's podcasts. I'm sure you haven't heard them all, but at least two or three times people have asked, which writers do you admire? Who are your favorite writers? And I go, actually, I really only got one. And I say, Mark Manson, just hands down, I think is the best writer out there right now because I really dig into the craft writing. There are other, many, many other people that have wonderful ideas and God damn, you have to scratch through a bunch of fucking verbiage and examples to get those little ideas right there. They're like, you know, the people with the metal detectors going through a bunch of stuff looking for a few good coins on the beach. I read these 300 page books. that have maybe, you know, 50 good sentences in them, but it's worth it to me. I read the book for those 50 good sentences. When I keep my notes, when I'm reading somebody else's book, what I do is I like to paraphrase. I put things, I take their ideas and I want to save those ideas, but I put them into better words because fuck their words, all the damn words they use. I do this all the time and I've done this with hundreds of books, basically every book that you can see on my website that I've ever read. If you go to my, S-I-V-E.R-S is my website and right there, you'll see the Derek's book list. So the last almost 400 books I've read that since I started taking notes in 2007 and every time when I would get to one of your books and I'd say, ooh, that's a really good idea. I'd say, okay, I'm going to put this into better words and you were the only writer out of the 400 something books I've read, the only person where I cannot change a single word to improve it. So there you go, hands down, you are my favorite writer. Your belief, Derek, may not be true, but it is certainly useful. At least it's quite useful for me, so thank you very much. Nice deflection. Naturally, I got on your website last night for the first time in a while and probably read through a dozen of your more recent musings and there are so many times where I read your stuff and I'm like, I have had similar thoughts to that. You really have this, see, now we're just kissing each other's ass, but you have this incredible ability to capture a deeply complex concept in a very simple metaphor or story. Like, it's very elegant. It's almost like Aesop's fables. Like, that's kind of what it feels like to read a Derek Sivers post. You know, it's 400 words, a very simple story about you and your kid or something you did in the music industry and then it just lands and you're like, oh, I never thought about it that way. So, you're not too shabby yourself. Speaking of your posts though, I wanted to bring something up because you did have a post that was, I believe it's an excerpt of the new book that I really liked and I think it's a really interesting concept to explore a little bit. You were talking about your kid and some of his friends, they were like playing a game, they were building pillow forts and all this stuff and basically they were playing make-believe. You used this as an example of how something could be untrue but useful. Yeah. And you kind of used it as a jumping off point. It was one of those thoughts, it was like an initial domino that just spread and all these like further dominoes. I ended up, I looked up a famous Picasso quote. He said, art is not truth, art is a lie that gives us truth. Whoa! And this got me thinking about the role of art in our lives. Oh, fuck, that's, sorry, sorry, sorry. Hold on, I'm not hearing your further sentences. I'm still digesting that one. Damn, that's good. So it just got me thinking about the role of fantasy, metaphor, art, fiction. I think we've all experienced this to some extent. Like if you think about like your favorite films, some of your favorite films in many ways, they feel more, I don't wanna say true, but like more important or significant than a lot of the events in your own life. Like when a movie like really hits you hard, it just got me thinking about like the role of art in human culture. It is almost an organizing force for true sentiments that we don't necessarily have, like they're intangible. We can't point to them in reality. So anyway, I just wanna throw that out there. I wonder what the connection is with dreams and I'll just preface to say, I know nothing about what I'm about to say. Always love that on a podcast. I have no idea what I'm talking about, but. Dreams, don't they say that there's a theory that the reason we dream is to process unprocessed ideas. So in a way, I think what you're saying is that movies can do that in a way too, that it's tapping into something that maybe there's some feeling of loss that we haven't addressed in our past or something. And it's sitting there kind of unprocessed within us as we're going to work and playing a PlayStation and looking at a phone or whatever. And that a movie can go like, and vibrate that and kind of like bring it up and tap into this thing that's in you that needs to be addressed. Well, if you think about it, the best art is very therapeutic. I feel like it's somewhere around this. It's a piece of fiction. It's not true. It's a bunch of people on stage playing make-believe, but depending on where you are in your life and the specific abstract concepts and ideas that are being played with, it can impact you in a way that feels way more true than say like sitting and talking to your parents or calling your ex-girlfriend or whatever. Yeah. Is it that it also helps point out something in us that we wouldn't have noticed by ourselves? Probably. It's situations and contexts that are basically impossible within our own lives, right? Or they're just exaggerated to such an extreme extent. Like you think about like the Godfather, it's about a mafia family and everybody fucking gets shot and dies. But at its core, it's a movie about family, the struggle of balancing commitment and love for your family versus your worldly goals and aspirations. I think everybody can relate to that on a certain level. So there's like something in the exaggeration of it that makes it feel extremely impactful and true. Ooh, and maybe they have to do that kind of exaggeration to call our attention to this specific thing. They can't just present a big, well-rounded life and expect you to go pluck out the meaning out of it. You have to zoom all the way in. Yeah. And I think in a lot of ways that is kind of the role, the role of art. I believe in that same article, you mentioned the role of religion or it might've been in another interview. Yeah, no, that was that one. I mentioned it quickly at the end, yeah. Instead of arguing that your religion is true or arguing that someone else's religion is not true and using that as your argument, again, just put that aside. Nothing's true anyway. Just think of it as, is it useful or not? Is this religion useful to you? Is this religion useful to somebody else? Well, then that's a better thing to judge it by. A much better framework to judge it by. And I also think it's probably a much easier argument to make. I mean, if you really think about it, like the whole concept of objective truth is a pretty recent invention in terms of civilization. Like it's only, I mean, I guess if you go back to the Greeks but like in terms of like mainstream culture, we've only really given a shit about what's capital T true the last couple of hundred years. So in some ways it is a culture built on thousands of years of art and history and religion and is in many, many ways truer, I guess, than pulling out a measuring tape and saying, well, no, Jesus doesn't fit in that box. So not true. Because I was brought up with no religion at all. My parents didn't even mention it. I was 11 years old the first time I met somebody that believed in God. And I didn't know that anybody did. I thought it was like the Easter bunny. That was the environment I grew up in. So I'm coming at this totally naive. I'm learning about religion now at the age of 53. I read the Bible last year. Oh, wow. Yeah. Yeah, but now I'm actually open to religion for the first time. I'm open to learning more about it. Whereas I used to just shut my ears. I'm like, ah, I don't wanna hear about stupid religion. It wasn't until like three or so years ago, somebody told me that all of these things in the Bible were not meant to be taken literally, that they were written in a time before science, when this was the way to communicate an idea is to say this thing happened, which didn't necessarily mean that you were supposed to actually believe that this thing happened or whatever, but maybe you did, maybe you didn't, but that was moot. It was a way of communicating values and ideas. I went, oh, okay. Well, then if we're not saying it's objectively, absolutely, positively, inarguably true, well, then that's really interesting. And so that's what I was like, all right, now maybe I'm up for reading this famous book that's affected so much of Western civilization. So I read that book page to page, like read it carefully every single page. And have you? I mean, so I grew up quite religious. I grew up in Texas. So we have very opposite backgrounds in this regard. So yeah, I've read quite, I've gotten plenty of Jesus throughout my life. I'm afraid to ask- But did you get interpreted or did you, see, that's why I didn't wanna hear anybody else's spin on it. I just wanted to read the original canon. So first of all, no, I have not read the Bible as an adult. I went to, I grew up, my parents were very, very involved in a church and went to church multiple times a week, Bible study. And then I went to a private Christian high school. And so we took theology, we had chapel every day. Whoa, okay, I had no idea. I came out of it a little bit resentful and bitter. I decided, I think when I was probably 12 or 13 that I didn't believe any of it, that I was atheist. And I had a lot of resentment towards it for a while. And I remember back when kind of Sam Harris burst onto the scene, what was his book called? End of Faith. And Hitchens was doing his whole thing. I sympathized a lot with those positions. It's funny though, because as I've gotten older, I've mellowed a lot about it. And I've actually, I think you and I have kind of very, in a very roundabout manner arrived in kind of the same spot in that the older I get, the more I appreciate some of the usefulness of religion and the usefulness of religion as a social organizer and as a set of principles that, yeah, people don't always follow it, but at least they aspire to, and at least they try, and at least they come together regularly and build a community around those principles that are, by and large, very good principles. So I have a lot of respect for it now that I didn't have when I was younger, but I still don't believe in it. Well, that's a perfect segue into when I said that there were two surprises for me. So first I read the Bible and then watched a whole bunch of little videos around it. And I wrote about it somewhere on my blog. If you search the word Bible on my blog, you'll read my tale of how I read it. My thoughts and which translation you read makes a huge difference. And then I read a book called What Everyone Should Know About Islam, and that was really well-written. It was a really good book that addressed, in FAQ format, just the basics of like, here's a whole bunch of stuff about Islam that everybody seems to not understand. It was a great way to just do the whole thing in FAQ format. Then I read a book about Judaism. I think it was called Judaism for Dummies. So both Islam and Judaism made a lot of sense because they're like a top-to-bottom, here's how you should live your life. I'd say that they actually made more sense to me than Christianity because both of them were like a complete how-to-live manual. This is what you should eat. This is how you should dress. This is how you should marry. This is how you should live your life. This is what you should do every day. This is how to live. I was in college when 9-11 happened. And so I took a number of courses. I took one course on Islam. I took a course on Middle Eastern history. And what struck me about Islam, there's an elegance and a beauty to the completeness of it. It really helped me understand, I think, a lot of the mentalities of that culture because in Christianity, there's kind of a lot of gaps. There's like, they really care about these things in this lane, but if you're over here, they have nothing to say about it. Whereas Islam is like, there's kind of like a complete set. It was interesting because there's something very satisfying about that. I think there's just an innate thing in human nature that we want stability and predictability. We want easily available answers. Once I learned about all that, I understood the appeal, I think, and I sympathized a lot with that appeal. Let me bring this back. And this actually loosely, my next question actually kind of loosely relates to religion, and that is changing a belief. It's one of those things that it's easy to talk about, but particularly for like deep-seated beliefs or beliefs that we've held for a long time, or maybe even beliefs that we don't have a ton of awareness around or understand why we believe something. It can often be very difficult to dislodge an unuseful belief. Do you believe that any belief can be changed or dislodged? And two, if so, what do you think are like the most effective means of doing that? I journal a lot. I journal for hours and hours and hours, not every single day, but especially if I'm going through something or trying to reframe a belief or trying to process something that's really upsetting me, whether it's a breakup or a major decision in life. I just spend so many hours in my journal very deliberately walking through the different ways I could think of this thing, whether it's in the past or the future. And after I've been in brainstorming mode for, what's another way I could think about it? Okay, that one's really good. But what's another? I make myself keep going, right? It's like the brainstorming 101. Don't stop just because you had a good idea. Keep going, keep looking at other perspectives. So I'll keep looking at a bunch of different ways to think about something. And at a certain point, one feels like, ooh, ooh, this works. I'll find a belief that I can just tell like, ooh, this hits me, like this works for me. This is what I needed to believe. This is a good perspective I can use. And then I'll just start writing. It's like self-talk. If this, then what, right? So if this belief, then what are the consequences of this belief? I just, I drown myself in that, or I just immerse myself. I bathe myself in this way of thinking until I step away from my keyboard like, yeah, all right, this is it. This is my new way of thinking about it. And then I try to go make something happen with that belief right away, whether it's just making a phone call to initiate something, signing up for something, walking out the door and doing something, talking to somebody, whatever it is that is the next step in that belief."}
