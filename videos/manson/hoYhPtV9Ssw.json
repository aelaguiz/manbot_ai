So why are we so miserable? This is a great question to get into the nuts and bolts of compromise. What is compromise? What's a good compromise? What's a bad compromise? We all hear that we should be compromising in our relationships and compromising with our partners, but like, what the fuck does that actually mean? Compromise isn't about making everyone happy. In fact, compromise means making sure nobody is miserable. Obviously you don't want to compromise on everything. Ideally, you guys should overlap in your values and interest enough that you're only having to compromise occasionally on things and that you can live with those compromises. Compromising to mitigate misery, I actually think it ends up generating more happiness for both people because happy relationships make you happy. And that's kind of what I discovered with my wife. I gave up 10 to 20% of my happiness, my lifestyle happiness, but I gained an extra 50% relationship happiness. And relationship happiness is like a very powerful happiness. So that ended up being a fucking fantastic deal."}
