Even after we finish school. Even after we get a job. Even after we\u2019re making money. Between ages 18 and 25, I changed career aspirations more often than I changed my underwear. And even after I had a business, it took another four years to clearly define what I wanted for my life.\n\nChances are you\u2019re like me and have no clue what you want to do. It\u2019s a struggle almost every adult goes through. \u201cWhat do I want to do with my life?\u201d \u201cWhat am I passionate about?\u201d \u201cWhat do I not suck at?\u201d I often receive emails from people in their 40s and 50s who still have no clue what they want to do with themselves.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: what we value changes over time, our priorities shift and we redirect our paths. So a better question to ask is: if this was the last day of your life, would you feel good about what you\u2019re doing? For more questions and ideas on finding your life purpose, watch this video.

I was like, what? And he said, I'm going to do art for video games. I was like, sweet dude, happy for you, can't wait, whatever. I figured it was just some dumb shit teenagers said to each other, you know, like everything else we said to each other. Today, he's an artist in the video game industry and everything he's done for the last 20 plus years has led him to that goal. Now, I know what you're thinking, it's the same thing I'm thinking, fuck that guy. Who figures that out? Like especially when you're like 15 and not even sober. I mean, I changed my career plans like seven different times between the ages of 18 and 25. I didn't even know I wanted to write a book until I was 27. But some people are just blessed knowing what they want to do with their life. It just kind of falls into their lap. But for the rest of us, it's a difficult process. And this video is going to help you ask the questions that you need to figure that out. There's a very popular question in the self-help world, which is that of life purpose. What is my life purpose? How do I find my life purpose? You know, as if it's sitting under a fucking rock out there or something. If you want to know your life purpose, I'll tell you right now. It's to subscribe and like this fucking video. I mean, there's literally nothing you're going to find in this life that is more important than subscribing to this channel and liking this video. I promise. Don't, don't, just don't even look. I never liked the term life purpose. It's all like, it sounds all cosmic and theological, you know, like there's this universal purpose that each one of us is born for and we have to like go on a cosmic journey to find it. It just feels very self-important and bullshitty. I think a better way to think about this question is how can I use my time in a way that feels important because ultimately that's what we're asking. You know, when young people email me asking, what should I do with my life? Or middle-aged people are like, I haven't found my purpose. Why am I in this life? Really what everybody's saying is, how do I use my time well? How do I use my time in a way that I don't feel like an asshole afterwards? And it's an important question. It's not easy to answer. And I think generally the best advice you find on this topic sees it in a similar way. There's a great commencement speech that used to get shared a lot by Steve Jobs, where he said that every morning he would stand in the mirror and ask himself, if this was the last day of my life, would I feel good about what I'm doing today? And he said that if he ever answered the question, no, too many days in a row, he would sit down and have a big think. And I think ultimately that's kind of the most useful way to approach this is like, if you were going to die in a week or a month or whatever, would you change anything? Would you see anything that you're doing differently? Would it change your mind about your priorities at all? It's a tough question, but it's probably one that we should be asking. I think ultimately, if you're trying to figure out what the hell to do with yourself, you want to find an intersection of three important things. First one, find something that you enjoy doing. We've all got a passion, even if it's masturbating to rabbit porn, hey man, if that's your thing, go for it. Number two, find something you're good at or have a particular talent for. Now, sometimes I get people who are like, I'm not good at anything. And it's like, well, maybe you haven't tried enough stuff yet. Maybe you're trying the wrong things. Maybe you're just doing a bunch of shit other people told you to do, and you're not actually exploring your interest in your talents genuinely. Number three, find something that other people value that, you know, they might like pay you for at some point. Now find where those three things overlap. Generally, we all got stuff that we like doing, but you know, other people don't really appreciate it, i.e. rabbit porn. Generally, we've all found something we're good at, but to get to the point where you're able to be paid for something, it takes a certain amount of time and dedication and expertise. The problem is some people have a really hard time answering these questions. And you know, for many years, it kind of dumbfounded me. It's like, how do you not know what you like to do? That's so weird. Generally, people who've struggled with this question, it is because they've always prioritized things that other people want and not themselves. If everything you do is to keep your parents happy, then you don't actually know what you're good at because you didn't try anything else. So there's a weird connection here of the classic life purpose crisis and, you know, just run-of-the-mill codependence. People who have not actively lived for themselves or lived out their own interests have trouble answering these questions. And so then they interpret it as, well, my life purpose must be out there somewhere. Maybe somebody else will tell me where it is. No, we don't fucking know, okay? I don't know. Nobody can tell you. You got to go find it yourself, man. And yeah, it's hard. It's an arduous process. It involves fucking up a lot of times. But each step of the way, you get a little bit closer. One metaphor you can use is imagine seeing something on the horizon. You know, you see it on the horizon, you start walking towards it, but you walk a few miles and you realize like, oh shit, it's actually over there. So you adjust course, start walking towards the horizon. A few miles later, you realize, oh, it's actually over here. Adjust course. What I'm saying is very, very few people get it right the first time. And I think it's just this unrealistic expectation that we often have that we should. The other thing that's important to keep in mind is that ultimately this question, it's a pretty privileged question. And I don't mean that I'm like, trust me, I'm not getting preachy and moralistic here. I'm just saying that if you grow up in the middle of nowhere with dirt floors and no electricity, you don't really think about your purpose. You just think about getting some fucking food and some fucking electricity. Generally this question of higher existential meaning in our lives, it's not even a question that we feel liberated to ask until things are gone well enough that we can ask it. I mean, let's put it this way, right? Like on the old school Haslow's my, Haslow's myarchy, Haslow's myarchy of needs, on the old Maslow's hierarchy of needs, I mean, you got to be safe and secure. You got to have some food, you got to have friends and people who actually give a shit about you. You need to be able to do something decently so you have self-esteem. Then you get to ask the self-actualization question. You don't go straight to the top of the pyramid, man. You fucking, you start at the bottom and you build up. So I guess my point is, is that if you're even in a position you get to ask this, like you're already ahead of like 95% of humanity. So, good fucking job, good for you. Now, is that supposed to make you feel better? No, because I mean, this question doesn't go away. You know what? That, that's the harsh truth of the day. The harsh truth of the day is that this life purpose question, it never gets solved. Even if you do find something that you're good at and other people value and you really enjoy doing, five, 10 years go by, things change. I mean, maybe you're not so into the fucking people in bunny costumes anymore. Maybe the video game industry completely changes and there are weird unions that fuck up your pay scheme and you decide that everything's derivative and you want to go live in Zimbabwe in farm beats. I mean, who knows, right? Like these things change. Like right now, I love writing books, but hey, five years from now, I might get sick of writing books. Maybe I'll want to write a novel. Maybe I'll have a kid and I'll just be like, fuck work. The point is, we don't know. Circumstances change. Life changes. The world changes. Basically that essential question of what feels like a valuable use of my time, well, what we consider valuable changes as time goes on. Therefore, the question of purpose and what to do with your life changes as well. So the key is not answering the question. The key is to consistently ask the question and I encourage you to ask the proper questions today. So leave a comment saying what you find to be a valuable use of time and be sure to like and subscribe because, I mean, that's my purpose in life, subscribing to my own channel. Until next time, Manson out."}
