Young men don't have an opportunity to prove themselves, uh, like they had in the past. Yeah. Just call a duty fortnight. Uh, that's what you went to. You went into the service. Yeah. You know, like we have to, and I, we just interviewed somebody and I can't remember who it was at the moment, but we discussed this idea that if young men don't have that challenge in front of them, that coming of age moment, that, that task that loses themselves so they can find themselves, they will create it in their lives. And it may be too destructive for them to get out of. Yes. I also believe that you have to lose yourself to find yourself. And there's many ways of losing yourself. You can lose yourself to drugs. You can lose yourself to gambling. You can lose yourself like David Goggin and to running, uh, into physical challenges. But as men, we have to let go and lose ourselves in order to put it all back together. Once we're back together, we're bigger, better, better, smarter, faster than ever. But that has to happen. And you can choose what that is. Um, there's young men who lose themselves in gaming. Yeah. Right. And they have to crawl out of, uh, out of that. Luckily I'm Gen X I'm 49. So video games were always lame for me. They, they, they still, they sucked back then. And I was well into playing music and chasing girls around. And I was like, I'm out. There's other things that I want to be doing, but I can't understand what it is like to lose yourself in this virtual world that these, not only are they lost in or congregating in and they're, they're creating lives inside of that. Yeah. Um, and I've, I've also have dealt with some clients who once they realize that they are spending all their time building up a character inside a game, they're like, well, wait a minute. If I spent as much time building myself up in the world, as much as I'm building myself up into this game, what would I be able to achieve in real life? What am I doing? Yeah. Like it is those moments of clarity right there. What's like, what am I doing? Yeah. Yeah. I think it's a function of a participation trophy age combined with the fact that I think highly productive men, there are moments in our lives where the world tells us no. And I think this, by the way, this is for, you see sometimes where a person, uh, uh, a guy, a kid, 18 years old, he gets drafted in the first round of the NBA and no one ever told him no. And they don't adjust very well. Sometimes you'll see that for a, a, a very young Kobe Bryant or a Kyrie Irving who thinks the earth is flat. You see this like lack of, because there was no accountability. You'll also see it often with very attractive women, where it's one of these things where it's like, uh, like I, again, a lot of women out there are going to get really angry. When I say this, no man you're talking to believes in astrology. He just believes he needs to say this to have sexual intercourse with you. And if you break up, ask him afterwards, if I'm telling the truth, and you're going to be shocked, we don't believe in that shit. That is something because we understand as men, I didn't get rich because of fate. I got rich because I worked harder than the other guy. Right? So I, as a man, I can choose like every day I'm like, Hey man, I want to buy that Bugatti. I don't have enough money for it. The world told me, no, I want to date that girl. She doesn't, she's not interested in you. The world told me, no, I want to live. I want to deadlift 500 pounds. I can't do that. The world told me no, the world as for men, we are constantly being told no. And that's shaping us almost like, uh, you know, chiseling us into the man we become. And every day that weight of the world telling us no is the weight we use to get stronger every day. The world is constantly telling us no. What happens though, it was with the participation trophy era or the, what do you call helicopter parents is that you don't have the world consistently telling, you know, I was just as valuable for me to get kicked in the head in martial arts or me to get blown up on a trap play when I played fucking defensive tackle in football than it was for me to win. And that's the thing that, that I think is a loss for a lot of people. And for some people who are, are putting it, and again, I'm not knocking you, but if you're incredibly good looking man or woman, incredibly wealthy man or woman, and you just kind of have that thing, or you just, you know, happen to be a fantastic actor or a musician and the rest of your life, you don't have to worry, dude, if you're, if you're, you know, I don't know anything about, um, Kurt Cobain, but like if Kurt Cobain didn't have game, he's still going to get women because he's Kurt Cobain. You know what I'm saying? So there's these other parts of your life for me, I've got to work on every single part of this. And for a lot of people, they didn't have to do that. And then when the phone came out, one of the things that happened, or the, uh, the app, the Facebook app on the iPhone and no eight, when that happens now, what happens is the face down after school, cause you were talking shit or because you were talking to somebody's girl that stops happening. Now I just talk shit about you on a burner Twitter account. Now that stops happening. And now we've gone for further into this whole thing. I didn't have this fall down moment where I had to get back up. I'm not accomplishing goals like my ancestors did. And my criticisms of other people are done in a cowardly, passive aggressive way. This is what I'm learning. And so what do I do? I create copes like video games or message boards or something like this. And I, my cope was a bench press. My cope was boxing. My cope was whatever it was, you know, whatever physical activity was out there, or my cope was to go out to a club and I was not going to leave here until I'm getting this number, this, until I approached this number of women, I'm not leaving. Those were my copes. And that that's the part of \", \"segments\": [{\"id\": 0, \"seek\": 0, \"start\": 0.0, \"end\": 9.119999885559082, \"text\": \" as men, we have to let go and lose ourselves in order to put it all back together.
