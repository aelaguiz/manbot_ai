Yep. What do you think is gonna make you happy dude? It's accomplishing shit That's what's gonna do it and it's just so hard when I have these guys Listen, nobody's a bigger fan of eckhart toll than me. I love being in the present moment I understand that but i'm in the present moment because I just hit three three pointers in your fucking face That's why i'm in the present moment exactly and a lot of people don't understand you need to accomplish Things that's what i'm you talk about being in a sales call is being like your meditation. That's exactly like for me It's the same thing when i'm on stage or when i'm playing basketball There's a couple of things or when i'm doing my calls my my group calls. I'm in a meditation I go to a place. I don't even I don't i'm not even thinking i'm just doing you're totally present Just like maverick the key thing about the the power of now and that type of stuff versus taking action Is it's it's not it's not one of the other right you could take a bunch of action and get the result you want Whether that's in relationships health your business, whatever and be miserable, right because of the expectation associated with that So I think the the spirituality and being in the present is really teaching you to be You know be content with where you're at or not not fall into this. Uh, be accepting. It's it's acceptance Yes acceptance at the present moment. It's a radical acceptance, but that's not going to get you You know, you're not going to sit there and be really present and all of a sudden like a hot chick's gonna fall from Right and that and that's unfortunately there was that fucking i'm sorry I hate to say this because I know it's gonna make a lot of people mad That parasite of a movie called the secret that just ruined so many people and it turned all these lazy people into Entrepreneurs by believing they're going to manifest shit The world is not going to the universe is not going to manifest anything for you You are going to go make things happen. I I don't show my clients the secret I show my clients videos of christian nicole and beau jackson Those guys did not wait for the hole to open they knocked the motherfucker out who was in front of them and made the hole Open that's why I love showing those videos, right? And so that that's the thing and the other thing before we were talking about what didn't work, right? So my sales guys, they've gone through my program, right? the other thing is there's two kind of a Opposing things the one I said is the you know, the breath movement and the and the trauma release guys again I'm, not saying that's not helpful for some people suffering from ptsd. You need that i'm not saying don't do that Yeah, what i'm saying is then then you wake up and your bank account's not any bigger and your drink your drink goes on Yeah, there's no action at all. And then the other group is the creepy pickup guys And the problem is it's not just I don't even call I don't even have to say this is why this didn't work They all know it didn't work. It was a fucking unmitigated disaster for them in their lives Once they get to me my sales guy is like listen This is what michael did for me and it completely changed my life So the exact thing that you're talking about is exactly what goes on with us, man We're just like I did this this and this and then it's like here's 50 photos of my entire life changing And here's the huge influence i'm dating and it's just like it's very much night and day And the key too is it's helpful for them For them to understand why it didn't work so they know it didn't work But they didn't do they know why right and that is an education thing so when you talk about like It's funny like a lot of sales calls are framed as like, you know These breakthrough calls or whatever they're supposed to be super valuable and a lot of times that could be kind of bullshit But here is a way you can make your sales call valuable. Yeah is by educating them like dude I know you tried that here's why it didn't work and then the people that are successful on the inside Here's what they do and why it does work and you can explain the psychological principles behind that which also Kind of alleviates the responsibility from them, right or alleviates, you know You probably heard in sales copy you want to tell people it's not their fault, right? So it's not your fault, but it is your responsibility. Yeah, and so it allows them to think okay There's nothing wrong with me. I was just doing the wrong thing. It's funny. You say pre-selection that's in the top three things We talk about it well And the thing is too like people I guarantee who aren't working with you who reach out to you They start to realize they probably they want to believe that is the reason because they didn't have that they don't succeed, right? And so that's the one thing you can leverage and then they can cling on to that and they're like, that's why the other thing I would say too is if your sales team is doing really good just based on what you told me I would wager the most important thing that they have Is conviction because they're your clients and you've changed your life. They have their personal story They are the living proof right and now they're making money helping you. It's like there's so much conviction Like for instance, we have one of our best sales people fundamentally um is not like the most tactical best fundamental salesperson Like ever right? But this person is amazingly good like scary good and it's because of their conviction Not necessarily the fundamentals if I had to take somebody who's fundamentally sound versus somebody who has conviction I would take conviction Every single step of the way because if you think about somebody who has that conviction and like let's say this has changed their life So much. Yeah, are they going to be more or less likely to challenge the person at the end of the call? Are they more and less likely to say? Hey, I kind of had these doubts too about x y and z But here's what I found. So that is very key now. It's not a either or right? It's it's both Yeah, right So you want to be fundamentally sound and you want to have the conviction? Well, the conviction would create the tonality that you were talking about before exactly because it's because it's almost like method acting right? It's like I I feel I don't i'm not acting like a person who's angry I'm, actually angry while i'm talking to you during the scene and that creates the tonality and it makes it more believable I think that's the same thing with the conviction. You're exactly right I've heard these guys on the call and like yo, man that thing you just said that's not gonna be a problem I promise you that it's not gonna be he starts like that's not gonna be the issue that you're gonna have. Yeah, right Um, so yeah, that that's exactly \", \"segments\": [{\"id\": 0, \"seek\": 0, \"start\": 0.0, \"end\": 6.0, \"text\": \" Did the reward centers in their brain fire when they killed the meat and brought it home and had everyone\", \"tokens\": [50364, 2589, 264, 7782, 10898, 294, 641, 3567, 2610, 562, 436, 4652, 264, 4615, 293, 3038, 309, 1280, 293, 632, 1518, 50664], \"temperature\": 0.0, \"avg_logprob\": -0.2283283770084381, \"compression_ratio\": 1.8024691343307495, \"no_speech_prob\": 0.05491693317890167}, {\"id\": 1, \"seek\": 0, \"start\": 6.639999866485596, \"end\": 12.720000267028809, \"text\": \" See them as higher status.
