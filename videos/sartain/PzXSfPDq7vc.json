It's about problem solving. You made a video not too long ago. I do appreciate you doing these videos. Like you're putting your makeup on, you're like in your hotel room and you start talking about like after a workout, you start talking about women need to improve. Yes. Okay. The two things you talked about was STDs. I want to ask you a couple of things, the stats that you like to quote, which are the ones that you think are the most over, like crazy ones. One that I remember 40% of women who have had an abortion have had a second abortion, have had at least two. And then you talked about the thing with STDs. What are specifically some of these things that you were talking about where women need to improve? Oh, well, the first one is obesity. I just, I think we can all get like, there's so many men's improvements, right? So like, and when you look at the men's improvement stuff, like fresh and fit, whoever, it's like actual improvement, like get in shape and you, right? You have your whole thing, like throw these charity events. This is how you can do that. Women's improvement. It's so weird. I like study this stuff. It's like journaling, confidence. I'm like, what? And therapy. We can talk about that too. And I am in, I am in a psychology program currently, sort of. I'm half dropped out. I don't know if I'll finish. It was, I just wanted an easy program. I'm just gonna, yeah. I don't actually care about it, but these women are crazy. They're therapists. Do not, I'm telling you, these therapists will make you more crazy. And I say this, I'm in school with these therapists, ladies don't do it. Crazy ladies now. Yeah. So I was saying like women need to improve because it's like, like men are actually like their self-improvement is about improving, but ours isn't. It's about problem solving. Yeah. And so, you know, it's not about feeling good. It's about problem solving. Good self-improvement. Yeah. So it's like, maybe don't sleep with the entire football team. You know, maybe we could start there. I know you can't undo what's, you know, happened before, but we could, you know, maybe not sleep with the entire football team. Right. And then on top of that, it's like, we're so overweight. It's like 70, 60, 70% of us are overweight. So maybe 42% of women are obese, like extremely obese. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm like, maybe we could start by getting in shape. That's number one. Maybe not sleeping with everybody. Maybe. Yeah. If you think that I'm shaming you because you're overweight, that's fine. You can have that opinion. It's not a valid opinion, but you can have it. What you can't have the opinion is then me saying you being weighing less would not make you more objectively attractive. Yeah. That's when we're getting into just like Lulu, like fucking lunacy. Like, of course you want to know what the number one aphrodisiac is for your man. Be in shape. You know, the best dating coaches for a woman is a personal trainer. It is as shallow as you may think that is. I will just show you study after study of what men find attractive. And there's a difference. This is a big one. And Rollo is the one who taught me this. There's a difference between personal self-worth and a sexual market value for men, personal self-worth and sexual market value. Often it's the same. They're often the same. Yeah. My competency, my self-worth and my, my stature, and even my speaking voice make me higher value to other men and higher value to women, women's personal self-worth. Like Madam Curie, who discovered radium, ended up dying of cancer. Right. That's an incredible thing that she did, though, like discovered like radioactive decay. That's fucking amazing. But that didn't make her husband's penis harder because she discovered radium. In fact, he may have died also from radiation poisoning. I don't know. I don't know the answer. I just started looking up some numbers and I was, it said one in three women have had an STD at some point in their life. Okay. So to be fair, I think that may include a UTIs. I think that number may include UTIs. I think that may be because that one in three is a crazy number, but yeah, I may be wrong, but I know I've seen somewhere where a urinary tract infection, meaning biome from their outside of their vagina that goes into their vagina causes a tract infection because they don't piss after they, they have sex. This was from the CDC. So, you know, I don't know. This is just what the, from what I understand a UTI would be considered. I could be wrong. Somebody wants to correct me. Okay. And it was like one in three women have had an abortion. Okay. Right. And then it was like 90% of women have been on birth control at some point in their life for now you're telling me 43% of us are overweight. It was either 60 to 70% of us are, Oh wait, I'm sorry. 43% will be 60 to 70% overweight or obese. Um, and then when it comes to loyalty, you know, we're the ones leaving marriages. Um, we leave 70 to 80% of the time, 90% if we're college educated, it's like, how can we look at this as a whole and just say, well, you know, we're doing a good job, ladies. It's like, maybe we should improve a bit. And so we, we have the wife's school that we did. A lot of people think I'm teaching it. I'm really tired of this narrative. Everyone's like Pearl's teaching wife's school. I'm not teaching it. I bring in like wives or women that have been in like long term relationships for a long time and they just teach like basic skills on, you know, being a wife. So like I learned how to cook for a family of four or one episode. I learned how to knead bread another episode. Not that that's, you know, you got to do that, but I just, it was fun. Yeah. It's amazing. I'm actually interested in seeing what some of the stuff you put on there. Yeah. Yeah. I did. Um, the first, what did I do the first episode? Um, I'm going to, I'm going to get a kid for a day. Okay. Wow. That's a good one. Yeah. Watch some children. Yeah. So it's just going through like skills that, you know, you can learn. \", \"segments\": [{\"id\": 0, \"seek\": 0, \"start\": 0.0, \"end\": 4.239999771118164, \"text\": \" Like men are actually like their self-improvement is about improving, but ours isn't.\", \"tokens\": [50364, 1743, 1706, 366, 767, 411, 641, 2698, 12, 332, 46955, 518, 307, 466, 11470, 11, 457, 11896, 1943, 380, 13, 50576], \"temperature\": 0.0, \"avg_logprob\": -0.258586585521698, \"compression_ratio\": 1.7799999713897705, \"no_speech_prob\": 0.0017273228149861097}, {\"id\": 1, \"seek\": 0, \"start\": 4.239999771118164, \"end\": 7.599999904632568, \"text\": \" It's about problem solving.
