And we did this while being pretty capital efficient, which means we didn't spend $10,000 to get a customer for $2,000, which is pretty common in the SaaS world when there's infinite money running around. So we did it efficiently. And then he went on to scale. He scaled it up past $5 million and past $10 million. And then he ended up selling the company to Broadridge, which is a cool case study. It took a few more years after, but I got him off the ground. With that case study, I got a good reputation of growing software businesses. So another company reached out to me. Copilot Advisor was selling to Financial Advisors, similar market to Kevin's Advisor Stream. And he's like, hey, whatever you did at Advisor Stream, do it over here. So I went into his company, built a sales funnel, built a sales team. We learned that the product needed to change because it wasn't addressing the most urgent problem of the financial advisor. So we got our engineering hats on. We changed up the product. I literally went to the whiteboard with Henry, the CEO, changed up the product, relaunched it, scaled it up to a million annual recurring revenue in 10 months. So it was a little shorter. But this was from a standing start. And he went on to scale it up further. He started selling it to the enterprise. The company was valued at like $75 million. And with those two case studies, I started doing consulting. And so I packaged my process up, called Sales Process IO, how I scaled businesses efficiently. And then I sold it to 2,000 software companies. So over the last three years, I've been selling the process to software companies. A lot of these big guys from like Y Combinator, Greylock, Sequoia, some of these big accelerators were using my sales process and methods to get traction. And yeah, I create a lot of value. A lot of my companies have big exits. And yeah, it's just been going. I've just been doing my thing. So Nick, a lot of the people that are watching my show, they're unfamiliar with several of the terms that you use. I was listening to a lot of the stuff that you were doing yesterday. A SaaS company is software as primary service. What does that mean again? Software as a service. It's like a license. Okay. So this could be e-commerce. This could be online coaching. Anything that's not necessarily just a physical product. That's right. The things you really want to sell, coaching is good because it's so efficient. You're selling logins. And it's delivered over the internet, which is pretty instant. So coaching, training, software, financial services like loans, mortgages, that stuff scales really nicely. Okay. So that's it. The second thing you just went over about hiring a sales team. In a sales team, because I have a ton of questions. I'm a former US military officer. We talk about team building. Obviously, it's one of the main things we go over. In your situation, when you're building a sales team, a lot of these people are remote and you're giving them a script and the script is designed based on what the problems that the founder is trying to determine that need to be solved. Could you go into that a little bit? Yeah. So this is a misconception with the sales team stuff. So sales teams are really easy to build if you have an insanely good marketing engine. If you charge me with, say, you want to say, Nick, I want a sales team. I want a hundred people. I want to be Jordan Belfort and have a massive sales team. Well, the first thing you're going to need is a really, you need a marketing flywheel, which means you can spend X amount on some scalable channel, like paid traffic, or in Jordan Belfort's case, because everyone likes that movie, right? His marketing channel was the cold calling channel. So the success behind his sales team was the cold calling channel that he was able to leverage. We're talking about before the movie. After the movie, the movie actually is part of his. Oh yeah. Yeah. This is in the early nineties. When we talk about Jordan Belfort, there's two Jordan Belforts. There's pre-felony Jordan Belfort, who's taken quaaludes and is back cold calling guys for pink slips. And then there's a pink sheet. Sorry. And then there's post Jordan Belfort, who's got a podcast and is married and it's clean. It's not been on drugs and he was doing Tai Lopez. And this guy is like incredibly famous because, you know, Leonardo DiCaprio did an incredible, probably one of the most memorable depictions of any human being in the last hundred years is in that movie. So, so yes, for sure that we have to, cause a lot of people get confused. Those are two different Jordans. I know Jordan too. I personally know him. Yeah. So, but the, the point is like, if you, like, if you want to build a big sales team, you need a marketing flywheel. You need a marketing trick. Right. So yeah. And Jordan's pre indictment or whatever you want to call it phase. It was, it was a cold calling that he was able to exploit that channel very well. Nowadays, well, it changes. There's Facebook ads had his heyday. Tai Lopez, you mentioned him earlier. He had his heyday with YouTube ads. He was actually one of the first buyers on YouTube. He bought up like tons of the inventory when there were hardly any advertisers. Right. There's a Google ads and there's now it's like influencer, influencer stuff. There's podcasts. That's a channel, right? So the point is you want to find before you build a sale, the sales team success as a function of the marketing channel. \", \"segments\": [{\"id\": 0, \"seek\": 0, \"start\": 0.0, \"end\": 5.199999809265137, \"text\": \" And we scaled it up to $1 million in annual recurring revenue in 12 months from a standing\", \"tokens\": [50364, 400, 321, 36039, 309, 493, 281, 1848, 16, 2459, 294, 9784, 32279, 9324, 294, 2272, 2493, 490, 257, 4877, 50624], \"temperature\": 0.0, \"avg_logprob\": -0.1962907910346985, \"compression_ratio\": 1.7340425252914429, \"no_speech_prob\": 0.014500653371214867}, {\"id\": 1, \"seek\": 0, \"start\": 5.199999809265137, \"end\": 10.720000267028809, \"text\": \" start.
