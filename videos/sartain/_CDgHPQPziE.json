I've ever met like Low body count fucking you're super beautiful in the gym all the time family women multiple master's degrees run their own company when I meet Their boyfriends 500 body count the guys who've like slept with like six like male strippers with fucking neck tattoos It's like former men like gigolos like and you're like what in the world's going on Why because we as men sometimes we start thinking because we judge women and I try not to but like when we judge women is This is a good girl. This is a bad girl. We start thinking our status is the same way This is good guy status. This is bad guy status Take a look at Machine Gun Kelly Before you start thinking of good guy status or bad like look at like when you see Kendall Jenner's at the one with Travis Barker, which ones with Travis Barker came over Kendall or Kylie Jenner for whatever It doesn't matter look at look at Travis Barker and then he's with these fine-ass women like anyone He wants stop thinking there's good guy status and bad guy status. There's just Status your president fucked a porn star and got elected. There's just Status. Yeah clout is also a word you could look on there for Instagram specifically But I have this belief system and I'd love to share it with you You're one of the few people I feel like I could have this conversation with so I did cold approach pickup I was obsessed for sure 2012 2015 skipping ahead. We were gonna talk about this for a while. Yeah Yeah, so I was super into this world and love the idea and once you get that superpower You actually go out and you're like, oh that cute girl You can go talk to her and get her number wait before I had I had to be friends with her friends and anyway So you do this thing and then I realized there was a ceiling for me and I would go into a bar and the cute Girls over there there was some discrepancy between How I perceive myself and I couldn't I would never walked up to them confidently and I realized I need to improve my status my Lifestyle my income wealth career how I perceive myself all this stuff. And so I I focused Specifically on gaining as much status as I could that was my pursuit Yeah, I believe personally that after guys go through that little sleep with everyone phase I think they should pursue status above all else because my opinion is status is like an umbrella money if You want like the clout game and access to women through clout like that's obviously becomes available But also who you who you meet for sure, dude I was working at a desk job two years ago And now I'm hanging out with people with like real clout like you like real clout. I don't have real clout Yeah, no you you hang out all like these successful people But anyway, my social circle now is with some of the people that are biggest on the platform this isn't within two years my Incomes gone up my connections my social circle the quality of people I hang out with all this has gone up Specifically because I have like some clout on YouTube and I would be curious to hear so let's look at this So let's like say status is the overall set and there's two subsets We'll take one of them is called clout and the other one is called competency Okay So a competency like you're famous because you're really good at what you do, right? Michael Jordan would be an example of having status because of a high level of Competency and with that comes clout as well. And then some people they don't have a high level of con I'm not saying that Logan Paul doesn't have a highlight Obviously, he's probably he's an incredible podcaster very very talented content creator But his clout is what where he gets his status from the Kardashians are always the best example They were the famous for being famous for being it's a great example famous for being famous I don't like to put Paris Hilton in this category because she makes you think she's way dumber than she is She's way smart. That woman is a billionaire. She has more Paris Hilton has more money than Kim Kardashian A lot of people don't realize it a hundred percent She does because she has that makeup line now Kylie may have more money than Paris Hilton now But Paris was a legit be billionaire without Conrad Hilton's money without her great-grandfather's money So that's that's one of the things that I thought was really interesting is that So you clout is just the thing where I'm famous for being famous, but competency was another thing Like for instance, dr. Buss is famous for being competent not for the for the clout I wanted this this program to be an expression of both you kind of call people out for just the clout with no Competency so they have status with clout with no competency when we talk about I need to improve myself Not everyone not every one of our clients or everyone who follows you or everyone who's in pickup or everyone who's in red pill or? Whatever they not all of them can become famous like bulls earring talks about fame brain You can't all become famous, but they can all become competent. They can all become the best engineer at their work They can all become the guy on social media who like just has the coolest photos travel photos of their of their small group of Friends in Des Moines, Iowa, Wichita, Kansas, they can all let increase a level of competency which gets them to a level of status That's that's possible. That's possible to do but like I don't think everyone can become famous, right? And that's interesting because you talked about you wanted to gain as much status as possible in order to get to that place And it is really interesting because like if I took you on stage at at Zouk I promise you somebody would recognize you more than me obviously you have half a million followers on YouTube and we would do that and you would see this this kind of thing where like You've done all this work for cold approach and like I'll take you on stage at Zouk We'll be behind dead mouse like five feet behind dead mouse and it'll be the most beautiful woman You've ever seen in your life and you do no work Then the reason why is the crazy part when I the first time I experienced this was at the Playboy mansion We're at the Playboy mansion and every I'm thinking these girls are gonna be mean as fuck to me because I'm nobody Because I'm in the Playboy mansion you got past the bubble They're so nice to me because they think I'm some TV producer or they think I'm some reality star or I'm an athlete Mystery the better. That's exactly that guy. Why is he here? Just why do I not know him? Just getting on stage at excess just getting all to the marquee skydeck during EDC Just getting in the Playboy mansion just getting into the VIP at the Maxim party just standing there Girls are just like who is this guy and they have to be nice to everyone yes, when I was in the cold approach game, and that was one of the most important parts of my life and That was one of the most important parts of my life and I learned a lot about dating women cold approach Communicating with women everything all the above but I found I was in Houston at this time and I was going out six nights a week Yeah in the typical like young 20s Yeah hardcore cold approach pickup and I found myself when I went to the bar the kind of the higher status bar when you have the Cute girls all four girls at a table. I didn't feel confident going and talking to them in this game I just felt like the game was rigged against me. It was almost like when you're investing I've seen something it is the bar rigged it against you the bar wants to shit on you for being poor Always remember that in a nightclub in Vegas There's a girl guy his job is to go find all the pretty girls in GA and pull them away from GA So that cold approach pickup artists have no shot with them Take them to a table with a guy with a 15k minimum make those girls drink all his alcohol So he keeps buying more bottles. That is the business model to shit on the low status people always remember that go ahead And I had this belief at the time where I saw it I was like, I don't believe I can attract these girls with any type of consistency. How do I gain and when I say status? I'm not some guy that's like out to clout chase. I'm not like trying to be famous for famous I just wanted I just want I saw what the benefit was with you when you have like a blue check on Instagram or you Have a social circle full of very successful people whether that's on Instagram or business people I just wanted to be around that group of people Anyway, what I really respect about you is you were always on the periphery of this RSD and I would see you and go Okay This guy is the only one that's hanging out with beautiful women all the other guys claim to be he's hanging with beautiful women That I could see the way they react to him You had this philosophy of being friends with them and I could clearly tell that they respected you and they looked at you as an Equal friend the women the women. Yeah. Yeah, and I was like, okay this guy seems to have it And then and at that point in my mind, I was like, I'm not playing the right game I want to play a game where girls have some type of perception of me up front whether we're at least on equal playing field I know this is like an uncomfortable topic for a lot of people and I know you know where I'm going Yeah is it's not an equal playing field Like if you walk up to a girl and she doesn't know who you are and she's really hot in a bar and she knows She's hot like good freaking luck. Yeah, you need you need like the best verbal game and I just didn't or or Kindly Myers is a wingman. That's another thing that helps and we've talked about that before anyway That's that's what I'm getting at is I wanted to live a life where I was around successful people and I had cute girls with me and going to the bar Not one of these alone pickup guys you and your buddy got in your $10, you know button-down t-shirt So here's the problem the the problem is the way pickup was taught was that cold approach was 100% of pickup and that there's a subset of pickup or a game called social circle. That's incorrect. I don't even call it game It's just being a normal human. That is social circle 2% of game is cold approach cold approach is inbounding the basketball Social circle is the entire game, right? This is the way it's taught though is because the metrics are so unattainable You feel good about yourself because you approached a woman now all of a sudden it's like well, I feel good about myself Therefore I'll just keep doing more and more cold approach and that and then here's the other thing if you ever seen me with a Successful interaction with a woman it is boring as shit. I Lean in a couple times. She laughs I don't touch her at all And we just leave together and go go eat like at a pizza place in the middle of the night It's so boring. If you filmed me, it would be like dude. This is the most boring shit ever But what do we see with the infield videos that guys were doing it was they were spinning around dancing monkey They would bark on them. They would lay on the ground They would spit. I was one of the big one of the guys I have been told over and over again was the greatest PUA of all time I'm sitting there hanging out with him and he's barking at this girl and I and I take him the side I'm like, hey, bro, these girls know me like we they'll leave with us right now. They like me, right? Don't have to bark at them Yeah, they'll go home with me But it was so funny because he couldn't transition from cold approach to like like the the social circle part of it \", \"segments\": [{\"id\": 0, \"seek\": 0, \"start\": 0.0, \"end\": 4.639999866485596, \"text\": \" Status is status is status when I meet girls who like the best girls.
