Today we're going to be talking about updates with, you know, probably the biggest news in this space is that Andrew Tate and Tristan Tate were released from a Romanian prison they had been in there for several months, and they came out. The only thing I can personally confirm is that Andrew has his phone because I texted him last night and he texted me back. I'm not going to say what we talked about. Obviously he's he's trying to prepare defense he's still you know there's charges pending. He's on house arrest he's not completely free. So, you know, if I was his attorney I'd tell him don't say shit to anybody on anything especially after what happened with, with the the previously what happened with you know some of the WhatsApp stuff that happened, and we have Rolo Rolo where you at man Rolo you on here right now, is your audio working. Let's see here let's put Rolo spotlight him. What's going on man. How about now. Again, beautiful. Okay, beautiful. Hey guys, hold on, hold on, let me let me say something real quick. Can I get everybody to put a one in the chat if you have read one of Rolo's books or you watch us on Access Vegas put a one in the chat real quick. Okay, awesome. So I need I need you guys I need you guys to help me with something ready, is everybody ready to help me all the guys in MOA put your put your thumb up like this but give me a thumbs up if you guys are in MOA right now ready. Can everybody and I need everyone to unmute themselves can everybody unmute themselves, I mean everybody on the call unmute themselves ready. Beautiful on the count of three. Happy birthday. Here we go guys. Hey listen, listen. This motherfucker doesn't look a year past 79 years old give him a big round of applause. That's incredible role unmute yourself sorry I had to mute everybody again here real quick, and everyone of you are going crazy. Yeah guys you okay so one thing I need you guys to be careful with your echo stand by. I guess some of you are echoing. What's going on here. I think it's us. All right, roll it. Can you hear me okay unmute yourself. Can you still hear me. Okay, I don't know where that echoes coming from somebody, somebody guys one of you guys is having some issue there. Anyway, we just lost all of our viewers on YouTube so thank you guys for that it's incredible. A bunch of people just joined on certified Tyrone comment all right beautiful. All right, Rolo, do you know anything about this, so we just saw that he was released from prison yesterday what what have you, what have you seen or heard or whatever. Okay, well I texted him just a little bit before we came on just to see if you get any answer back from maybe I'll get if I get an answer back from him like later on in the, in the show today I'll definitely relate them relay the message here but I just, I just back home now just, you know, kind of just chit chat kind of thing because I, I know that they took their cell phones back as far back as like I think January or something like that so I got kind of got to be a little careful about that because I don't know about you but I've got like quite the chat log with Andrew from as far back as when I was doing the Dr. Phil show and even I go I go back about two years with going back and forth but there's nothing there's nothing incriminating it's just the problem is like it's a function of privacy, you know, it's a function of right. Hey, one more thing. Hey, can we say happy birthday to Liddy Ward guys. Happy birthday Liddy. I actually have my other Babes in Toyland host Julia here with me and Jules. Hey, what's going on. Love it. Love it. Oh my gosh, Michael. Liddy, Liddy, Liddy, Liddy, Liddy come back on in the second hour and let's talk a little bit more okay we'll talk a little bit more happy birthday Liddy love you baby. All right, awesome. Nice, nice. Okay, cool. Is there a. The other thing is, so we have access Vegas coming up next week and there's a lot of great stuff that we want to talk about just a lot of the socio economic reactions those are the things that have been going I don't know if you've noticed, but anytime we go over like again, the percentage of the population that's six foot three or the percentage of population that makes over $170,000 a year in the United States. These are things that a lot of people don't grasp and I think that it's really interesting. Also, I don't know if you saw this Chris Williamson roller, or I'm sorry when, when David bus went on Joe Rogan he mentioned he's writing a book with Chris Williamson Yeah, I did. Yeah, I'd be interested to know what it's all about to did you did they mentioned any like topics or anything that there's. Yeah, so I've been back and forth with Dr. Bus and he says he's writing a book, it's on prestige. That's what his next book is on specifically on prestige so that should be a really interesting. I think he's probably going to look at it because remember Dr. Bus got into evolutionary psychology through homicide, and then kind of morphed pivoted over to mating. So it might be interesting if he gets into just basically a discussion of status in general. And so that that that's pretty awesome. I also got in contact with Ashley mirrors the sociologist from Boston University, I went to Harvard last week and obviously I saw Jason Strauss, David Grutman and Noah Tepperberg, those are the three most powerful men in nightlife on the planet. Jason and Noah obviously owned our hocus on group MSG bought talk to our group and then they bought hocus on with that money. They're now spinning them off and selling them they might be selling them to MGM we don't know yet. And then Dave Grutman is the king of Miami he owns pretty much every large venue and probably about 25 restaurants in Miami. And so now towel and David Grutman are coming together to to start their own venture in Los Angeles to doing one in Los Angeles and they're doing one in, in Miami so that's going to be pretty awesome. Some really great stuff and then of course one of my clients is a professor at Harvard, he doesn't want me to say his name for obvious reasons because he doesn't want to get canceled. But he I went to one of his economics and sociology classes that was pretty fucking awesome. So shout out to Tristan for setting that up that was that was pretty great. Also, we have a couple other announcements so just real quick as far as I'm concerned, we have Robert Kiyosaki coming up, I talked to him right after my birthday show today so we got Robert Kiyosaki on deck. We have and he wants to come on access Vegas, and we're gonna do with 12 girls. Oh yeah, but 12 girls on, you know, he. Okay, want is one thing, whether his handlers will allow him to do that that's an entirely different thing I wouldn't. Oh yeah I wouldn't. However, stay the fuck away from Rollo and Michael. He does want to do an interview with us, I would love to get him on with Miguel and Charlie from Cultivate Crypto slash dollar cost crypto. And then, and then us as well if we can just do like a one on one I would think it would be fantastic to do that and he'll talk about red pill topics with us whether we're on there with the girls or not I want, I would really love to get him on with the girls. So we got Kiyosaki coming up we also have Gary the numbers guy Gary Ginsburg is coming up for going to be doing a, I guess he's been he's been talking disrespectful bro he's been on Twitter talking. All I gotta say, all I gotta say is, well, you know, bring it, I've got the chest timer and we're going to have a real formal debate. So for those, for those of you don't know I have a background in astronomy and one of the things that I really have a problem with is when people conflate astronomy and astrology, that is very bothersome to me. One of the issues that we have especially in the United States is that we have a very scientifically illiterate culture, and part of the reason why is because you can ask people about their sun signs, and what you know whatever their zodiac sign is, but if you ask them the four fundamental forces in the universe strong nuclear force weak nuclear force electromagnetism and gravity, they have no concept of who they are, or who Johannes Kepler is or James Clerk Maxwell, or Albert Einstein they don't understand what the law of attraction is they know exactly where it is. Like I said before, when they were talking about a war against the United States no country militarily can stand up to the United States, the war against the United States is the secret, the war against the United States is the five love languages, the war against the United States is 50 shades of gray, the war of love like it's idiocracy like that, that's the war against the United States. Exactly stuff like that is that's the war against the United States where we take things that are not based in science, or not have any evidence evidentiary basis whatsoever. And then we push those those agendas for I have opinions when I have opinions I express them as opinions. When I spread something to be what I believe to be evidence based like for instance, the concept of the idea 80% of men on social media or dating are deemed to be unattractive. That's not my opinion. Right, that's something that we see empirically and we can also see the data for a set. It's funny as people need again this is like maybe something we should talk about at some point. When we're talking about data, you have to understand the difference between a qualitative study and a quantitative study, you just you just made that distinction quantitative studies are numbers that's hard data that's like here's what it is this is what we can see factually right there in front of us qualitative studies qualitative data is what people are relating as a self report, what what people feel like is the truth or what we've taken a sample size and this is what people have said that's quality over quantity, and too many people do not know the distinction between those two types of studies. Yeah, I mean, but I mean the main, the main issue is rollo is that there's a study, and but I don't feel like that studies real, therefore my feelings outweigh objective fact, generally as generally as average men, we grow up and we if we want to buy a Lamborghini tells us no. If we talk, we go up and talk to a girl who's very pretty and she's not interested in us. She tells us know the world consistently tells average men, no, no, no. And so because of that, we were sort of chiseled and shaped to understand to have a very clear understanding of what our actual value is. If you are a kid who was drafted into the NBA at 18 and everyone knew you were going to be great like say LeBron James, his high school experience would be very different than say my high school experience, or you're a very attractive woman, then what's going to happen is a lot often, the world isn't going to tell you no and so what happens is there may be a sort of a misunderstanding. It's almost like the free agency thing you see this is sort of happening with Lamar Jackson, the situation with him, where he went into free agency he expected a certain amount of money, and it turns out that's not what the market wanted to give him, because there was a difference between what all of his people close to him were telling him he was worth and then what he actually ended up being worth this happened with a lot of running back to tight ends in the NFL. I feel like I should be driving a Lamborghini. Exactly. Exactly. That ought to happen. I feel like the universe. If I just put it out enough positive juju into the universe that Lamborghini will just show up in my driveway. That's not how it works. That's not that's what we can that's what we can hope for. So we have we got Gary the numbers guy Gary Ginsburg's coming in on the 26th 27th we have another access Vegas coming up. Let's make sure I'm gonna make sure Gary said he's going to destroy us. He's coming on there to talk about astrology and I'm sorry no no he's going to destroy you. Oh, he's going to destroy me. So just just going back to what I said, obviously astrology is complete and utter nonsense there's no truth to it whatsoever like not even 1% there is no what you could do is easily create a study where you look and see our Libras, on average, more outgoing, or, or, or Gemini is more, more likely to be dualistic minded or suffer from bipolar disorder, or Taurus is more likely to be assertive or have a higher testosterone levels, any correlation, but the thing is the correlation between the individual zodiac signs people born born during those periods, and the correlation between in between coral between zodiac signs is zero, it's probably zero, there have been dozens of studies to show that it's zero. It's fun. If you guys want to believe in zodiac signs, just to be part of a group that's totally fine, but just understand, it's not real. When I watched the WWF, or, you know, I don't think it's when I watched the Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin. It's fun to watch, but I know it's not real when I watched john wick for it's fun to watch it's entertaining, but I know it's not real. The problem with astrology is that you people think it's real, you can separate fantasy from reality. Right. I was also going to say are you familiar with and I hope I'm saying this right I'm getting this right but it's called the four effect. Do you know what the four effect is. Okay, so the four effect is this is that when you tell they did these, they've done studies qualitative and quantitative studies about astrology, I got into this because of MBTI which is basically astrology or astrology for the modern age and the work American workforce right now it's, it's supposed to be based on like union psychology and, and, and the big five personality traits when in fact it's really there's really not much to it's really basically junk science, but we still have like standardized on it. But the reason I started looking into this is because there's an effect it's called a four effect and what it is is like if you tell somebody that something positive about themselves, they're more likely to believe like Hocum, they're most more likely to believe astrology or bullshit whatever and you'll notice like whenever you go and you look at like MBTI which is like you know the personality types and stuff like that or enneagrams or astrology or anything that's kind of like superstitious but it has to do with the personality. Yeah, be, you'll notice that it never says like well you know you were born Capricorn and that means you're an asshole. Let's talk about, let's talk about MBTI that union personality testing that they gave me when I was at business school at UT Austin, that turns out to be Hocum as well there, there is no, there is nothing to that that's not real. Other than work with you. Other, other than other than the concept of introversion and extroversion which those things are true just like the majority of the population would be considered more extroverted than introverted. The reality of the situation is, and by the way that number is rising as far as introverts are concerned, but the, but the fact of the matter is that other than that, none of it's scientific and real the thinking feeling one is just crazy to me like that somebody would be like that. I promise you. You get those, you get those archetypes you're an INTJ or something like that. Yeah, the way that is none of those, none of those letters that correspond with whatever the archetypes are whatever that shit. None of them say, you're a dick. You're an asshole. There's something wrong with that because they're not they're not moralistic judgment. And so it's always something you can sort of align yourself with and it's like, Oh, take this, take this test to see if you're an artistic person right and it's like you take a few questions and at the end of it it says, you're an artistic soul you're like, yeah, your question. That's, that's correct. We're talking about Myers-Briggs. There is no science behind Myers-Briggs. Yes. Myers-Briggs is not, it's not proven to be, it's not spelled out. Personality traits are definitely something that have merit, but the MBTI Myers-Briggs. Yeah, it's not. It's not accurate. All right. So, hey, man, let me just finish just right quick. The 27th, we are going to be doing Access Vegas once again. I don't know who our guests are going to be, but we're also going to have Chrissy Mayer in that week. I don't know if you know her, but she is a, I guess, a conservative, like stand up comedian. And she's also going to be doing her show, which is called Friday Night Tights, which will be on Friday. They have a sort of an affiliate with Nerd Rodic, which is a really big channel. So they're going to be in Sticky Paws on that Friday on the 28th. I'm hoping to get her on our show or have some sort of interview with her somewhere between, like, say, the 25th and the 28th. So we're going to be doing something with Chrissy Mayer. She's also a friend with John Orlando as well, who's the owner of Sticky Paws. So we're going to be doing something with her during that period. And we have some other guests that are kind of unconfirmed just yet. So I don't want to give away that. I don't want to throw the baby out there with the bathwater just yet, but we do have a Chrissy Mayer confirmed as well. Awesome. Okay. So Rola, I've changed my mind. I want to go in a different order today. So we have a special guest and I listen, I got to give him, I got to give him some, some, I got to give him actually some credit for coming on here like this. We have primal status elevated. Obviously he's made several pieces on you and me. I found him to be pretty hilarious. Actually I just let you know, I show every one of your videos about me. I show to all of my clients immediately afterwards. 100 billion percent. Yeah. So anyway, go ahead. So did you, you said you had some questions for us. So, so go ahead. Not really. I didn't come here to have specific questions, but we had some altercations and I believe that people will understand much more as I speak, but someone or people from my comment section, which is still small, but still winning. Cause you know, I am here with even less than 200 followers, but what's going on is that people from my comment section were saying, Oh, uh, that you said Michael Sartain that you'll get on anybody's podcast. So get him on your live stream. And they were speaking all kinds of stuff. And me, I'm a yes man person, which means I say yes to everything I go for whatever is in life. And I thought I want to present a different perspective, which is this. I spent around 20 years as a student of, uh, status. I understood very clearly from the very beginning that there is something going on and I developed my ability or study or whatever it is to understand those pieces behind the matrix, which is what I'm doing right now. What is happening? You do think that there is a matrix? That's not exactly like that. This is a metaphor. Now we're speaking metaphor. Metaphor. Yeah. Okay. I agree. I agree that it's a metaphor. Yeah. And people were telling me, Oh my God, you're helping people unplug for the matrix or whatever. And I was telling them, look what many, let's say the gurus or, uh, anything like that, what they are doing is something very beautiful, which is creating a tribe. And, uh, let me, for example, speak about MOA men of action. If anybody's doing MOA, and in many ways, I say there was an AMA that people ask me anything and they asked me about you. And I said, what you're doing is superior, for example, to cold approach. But what I was telling them even deeper is that let's say you do everything like the events that you're speaking about, which I agree with, there is a higher level where people can come to your events and then leave. And they don't feel that they know you or anything like that. So what I am presenting is a framework and idea that I can share as well, which allows you to tell people I am building a tribe. I'm going to be that tribe leader. It's exciting. Come join my tribe. And for example, attacking you both, which was, uh, something that shows that you're worth attacking, which is a first, a sign of respect. If there is anything, it is something that is very good because it creates polarization. And therefore the people within your tribe who are maybes are forced to choose, do I protect my leader or am I maybe who is not, you know, good enough or worthy or interested enough to stay there and to join the new tribe? And thank you very much. Uh, the girl who was with you, she commented as well on my comment section and I told her, thank you for your comment. So just to share a bit more about me, I thank you. Everyone is joining here. Just keep going. No, there's, I actually have, I actually, before I even go Rolo, I have some clients, I have some guys that are in my way that I want to ask a primal, some questions. So just keep going whenever you're, whenever you're ready, man. Okay. You froze a little bit, but okay. I will explain it and give me time. You said you promised me, you said, Oh, I'll give you all the time to talk and to present and everything. So I'll do three things. The third thing is to talk about all our altercations, et cetera. And they weren't altercations. I get people make hit pieces about me every week. I don't feel they were hit pieces because I'll explain everything. But hold on before, before we go on, you did say that I was using something akin to Stockholm syndrome at some point on many. So that would be a hit. In fact, that's borderline defamation. There are several cases during your thing where you say that I'm manipulating people or someone is begging for their life. The problem is this, okay. We can, by the way, you're entitled, you're entitled to your opinion. That's fine. The problem is this, when I have like 500, you know, satisfied clients, one of the issues is at some point, where is the end of manipulation? And at what point are we actually just like learning a skillset? Because one of the problems is if anything, I'm not even exaggerating. If you guys want to go back, look, I think you made a video recently. Sorry. This is my new rescue. When you made a video where I literally put my hand up in the air, you stopped the video and you said, do you see what he's doing there? It was a 52 minute video and me and my friends were watching it. And we fell overlapping, dude, everything that you do that gets people to buy your product or join your tribe isn't manipulation, but that's, that's the issue. Because, and the other problem is when you say primal status elevated, one of the things you don't really provide. And by the way, just friendly piece of advice. One of the things you don't provide is any way for anyone to elevate their primal status at all, because what you're doing is very similar to what the fat kid in Brazil does, which by the way, I don't even know if you've done a video on him. He's the one you should be doing the videos on. I don't even know who he is at all. I'll text you later, but I'll text you later. Shock, shockingly, like if you were going to start a channel based on like doing hit pieces, like that, he was who I would start with. The problem is when you do that and then everyone goes to my Instagram and then they're like, wait a second. But the things he's saying, like, I remember one time I mentioned that I had 500 clients. And then you said, do you see what he's doing here? He's trying to get you to see and blah, blah, blah, and all this kind of stuff. And I was like, wait a second, but I really do have 500 clients at some point. But at some point, it's the truth. You see what I'm saying? Perfect. Perfect. Let's talk about it. Thank you for everything. And for giving me the time as well. I graciously appreciate that. So let me share, and then you will understand everything because I had an interview on someone else's channel and I explained, okay, there is a lot to explain. What I am saying is one of the definitions of manipulation is handling skillfully and therefore similar to Rollo, his archetype is the magician, but he's balancing it with the opposite archetype, which is the outlaw, which is like having a bad boy or a fuck boy professor or whatever it is, which keeps people interested. I am a magician. And therefore I need to, in many ways, balance it with the outlaw, which is the archetype of attacking and doing things like that. So in the titles and in the outside, I'm attacking, but I'm providing real value within that. In your specific videos, Michael Sartain, I did not, but more and more recently, and I can explain the whole framework. So I'll just very briefly explain what's going on. There are ingredients, let's say, within the human psychology that the more you put of them, the more you have a delicious meal of high status that that person is presenting. And these ingredients, if you think about the past, present, and the future, in the past, it's your odyssey story. And that story has narratives where it's, whether it's the bodhisattva, me personally, I'm Robin Hood. So I'm attacking the rich in order to give to the poor. You can be King Arthur. There are archetypes like that. And in the middle, you have imagined- Sorry to cut you off, but that's not scientific. There's no science behind that. I agree. And I was going to say, just give me a few minutes. I'm supposed to say something. Can I just ask one question before you- Please, Rollo, go. Where are you getting the archetypes from? Where is this from? Okay, I understand, but- I'm Robin Hood. No, that's a tricky- I'm the pirate. It's like the- It's not. That's not the same thing that I'm- Let me please finish, Rollo, and then after that- Where is it coming from, though? That's what I'm just- Because we're not speaking about the same thing, because your philosophy, which is I was going to speak about, that you need the philosophy- Yeah, but where do you get the names? That are the archetypes of power. Is it like Magician Professor? What is it, though? No, it's not KWML, which is King's Warrior. Which one is it, though? That's just what I want to know. It's like, what book is this from? It's not from a specific book. I'm trying to explain. This is metaphorical. I'm giving you a metaphor that explains reality in different ways. That just sounds familiar to me. That's just why I'm- Yeah, I'm using it because it's supposed to sound familiar. You know what I mean? It's supposed to so that people can get it. Otherwise, I'm not trying to- This is like your terminology, right? Yes, but I show how it is happening within whatever people are doing. So in many ways, what I'm speaking about, and I say, for you to be a living legend, or someone who becomes elite, or becomes similar to Michael Sartain, or to Rollo Tomasi, who is not even paying attention to me right now. I love that. So that's how you take away- No, I'm paying a lot of fucking attention. I love that. Okay, let's begin. I'm taking notes on you while I'm doing this. Let's go. Let's go. That should flatter you right there. Thank you. I'm flattered. I'm super flattered. Okay, the past, and the present, and the future, because within tribes, what is the difference between someone within your tribe and outside your tribe? You have seen their previous, like their past. You are with them in the present, and you have some kind of shared future together. And therefore, I divided it into past, present, and future. The most important one is the present. And what is the present? It is showing that you are a complete individual who has, within them, developed all, whatever you think about Carl Jung, or whoever- I'm going to have to give you about 20 more seconds, man. The guys in the chat are all completely lost about what you're talking about. So one of the things, man, as far as showing status, is I need to be able to say the thing quickly in two sentences. And I know, I remember the video, the thing with Anton, where you said that I was bullying him. I wasn't bullying him. If he went to a sponsor and had a 15-paragraph explanation for his business, the guy was going to kick him out in two sentences. Can you explain what you're talking about? Because, brother, I got to be honest with you. Sure. It doesn't feel like what you're saying. It doesn't feel like what you're saying. Well, feeling is not scientific. Right, but it's not scientific. Yeah, but all you did was- You were just saying earlier that- But now we're changing. You're making this a discussion. As you promised me when you sent the email, you said you can have as much time as you want. I will summarize it very well. Nowadays, we live in a time where we're not dealing with people in real life, and therefore, status can be manufactured because people are behind cameras. And there are ways that people manufacture status in order to be the leaders of tribes. And they build the tribe based on shared values, which is the philosophy, and outsiders. And as long as you have outsiders, there is enemies. And therefore, the warrior leader of the tribe is- Yeah, bro, you had two sentences. Again, let's do it again. Let's do it again. You're doing this- No, that's it. I'm done. No, no, no. Okay, cool. I know what you're doing right there. I stopped. I'm not, like, look in the chat, bro. They're literally saying, wrap it up. Like, everyone in the chat is saying this. Let's wrap it up. No one's manipulating you. We're done. We're done. Yes, we're finished. Beautiful. So everything is good. The issue is, man, like, so the thing with Rollo and I is we, I try to express as few opinions as possible, and base everything I'm saying on the works of Leah Cosmides, David Buss, Cindy Meston, Stephen Stewart-Williams, Joffrey Wilson, Stephen Pinker, and Gadsad. I'm glad to hear you say- In two sentences, in two sentences, I will answer that. If you look at the philosophy of science, and especially in physics, we live in a world where it's kind of proven that we live in a multiverse, and therefore anything scientific- It has not been proven. It has not been proven that we live in a multiverse. It's theorized as a multiverse, and therefore- That is theoretical physics. Everything is theorized in that way, because I believe in pragmatism, not specifically what you do, and therefore there is a clash of beliefs right there. If you divide whatever is happening by the infinite possibilities of the universe, it becomes so insignificant that you cannot draw any conclusion, and therefore even scientists know about science that it's a temporary placeholder for our understanding of reality until something better comes, and therefore that's my belief and my answer. I love it. And I know you're doing that. I love that. You're doing exactly what I said. Yeah, but you think, we're not manipulating anyone, bro. I said manipulation is to handle skillfully, and therefore I think you changed the whole debate. I was going to explain the whole theory, but let's play this game. It's not a game, bro. I'm a performance coach. No, no, here's the problem. I'm a performance coach. If I take guys who are not performing, and then they take my course, and then they're performing, I'm not manipulating. I'm persuading, number one. And number two, what I'm saying is the truth. It's almost like saying Isaac Newton manipulated everyone into thinking he was a genius when he wrote Principia. He didn't manipulate anyone. Okay, the thing that makes me not believe that 100% is the Pareto principle that in any population, only 20% of people will excel. So if you're saying 100% or 80% of my people are so amazing and get the results. My guys. Yes, your guys. Yes. It will make me not believe that that is true because it's probabilistically impossible. That's it. Within any population, you'll find that 20% of people are excellent, and most others are average to below average. So in results, that's what I mean specifically. And thank you. You're making it very exciting right now. And someone is raising his hand. Yes. Thank you. Okay, so here's what we're going to do. First off, I'm going to let... Tristan and Raj have been seriously... like waiting forever to talk to you. So I'm going to let them go first. You wrote comments on my thing. Yes, for sure. So I'm actually going to pull, I'm actually going to get off, OK? Now, I'm not going to get off. You guys can still hear me. Tristan, Raj, go ahead. What questions do you guys have for Primal? Ask me everything you want. OK, so when it comes to the Pareto principle, scientifically, that has to do with a representative random sample of the entire population. So when you took the Pareto principle and applied it to 500 people, it's actually invalidated. So the idea, now, whether it's by chance or not, I'll give you that. But whether it's by chance or not, it's not by definition only 20% of clients would succeed because that's not actually statistically viable at all. So, but here's my thing. Thank you. Thank you for that. I will answer it very quickly. What is the chance that 100% or 90% or whatever it is of any population to be... You said 100% or 90%. No one said that. You said that. Then is Michael Sartain saying a small percentage or less than 50% of my people get a material result? No, so what happens is there's results that they look for and these are different types of results. So, for instance, I have accountants that don't want to host a bikini competition and I have club promoters that don't want to host an accounting convention. The results are different and varied for each person. For some of them, it's a divorced guy who, for the first time in forever, he's finally able to just go out and meet people. Like the litmus for each individual person is different. But the problem is it's like you saying that 20% of people succeed. No, 20% of people who graduate from Harvard don't succeed. It's more than 20%. There are exceptions to what you're doing. And the reason why those exceptions exist is... For instance, I'll give you another example. Almost 100% of biologists believe in evolution and Darwin's theory of natural selection. It's not a 20% thing. In some cases, you have logarithmic returns where you have a large number of people who do it. What I teach, it's almost like one of these things. If I tell you to go to the gym and I tell you to diet and I tell you to lift a certain amount of weight and you do it every day, it's not 20% of you that will receive results. Unless you have some sort of like motor neuron disorder or you have some wasting disorder, you're going to gain muscle. So, in my program, because this is something you probably don't understand, in my program, in order to make it past the first step, you have to take action. That's why it's called the men of action course. Can I ask the question? 100%, let me just say something. I believe in chaos theory. What it means is action by definition, there will be a randomness within the results and some people will get results early, others will get it later, whatever it is, which can take years. And therefore, I don't believe in any thing that is not like role called praxeology or whatever. There is nothing that you can tell me, like in my experience of reality taking action in it, it goes like this and then you get spikes that helps you to go to the next level. And then you go at a plateau and then you spike, et cetera. And therefore, it's not something that will work in that way. There'll be too many people that need to take action without seeing any results for a long, long, long time before a small spike that gives them hope in order to go to the next level, et cetera, which is very similar to George Leonard's mastery book concept. Since Rolo's taking notes, he can take notes on that. And thank you. You had a question, Tristan, right? Yeah, so Primal, I have a question for you, like after watching your videos and I understand like the critiques, everything like that, I wanna be completely objective here. I genuinely want your perspective on this. So I have a question. So my question to you is obviously like put MOA aside, take like any businesses, any marketing strategies, anything like that, right? There are products that are good, there's products that are bad, there are products that over promise, all of that. We can agree, right? Yes. Okay, so my question to you is, where in your mind is the fine line between persuasion and manipulation? Because my question is, wait, wait, wait, let me finish, let me finish. For example, right? Let's say a personal trainer, right? He's helped 300, like he has testimonials, he's helped 300 guys lose a certain number of pounds, hypothetically, right? Yes, you could say by using that, he's manipulating for quitting, he wants you to get to buy his product, but he also helped 300 guys lose it. So where's the fine line? I wanna hear your perspective on that. Sure, I will explain it very well. I am reclaiming the definition of manipulation and I say that inside the videos to mean to handle skillfully rather than to deceive. And therefore to me, persuasion and manipulation would be the same thing because I'm originally a nice guy. So I'm going all the extremes to not have any ethical things that powerful people could put on us in order to not do what works. Because I believe that when you speak to the primal brain of people, that's when they listen to advice, but any other way, they'll be like, yes, yes, and they will not do it. And that's why many people, let's say about porn or eating or whatever, they will know what not to do and still be addicted to it because their primal brain or lizard brain is not working on that. And I know Rollo will write a triune brain theory is not confirmed and blah, blah, blah. And- I 100% agree with you. 100% I agree with you. So what I am saying is I am saying, look, the problem that I would have, and I don't have it with Michael Sartain or Rollo, it's what other people that I speak about. They will include beliefs to keep you as a customer for life when change the definition of getting results to, oh, if you want results, it means you have, you're like, if you ask a question where you want results, it means you're not ready to receive the results. And that's why you should keep paying us money and keep getting our coaching. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm sorry, I'm muting everybody. Number one, bro, we give you back your money if you don't get results. Where's a 100% money back guarantee on my program. That's the first thing. Bring up to you is like, at what point when people keep saying it works, is it no longer manipulation? That's what Tristan is trying to ask you. And you keep saying, well, we're trying to keep, listen, we deny people from this program all the time. If you think that you're a special snowflake, if you're not willing to work, or if you go set, we had one guy, he went like 10 months and didn't fix his Instagram. We just kicked him out of the fucking program, dude. I kicked one guy out because he was literally working with the Russian Federation in the invasion of Ukraine. I literally, dude, I would kick people out for whatever. So that's not accurate. Here's the problem, dude. You have all, everyone who's watching this has access to me. If you wanna message me and ask me questions, you can. You could have gone through, and I would have given you probably my entire list. It would have been weird, because obviously I don't know if you're a coach. I can't give you my entire list, but I'll give you a good number of people on my list. And you can ask each one of them. Like there's so many guys on this call right now that will tell you, I did what Michael said and it worked. So at some point, like at some point it isn't manipulation. I don't know, like, bro, I'm not, I don't need you to reframe this. Just consider this hypothesis that maybe, maybe when Galileo says the earth goes around the sun, he's not trying to reframe the fucking Pope. He's just telling the fucking truth. Maybe that's all that it is, man. That's it. And that's the problem. It's like, and then you're gonna say, well, thank you. And then Rolo does this and triune brain theory. By the way, triune brain theory is a fantastic metaphor. It's not true. It's not like actual scientific fact. It is a good metaphor though. It has to do with the different evolutionary periods of different parts of the brain, but it's not real. So that's one of the things that it's just so crazy, man. It's like when we had these discussions. Science does not deal with facts. No scientist will say this is proven or this is fact. What? This is like, no, really go read any scientific paper. They never say that. I have a master's of science, like literal. Yeah, it's not even a joke. You deal with 95% confidence intervals that this whatever is, is explaining the data in this way. And many ways. Hold on, wait, wait. Do you know who says a fact is a scientist? Nobody who uses the word fact is a scientist. It doesn't exist. You're confusing everyone. When Johannes Kepler- I'm not confused. I'm telling the truth. I'm the truth teller now. Now I'm Galileo. When Johannes Kepler wrote down his laws of planetary motion, his observations, Isaac Newton then made in Principia, he wrote down an equation for gravity and NASA uses that same thing today. That is a, right for it, fact. Fact. It is a fact that gravity will operate in that way in low gravitational environments. So there are actual- The data, yes, but the explanation or the theory is not a fact. I mean, Jack Feynman, he has like on YouTube a whole lecture- Bro, you're making our brains melt here, bro. You're telling me facts aren't real. Yes, because I'm telling you stuff to advance. I love this. No, no, this is so- It's too advanced, bro. It's like, now I understand where the disconnect is between us. We live in reality and you believe that your interpretation- No, no, no, no, please don't say that. No, it's not. You don't live in reality. That's not at all. I love that reframe that you're doing, but no, don't go there. This is not the play. What I'm telling people is not that at all. I'm saying, look, when people do specific things that elevate their status, it makes them attached to that person and their tribe leader and love them. And therefore, whatever that person says, it will become the truth that the tribe accepts. I'm saying, don't do that. Yeah, bro, but like there's no science behind that. There is no science behind this. No, no, no, that is bullshit. They're doing it. I'm showing you the action. I'm being the scientist. I am being the person. I can't, I can't. No, you're not being the scientist because you're not going over the scientific results that would prove something like that. No, why would you? I'm showing you the action. You are purely using analogy and action. Okay, when you observe animals or even evolutionary psychology, that's not even considered hard science or even science at all. No, evolutionary psychology is considered a hard science. Psychology is not considered a hard science. By whom? By you and the people. Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. By scientists who look at falsifiable observation. Yes, but because there's no, there's a problem. The fact that it's falsifiable doesn't mean it will never be falsified. You know what I mean? No, no, no, no, no, no. We agree with you. That's what I'm saying. We're gonna stop, dude, because I'm not gonna let you interrupt me again. When the fact, the fact of the matter is in evolutionary psychology, there are falsifiable data that you can test. In psychology, there isn't. That's why evolutionary psychology, whenever you do the 37 culture study and things like that, that is falsifiable data. That is a hard science. Now, Raymond, is it Dr. Voss? The interpretation is not. That's what I mean. The interpretation is a temporary placeholder for the thing. I don't, like, I'm not arguing with the data. I'm arguing with the interpretation. I remember Rollo, it's one of the criticisms that I say about him. He says, oh, this is a praxeology, but, oh, there is a difference between data and interpretation of the data. And I'm giving you the interpretation, which by definition makes it an ideology. There is some stuff that we're talking about in this way. No, bro, but it's not about you giving an interpretation. It's like, you're saying, hey, when people do this, they get attached to the tribal leader, and this is a fact, and this is what this happens. That is not true. No, it's not true. That's my point. It's not true. There is no such thing. Your interpretation, your observation of this thing is wrong in evolutionary psychology. Now, some of it is true. Since you're speaking about- Wait, wait, wait, Greg, Greg, I'll do it. I'll do it right now. Okay, the first one, when you make the analogy of my clients experiencing Stockholm syndrome, Stockholm syndrome has a definition. We can look it up in the DSM. The symptoms for Stockholm syndrome do not match what is happening to my clients. Therefore, what you're saying is unassailably incorrect. That's not an interpretation. It's like- No, that's appeal to authority, just because the DSM doesn't say it because it doesn't deal with- Just because the DSM doesn't say it. Yes, so like- Got it. I said it as a fun, like, it was a joke. The same way that when I said Anton sees you as his daddy. It was not a joke, bro. When I said Anton sees you as his daddy. No, I laughed. When I said that, I laughed. Now, you're just lying. Now, I'm calling you a liar. The Stockholm syndrome thing is funny to me. I find it to be funny. You didn't find it funny at the time. That was not a joke. You said it and you're trying to reframe- But it doesn't matter. It's true. It's the same kind of attachment when you get- No, but it's not. But it's not true, though. Hey, guys, guys, real quick, real quick. I'm gonna call him out. I'm gonna call him out. Some of the thumbnails. So he's not, he's not out here bashing us. Guys, look at the thumbnails. Look at the thumbnails, guys. No, no, I'm saying I am. I'm saying why. Okay, like you're going after Alex Hermosy manipulation. Alex Hermosy has made more millionaires than money you will make in your life. And you're calling this man a manipulator. It's fucking insanity, bro. I do, yes. Keep doing the devil horns for me, though, please. I'm good with that. Keep going. Yeah, sure. They look very nice. I mean, it reminds me of your guitar, which goes with the Vikings. So it's your Viking archetype, which I speak about in many ways. So I understand. So there is, it's not, now we're not arguing, because we're speaking about things that I cannot show you specifically. What I'm showing you is what people are doing. I am saying, look, people are doing this because it's blah, blah, blah, and they're doing it. So how is this wrong? You know what I mean? I don't mean wrong like you're doing. It's wrong because it's not Stockholm syndrome and I'm not manipulating people. Okay, you're taking one point and creating a whole- No, no, no, because you made, okay, the other one is when I try to make someone, when I try to make Anton, like make him in lower status, I was giving Anton verifiable, like I can show you several books that will verify what I was saying was accurate. At some point, accuracy must count for something. When I can say, again, what you're saying is- Define accuracy, because I know the role of nowadays. One more time, one more time. What you're saying is essentially that when General Relativity was written in 1914, the purpose of that was for him- No, no, no, please don't use metaphors. They're invalid. No, it's not a metaphor. That's what you're saying. The idea that he came out and wrote that paper, he did it to manipulate people so that he would gain higher status, it is absurdity. When he talks about something that is true and wins the Nobel Prize for the photoelectric effect- Doesn't matter, just because you won the Nobel Prize doesn't mean anything. It doesn't mean anything. It doesn't mean anything. I mean, you're against the matrix and you speak about the Nobel Prize. Like, I don't understand these- Against the matrix. I like Andrew, but I don't say matrix shit. I never talk about the matrix. Okay, no problem. What I'm saying, whatever won the Nobel Prize doesn't mean there is next evolution. It doesn't matter. We're debating something totally different. No, no, no, we're not. We're debating unassailable truths. When something is unassailable truth, it doesn't make it- Unassailable truth. It doesn't exist. That concept is invented by marketers. No, it's not scientific. This is hilarious, bro. This is hilarious. Okay, hold on, hold on. Did OJ kill or did he, or did he not kill Nicole? That's a different thing, that's a justice thing. It's not a different thing, bro. It's so crazy, bro. My brain is coming out of my fucking ears, you're insane. It's either he did or he didn't. No, that's a black and white thing. That's a black and white thing. Go to the DSM. You'll find that is a psychological issue to have black and white thing. No, it is not. There are many grays. I'm not gonna let you do this again. I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna, I'm muting everybody. I'm not gonna let you do this again. One more time. In the DSM, there's a thing called splitting for people with borderline personality disorder. That is a symptom of a particular type of cluster B personality disorder. Cause he says these vague things that he hasn't studied. And then he talks to people who actually know what they're talking about. And he just throws this out. I love what you're doing. Yes, you're doing what I'm speaking about. Stop, stop, stop, bro. I'm not, I don't need you to comment until I'm done. Now, the other part about this, this is my show. I'm not trying to manipulate you. This is my show. The other part about this is that when you say that binary thinking, when it comes to did OJ or kill or not kill Nicole, that is a binary answer. Are you or are you not pregnant? That is a binary answer. You can't be partially pregnant. And you should know because OJ, there is a lot of speculation whether he did it or not. Whoa, holy shit. Okay, hold on, hold on. Now if you tell me, did Michael Jordan win the NBA, blah, blah, blah. I will say yes, but you're telling me something. Are you sure? I mean, there's no, there's no unassailable truths. You have disproved your own beliefs. There are assailable proofs. There are, there's unassailable proof that natural selection actually did occur amongst homo sapiens. Oh my God, this is great. A Rollo is put in the timer for the chest thing. That's great. That's a metaphor too. So now it's actually a metaphor. It's not a metaphor. It's actually, it's not a metaphor. It's reality. You think that way because you're limited in your thought and that's what's happened. But this is great. Do you understand? Do you understand what's happened? It's like you came and made a channel where you started trying to gain notoriety, trying to gain status by going after certain individual peoples. And no offense, bro. I don't mean this, I'm not trying to be offensive. It didn't work. It was a fucking unadulterated failure. You have put way too much work into these videos. But it doesn't work for you. You're the right person to say this. You don't sell any product. You have 200 fucking subscribers. It didn't work. And now you- 186. Yeah, 186 subscribers. It didn't work. Now what's happened, it could, any one of my guys, I could teach them in two seconds to get more than 200 subscribers in a day. But because you don't use, you probably don't use social media. You don't know how to use TikTok. You don't know how to use other things. You don't understand any type of status. And you're trying to say primal status of elevated. Hold on, but you don't- I look at your social blade, you're buying followers. So literally like, I'm not- Who am I buying followers? I didn't buy, who am I buying followers? Your YouTube literally has buying followers. Hey bro, I will bet you $100,000. I have never bought a follower on YouTube. I will bet you $100,000. Okay, check your social blade. I'm not saying it like- No, no, no. You just said I bought followers, bro. I'm, no, we're not gonna let this thing go. I said, have the pattern. I said the words. No, no, no. When I looked at social blade- Bro, we're not letting this go. We're not letting this go. Yes. I had 18,000 subscribers when I started my fucking channel. And now I have 49,200. And I did so because I interviewed Dan Bilzerian. Did you interview Dan Bilzerian? I interviewed Dan Bilzerian. I interviewed Tai Lopez and I could go over a number of people. I go on Fresh and Fit frequently and they have a million subscribers. And you think I bought my followers? Bro, if I bought my followers, I'd have a 100,000 subs. I never bought a single fucking follower. But the problem is from your perspective, from your perspective, because you aren't successful. You look at me being successful. I love what you're doing. I encourage everyone to do the same. I have never, I have never bought a fucking follower on YouTube. That is so absurdly ridiculous. I have videos on there right now that have fucking 800 views. I have never bought a fucking follower. That is crazy that you would say that shit. And I will go look at my social blade. It's not gonna show that I bought any fucking followers. You are- It shows some days you have zero and some days thousands, some days zero like that. Yes, why would I? Hold on, hold on. If I go and I peer on other people's shows like Bradley or Fresh and Fit, could it possibly be because I went on their show, I gained some followers? Or is that concept too difficult for you to understand? You will look at it. No, when you look at it, you'll see what I'm talking about. Bro, don't, don't. It's not like that. It's not the spike that you think. We're looking it out now. I'm not worried at all because I didn't buy any fucking followers, dude. This is crazy. Stare at your screen, bud. I am, I'm about to. Hold on. Can I throw something in here about following? Go ahead. Sub subscriptions are a fucking vanity metric, first of all. Yes, I love that. No, shut the fuck up for just one second. Thank you, thank you. Subs are a vanity metric. Comments are a vanity metric. Likes are a vanity metric as well. So whether or not anybody's buying subs, the only people who care about who has more subs than who are people who don't understand how fucking YouTube works. Yes, but that's a diss to Michael Sartain right now. This is funny. This is great. Well, I have more subs than you and Michael Sartain and pretty much anybody else on this fucking show right now. I love that. Okay, so hold on, let's go here. Let's go here. Bro, bro, bro, here's the problem, right? So let's look at this spike right here. So you're saying- No, go down to the daily followers, please, below. It's below. Yes. You see how it's exactly 100? No, up, up, up from there. Because it rounds off, dumbass. No, no, no. I looked at other channels. They have no other channels. I don't have it rounded off. Sorry to say that. No, you don't know how YouTube works, dude. You don't know how YouTube works. It does. Admit that you do not know anything about YouTube analytics. No, I will not. No, I disagree with whatever you're saying. No, no, no, no, no. Look at that. There are days where it's zero and days where it's- No, I looked at other channels. Go look at mine. Go look at mine. Go pick up mine. Go pick up mine. Go look at mine. I got more subs than Mike. You would think- It's the rational mail. It's the rational mail. It's in mine, right? It's the rational mail. Now, go to, you didn't even go to, go to playboard.co and look at my shit. No, we're doing the same one because- Oh, look here. Oh, what is that, bro? Oh, checkmate. Checkmate. No, checkmate. Sorry. I have no idea about Rollo, but I checked- Checkmate. Checkmate. Bro, bro. You're pissing me off. Pick a fucking channel. Pick a fucking channel. Pick a fucking channel, dude. The reason why is because you get fewer than 100 subs a day. That's the reason why it looks like that for you. Pick a channel and I'll show you this again. They do round off subscriber numbers. You don't know what you're talking about. Checkmate. One more time. Go to Fresh and Fit. No, checkmate. I disagree with this objection. You just- Oh, sorry. No, no, no. Don't change it in that way. Bro, like coming on my channel, telling me that you love the stuff I'm doing and then saying I bought fucking followers, it's fucking insanity, dude. I believe it could be part of the game as Rollo Tomasi had in his live stream to say, oh, many people, it's part of the game that they play, which is to buy things. So I don't see it as a negative thing. When you spoke in that live stream- Iron and Fresh don't buy subs because they understand it's a waste of fucking money. It is such a waste of money to buy subs. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Let me throw- Oh, Rational Mail Clips, 1K. They do round it off. They do round it off. Let me see if I can explain this in like eighth grade terms here, okay? When- Thank you. Now you're belittling me. You're dominating me. Go for it. It's fine. Let me explain to you- Oh, oh, look here, look here, look here. Subscribers, plus 1 million. Checkmate. Checkmate. They do round it off, bro. They do. You didn't know what you were talking about. This is the most popular person on all of YouTube, Mr. Beast. Checkmate. They do. What they do is they don't round it off by day. They just round it off. He got 1 million in the- From this period to this period, he got 1 million new subs. That's how it works. You don't understand YouTube analytics, and you came out here. Dude, don't say thank you. Lord, you have been making mistakes. You've been taking Ls left and right, man. I said the pattern. When I said, I spoke specifically in this way. No fucking pattern, bro. I can show you the days where I had boosts, and those days, I was literally on Fresh and Fit. Goddamn, man. All you guys are ganging up on me. It's fun. It's really fun. I love this. No, no, no. It is. Absolutely. No, I have seen channels who have, it's not rounded off at all. It could be like 2,000- Yes, because they have less than 100 a day. Where? Where? Where? Where? Where? Where? Tell me the name of them, dude. I will find the name right now, and I will tell you. Just one second. I'm not looking at Social Blade. I'm just looking at your group. Go to playbook.co. They do the same thing there, too. Those are the two places that you go. Now, let me explain something to you, okay? So the reason why we say that subscriptions are a vanity metric and comments and likes, please like my video, okay? Great, but the thing is is that when it comes to the algorithm, when it comes to impressions, when it comes to click-through rate, it makes no fucking difference, period. Now, how do I know that? Let me explain to you. Back in August of 2021, when Myron and Fresh got sort of run up the flagpole by ABBA and Preach, everyone thought that was the beginning of the end. They were at about 400,000 subs at that time, and they lost probably about 36 to 40,000 subs as a result of that. If they were buying subs, do you not think that they would try to offset that by buying more subs? No, they didn't. You know why? Because they know that it does that. You want to talk about playing the game, I'm going to tell you how the game is played, okay? So what happens is they lose 36,000 subs. Hold on, hold on. We let you talk. I'm going to explain something to you so you'll understand this for the future. So when you do another Hit Piece video, people will know what we're talking about. So when you're talking about subscriptions, subscriptions don't make any difference at all. You know why? Because if you go to playboard.co or if you go to Social Blade and you go, I want you to do this after we're done. Go to those sites, go look at who are the number one, look at who are the number one. Of course you wouldn't. Of course you won't. Look at who the number one most super chatted show was during the month of August. I love that. You're putting the criteria of the tribe. Hold on, shut up for one second. I'm still talking. You're very polite. Let me finish this thought, okay? I'm trying to speak over you because you keep interrupting. So here's the deal. What happens is they're at 400,000 subs. They lose, they're down about what? 386, somewhere, maybe lower than that, like maybe 370 as a result. People thought it was the beginning of the end. If you go and you look at the revenue that they generated during the month of August of 2021, they are the number one most super chatted show on planet fucking earth. $120,000 in just super chats. I know, I watched the fucking numbers. So when I'm looking- I believe you have shown it in the show. Let me explain. So what happens by October of 2021, they were well over 500,000 subscribers, okay? All those subs came back. They're not making as much money because now they've got more subs, but that's not causal, okay? So now suddenly they're back on top again because people think that subscriptions make any difference whatsoever, and they don't. When you're looking at the money and the dollars and cents- That's not what I see. What's going on there? That's not what I see. They're looking, I know, but I'm telling you why you don't understand this, okay? I do understand. I do. I don't know what's weird about your channels, you guys. I sent you a, please open Psych Hacks, which is a channel that I saw. Today you'll see a natural pattern of YouTube growth. That's a very natural thing. I don't know what's wrong with your channels, where it looks so weird like that or whatever, but please look, that's how it's supposed to look. Like now- The reason why you have wild increases or decreases is because- Not to me. In the content of the show. Simple as that. That's all. Hey bro, my man, my man, I'm sorry, bro. If I do a show- You just took the biggest L of all time, bro. This is Psych Hacks. No, no, I mean, look how it's every single day. You have days where it's no subscribers. That's why it's so weird. Yes, because I'm down to one. Hold on, bro, because I'm down to 100. When you round off below 100, it's zero, bro. Do you not know how this works? Yes, how do you- It's fucking insane. How does it go like that? From less than what? Less than- So not that it's any of your business, it's because we switched from one guy who was creating clips for us, and we switched to a different one that Pearl actually messaged me. So for four days, we didn't produce any fucking content, so I didn't get any new subscribers. That's why it happened, dude. Goddamn. Man, it's just so crazy that you like, the difference between 100 subscribers and zero, you think I'm paying for 100 subscribers today? At some point, we're getting to like you having mental illness. This is crazy. No, dude, I am not paying for subscribers. I'm crazy like that. No, no, but it's not just that you're crazy, bro. It's not just that you're crazy. You have a channel called Primal Status Elevated, and you have no muscle mass. You have a channel called Primal Status Elevated, and you're not good with women. I will bet a million dollars. You'll be in John Anthony Lifestyle. I love this. This is good. But you're not good with women. Exactly. You know, everyone, this is what I show you, what they are doing, et cetera. For example, now he's attacking me as an ad hominem, which is to destroy my ideas by attack as a person, which is a fallacy. I'm not- But when you get angry, that we destroy your ideas. So what are you talking about? I'm not angry. I'm excited. This is fun. One more time, one more time. It's ad hominem if your name is John Smith. It's not John Smith. Your fucking name is Primal Status Elevated, and you do none of those things. I love that. You have no status, nor do you elevate others. You're literally like- That is not ad hominem, bro. You don't understand. Thank you so much. I love this. You don't understand. You don't understand Latin. That is not what ad hominem means. I am attacking you because you are literally promising something that isn't true. I'm speaking about the debating fallacy. It's not, no, no. You literally said ad hominem, bro. It is not ad hominem. You don't know what that means. Ad hominem would be if your name was John Smith, and I was like, yo, bro, you're a bitch. That's ad hominem. You have a name called Primal Status Elevated, and no offense, bro, you don't look like you go to the gym. That is not me ad hominem attacking you. Thank you, thank you very much. Dude, you don't have to keep saying thank you, bro. This is not working out well for you. Trust me, okay? If you want, listen, if you want, but I know you think you're gonna get a ton of subscribers from this. You aren't. You're taking it. You're Alton Lister getting dunked on by Shaquille O'Neal. Hold on, listen, you're Chris Dudley. Right now, you're Chris Dudley getting dunked on by Shaq. You're not gonna get any new subscribers from this, okay? I'm the real man of action, if you think about it. In two months, that's how old the channel is. I created more than 100 videos, 24 live streams in two months, et cetera. Like, who is taking the real action? I love action. I mean, I'm doing more than you. Me, I'm doing more than you. And I coach 500 guys. Remember, I'm one of, like, there is my story, which you didn't watch in the thing. I almost died in the war in Ukraine. So, of course, I gained some weight to heal mentally and then get back to the thing. I'm not a normal person. I lost everything and I need to rebuild or whatever. And I'm not saying I'm attacking you. I'm explaining specifically. It's attacking is the way you get attention, which is similar to Andrew. whatever so that you share the good value that you didn't get attention. You didn't work because I am speaking to you right now to show that's right. No, you're not bro. No, it's automatic. I'm Michael Sartain. So like, it didn't work. No, no, no, bro. You're not listening. This is the algorithm. The algorithm, it doesn't work what you did. I don't care about the algorithm. No, no, you're saying that because this is the game you're talking about. You don't care about like, you don't care about the algorithm because you took an L. That's the reason why. If I've made that many videos and got no fun. As long as you don't give up, there is no such thing as taking an L or losing. Yes, there is taking an L. No, it's not. Let me give you an example, right? The Dallas Cowboys played the San Francisco 49ers and they didn't give up and they still took the L. That's how it fucking works. This is an infinite game. It's not a finite game. That's a totally different concept. You're right. And you take infinite Ls. That's exactly what I'm saying, bro. Thank you so much. Here's the other thing, dude. There's very small, there's very small things that you could do that would help you build your channel. And one of the things is you making ad hominem attacks against me and Rolo. That's the problem. It didn't work. And you thought it was going to work. It didn't work. Yes. Yes. Now I knew. This is where all your bullshit comes from. Raj. Raj, go. This is where all your shit's coming from. Yeah. It's not. Raj. It is not. Raj, go. I read a lot. So it's unrelated to any specific book. But thank you. Are you calling it bullshit? It's literally. I am calling it bullshit. It's beautiful. I know we're talking about the same point. I know where it came from. Yeah, that's a that's a scientific fact. Love and hate are two sides of the same point. More science. What book are you getting this from? Raj. Go Raj. Does that book have any of the stuff we're talking about? I don't know. But thank you. Thank you. I love this. Now you're laughing in order to belittle me. He's not laughing. No. He's not laughing in order to belittle you. He's laughing because what you're saying is nonsensical because he's not laughing. No one is trying to belittle you, bro. We are living our life and you are saying absurd shit. I love that. Yes, because I'm innovative. They're not understand. It's not innovation. You know, it's not the same level. We're not speaking at the same level of consciousness and that's why it doesn't land. You are one. That's the first thing you've been right about the whole time. I have to lower myself in order to be understood and I'm unwilling. Thank you. Thank you. This was fun. Thank you. Thank you, Michael Sartain. This was so much fun. I just have a question. You were saying to Mike that, hey, you know, like you only have 49,000 followers, blah, blah, blah. And then and then like you were kind of talking shit about like his views and stuff and then that he bought followers. But like then you said, I'm a man of action. I have 100 videos and I only have like 200 subscribers. Like it doesn't really make sense. Like, do you see the disconnect here? I don't ask people to unsubscribe. Like you can watch. I ask people to unsubscribe. I don't want smart subscribers. I literally do not. Never. I have never asked people to subscribe. I literally ask people to unsubscribe all the time because I'm doing something different. Yeah. But like, even if people like nobody, like, I don't like, is Simon Sinek speaking about unsubscribe? I don't know what you're talking about, Rollo, because that book is not a Bible or you know, dude, you know exactly what I'm talking about. Let's cut the shit. Just cut the shit. No, I only watch the TEDx, I didn't even read the book. You will do so much better if you stop, dude, when you're digging your own grave, the best thing you can do is stop. I am not digging my grave. I'm having fun. This is great. Let's keep going. So Raj, you wanted to ask something like, um, what's your videos that you made? You said you made a hundred videos, right? The last two months. Yes, at least I have more. Are they all like exposed videos of like literally everybody in a certain niche or space or are you? Anybody who is doing things well enough to be worth studying. That's how I will frame it. And thank you. But if they're, if they're, um, Like J.S.P. Kars. I don't know who's J.S.P. Kars. No, really. I honestly do not know. I do not. What do you mean? I'm not lying. Look at my energy and my vibe. Look in my eyes. I'm not lying. I have no idea who's J.S.P. Kars. You realize when people get nervous and they get caught in a lie, that's, they do exactly what you're doing right now. Yes. Or people who are having fun and playing the game well. Defensive posture. People's guilty conscience. Just saying. Thank you. Thank you. I love that. Now it's the refrain. But honestly, I'm fine. This is fun. I learned from you fucking best, my friend. From me, yes. You learned from me. Thank you. Thank you so much. You learned from me. I appreciate it. I would love to play poker with you. Would love to play. Thank you. Yeah. Oh my God. It's going to be so much fun. But thank you so much, Robo. This is a great coaching call. Can you guys stick to questions? I need you guys to stick to questions. Go ahead. If you've got questions for Primal, go. Sure. Ask me any question. I'm ready. Let's have fun. Go ahead, Tristan. All right. So I have one more question. Okay. Okay. So I know you talk a lot about psychological concepts and foundations. You would agree with that, right? Okay. Yes. I have two questions. What is your qualification to speak on something like that? And how do you go about learning and getting your information? Okay. So I have one more question. Okay. Okay. So I have one more question. Okay. So I know you talk a lot about psychological concepts and foundations. You would agree with that, right? Okay. Yes. So I have one more question. What is your qualification to speak on something like that? And how do you go about learning and getting your information? Because as someone who studies psychology, I could tell you don't use psychological science in your assumptions. I use metaphors because as Cialdini said, metaphor is the most powerful way to communicate to people in order to be understood. Okay. So you don't use science is what you're saying. What do you mean with science? Now we're going very complicated. I have a master's degree of science. I'm not going to reveal too much because I get death threats on my email every day. So let's stop there. Not too much. What field of science? Can I ask that? No comment on any of that. Sounds like bullshit. No comment. No, I'm not going to. It's mentalism combined with numerology. That's the science. Thank you. I love that. Yes. Those people do primostatic elevation very well. Honest to God. This is a genuine, honest question. Is it in the STEM field, science, technology, engineering, or mathematics? Is it any of those four? Close enough, but not any of those. No. Okay. So none of those. That's all. That was my question. Anyone else can go. All right. Cool. Anybody else have a question for Primal while he's on there? Ask me. I need it. Guys, go ahead and unmute yourselves because I don't know who to call. There's so many people with their hands raised. I got three quick points. All right. One, happy birthday to Volo. Number two, musician, not magician. And number three, John Anthony Lifestyles. This guy reminds me of. That's it. Oh, thank you. I did a video on him. What is it? Dylan? Dylan. Dylan. Dylan. Dylan. Dylan. Dylan. Dylan. Dylan. Dylan. Dylan. He says he reminds them of John Anthony Lifestyles. That's who he reminds me of. And happy birthday, Volo. I made a video about him, yes. You can watch it. And earlier, did you mean musician or like magician? No, magician, which is the archetype of academics of knowledge, and it's balanced by the opposite, which is the outlaw, which is the archetype of the bad boy, Viking, et cetera, that he's going for. So. But what did you learn about archetypes? Why do you need to know? You need to know if you want to go to primalstatus.com and you'll know why or where. Like you're asking me specific questions about things that are appropriate to you. Bro, stop using archetypes that's not scientific. This is legitimately pissing me off. This is not scientific. And then you're using it. If it's in your office, absolutely great. That's what I'm going for. Okay. Primal. Primal. Primal. Primal. Primal. Primal. Primal. Thank you. Thank you. Primal. Who's talking? Who's talking? That kid that you're arguing with goes to Harvard. So what? Chill. I'm cool as well. But you won't say it. But you didn't. But you didn't. But you didn't. But you didn't. But you didn't. No, I did. I really did. But you didn't. But you didn't. Because we've caught you in like six lies already, bro. You didn't. The fact we disagree doesn't mean it's a lie. The fact I don't ascribe to the same paradigms as you doesn't mean it's a lie. The fact that you've made false metaphors about me means that you are, you consistently lie. And this is probably another lie. Okay. Thank you for saying that. I appreciate it. No. You want to tell your camera? You can't. You're just thanking Mike. Like, like, it doesn't make you win the argument by thanking him. I'm, you know, I believe in kindness and in love for all and hate towards. I know you wouldn't. How are you talking about you believe in kindness, motherfucker? You make kid pieces on people who've seen your content. It seems to you like his is watching your content. It's I actually last time I said, for example, during my interview with some guy who spoke about the red pill, I said, I think Rollo Tomassi, a lot of things I wouldn't have known without his book, for example, like you see the title outside and you judge the inside the inside. We watched the whole video. I show all your videos. It's not kindness. I felt bad for that specific. Cause it's not fucking. Hey, you want to know something? Anton is kicking some fucking ass right now. I'll tell you that right now. And so is Bill. I'm happy for him. No, you're not, bro. It's not kindness, bro. You shit talk behind people's back. That's what you do. That is not high status. That is not. I'm here. I have not. I'm not. Roll it. Go ahead. Roll it. Go question. You mentioned Robert Cialdini just a little while ago, right? Would he be an influence of yours? Did you hold him in high regard? He's a psychologist. I know. That's a trick question anyway. So it's a trick question because it has a definable answer and you won't answer. That's why it's a trick question. I separate the messages from the messenger. So in any way. So you know, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. So, you can, I just, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. What is he to you? Why, why would you mention Robert Cialdini? He's a peer. That's all I can say. No man, don't play please don't because I know what you're doing. You're setting me up for something. So I won't even go there. Well, I mean have you read any of his books? Ah... No comment. I'm not going there. Can you name any of his books? I don't know. You're setting yourself up by not answering the question and showing you don't know what the fuck you're talking about. That's what you're saying. No, I'm not. I'm not entering a game that I know I will win in a double bind. You already entered in a game that you were going to lose, bro, but when you came on the show. No, no, no. This is fine. Yeah, you did. This is good. I understand that you're reframing. I'm just asking you questions, man. At least, at least Flat Earthers have empirical observations that they confuse for facts. You don't have anything. Flat Earthers. This is good. I love this. This is great. Thank you. You did it to yourself. You're doing it to yourself, dude. You make yourself look like that. You make yourself look like that. Do you not see? This is a problem. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Here's another one. Here's another one where you were just completely off. There was a time when you make a video and I say something and then Kylie starts, who is my girlfriend, starts laughing at the thing that I said and do you see, do you see what happened here? Do you see how she's turned in towards him? Yes, motherfucker, because it works because I actually teach a course about status and I know what I'm talking about and you don't. That's the point. This is the point. I'm trying to make. I am 45 fucking years old and I'm in the gym every day. He's never sat this close to him, so he doesn't understand. It's just so fucking crazy, bro. Like at some point, at some point, dude, it's the way you're triggered right now. Please calm down, bro. I'm not triggered. This is what I do when I go. He's pulling the trigger on you. Yeah, bro. It's just so crazy. No, no, no. Here's the thing. I'm a performance coach. I care deeply. Now you're not one of my clients, but my brain is here. My brain is in this. That's what I do on Monday. I care about everyone. Aren't you saying that you should, nobody should qualify ever. Why are you qualifying and say I'm a performer? That's never. That's not what I'm saying. That's not what I'm saying. That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying you don't need. I'm saying you don't need to qualify. You're all the same tribe. I'm the outsider. So you're attacking me. The whole tribe. I'm so great. I'm on your side, bro. I want to ask questions. This is absolutely fun. Let Rolo go. It's his birthday. Everybody shut the fuck up. Rolo wants to talk. Rolo's wife has to have sex with him. It's his birthday. You should. The hummer I got last night was great. So I'm going to, because I've been, I've been taking notes because I actually care. Happy birthday, Rolo, by the way. Thank you very much. So give me one birthday present. Well, let's go to this one. You said you redefine manipulation. Is that what you said? Yes. Okay, manipulation, as I said, I redefine it as handling skillfully because manipulation, you can think about it as something which is to handle things without, I'm taking out the deception part of it. And I was asked this question and I always say it because I believe that, and you probably will know about that 48 laws of power, but I didn't even, I'm not even saying I'm ascribing to it. I'm just saying something. There is one thing where the most power you hold is by making people not believe that power exists or that it's good. I want to make normal people believe that whatever you're doing is actually great and you should do the same thing that you're doing in order for you to build an audience and gain power. I am attacking you, but actually I'm giving you literally saying that this person is a great example to be studied. That's literally what I say in the video. I don't know. But sometimes I say, sometimes you, sometimes you justify too much. Can we refine this just a little bit? Okay. So you, if you're, you're, for your redefining manipulation as handling skillfully, correct? Yeah. Was I right about that? Okay. So if that's the case, and what's the difference between say seduction, persuasion, manipulation, like salesmanship, what, what's the difference? Like what are, where's the distinction between all of those? Like when is it good and when is it bad? I will not go into good and bad because I'm beyond good and bad. Well, when is it, when is it, when does it become cult? And when does it become salesmanship? And when does it become seduction? And when, because those are varying shades of manipulation, are they not? Sure, sure, sure. I will tell you 100%, 100%. What I believe in is creating scenarios or using symbols or beliefs so that people come to their own conclusion. And that's what you, for example, do. And many of the great manipulators I will say is creating something or whether it's by telling a story or showing irrefutable visual evidence, as Michael Sartain would say, or anything like that, where people will come to their own conclusion and therefore it's from their own volition and therefore they believe strongly in it rather than believe in or feeling they have been influenced. And therefore there is always some buyer's remorse. Would you say that influencing somebody, like being an influencer is a negative thing or a positive thing? Depends. I would think it's weaker because it's felt, it's like the difference between charm and charisma or something like that. Do you want charisma to be like negative or positive, or is there some sort of distinction or threshold between those two? The distinction is the effectiveness, I would say, not in the negativity. I don't go into negative or positive. Wouldn't the distinction be in the ultimate purpose rather than the effect? I mean, you could be very effective and have it be like you can be a real son of a bitch, or you can be effective. I found that Rommel and Hitler were pretty effective. They were very effective. That's what I'm talking about. You can be effective. You can be effective and also help somebody by persuading them to do something different, can you? What I am talking about is that the only way to help people is to offer them to do that what we are speaking about. So I am saying the only way to help people, because then it's their own decision they feel like it is, or they feel it's the tribal leader who's giving them advice, because if you try to give someone advice... Good, good, good, good observation. Okay. So if it's the cult leader, if it's the cult of personality, if it's tribal leader, whatever, that leader has the best interests of the tribe in mind, then is influencing them a good thing? I say yes. I say to people, become that. I literally tell people, become that, because that's the only way you can be a good person and help people, rather than being naive enough to think that you can just talk directly to people or whatever. So that's what I say. I literally say it all the time. So I say it in that way. I'm just asking questions here. So would you say that seduction is a good thing or a bad thing? Depends on your definition. So please don't go there, because it's a totally different... For example, if you think about Locario, he will define seduction as with women who are low interest to turn them into high interest, while the art of seduction will define it differently. There's too many definitions. Can you speak about sales and marketing specifically so that we stay within that realm? Well, okay. And Bill, the reason why I say that is because people liken game and pickup artistry and influence, because if you've ever read, well, you just mentioned the 48 Laws of Power, right? With Robert Greene. So Robert Greene also wrote The Art of Seduction, okay? It's not an instruction manual, it just shows you how it works, okay? So how does... Because he doesn't... It's a Brecht theology, correct? Well, no, no, no, no, no. Well, it is in a way, but I don't think he meant it that way. But here's the thing is that, so you can be persuasive to help somebody, say, quit smoking, correct? Okay. So let's think about this metaphorically. You can be persuasive to get somebody to vote for you. You can be persuasive in a sermon at church. You can be persuasive when you're talking to a girl at a bar. So there's a distinction. I love what you're saying. Well, I'm just saying, is the act of seduction necessarily bad or is it how you use it? So I love this very, very much. We're not actually in disagreement. I am a bit offensive in order to get attention. So that's what's messing the whole thing. I use specific metaphors in order to explain to people deeper levels of persuasion that because when they watch it, they go more into trance. They cannot analyze them. I stop and explain what's happening there. And yes, I say it literally, you have to do that if you're a good person, because it's a tool. There is a difference, I say, between speaking a language, let's say there is a language of persuasion, and then you can lie in that language or tell the truth. It's amoral or totally neutral when it comes to that. So when I use manipulation, it's a neutral thing. It's not good or bad. So would it be fair to say that the problem you have with Michael and I is not the fact that we use manipulation, that we use persuasion, that we use, let's see, handling things skillfully, but rather how we use them? No, I love that you're doing and I'm showing people how to study what you're doing so that they learn. I don't have a problem with neither of you. I'm here. I'm only saying that to get some, like, understand, and you do it as well. Like when you're attacking people, for example, it's not because you hate those people. It's literally because that's a topic that will be interesting to people. So you are worthy of being studied. So literally, yes, it seems like an attack, but that's only in the outside. No, because it is an attack, but you do it to get views, but you're not getting views because it's an L. That's what you're saying. So the act of influencing is not necessarily intrinsically bad or good, correct? Can you repeat that? Just because someone else... So the act of influencing someone is not necessarily bad or good? I believe... How it is being used, correct? Yes. No, I mean, like, whether you're influencing them for their best interest or not, but then you have to define what is their best interest, which makes it complicated. If it's mutually beneficial, it's good. Let's say it in that way. Okay. So when you are influencing somebody to buy something that they may not want or that they may not need, is that bad? It is bad. Yes. Okay. Is it good? But hold on, but you're saying in general, like what you're talking about is just like manipulations that could be good or bad, right? You're not giving a definition to them. Is that correct? Yes. Okay. That's very interesting. Because the title of this is Dirty Michael Sartain Manipulation. Yes, I know. It's for fun. Look. Michael Sartain Explodes. Grinching. Look, it's fun. It's a joke. It looks grinching. It's a joke. Does everybody... Hey, put a one in the chat if you guys recognize it as a joke, bro. No, it needs a description. It doesn't matter what the descriptions is, bro. Nobody thought it was funny. Unless you have autism, nobody thought that was funny, bro. It's crazy. I don't have currently autism, but the video that I think would be... That is exceptionally debatable. That is exceptionally debatable. Thank you. Thank you. Yes. Yes. Thank you. I thank you for your perspective. All right. Well, I find that really interesting because if you are a fan of Robert Cialdini, then you must know that every single book he's ever written about is titled Influence, the Science of Psychology and Persuasion. Influence. Just because he calls it that, it doesn't mean that I have... Influence and Persuasion, every, literally every title of the psychology... He's one of the people I read. I didn't say he's my God or anything. That was the only name you brought up, though, so far. I could... I brought up Infinite Game. Except for maybe James Picard. Yes. But still. No, no, no. No, I was speaking about Simon Sinek. No, no. Literally. Could you tell me... Do you know what the six principles are? Simon Sinek. No, specifically, the book that I meant is Simon Sinek, Infinite Game. I don't know the other book that you're speaking about. There is Simon Sinek, Infinite Game. No, literally. Look for it. Hey, guys, look at this. Disturbing Michael Sartain Secrets. Isn't that funny? Guys, that's a fucking hilarious joke. Put it in the chat if you guys think that's a hilarious joke. Look, every single one. Disturbing Michael Sartain Secrets. Guys, look at this. It's a joke. It's obviously a joke. Put it in the chat if you guys get that this is a joke. That's hilarious, bro. For sure, bro. This is clearly you being a joke. So let me explain to you what... His first book was 1984? Fuck. Really? Let me explain to you guys what's actually going on. Primal Status saw that there were some people that made hit pieces, probably similar to like CoffeeZilla, maybe Spencer Cornelia, and then maybe saw what John Anthony Lifestyle and some other people like that were doing, and he tried to take up that mantle. And he did so, and it didn't work. So he kept making more and more and more, and now at 170 or how many videos he's made, it's still not working. He has shorts with like one view on them. So in order to try to level up his game, he writes me a message to try to get on my show. And I did this, but I didn't do this in order to like... But bro, trust me. I could tell everyone here to follow you. They're still not going to follow you. No one's going to subscribe to your channel. The problem that happened is what happens after that is that you come on here and you consistently disprove with your action every single thing that you're saying. You do care about getting subscribers. Don't shake your head, bro. You're being silly. You can unmute yourself, bro. You seem ridiculous. And no one believes you, and no one thinks that what you're saying is funny. So here's what happens. It's like you shove a bully in the back, and after he turns around, you're like, yo, bro, I was just joking, bro. You grab some girl's ass, and you're like, yo, bro, I was just joking. That's what you do after the fact, because you are taking the L. That's what's going on, bro. In case you were wondering... Bro, just unmute yourself. Why are you being ridiculous? Like, seriously, do you have a learning disability? Just unmute yourself, dude. What's going on? Unmute yourself. The fuck is going on? Push the mute button. Be 1% smarter than the machine. Thank you. Thank you very much. What I said is I'm not being ridiculous. Thank you for everything. As you say, social media is fake, and I'm okay with that. And therefore, I'm very okay with this. I love this very much. I believe you are people worth studying, and people will benefit from knowing what you're doing, not what you're saying, only what you're saying. So what you're saying, of course, it can help some people, but the deeper level is what you're doing, which is where the magic is at. And that is what I'm sharing. And you said it's not working. I'm asking people to unsubscribe. To me, it's working. And to me, action is its own reward. So I'm very process-oriented. Yeah, we're all sufficiently confused. We're all very confused. I'm not confused. We're glad you're not confused. I'm like eight years old. Does anybody else have any questions? Yes. Anybody has questions? I do. I do. Can I talk? Yeah, go ahead, Gabriel. All right. And I just want to know, and I looked at his channel, and he has like a couple dozen videos always bashing someone from the self-development community, from Tyler to you. But at the same time, he uses things like I'm process-oriented, which is a classic jargon that Tyler uses. So what seems to me to be the case is that he's frustrated with the community and has made it a life mission to undermine it. And I am sorry for my English. I'm speaking from Brazil. But I want to know from him, it's like, when did you lost hope to develop yourself? Because that's the only possible explanation. Like, you couldn't do it. I love that. The only possible explanation. And again, you decided to spend like 1,000 hours and 200 videos to bash the community. And you talk about past, present, and future, and that's creating a narrative. Your narrative seems to be. I can't make it, and I'm going to destroy it. And then you're going to come in here, and you're going to take this like false satisfaction of when you put these really good arguments, you do these silly jokes that not even you yourself believe in it. And you seem to be taking pleasure of kind of pissing some of us off. Yes. So why have you embarked on becoming this like kind of Darth Vader hunting down? Oh, thank you. Yes. Failing miserably to hunt down the development community. And what do you think you can get out of it? Wouldn't these 1,000 hours be better spent on the gym or studying the manufacturing course? Oh, I love that. I love that too, but not for the same reasons you do. Gabriel, that's a great question. Okay, can you give me like, no problem. Is anybody seeing me? Because it seems you're. We can see you fine, bro. We can see you fine. Okay. Thank you very much, Gabriel. Brazil is a beautiful country. I love that place. I mentioned it in my story. And I will say literally, I speak about people that I know about. And therefore, because I know about them, I can speak about them. And it actually means that I am into the self-development community. But thank you for the leading question. That was great for the presuppositions and for creating me as Darth Vader who is failing. I love that narrative. It's very good. You should be a politician in a good way. Primal, answer the fucking question, bro. This is so great. Answer the fucking question. Why did you give up hope? Why don't you work on yourself? Primal, why don't you work on yourself? That's the point he's making. You put so much effort in this. I'm working on myself. I'm working on my every single video. Primal, you are a fucking hater. Primal, you are a fucking hater. That is all you have worked on becoming. You are not in shape. You are a hater. And you have an unsuccessful YouTube channel. No, bro. Hold on. Here's the problem, bro. You're confused. You think I'm insulting you. I'm not. I'm legitimately asking the question. That is so much effort. Why not just take one fucking iota of instruction and do better? I don't understand. Sorry, I don't take instruction from other people. I apologize for this. I'm super independent. But hold on. Stop, stop, stop. Then stop saying that you're Primal Status Elevated. Change your name. It's my name. I claim it. It's up to me to decide. I can. I choose to talk about it. It's my choice. I'm my own sovereign person. I don't take instruction from other people. Successful, high-status people deliberately take instruction from other people. I'm going to use extreme examples again. That's what you say because it helps you sell more. Well, it's insane. It's insane. So Max Planck didn't help Albert Einstein? So Max Planck didn't instruct Albert Einstein to get his PhD thesis? Are you serious? I choose to live my life my own way. You're living in a fucking dream world. Right? I understand. Right, correct. You are taking L's your own way. I'm an idiot. No, nobody said you're an idiot. You have just chosen to be so fucking hard-headed. See, when you say, I'm an idiot, you're taking a victim mentality. No one's insulting you, bro. No, I am not. They're telling you the truth. Idiot means someone living in their own world. It's like if you think\\u2026 You have a psychosis. I believe you have a psychosis and a fixation. You only did videos on people you knew. My question is, did you buy the courses of every coach you should talk to on YouTube? Did you buy Man of Action? Did you buy RSD Pimp, Tem Game? Did you buy\\u2026 Look at my face. You said you should talk to people you know. How well do you know the people you should talk to on YouTube? I know very well. No comment about more details, but I do know them very, very, very well. As well as I mentioned, I read all of the Rollo Tomassi's books, which I mentioned earlier. So, no comment about more, because then they can look in their database of clients and it becomes messy in that way. So, no comment about that. It's too revealing. But thank you. Do you know Michael very well, though? Who? Do you know Michael very well? I even quote\\u2026 Like, I say when\\u2026 I think I know Michael. I quote him sometimes. But in a good way, as a peer, not as a guru. Yeah, as a dirty, manipulating peer. 100%. 100%. I would use that in a title, but I will never say it. Oh, I know you literally do when you say it. No, no, no. But it's not correct. So, I would never say he's a dirty\\u2026 Because I don't know. I cannot judge that. I'm only speaking about the manipulation behavior. So, why do you say it? Okay. So, no, but why do you call him dirty in manipulation tactics? Why do you do it then? Why? The manipulation tactics are dirty. It's not him. I never speak\\u2026 So, what are the manipulation tactics that Michael\\u2026 Just to finish it off, and you use\\u2026 On your YouTube channel, you help other gurus, what is your positive impact in the world? How many clients did you have? How many lays have you helped them got? Michael has helped me. I am not a dating coach. I'm not into seduction. I'm not a dating coach either. I'm not about lays. I have just listened to three lectures. He has helped me fuck, like, almost 20 chicks. And all these other guys who shit talk, they have helped me in massive, massive ways. The question is... I'm happy for you. You can draw your own interpretation of the world. We can all do that. Interpretations are free. They're not a crime. The question is... When you test your interpretation against the world, what results do they produce? Does your formula match reality enough to produce desirable results? And my question is basic. It's like... How many clients? How have you helped them? How much money? How many fuck girls? Status? Anything? Okay. First... What is your legacy? I will explain something very beautifully. The fact someone builds a tribe and becomes the leader, the confidence of the leader gives the tribe members superiority, serotonin, and confidence to go conquer the world. And therefore, even as placebo, you could be helped. But anyone who seems super confident and strong, and therefore, to me, that's not a sign of anything. I'm not discrediting what you guys are doing or anything. I am someone who, when people come to, they're like... They see the uniqueness and the amazingness of what I do. And therefore... Yes. You're not discrediting what I do. You're not discrediting anything I do. Okay. Got it. Yes. I just want to make sure. Michael. There you go. Thanks for using the picture. Androlo. And Michael Androlo. You both have been doing this for like 20 years or so. So you're asking me, two months? Why aren't you as big as us? What are your results? No, we're not. No, no, no. We're not telling you that. It's forever. We're not asking you why you're not big. We're telling you. We don't have... No, you're super confused. You're not confused while you're not big. Your content isn't good. Thank you. I love that. That's the presupposition. No, no, no. Wait. It's not presupposition. I shouldn't use that. A presupposition would be me assuming something that isn't true. For you, you make this content and get no views. No, no, no. That's a presumption. That's a presumption. Presupposition is an NLP term, which is within what's assumed to be the language. Here we go. He's going to try to pretend like he knows big words. Here we go. Let's do neuro-linguistic programming now. Let's talk about it because we don't know anything about neuro-linguistic programming. We can do everything. We can do hypnosis. We can do therapy. We can do everything. Again, bro. Again. Again. Again. This is what I'm talking about. When were they? When were they? I have things that were like a few hours ago released. So check the lives. Go to live and you'll see. It's not about being big or not, but check the lives. I have a ton. No, no, no. No, no. It's not about it. Social media is fake, right? Now we want to check the lives. No, bro. What you're doing is a failure. That is not a presupposition and that is not an ad hoc term, ad hominem term. No, no. You're creating a reverse preselection or reverse social rule. No, it's not. So it's a negative social proof. I love that. That's very good. Very good. Well, since we're talking about logical fallacies, what you've just done is beg the question. Okay. That's circular argument in which the conclusion is in. Well, if I'm dealing with people who are into fallacies, I'm unashamedly willing to go. You just said. You just said ad hominem. So you want to go logical fallacies. I'm going to hold you to every fucking one you use. No, I am saying use all the logical fallacies. I am saying use them. I encourage people to use them. I'm for it. So I'm not against it. Hey guys, for those of you in MLA, we're going to make this a module talking about cognitive bias. No further questions, Your Honor. I am for it. We're going to use primal status. We're going to use primal status. This is a great example of cognitive bias. He doesn't see himself as a flat earther, but he's exactly like flat earthers. The world. Thank you very much. Hold on. Nothing is true. Things can be interpretive. There is no hard and fast rules. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter that I shouldn't talk to you here. I'm into pragmatism. It doesn't mean later. That's not pragmatism. It's pragmatism. Hold on, bro. The definition of pragmatism is literally. You're just a liar. You are. You came and you should talk. I am on your thing. And now you're here. And what I thought is what you were going to come on here and say, hey, man, I've changed my mind about you, which I know I will not. I love what you're doing. But you didn't love what I'm doing. Damn, man. It's so crazy. Like watching you. This is such a great example. Manipulator in the definition that I say, of course, I love what you're doing. Oh, my God. The only manipulator on this show has been you thus far, because you know, shit, bro. You don't elevate. You don't elevate. We're all manipulators, I guess, around here. You're all ganging up against me. So I have. No one's ganging up at you. You know what they're ganging up on? They're ganging up on the fact that you have no logical basis of anything you've said for the last half hour. Logic doesn't deal with truth. It deals with validity. So sorry to tell you that logic. Logic does not deal with truth. Wait, wait, wait, wait. By that definition, your truth supersedes the truth. That's pragmatism. That's what works within your life. No, it's not pragmatism. I said. That is. Look at the definition. Look at the definition of pragmatism. Wait, wait, wait. Or being practical. It doesn't mean being practical. It's a different philosophy. We're going to call out another logical fallacy. False clause. Okay. Presuming that a real or perceived relationship between the things that one is because of the other. You just did that right now. Thank you very much. You are a man. I agree on the pragmatic perspective. Everything that has come out of your mouth thus far has been nothing but logical fallacies. Every single thing. You do. Now you're trying to. This is not logical. This is not the neocortex. By turning it back on the accuser, answering criticism with criticism. Practical application. Yes. You are like four for four right now. Yes, bro. Hold on. Hold on. You are not. You are not applying any practical application. Let's keep going. You're not winning in any of these things. I am. You're not winning at all. No, you're not. Mike. Mike. Mike. He is winning. He's winning in his own mind because he lives in his own truth. When you are a pathological person, you have a reality distortion bubble and no one is going to take you out of that until someone says, no, the worst thing you can tell a pathological personality. No, no, no, no. You can tell me no. I say thank you. I love no. I love no. You are not open to anything. Yes. I am not open because I'm correct. You just said. Because you're correct. You just said. Yes. Dude, that logic isn't truth. What the fuck are you talking about? Seriously. Okay. Okay. I will explain it. Explain it beautifully. Logic is based on some basic assumptions that are unprovable and you build upon that in order to have validity. And therefore, if those unprovable assumptions are wrong, you're wrong. You're right. That is. No, this isn't true. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. I asked him in the chat a little time ago to try and make his point about the archetypes in the theory of scientific validity better than him, but I don't know if you are answering questions today or it's just a guest and I would like to try. People seem to be looking forward to it. No, because they're literally looking to attack me. So now I'm being in the line of fire. Now who's ad hominem? Now who's ad hominem? Now who's ad hominem? Now who's ad hominem? Now who's making ad hominem attacks? Yes. It's mutual. It's mutual relationship. Dude, I've done nothing but attack your arguments in this entire thing and you have no counter argument for anything I've said. I countered every single point, so I don't know what you're talking about. Right now you're turning it into a very wrong thing. Why? Okay. How? How? How have you countered anything? You have not. Holy shit. Bro, you're losing 106 to nothing. We've countered every single thing. No one agrees with you. No one. But hold on. No one agrees with you. The problem is this, bro. The problem is no one agrees with you. And it's not, don't say anything about my tribe. We're on YouTube live streaming too. And by the way, this is a free call. These aren't my fucking clients. That's enough. I don't understand what these people are talking about. Good, good, good, good, good. Time out. Time out. We got to the point, guys. He agrees with himself. That's all it is. I'm my own point of origin. I am. I'm literally my point of origin. I am. I am. I am. I am. I am. I am. I am. I am. I am. My point of... What is that, hey guys. Ready? For those of you ready, right. Here we go. For those of you. Those of you can look up in the DSM 5 what's that called when you are the point of your own origin and you always agree with yourself? There's a cluster B disorder. That's it, that's it. Oh, really? It's funny. I don't. It's funny because you try to do that. When you were talking about binary binary thing of splitting, it was fine. The DSM was fine then, but now the DSM is not fine. Bro, you are a narcissist. You are, you suffer from narcissistic personality disorder. That is what's going on, bro. I worked on it for a long, long time, so I'm happy it succeeded. Nobody here is actually attacking you, they're just trying to have a reasonable argument with you. But have you... It's not reasonable because they're looking for anything in order to create a new narrative, but this is good. You're doing things correctly. All of you, you're supposed to do this. Just like how you do with your entire channel is what we're doing to you, right? Yes. So you're doing things correctly. I agree. I'm just asking a question, bro. I'm just asking a question, bro. This is the right way. I'm not against it. Just a quick question. Like, have you ever like been in an argument and admitted you were wrong ever, like in your life? Yes, I do. And when we look at the scenario, because I actually don't believe you. I don't need to explain to you specifically the scenario, but social media... I don't have to explain to you. It's like arguing with a stuffed animal or with an alpha male, if you want to define it in that way. But let's go. I'm against the idea of alpha male. But anyway, Raj, do you have anything else to say to me? Yeah. Yeah. I just... Okay. So you, I will say thank you very much, Raj, for all your questions. I really appreciate them. I understand your perspective and point of view. I see that the disagreement is the fact that I use inflammatory things in the beginning in order to create a kind of like fun drama situation within the channel. But in every single video, it's positive and high vibe. And therefore, I am not that person. I don't go say, oh, look, these people are stupid. Look how he looks there. We're like John Anthony lifestyle. I never attack any person personally or say they're very bad people or whatever, except maybe John Anthony lifestyles, I said, he's only attacking people, he doesn't do anything. Your entire channel is nothing but attacking other people. Yes, that's the outside. That's the cover of the book. That's the blurb of the book. That's the cover of the book. But Primal, I'm going to have to disagree with you. All right. Because I know Michael for a few years now. He's like an older brother at this point. And you said that, like you said that, oh, you only make the thumbnails to attack them just to cause drama, to get views, I assume, right? But in the videos, you're very... You admire these guys, right? Only, not admire, but study them. And I will say I would not use admire, it's studying because they're worth studying. But only the video with Anton, which I felt bad for the guy, I was a bit more aggressive in that way. But other ones, I'm totally neutral and nice. So I don't believe... Only neutral. Because you said... And objective, and objective, Michael. Totally objective. And scientific. I don't believe objectivity exists. I got one final question. I don't believe objectivity exists. So would you call yourself... Oh, we believe you believe in objectivity is not real. We 100% agree with that, you believe that. Would you call yourself... Thank you so much. I love the presupposition within that. That was good. Would you call yourself an entertainer? You're welcome, bro. I learned it from Beth. So you're an entertainer then, correct? I guess I am not. I am not an entertainer, no. Okay, then you just... Educate yourself. Because you said it's a joke. It's the cover of the book. I did not say it exactly like that, because remember when I speak about the archetype... Would you like to rewind the tape? I will explain. Yes, yes. But let me explain. I will explain. I will explain. I did not say it exactly like that, because remember when I speak about the archetype... Would you like to rewind the tape? I will explain. Yes, yes. But let me explain. Let me explain. Within the archetypes, the entertainer is the trickster. I am not, I am the... Similar to you, like the Viking attacking, that is the metaphor that I'm going for, rather than the comedian being funny. So I would not use specifically joke. I would say it's the hook, or the like breaking of the pattern, or whatever. So I would use it like that. I see. So you do believe in archetypes then? I do. Not as a metaphor. As a metaphor. As a metaphor. I see. Okay. Well, then you just... As a way to structure reality. So let's take a look. The innocent, the everyman, the hero, the rebel, the explorer, the creator, the ruler, the magician, the lover, the character, the gesture, the sage. Those are not the archetypes that I speak about, but I know those, I'm familiar with those. Okay. So I'm familiar with those, but that's not what I... Those are Jungian archetypes. Those are Jungian archetypes. Yes, but I'm not sharing Jungian things. It's a different thing. I'm sharing specifically... You're sharing... It's more about personal branding. No, this is more about personal branding than that. Oh, okay. I'm sorry. I apologize. We're living in your world. That's right. So could you tell us... Thank you. I love that. Oh, you're missing the point. Oh, I'm sorry, Rollo, because I don't belong in your world. I'm sorry that you want me to live in your world rather than my own. You are absolutely... You know what? That's the first thing you said. I'm sorry you want me to live in your world rather than my own. Yes. I have to break my world in order to live in yours. I'm living in reality, dude. Oh, I understand. I'm living in the real world. What is reality? Literally, you are living in your brain's interpretation of reality. I see. So everything correlates with reality. No, Raimo, no, no, no. What is reality? Okay. So these things have answers, right? Your sense perception is the way you perceive things, but whether or not I perceive things or don't perceive them does not change reality. The moon is 238,000 miles away from the earth, and if there were no humans on the planet, there would be no reality. I believe in reality. I believe in reality. I believe in reality. I believe in reality. I believe in reality. I believe in reality. I believe in reality. I believe in reality. I believe in reality. I believe in reality. If there were no humans on the planet, the moon would still be 238,000 miles away from the earth. There is a reality that is reality, and this is the problem. But you can say you love this, but the problem is you keep going after like red pill and menosphere people, and the issue is you say elevated. Not specifically. Just the people love them. Okay, cool, yes, but you say elevated. So what I need from you is to explain how are you elevating anyone? Where is the elevation? I see the hate. Sure. Very clearly see the hate. Thank you. Don't see the elevation. It actually is not. There is no hate. Stop. Show me. Show me the way you elevate people. First, let's speak about reality. I will explain to you my perspective, which is different, and it's not I feel or not. That's your perspective. It's not reality, and it's what you feel. Yes. Okay, it's pragmatic. It's pragmatic perspective. So you want some social proof or whatever. So you believe reality can be known and experienced, while pragmatists such as myself believe that all we can know is things that are working for us to get us the results we want, but we can never extrapolate that into general relativity, truth in general, in order to call that science, as you would call it, which is very similar to what Andrew Tate, when he was asked about XQC, he said that specifically, and then he was attacked for it. I believe in that. I cannot change it. I'm not a liar. I will never lie just to sound smart or something. on good. I do not believe we can understand fully reality as it is, or even fathom it. What we can know is what is working for us and share with others so that they will use it as frameworks to find patterns that work for us, but something in the future can break everything and get us to a next level that proves us wrong. And that's a part of the evolution and the beauty of life. Yeah, so you're describing, wait, wait, Michael, but can you answer his question? How are you elevated? I'm not sure to answer the other. Okay. Say it again, please. He asked you, he asked you verbatim, your channel is called Primal Stylist Elevated. Would you agree? That's the name of your channel. Okay. How are you elevating anyone with your content? Perfect. Perfect. First... It's not perfect. I'm just repeating what he said. It's not perfect. I'm repeating what he said. It means I have an answer for it. That's what I say when I say perfect. But you don't decide... First, there is no hate that you would call it in that way because it's the... Okay. Thank you. You're lucky. Bro, just answer the question, man. Illusion of hate. It's the illusion of hate. So it's a big difference. Secondarily, I am elevating people by giving them the tools for them to know how to practically build their tribe. And because they're building, they are the... No, no, motherfucker. I am. I am. No, motherfucker. I am. I am. You aren't. I am. You aren't. There's nothing practical. This is the reason why you're not a pragmatist because what you're doing doesn't fucking work. There's no practical application for your shit. Just give me time. I'm about to be right. You are a YouTube troll and a hater. Just give me time. All I need is time. You are a YouTube troll and a hater. And, bro, again, I'm not trying to say this to be an asshole. I'm really not trying to say this to be an asshole. Thank you. Thank you. But you look like you were carrying a little bit of body fat and that's not elevating people's status. That's not a good example. That's the criteria you're choosing for the elevation. That's one example. I'm elevating people's minds, which is beyond the body, which is temporary. By the way, no, no, one more time. If you read Grain Brain by Dr. Perlmutter, you're bad ass. Why should I read their... Like, you have people who are your leaders into the world. I understand. I am letting the world... I'm a first-hander as Ayn Rand, and I know everybody will get on me for this, rather than a second-hander. Most of us read Ayn Rand. Well, I am a first-hander. You don't know your audience. So, hate me, hate me, hate me for... Again, again, again, going back to victimhood. This is not a practical application. No, it's not victimhood. I love it. Hate me, hate me. I welcome it. No one said they hate you, bro. Hate is the opposite of love. You're picking a victim mentality. No, I am not. Once again, what you're doing is not... There is no practical application. You are not helping people, increasing their... How can I be a narcissist and a victim at the same time? No, that's literally how it works. Whoa, whoa, whoa, that's exactly how it works. No, no, no. Because I am not a narcissist, and that's why I'm not a victim. It's not the same thing. You are a victim and a narcissist. I know the truth. I know my truth, the truth that works, the practical pragmatic truth. My truth is what narcissists say. There is no my truth. There is the truth. OJ did or did not kill Nicole. There is or is not a moon. Don't ask me about OJ. I'm unrelated to the U.S. Say, is there a war in Ukraine? Yes or no? I will say yes. Are you sure? I mean, how do you know? I mean, maybe there is one. I was there. I told you. I was there. No, no, no. Hold on. Maybe since you left, they all packed it up, and it's just fake. You don't know. There's no truth. That truth means more to you because it affected your fucking life. But that's the only thing. You don't teach anyone anything practical. Other people are trying to help you. I do. I actually do very much. You don't. It's not in the videos about you. Yes. There was nothing practical. Okay, good. So we've been asking you four times. What is something, a practical thing, a specific thing that you've done... What is something that you've done to elevate someone's life? Be specific. How have you elevated anyone's status at all? Tell me. I elevated the status of my followers. What? Who? There's no one. First off, you have 186 followers, number one. And number two, how have you... I love it. Even one person in this world is worth... Okay, tell me. How did you elevate their status? How did you elevate their status? Go. What did you do? 100%. What did you do? I give them the keys to understand what people are doing to manipulate them so that they will judge the message rather than be enamored with the messenger. For example, that's one of the many things. No, you don't. But you don't. I do. I'm doing it. I do it. That is not elevating their status. Show me one thing that you do that elevates people's status. Okay. I show people specifically how to build their tribe so that they're not roaming, belonging to someone else's tribe. No, motherfucker. That's what I do. That's what I do. We do it differently. Mike, can I ask a question? I have a question. Okay. How have you applied this in your life to build your own tribe? That will be private information, but I'm applying it on YouTube in order to build my tribe. Of course it will be. Come on, man. Of course it is. Hey, bro. I have permission to speak. Bro, bro, bro. First off, homie, I get more death threats in a day than you've got in your entire life, and I live at 4525 Dean Martin Drive in Las Vegas, Nevada, and you're welcome to come by. But, motherfucker, I don't miss. Okay. I'm not telling for any of you. Don't worry about the fucking death threats. Bullshit. That's bullshit. I am living as a refugee currently, so people can mess with me when it's done. I don't care about sharing. Fuck people. So, literally. Can I ask you a question? Yeah, go ahead, Daxus. My friend. Thank you. Hello, hello. I love your mic, by the way. It's really cool. No, I will not take it. Thank you. Thank you very much. Well, for my own culture, that's a very appropriate thing to have, and therefore now you're attacking a culture that is not yours. Hey, motherfucker. I'm black. People attack me every fucking day. You want to try that shit? I'm born literally in Africa, so I'm more African than you. Daxus, he thinks you don't believe Black Lives Matter. That's what he's saying to you right now. Okay. All right. You're a Harvard student. You're a retired United States Air Force captain. I'm fine. I love it. It's good with me. You've convinced no one of your point. Beautiful. All right. So here's what we're going to do from this point on. Listen, got my blood up. So here's what we're going to do. Guys, I'm going to start calling on you by your hands. And here's the thing. It's Rolo's birthday. I don't want to ruin Rolo's birthday, although I think this is pretty funny. Well, here's what we're going to do. You guys. Because it's late around here. Okay, ready? So here's what we're going to do. You can ask questions to me or Kylie or Rolo or Primal. You guys can ask whoever. I'm going to call on you one-on-one. Primal, let's keep it to under four paragraphs, okay? With the answer. Here we go. Yusuf, what's your question? Yusuf, unmute yourself. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Yeah, go ahead, brother. Turn that volume down, please. Okay. Okay. No, I think. No, we're getting echo on everything. Bro, you need to either put headphones in or go to mute. Go to mute your audio. One of the two. Okay, now. First of all, thank you for the opportunity and to the AMA group. I love it. We've been having a lot. I have three questions, if you don't mind. If I take some more time. Go. Yeah. First question was about group chatting. When I have conversations with people, it's usually around with different friends. There are females. And the thing is that usually what happens is that I go directly into very vulnerable topics, which means a verbal in the sense that very intimate, too fast. Yeah. Which usually happens in group settings, which is not ideal. Okay. So, I ask this in the group. What are the goals or topics that you will talk about usually? Okay. Yusuf, let me help you. Ready? You cannot give value until you have value. This is one of the things where people get this wrong, that men need to be more sensitive and share more. Be sensitive and share more when a girl has shown you that she cares about you and want. It's like, understand that there's a level of trust there. Going up to strange women and being like, hey, I'm just really going through this tough stuff in my life. You're just her buddy now. Like she's an attraction for you. No, no, no. I think I refrained the question badly. I act like a psychologist. The thing is that I open people too fast. And it's usually done in a group setting. Okay. I don't know how to small talk. That's the thing. Oh, got it, got it. You know, I've had that issue, too. Oh, this is really tough. I used to follow this guy around here in Vegas who's really, really socially calibrated. And he would talk to people, these very high status people. In fact, Jason, he was one of the people who introduced me to Jason Sprouse. And I tried to get as close as I could. And I would listen to what his conversation was like. Do you know what they were? Do you want to take a guess? In a club. In a club. Going up to super high status people. Whoever. Fucking Dan Bilzerian, DJ Marshmello, whoever. What do you think the conversation is like? Take a guess. It would be about rumors, for example. Okay, ready? What up, bro? Hey, how's the weather? You doing good? Your family good? Oh, that's awesome, man. What else is up with you? That's it, bro. That's all. It's so fucking shallow. And it's hard. Because I'm just like you, man. I have a background in physics. When people want to have conversations with me, I want to talk about evolutionary psychology and quantum mechanics. But the reality is, what up, bro? You doing good? Cool. How's your family? When I talk to Bilzerian, I'm like, yo, what up, bro? You doing good? How's your family? Is everything good? Oh, cool, man. How's everything with the business? How's everything with the business? Not, hey, I heard that your father took over as CEO for Ignite. So what is the market cap of your company? No. What up, bro? You doing good? How's your family? It's simple. This is how a lot of high status people, not all, obviously not all. If you had a conversation with me, not all, obviously not all. If you had a conversation with Elon Musk and you want to talk to him about material physics, I've understood from other people who have gone up to him that actually works out really well. But for some people, for me, you can have a deep conversation. I appreciate those conversations. But for a lot of people, when they're in places where they're not really sure where they stand, like if you come to the Bunny Ball, you come to the Playboy Mansion, if you come to the Playboy Mansion and start talking about psychology, you're going to have one girl kind of look at you funny and then just walk the fuck off. But if you talk to them like, hey, what's up? You having a good time? It seems so superficial to either highly intellectual or very introverted people to say, hey, you having a good time? But that's what you do. It's going to make you feel cringy. This is how I felt in the beginning. Yeah, the thing that, Michael, is that you talk, the example that you put is in one-on-one basis. It's not that you're with a five- or six-person group and talking to everyone. Like the example that you put is you talk to someone, just that person, and you can open up. Hey, you guys doing good? What's up with you guys? Hey, what's up with you guys? You guys doing good? No, it's just plural. It's the same thing. Okay. Now, you start with that. Now, Yusuf, someone takes you to the side and be like, hey, man, what do you think about this invasion of Ukraine? Now we go to that next level, but wait, you cannot give value until you have value. Does that make sense? What does it mean exactly? Like having value? So consider this situation. A beautiful woman is walking down the street, okay? And a homeless person comes up to this beautiful woman and is like, hey, listen, I'm going through a really rough time, and blah, blah, blah, all this kind of stuff. And she's like, hey, get away from me. Now the same beautiful woman is walking down the street and Leonardo DiCaprio walks up to him and be like, hey, I'm just having a really rough day, man. It's been really crazy. And she's like, really? Leo, really? Tell me more. He gave value because he has value. And one of the things that you're trying to do is when you have these deep intellectual conversations, many intellectuals feel this way, their contribution to the world is to give value to their intellect. Do not give value, though, until you have value in their eyes. If you don't do that, what happens is you're doing this prematurely. Does that make sense? Just a little bit. You there? Yusuf, here's the other thing. Get them to talk about themselves. This is also very difficult for people who have high intellect or people who think they're in a room full of people that they think are not as intelligent as them. What I do, when I first met Kylie, I wanted Kylie to talk more about herself and me to talk less. Yeah. Okay? Yeah. You got it? Okay, so that's the thing. Hyperintellectual people, they want to hear, no, I actually have a problem. I have a solution for the global financial crisis. Here it is. I'm like, I just met you, motherfucker. Why are you talking to me about this? This is fucking weird and uncalibrated, so stop doing that. Hey, buddy, what's up? You doing good, bro? Cool, man. How about Messi going to the fucking French? Isn't that dope? Awesome. Very vague topics. Very vague, and it feels so fucking disingenuous the first time you do it, especially as an intellectual, but over time, you're going to understand. No, man, this is just like you're just kind of like two people nudging each other, just trying to feel in each other out. You don't walk into jail and just start fighting immediately. People kind of look at each other. You know what I'm saying? They're kind of attributing, oh, is this guy high status? Is this guy high status? You warm up to it, so the way you warm up to it is by small talk. Small talk is as basic and as dumb as you think it is, and it's dumb. It is dumb. For intellectual people, small talk is super fucking annoying. I know, but getting over that is such a massive, massive way for you to be able to network well. Please read How to Win Friends and Influence People, and also, please understand that you getting them to talk about themselves is so key. What will happen is this is so, it's such a weird phenomenon that will happen. You'll talk to somebody, they'll do 90% of the talking, and they'll be like, man, that guy's really interesting. Wait, I didn't say shit. You did 90% of the talking. It's a weird psychological effect that happens, okay? So can you try that and then come back to us? Just give me one small tip. Make them talk about themselves. Listen, it's just about that. I do that, and the thing is I don't know how to connect all the things that they say. Stop trying to connect it. Stop trying to connect things. Okay. Dope. What up, bro? Don't be connecting to them. Yo, man, we're having a good time. You having a good time? Yousef, you having a good time, bro? You having a good time, bro? You want a beer? Cool, man. You doing good, bro? Yeah, that's awesome. I'm doing good too, man. Awesome, man. Stay up, homie. Yeah. Shut the fuck up. Connecting? Shut the fuck up. Stop trying to connect shit. It's not like that in the beginning. In the beginning. Once you have deeper, like, all I do with Rolo now is we send each other evolutionary psychology articles. That's all we do now. But in the beginning, it was like, you doing good? Hey, man, big fan. Read your books. Basic. Dumb. Basic. Small talk. Dumb it down. Basic. You got it? Okay, yeah. It's real hard, man. Most of my clients are not dumb people. And those people, whenever you get them in small talk situations, they're like, fuck, I don't know how to talk to these people. Dumb. Basic. Basic. Dumb. Listen. You talk now. You talk now. And at first, it's just, it's so cringy. But then after a while, you understand, oh, okay, now I understand why we're doing this. They're insecure or maybe not super secure with the situation. And I give them the ability to become secure. It's almost like lube, right? Just, I was like, okay, now I understand what's going on. Okay, I feel like I can kind of trust you. You seem like you're smart. Hey, how about quantum teleportation? What do you think about that? We can go there later, but we can't start there, okay? Okay, yeah. Got it? Appreciate it. Now, Yusuf, with me, you can. With me, always. Anytime you guys wanna talk about geopolitics, history, anything, you guys can start. I've had people come up to me all the time. But the thing is, when they do it, I know, man, if you were talking to anybody else, they'd be like, dude, you're a fucking weirdo. But with me, it's fine, because I read 30, 40, 50 books a year. I love talking about highly intellectual stuff, but I also teach a networking course. And I know that most people are not on your wave link when you wanna have deep conversations about psychology. You see what I'm saying? Yeah, I mean, there's time for small talk and big talk, I mean. Just for right now, you need to focus on just small talk for the next six months. Nothing but small talk. Okay. Hey, Yusuf, Yusuf, Yusuf, Yusuf, if it makes you feel really dumb, that means it's working. Okay. It's gonna feel real awkward, and you're gonna feel real dumb. That means you're doing it right. And eventually, you're gonna- So actually, the goal won't be connecting people, like what they do or what they think, but just like- It's not a puzzle. You're just connecting person to person. But like, that happens. It's just so hard. And if you've ever seen like two girls be like, oh my God, that's my bitch. They have not had any discussion about anything of any substance whatsoever. They just fucking like each other because of their energy. But you can see they're connected. How are they connected? Because it's nothing but small talk. Okay? Got it? Hey, Mike, can I give some advice there? Go ahead, Tristan. Yeah, Yusuf, okay. It's gonna be very random, but I think this will help you. There is a song I want you to listen to and just do what the song says. It's called Big Papa by Biggie Smalls. Follow the verses of that song and you'll be fine. Okay, I'll try it. Okay, thanks. Can I interject and just say something to Yusuf? Sure. Yeah, go ahead. Sure. It depends on your goal. If you want to enter a tribe that already exists, you have to act in a way that makes you a safe member of the new tribe. But if your goal is to create a new group of people or a new tribe, you have to be more yourself, repulse most people and get the few who will love you to be in love with you. And therefore, it's not about, you will have to change yourself to belong to new tribes. Well, you have to be more of yourself in order to build the tribe of the right people who you can be authentically yourself more about. So it's a different situation. It's about, I sense a fear of rejection right there. And that's why you care what they will think. And it's stronger to get used and do some rejection therapy in order to not care at all. And then you can choose to either behave in a way that makes you accepted by new people or do the opposite by having so much clarity that 99% of people will think you're crazy and hate you, but 1% will love you. Bro, that's not. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I mean, the first part of your argument is basically trying to overcompensate that I may feel inferior to them, which is already- No, I did not say inferior. I did not say inferior. I did not feel inferior. It's the assumption that the second part of the answer is actually polarizing, like taking a polarizing answer and being like this myself. And if they like it or they don't like it, I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about connecting people, not about me. Yeah, okay, Yusef, Yusef, Yusef, do whatever you want. Just, I gave you some advice. All right, let's go to the next one, man. Yeah, got you. Hey, I hope to see you soon. Gracio, what's your question? All right, hello. So just to add something to what Yusef said, I think that Yusef, basically what happens is that people don't care enough about you, at least initially, to actually be vulnerable and to be talking about deep stuff with you at first. And after some time, when they have enough comfort with you, then, and of course, through that comfort, you showcase enough value, then they start to open up to the possibility of being talking about more deeper stuff with you. Please, that is my- Gracio, I think they could just be comfortable. You don't even have to show value. Like, I have some friends that I enjoy talking to, and they have no value at all, other than they're enjoyable to talk to, and they're really good listeners. It really is interesting. And that is exactly what I'm saying. That's it. And that's exactly what I'm saying, the value. Being a good listener is the value. Exactly right, yeah. Exactly, exactly. No matter what it is, you do need to probably start off with small talk. Now, again, when I go to Harvard, and I was sitting there with, there was a professor I know there, and I'm sitting there with Tristan, and we're having a conversation, there's very little small talk. We go right into deep socioeconomic stuff, because he's a Harvard professor, and Tristan is a student at Harvard, and I'm a former US military officer, and I was a former counterintelligence officer. So we're gonna talk about geopolitical stuff. But for most people in cool social situations, hell no. What up, y'all? Y'all doing good? Awesome, fist bump. Just try the fist bump. What up, man? Fist bump. Listen, listen, listen. Watch what happens. And then later on, when you guys go to the after party, or you're having fucking breakfast at 2 a.m., then go into this thing. You know what? Isn't it crazy that we're all hairless murder apes? Evolutionary psychology. Bang, that's fine. But do it then. Don't give value until they see you having value. Got it? Make sense? Yeah. Beautiful. Ronny, what's your question? No, I didn't ask my question. Oh, sorry, sorry. Go ahead, go ahead. No problem. One of the last calls that we had, we had a guy here named Eric Tang, talking about the fact that he was having problems with his conversion rate when calling, DMing people. And one of the issues that I think that he had is that the first picture that he pinned on his Instagram was just like too much when it comes to touching the girls. And I see comparing his picture with yours, even though he has a killer Instagram, is that the way that you touch girls on your Instagram is not necessarily sexual. It's friendly, but not sexual. And the way that he's touching these girls is too sexual to the point where I put myself in the position of girls, when he sends a cold DM to a girl that he has never seen before. And they look at this picture that he has here that is just like as if he was a pimp, not in a good way. It doesn't pass a good, trustworthy impression to the girl. And because of that, that can have a problem with the conversion rate. The person that I learned that from was Corey Che, by the way, your photographer. Yeah, so Corey and I talk about this a lot. And this is the concept of, they need to be touching you, you're not touching them. Like that's where that comes from. So no, that's a really great point. I didn't see that before, but yeah, guys in your content, whenever there's a, if it's possible, you wanna show, you want them to show compliance to you, whether it's somebody watching you, listening to you talk, or if it's a girl and they're like up close, they need to have their pelvises turned in towards you. And I would avoid putting your hands anywhere on them in any of your media whatsoever. And you will see that translates way better. I would highly recommend that if you guys look at my content, my copy, you'll notice that in every case, there's girls. We had one where there was this girl and I was leaning over and I was talking to her. I was like, dude, get that out of my video. There's no me leaning over and talking to girls. Girls are talking to me or they're touching me. I am not touching girls. And that's the way we do it. And by the way, I would highly recommend that for your content. The second thing is lascivious content is a problem. No booty shaking in the back, mashing titties together. Between attractive and lascivious, we always choose attractive. We never choose lascivious. Lascivious, while it may boost a little bit of preselection, it also destroys comfort from women who don't know you. So never between attractive and lascivious, we always choose attractive. And we wanna show people complying. It's our social media. This is our home. This is our town. In our city, in our social media, we show people complying with us. That's it, because social media is fake. Do people always comply with us? Of course not. Do you guys ever look at the videos of the parties I go to with Sky Rigdon or whoever makes the videos or Corey Chaloff? It looks like there's 787 girls and three guys. That's on purpose. Is it real? Of course it's not real, but it's a sign of status because generally higher status parties have a more girl to guy ratio. This is true in the Hamptons. This is true in Brickell. This is true in Abu Dhabi. This is true in Dubai. This is true in fucking Monaco. This is true in Paris. This is true in London. This is true in Mexico City. This is true in Los Angeles. Like the higher status people, they're in places with more beautiful women. If you are sitting and you had box seats in the Superbowl, you look around, there's a bunch of women there. That's how it works. That's how high status places work. Now, it's one of the ways to show high status. It's not the only way, but it's a way to show high status. And the way we do that is, again, we still show compliance, but what we don't do is we're like, hey, did you see my girl I got here? Yeah, come here. That's the worst thing to do. That destroys comfort. We don't want to show girls groping themselves or us touching girls. We want to show, hey, girls are here of their own volition. They're having a great time. And other girls are like, hey, that sounds like a great time. I'll come there too. That seems like a fun place where I can come. And if I want to stay and have a good time, I can. And if I want to leave, no one's going to stop me. Everyone feels free and easy. They can come and go as they please. And everyone at the party has their own agency. That's what's really important that you show. So great point, man. Great point. Michael, I'm going to go, because it seems there is nobody who has questions for me. Thank you so much for inviting me here today. It's very gracious of you. I enjoyed the conversation. Thank you, every single person who interjected. And I appreciate your time. I wish you a great and fantastic day. Michael H has a question for you. Michael, go ahead and ask your question. Yes. I'm sorry. Thank you for letting me ask my question. My question for you was, after you listening to all these videos, and analyzing all these characters, and seeing how they do their part of the social media, why don't you think, oh, they're doing a good job. Let me just do the same thing they're doing and try to offer value to your subscribers. So assuming I don't offer value, which means you didn't watch any of the videos, which means I understand your assumption. Please watch my most recent live stream, for example, or anything, and you will see how I'm adding value to the community. And thank you so much. I appreciate your question. But let me just follow up. So let's say I'm not really into social media, or I'm not really looking at all these people. You're not really offering much value outside of that. You're just speaking about other people and trying to speak their ideas or what they're doing. Why don't you just try to make your own content for the people that are not? That's what it seems like, but not what I'm doing. So thank you for asking that. I am doing whatever you feel you're criticizing me for. But it's the difference between the appearance and the reality. So the reality is I'm doing what you're saying. But the appearance, I understand. It can cause you to ask that question. So it's very understandable. But when you do the appearance and it's not working, don't you think it's time for a change? That's your opinion it's not working. There is factual. There is views. There is numbers that you can go off of. Within two months, where do you expect me to be? Like, literally, I have no viral or anything. And therefore, I'm building it with hard work rather than luck. So to me, it's progressing. And that's what we look for in life, is that you're constantly progressing. And that's what matters. Yes, comparing myself to yesterday, I'm growing. And so it's great. Every single day. OK, that's all for me, to be honest. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. OK, Ronnie, who else? Did anybody else have a question for Primal before we let him go? Nobody? Just talk, guys. Unmute yourselves. It's a men of action course. Just grab your nuts and unmute yourself. I have a final question for you, Michael. Go ahead. OK, for him. Then goodbye, everyone, and thank you. All righty. So what are the things that you would consider when developing a podcast for developing your status, where you live? Because this is what I'm doing right now. I'm focusing on producing my own podcast, but with the goal of having its content as something that can leverage when I'm co-DMing people for my events. It's so great. So the guys who do the Real Madrid podcast, they're in MOA. We have this conversation with them. I was like, hey, I want to leverage this into something else. And I'm like, well, can you talk about other things besides Real Madrid? And they're like, eh, not really. I was like, well, I mean, what about something that women might be interested in? No, I can't really do that. Just Real Madrid. That's all I'm doing. Picking the topic might actually be kind of helpful. Now, if you look at Lex Friedman, if you look at Joe Rogan or some other people who are really popular, who's interesting that Impulsive wouldn't have on? Or I don't know if you guys have seen the Stevo podcast. These podcasts, they don't tie themselves down to anything. And I don't either. There's an underlying theme of evolutionary psychology in my podcast, but there's nobody I can't interview. There's nobody who I won't talk to. Does that make sense? So that would be something is like nailing yourself down to one thing can kind of be kind of a problem. I will say that there's some issues like Ryan Ponwall is that, or Polnow, Polnow. I never say his fucking name right. From Pillow Talk. He's surrounded by hot women all the time. Why? Because he interviews porn stars. That's what he does. And so that he's chosen to do that. But he has a very, very expensive studio. And he also lives in Los Angeles. And the production for what he does is quite, quite expensive. So that's one thing that you'd have to consider. And he does it all in real life. And he's built himself up to where like every porn star in Los Angeles wants to go on a show. Now, is that what you want? That's not necessarily what I want. That's why I don't do a show like his, right. I'm interested in what they have to say but I don't want to do a show about porn stars. I want to do a show about people in general, right. So that's a decision that you have to make. So the subject matter is one thing. But as far as like using it for status, subject matter expertise is something that I found. But here's the thing, man. It's so fucking basic and janky. It's a lot of times it's just, can you make a viral 60 second clip and put it on IG or TikTok? Guys, I'm gonna tell you right now. No Jumper. Why is No Jumper famous? Anybody remember? What made No Jumper just explode in popularity? Does anybody remember? Or go? No, that one girl, what's her name? It was a Selena. What was her name? I forgot what her name was. Alyssa. Selena Powell. Yeah, but Selena Powell had that homegirl, her homegirl with her. And she goes, I suck their dicks. I suck their dicks. There was like seven guys in the room and I sucked every, all you guys remember that shit. That shit went mega viral, 70, 80 million views. He goes, there's seven guys that came in and I sucked their dicks. And he goes, oh, for real? That shit went so viral. It blew up afterward. It was so popular. He gave those girls their own show. And all they did was trash African-American men. So they canceled the show. Do you guys remember this? That's what happened. So it was this one, it's these one or two things, most viral moment ever on Joe Rogan. What is it? What do you guys think? Elon Musk smoking weed. You guys remember that? Tell me, tell me about six other things that happened on that episode. Anything. You can't bro. Hairless murderers. One more time. One more time, dude. I know, I know it doesn't seem like a really good prescription for our society. The answer is 60. Can you make a 60 second clip that just pops? Cause if you do that, that'll, that'll make it happen. That is actually how you're going to use it for status. Okay. Now the funny thing is Rolo and I, you know, Axis Vegas, we're doing 20, 30 K views per episode. That's not huge, but it's crazy how much exposure it gets when we put it on Instagram or on TikTok or on reels or shorts or reels or whatever. We do that. It's pretty maddening. How now when I try to get girls to come on the show, they're like, I have too many. Before I couldn't get four girls to come on. Now I have to cut it at eight. Why? Because the status that it creates, subject matter expertise, exposure, are some girls clout chasing maybe, but they get a platform to talk. You know what I'm saying? How is it that fresh and fit after all the like stuff they say about girls on that show? Why are there girls lined up 30 deep every three days a week to come on the show? Why? Cause status is status is status. And like I said, for a million times, a girl does not need to like you to want to sleep with you. She doesn't need to even enjoy your fucking company. She just has to be attracted. And I watch these girls that, that Rolo will, Rolo, that Myron will trash. And right after the show, cause I did remember I did five shows, four shows with him. Right after the show, I watched these girls and they're just following him around like a puppy dog. And he was trashing them the whole show. It's crazy, but it's not because he was an asshole. It's because he stuck to his frame and he has a ton of status. They looked up there and they see a hundred dollars, super chat, $200, super chat, $500, super chat. That's what they saw. And then that created this. Obviously it's not going to work for every girl, but for some girls, that's what, that's the way it worked. Does that make sense? Totally, totally. Thank you. It's the really basic monkey brain explanation. That's the correct explanation. Let's go to Ronnie. Ronnie, what's your question? Thanks. First time being here. So I'm a San Francisco photographer. I do a lot of runway shows. I kind of want to do some more like a Airbnb type of photo shoots, but I'm not sure how to get like those large. I mean, I've seen some of your photo shoots and they're like huge mansions and like, it looks really sick, but I'm kind of wondering how do you set all that up and get the sponsors and stuff for like. So you do that, okay. You do runway shows, right? Yeah. Guys who are in MOA, unmute yourselves. Who should he be asking to get those locations? Girls. Models. Models. Autos. See how they all knew the answer? How was that though? I don't understand that. Okay, so you want to get like a free spot, like a mansion, right? To go shoot. The guy who bought the mansion, did he buy the mansion so that he couldn't be around hot girls or that he could be around more hot girls? What do you think? So like with Airbnb though, it's, you know. Forget Airbnb. When we're talking about level one, remember there's four levels to getting like a location. That's, oh, I'm sorry. You haven't taken MOA. My bad, my bad. In MOA, we're talking about level four right now. And if you want a free location, I never pay for locations. Why do I not pay for locations? Because a girl will come up to me and be like, yo, so-and-so is at this house. And I was like, I was telling him, hey, do you want to have a photo shoot here with like 30, 40 girls? He's like, fuck yeah. You show up, he's not creepy. He caters the whole thing and you get to use his house for the whole day. In fact, some of the people will even stay at the house. Who are the, again, who would know best which guys are thirsty to have a bunch of girls at their house? Wink, wink. A bunch of girls at their house. Who would be able to give you that information? I mean, I assume all men are kind of a little bit on the thirsty side. So go to their place. No, who's the one telling you though? I'm not sure. I'm not following. I'm sorry. We just gave you the answer. You said girls. Yes. Do you understand? Which girls? Kylie, did you know any dudes back in, when you were in Houston that always bought tables and you knew you could just go to their table all the time? Yeah. I got you now. Now I know what you're talking about. Okay. Okay. Those dudes, those fucking whales who like want photo shoots at their fucking 16 bedroom mansion, who do they reach out to? Who are they trying to get at? The same models that you have on your runway. Okay. The information comes from the girls. It's so hard. So many dudes don't grasp this. You know who's going to introduce you to your next girlfriend? Girls. You know who's going to find you your next sponsor? Girls. Again, that's one of the problems with this very like somewhat misogynistic woman hate culture in the, in the menosphere. Like I, like, you know, when, when, when Myron talks about women are useless, I don't think they're useless. Women are fucking great. I love women. Women are incredible for networking. They're unbelievable. If you want to get into a party in the Hamptons where every, like there's like eight or nine billionaires in there, the, the ticket to get in the party is? Girls. Oh my God, bro. Running. There's, there's hope for you yet, bro. Thank you. I appreciate it. Got it. Beautiful. Awesome. SB, what's your question? Oh, let's start talking. Sorry. My phone was trying to figure out how to use the zoom. Okay. We'll turn your camera on, say hi to everybody. Oh, that's okay. I'm camera shy. Okay. So my, my question is about table game. So in Vegas, normally I help my friend get into a table game and I'm like, okay, I'm going to do a table game. And I'm like, I'm going to do a table game. And I'm like, I'm going to do a table game. So in Vegas, normally I help my friend get into the club. Right. Yeah. And he wants to join a table, but lately the person that owns the table, who I'm not friends with, tells him to pay a tip. I'm wondering, is this normal in Vegas? Yeah, it is pretty normal. To always have to pay like a $50, like tip. Yeah. Because that guy usually got a comp. So it's funny, the tables with the most pretty girls in Vegas actually are comps. They're usually comps. It's usually one guy who's a promoter or something and all the girls are either atmosphere models. Well, that's the thing. The guy claims that he's not a promoter and yet he goes out every single night. So who is the guy? Oh, I can't talk. Oh, I don't know. I don't know the guy. You can text me the guy. I've only been to his table once. It's pretty common to have that happen. Now, does it happen for me? No, because I don't drink. And I'd only stay at tables for like 10, 15 minutes. I don't stay for very long. But if he's going to sit there and drink, yeah, he's probably going to have to tip. If I drank a lot at a table, 100% I would leave 50 bucks. If him leaving 50 bucks is a problem, he needs to change his occupation. Spending $50 on alcohol in Las Vegas, if that is a problem for you, there's a deeper problem besides some dude asking you for $50. Oh, well, I'm just wondering because the guy also, the promoter guy, also asked for me to tip as well. That's why I'm, because in New York when I go clubbing, I'm not used to tipping at tables. Yeah, you need to tell me who this promoter is. Message me offline. Something's wrong there. If he's asking you to tip, something else is going on. Yeah, that's what I thought as well. You should not be asking girls to tip. Unless it's a birthday and it's all girls, then you would be asking the girls to tip, yes. Okay, and how would I be able to, how would I be able to help my friend to get into tables? Because I'm used to table hopping on random tables in Vegas. Because you're a girl, you can do that. He's a guy, he doesn't, he has a penis. We don't have any, I don't want him at my table. Bro, I don't know who the fuck your dude is. There's no fucking way. If I have my birthday party, keep him away from me. I would literally tell Rocky, get that motherfucker out of here. Why would I want him any of my table? He needs to develop some value first. What is a way he could do that? What's a way he could do? Why do I get invited to everyone's table when I go out on a weekday? Because you bring 20 girls. Well, not only that, but what if I don't bring 20 girls? What's another reason why? Well, because you know everybody. Because I know everybody. Because on social media, they follow me and they talk, oh man, that meme you posted was hilarious. Or I watched your last episode. What value does he provide? Understand for women, you can be a really attractive and you're gonna get invited to everything. For men, there's got to be a ticket and the ticket is some kind of value. There's no cheat code. There's no words I can tell him to say. I don't want your, I don't know your guy friend. I don't want him at my fucking table. I don't. I want there to be 27 fucking girls and four dudes. That's it. Let's be, if you like, say if you bring your guy friend but you have like six other female friends, then he's good. Then he's good. By the way, one other thing. It won't happen because like, I'm sorry, but that's just the way guys think. We just want all the other guys away. One other thing, SB, if you walk up to a club and it's the guy and six girls, he needs to talk to the door guy. If you talk to the door guy, the door guy is gonna tell you the six girls can come in and he can't. He needs to be a leader. He needs to be a leader, okay? Got it? Okay. Is there door people? Is there like a doorman though in Vegas or no? It's just all hosts. Wait, are you not? Yeah, the door guy. Yeah, that's what we mean by hosts. It's different for different cities. Like you guys have individual door guys in New York. In Vegas, the guys at the door are hosts. They're junior hosts. Oh, okay. Got it. Hey, SB, do me a favor. Yeah, because I was just wondering, it seems like there's like a lot of hosts. SB, do me a favor. I need you to read the book, Very Important People by Ashley Mears. Okay. Okay? It's gonna answer a lot of your questions, okay? Oh, wait, can you say that again? Very important people by Dr. Ashley Mears, Boston University. Okay. Got it? That is actually a book about table game. All right. Thank you. Got it? All right, cool. Andrew, what's your question? I have a question about the Power of Now book. Yes. So I read it one time. I'm having trouble looking at the clock all the time. You're looking at the clock while you're reading the book? No, I understood that book one time. So I know what that means, the clock, like the Power of Now. I'm confused, bro. What are you talking about? I think he's saying that he's not, he's having trouble being present to the moment. He keeps on looking at the clock. Yeah, so you're talking about the present moment. Yeah, I'm having trouble always looking at the clock. I always exercise and do all this stuff too. And I still always look at the clock. I'm a little confused about why you keep looking at a clock, but like when you read the book, one of the things you, like it's about present moment awareness. Yeah, I know. So basically you're describing that you're not doing the thing that is described in the book. No, I'm saying that I understood what it meant in the book, but I'm just having a hard time. Okay, so it's not understand. You actually have to do it. That's why it's called the Minute of Action course. So here's the thing. If you're having trouble not being able to listen to what's on the book and you look at the clock, go find a cold plunge. All of a sudden you will become very present very quickly. Okay? Another thing, take a rubber band, put it around your wrist and pop yourself in the fucking wrist with a rubber band. You will all of a sudden become very present very quickly. Do you notice how people don't have a problem getting distracted whenever they get into a car accident and they're trying to get out of the car? All of a sudden they're not distracted at all. They know exactly what they're doing. Very focused, very much in the present moment, not concerned about answering emails, concerned about survival. You see how survival can put you into the present moment? Yeah. Let's use that as a technique. Okay? Thank you. Beautiful. Dax, what's your question? Hello? Yeah. My camera not on? No, it's not on, buddy. There we go. All right, okay. So I have a question about setting boundaries and it kind of ties in with the thing you're talking about with Fresh and Fit. Don't really like the way that they were talking to the people on Axis Vegas. I agree. But at all. But ironically, I kind of have the opposite issue. I've always been the nice guy, the beta, whatever. Not really been an issue. But when I try to do something, for example, if I invite some people over and I say, yeah, just y'all come over. And then they bring two, three more people. I'm at a, I'll call it- Bunch of dudes. Bunch of dudes. I'll call it a social crossover, right? There's two avenues you can go down. Okay. People tell me, and I'm not, I promise you I'm not. But people tell me that I'm an intimidating person. I'm really not. If I try to establish a boundary, draw a line in the sand and said, hey, I said, just you and you. What are him and them doing there? Just do it with a smile on your face. Hey man, unfortunately, so what I'll do is I'll create a construct. So for instance, there was one time there's this girl, she was coming out to a comp table that we had. This was probably three, four years ago. She comes up and tattoos are all, you couldn't see it on her IG. Tattoos all right here on her face. Tattoos down her cheek, tattoos right here. Top of her boobs are tattooed. Tattoos completely covering her body. And then piercings all over her body. And I told her, I was like, hey, this is not a comp. Somebody actually bought the table and they're not going to want you in there, unfortunately. And she was upset at first, but I was honest with her. I told her what the construct was. Same thing with bulls-arians parties. I'm like, hey, I just want to let you know they're only letting so many girls in and they didn't let you in. Here's the funny thing. Okay, so let's go. First off, let's back up a second. I thought somebody was going to ask me this earlier in the show. Toy and Myron. I talked to Toy after, you know, Toy got kicked off Access Vegas last Thursday. Toy went there with the intent of calling out Myron. Just so we're clear. Toy, her ex-boyfriend is Mike Rashid. Mike Rashid is friends with Myron. And when Toy showed up, which by the way, I love Toy, Toy can come on anytime she wants, but I didn't invite her, Rolo did. When she came on, she was telling Rolo that she's going to kind of like show Myron, you know, what the truth is. She was just going to sit there and be a little bit combative. I don't think she recognized how fast it escalated. I think she maybe was open to the idea that she was going to get kicked off at some point. I just don't think she understood how quickly she triggered Myron. Now, here's the second thing. Access Vegas is paid for, the studio time is paid for by Michael and Rolo. When fucking Fresh and Fit were there, you notice they opened the show. That was their show. That wasn't my time. If me and Raj or me and Tristan, let's say we're on Fresh and Fit in Miami and Myron wants to kick a girl off, me and Raj can't stop Myron from kicking someone off his own show. That was their show. That was their. time. It was purchased and paid for by, it wasn't by them. It was somebody else who paid for the time, but it was for them. It was not for Rolo and me. So I couldn't stop them from kicking her off. Does that make sense? And I'm not excusing it because obviously I wouldn't have handled it the same way, but Toy did come there as a cruise missile ready to explode. And the next day, I don't know if you guys saw, within 24 hours, she had a response video that was 58 minutes long and with clips from different stuff. Like that wasn't that some of this was on purpose. Do you guys understand? Pretty meditative. It was a little bit premeditated. Now I would never have called her or anyone else a dumb hoe on my show. That's something that Myron does. That's not something that I do. So that's where, that's where the disconnect is. Okay. But Toy and I are cool. We talked about it later. Toy is going to come on Access Vegas again. And here's the crazy part. The girls who got kicked off of Fresh and Fit, like Kay Jenkins or even Toy Hardy, if they ask them to come back on, what do you think, guys? You think they're going to say yes or no? Anyone want to take a guess? Of course, yes. Absolutely. Yep. They're going to say yes. Again, it is your, it is your job as a man to protect your friends. It is not your job to save them. Got it? Okay. If my homegirl is going to get beat up by somebody in a parking lot, it's my job to protect her. If she keeps going back to her fucked up ex, it's not my job to save her. Got it? Okay. Makes sense. Bam. Yeah. The, um, I just don't like when men talk to women like that. I totally understand. And you know what I wish would happen is afterwards is that there were some kind of consequence for it and there's none. They just get more views. And the other thing, the other thing I want to, the other thing I want to point out, Dax is that you understand the point of Access Vegas is to not do that, right? We're not kicking anyone off our show. Additionally, when you see Access Vegas in order for us to get a, um, a fucking audience, I need to go on Fresh and Fit, but don't get it wrong. I love, I actually like Myron a lot, but I got, I'm going to go on Fresh and Fit and I'm going to go on whatever podcast and I'm going to go on pearly things and I'm going to go on purple pill because I need an audience for my show where we don't kick girls off. Do you see what I'm saying? Yes. If there was a pickup artist who had a bunch of clients and had a huge following on social media. And I knew that I was better at teaching what he's trying to teach than he was. This has actually happened a couple of times. Guys have had me on their show. And then all of a sudden I like have a ton of their clients. Should I not go on their show or should I go on their show? Go on the show. Yeah. Jesus did not eat with the fucking Pharisees. He ate with the prostitutes and the tax collectors. Okay. Yeah. There's a discussion being had and I have to make a decision. Do I want to be a part of the discussion or not? Do I agree with everything I entertained and said, no, but I want to be part of the discussion. And there's a lot of things that he does that I'm like, man, that is fucking really innovative. That is really innovative. What he's doing. So you have to make a decision. Do you want to be a part of the discussion or not? Go ahead. I don't have a brand to live by. I mean, Michael, he does off camera. He's nice to everybody, but like when the cameras are, that's true. He has to put the front on super, super fucking nice. And by the way, if, if toy had not done exactly what she had done by calling out my crash, it, no one would've got kicked off that day. No one would've got kicked off. Wasn't even close to anybody getting kicked off. Toy is again, you know, when you show up to a, when you show up to a fucking convention in riot gear, people are more likely to riot. Okay. When you come charging in there, like I'm not saying toy did anything wrong. It's just, I'm not surprised. She got kicked off. Me, Kylie and Rolo all thought she was going to get kicked off as soon as the show started. Okay. And my thing is, yeah, my thing is, so I just kind of leads into another question. It's because I've always, I'm not that I've always been like the, you know, super greatest hosts of hosting events or anything, but I DJ parties for, I still DJ, but I DJ parties for five years. Every fight broke out, anything that got stolen, anyone who was vomiting on the floor, it was always dudes, dudes, starting fights, dudes, stealing stuff, dudes are doing this. So when I, you know, try to be, my thing is all about building comfort with my guests. You know, they come in, give them a house tour. They want water. They want something else. It's fine. I can accommodate anything, but it's just, you know, I try to make it a distinction. It's like, listen, like I know you trust these people. I don't know these people, the people that came in to my house that weren't warranted. One was hilariously drunk. Man was six, six, six, six foot, six tall, hilariously drunk. Another one brought a knife into a half a million dollar house. One of like eight in a neighborhood. You think I'm going to stat you, you think I'm a physical threat in my own, this is that social smooth brainness that a certain fellow that was on here earlier seems to share it's it's, but then they might feel like, well, that's my friend or that's my, this, that's my, that why they can't come in is because I don't trust them. It's because I don't trust them. They're not, they haven't been vetted by me. Like when you made it for sure. So, so set a boundary. No, you, you definitely write for setting a boundary there. There's nothing wrong with what you're doing. Well, actually I didn't even, I let them in, but like the whole, it's really like, it gets annoying to me. There's these women who like, again, when we, when we do a Maxim party or something like that, or like a really high status party at Playboy mansion, the girls who try to bring their boyfriends in and they just, they're just met with a very, very harsh reality. And then what happens after a while is they usually just give up and they're like, Oh, the high status men are in the party, not here with me. And they usually leave. And that's, if you guys want to read about, it's really, really sad story about the playmate who was murdered by her boyfriend with shotgun back. I want to say the 1970s or eighties, if you guys want to look it up. And what happened is she was, you know, they worked together like a Denny's or something like that. That's why I always say the Denny's manager. I use that example. They, they decided she started modeling. She posed for Playboy. She got in Playboy he hung around the house and then Hugh Hefner just didn't like him. And then eventually he was banned from the house. And then he consistently acted jealous, jealous, jealous. Then she started hanging out with celebrities. Then she started dating a celebrity. Then she broke up with him and he said, don't break up with me. They met one last time and he murdered her. That's, that's what happens. So, you know, it's just one of these things where you, you just have to understand, you have to, you have to come to a realistic understanding. Yeah. Dorothy Stratton. That's exactly her name. You have to understand like where, you know, these things happen from a lack of abundance, scarcity. These people think that they're high status. And then all of a sudden you put them in a different situation. They're not high status anymore. That's what happens. We are, you know, fucking apes that we're always searching around the room for status and women are more acute to seeing status than men are. That's another thing. They're far more socially acute than men could ever hope to be. The only reason that we, we get out of bed, dress up, do anything is literally for growth because we're the ones who have to earn. But my thing is, so even say, for example, in the future, right, I'm just going to say I'm a DJ and I want to have a small listening party at my house. And I invite a few people and then they say, Hey, can I bring this person to that person? I swear they're cool. They're fine. And I don't know them and probably never even seen their face before. Let's make it real quick, real quick. Yeah. Sorry. No more, no other guys. You'd be shocked how many times you say no other guys that the girl initially has pushed back. And then her response is wow. Okay. No other guys. This is actually where the high status men are. I'm going to leave my boyfriend at home. You'd be shocked at how often that happens. Okay. Yeah. How do you vet men to pick to come in? Like, so someone running security or I used to cover charge, bring some alcohol. Uh, what, what my buddy, uh, Ortega, Chris Ortega, his is really simple. You can come if you have 10 girls with you, period. If you can't, if you don't have 10 girls with you can't come period. That's how it works. When he shows up with three and the guys like, Hey man, you have three girls with you. Can't come. Guess what happens? The girls just go in. Is it not strange? Sorry. Is it not strange? I'm just the only male trust me. That will never happen. If you try to throw a party, do not think this is ever going to happen. If you want a hundred girls to show up to your party, invite 10,000. If you want a hundred guys to show up to your party, invite zero dudes are cockroaches. There's going to be guys that will get into your party. You're going to have no idea how they got it. Trust me. Dax, this is not something you need to worry about. You never need to worry. If you have a party with hot girls, you never had any have to worry about are there. There's not enough guys here. There's always going to be enough guys. Okay. Okay. And I mean, other than that, what, um, what else would you recommend to just make everyone, everyone, all my guests just feel comfortable. I mean, you said, you said, you said something really cool. You said, you know, um, girls pour the drinks, guys don't pour the drinks. I agree with that. I'll tell you a new thing, put a, put a runway up there and let anyone go walk up and down the runway. That, that is a fucking genius thing. Uh, that, uh, that Nino Venturella started doing at, um, the bunny ball, genius, lots of photo booths, lots of red carpets, lots of runways. That's what I would do. And then food and beverage. Okay. Food beverage, lots of runway. Okay. Um, um, yeah, as far as the top of my head, I, I just, I mean, so do you think that like, honestly, you don't agree with these, these, these people, like their, their viewpoints, but I mean, did it not cross a boundary to you when they were talking to her? Sorry, I forgot. We're talking to a toy. Yeah, of course they did, but, but it's not my show. Isn't it your show? No. One more time. Let me say this again. When Michael and Rolo are doing access Vegas, that time slot is paid for by Michael and Rolo. What you watched was a time slot paid for by fresh and fit. Well, it wasn't paid for by them, but it was gifted to them. Okay. Someone paid for that time slot. It was not me. It was not my show. Okay. I understand. I just always see you every, every on it. I just assumed it was your thing. Of course. Of course. And that's, that's the way we wanted to brand it. Cause I wanted more, more subscribers. It was, and trust me, a lot of other people complain, but toy didn't and her and I are cool. Okay. Um, yeah, that's pretty much it, man. Beautiful. Awesome. Gabrielle, what's your question? Yeah. Hey, can I ask you a follow up? So I had a situation recently similar to this guy where I, I basically kicked the girl out. Not like, well, not kick her out of a show. Basically she was very disrespectful and we were at a restaurant and I'm actually dating the girl who was helped, who was a server. I'm dating her friend. Um, so I, you know, I thought that was pretty disrespectful. So I would just want to ask you what it did was passive aggressive, but that's fine. So basically I just looked at her. I told her you're never coming with me to this place again. And then I'm sorry, say again, keep going. I don't know who said that. And then, and then basically she texted me about being sorry or whatever. And I just messed back. We're good. But then I stopped inviting her to anything we've been doing for the last two, three weeks. Cause I, I was just like, I don't want to have this conversation with her. She crossed the line. She's still a friend. She's not going to come hang out with me and my other friends. But I also thought like, maybe it's passive aggressive. Maybe I should sit down with her and be like, Hey, you can't talk like that with me anywhere. But at the same time, I was like, well, I don't really care. Like she crossed the line. She's out. Sure. Sure. Okay. So do you guys know who, who Jimmy Johnson is? He was the head coach of the Dallas Cowboys from 89 to 93. He won two super bowls with the Dallas Cowboys. He wrote a book called swagger. I just finished it. It's not required for MOA, but if you guys want to learn some really cool stories about leadership, I'd recommend you read that book. It's really good book. And one of the things he talks about, he's like, if a guy who's marginal, barely making the team falls asleep, one guy named John Roper, he falls asleep, but his pass rusher, he falls asleep. And it turns out later he had narcolepsy. He was really fucked up. He cuts him from the team. Immediately. One guy, he was a running back. It was like a preseason game. He fumbles the ball twice. He goes, get your waiver papers. You're off the team. He cuts them. He said, if it was Trey Eggman, who was the quarterback of the team, he nudged him. He'd be like, Hey man, start to fucking focus. People get treated differently based on the value they bring. Okay. I'm not going to lie to you. My sales guys, I talk to differently than other people in my company because of the value they bring. So if Lindsay Payless started getting mouthy with one of my friends, I'm not going to stop inviting her places unless she is super fucking flagrant or says something mean to Kylie. I'm not going to stop inviting her places. Okay. Because she's the quarterback. But if this other one is like a backup fucking, you know, linebacker who's playing special teams, she gets cut. This is not a function of like, this is not social events are not a display of your personal self-worth. We're just trying to create a tribe. And if you bring value, you get to go into the tribe. If you don't, you don't. And it's more so with men than women, women, their value can breed, you know, they have a bunch of social media followers, or they're actually really fucking smart. Or they're like Kylie kindly. Who's really fucking funny. Right. Or something like that. There's a bunch of different things or, you know, like Kylie, she has a knife. She's really good with a knife. She's really good with a Glock too. So just shoot people for you. If that's the case, if that's the case, then they bring value. If they don't bring value, then they don't get to come around. But that doesn't mean they're worthless people. It just like, Hey man, we're having a party and we're inviting people who have value. Yeah, fair enough. Yeah. And just smile when you say it and don't be mean. It was like, Hey, just so you know, like, I can't really have parties when you keep inviting guys who don't bring any value to the party. Oh, but no, no, he, he has a crypto company and he's going to be in this movie. And I'm like, I really want to record this and like play this back for you when he cheats on you. Like, I really want you to hear this nonsense that you're saying right now. You know, it's so great. Isn't it? One of my favorite things to talk about is some of my female friends when it's very obvious, their boyfriends are going to cheat on them. And then like afterwards, like looking back, like on the autopsy, the relationship, it's so fun to talk about. I love talking about this. Like how does this cognitive bias exist? It's very much like a primal status elevated. He like lives in this world of cognitive bias where he's never quite wrong. Oh, Michael, you're right. That's a thing. You know, you, I can probably learn some techniques from you to actually make better YouTube videos. You see how he doesn't do that. Never considers that right. Defensive. Oh, I'm dad. I'm terrible. I'm more African than you. Like all these little statements that he makes to protect himself. Cause he has to protect himself. Right. Cause he lives in his own. He's the center point for his own reality. Narcissism, solipsism, his, his viewpoints are very, are very feminine. They're extremely feminine. His mannerisms are somewhat feminine, too. Where does that come from? Probably mommy and daddy telling them that he's special, but he's special because of his beliefs, not because objective reality. And this is generally what you see with people who believe in numerology or have to, like, come up with a reason why they they do. They weren't very successful in life. Well, no, I'm successful because in my mind, I'm successful. OK, I guess so. Yeah, I guess so. Right. That seems really helpful, like if you're doing life in prison, though. I mean, I can see that happening. Or if, you know, you're you're, you know, handicapped, I can see that being helpful. The problem is he has the ability to improve and chooses not to. Yeah, that's where it's really bad. That's where you see the cognitive bias. I'm really glad you guys got to see that because that's what happens in the end. Like he he doesn't realize he's very close to flat earth, but he doesn't see it. He doesn't see that he's close to flat earth. No one agreed with him, any of his points. And but to him, he's still winning, even though no one agreed. And then you saw at the end when we were trying to give advice and he stepped in, he's an instructor in my program. He's sitting there trying to give advice, saying, no, you have to do the thing that one percent of people believe in. One percent of people don't believe what primal status elevated is doing. Not even one percent. Not one one millionth of one percent, because what he's doing is being a hater. And he's just wrong. And then comes on here and says, no, but I'm not being a hater. It's just my cover photos. Go watch the videos, guys. He's being a hater the entire time. Like not only is he has to reframe things, he also is just boldly lying in order to get his point across. Where does that come from? It comes from cognitive dissonance and sort of like a protection mechanism that happened to him somewhere. Because why? He probably didn't make a whole lot of money. And he is living refugees, like for real. Like if he's like Tunisian and he lives in Ukraine and had to leave and he's living as a fucking refugee in like Turkey or something like that, that sucks. That's fucking hard. I would probably tell myself stories as well in order to get by at night. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. And that's kind of what he did. You know, I feel bad for him. If he legitimately is living as a refugee, that's fucking terrible. That is really hard. But what he's done then is he's made up stories to sort of like make up for the fact that he's doing that. And if you watch his videos, they become very, very, very. If you guys watch some of his longer videos, they become very manic. There's these very quick cuts between spots because in his mind, he's very manic as well. And it seems like he's got some sort of disorder that's not being treated. And the way he does it is very often with people who have disorders and don't want to seek treatment. I'm the I'm the origin of my own mental health. I'm right because I think I'm right. You see what I'm saying? Yeah. I didn't think I didn't think he had a mental health problem until this this this conversation we had. Now, I'm pretty certainly he certainly does. Is these bouts of mania that come off is really, really strange. Cool. Anything else? I know. Thank you. I'm super excited to see the reaction video that he does. How we manipulate him. Huh? You're supposed to yell at Billy. How about that? Billy, Billy, you're great. I definitely have to talk to him. I came for. I'm disappointed. I'm fucking disappointed. You want to you want to you want to be you want to be really disappointed? Look at that. Look at the girls Billy's with every week. Then you'll be really fucking disappointed. You're number six. No, no. Billy is with some fine ass girls every week. You want to be really disappointed? Look at Billy. Fucking listen. When I yelled at him and now Billy is around you. My Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy is the Asian dude surrounded by fine ass white women. That's what Billy means. That's what Billy means, bro. I'm not yelling at Billy about nothing. Billy, I love you, Michael. You can yell at me as much as you want. I love you, Billy, Billy, Billy. I got an opportunity for you. I'm going to do a reality show in a couple of weeks for Paramount and they want me to bring a student. Would you be open to doing that? I need anything for you. Yeah. OK, I appreciate it. I mean, because we're going to be in a strip club. That's the only thing. If you're cool with that, it's going to be on Paramount UK. If you're cool with that, because you're because you you happen to be in Vegas. So it might be a little easier for you. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's fine. By the way, if anyone else is in Vegas and wants to do it, I'll bring all you guys. They'll let me bring as many as I want. But Billy happens to be here. So, Gabriel, what's your question? Unmute yourself, honest or not. Go ahead, unmute yourself, Gabriel. Did he just lose? Gabriel, I think your mic isn't picking up what your words are saying. Yeah. So you're still muted, Gabriel. And I think maybe the problem with your mic. Yeah, there's a problem with your microphone, Gabriel. You're saying we can see you talking, but there's nothing. We're not getting any audio. Now I can hear you. No, nothing. Hey, just just try it again. See if you can, like, test your mic. Raj, what's your question? You, by the way, shout out to Billy again, because Mike, I know I used to actually a lot of questions, but whenever I have a question, I go to Billy first because he's. Let me tell you something, dude. He gives brown people a chance. He makes brown people like me think I got a shot. Hey, guys, even I can date a hot girl. If Billy, if Billy makes me think that I have a shot, bro. Hey, now, hey, now. Yeah, I'm going to Billy. Hey, hey, listen. What can what can Brown do for you, bro? That's what I'm saying. You know what I'm saying? Like Billy makes you feel like I got a shot. He's brown. I'm down. All right. A question for Kylie. Uh-huh. Kylie. Have you been since you broke up with Machine Gun Kelly? Yeah, this is another Megan Fox joke. I get this all the time. I'm I I would never date Machine Gun Kelly. These two masculine. No. Do you want me to get in a pink dress like you? No, no. Kylie, Kylie, you would date Primal, though, right? I know. Fuck that guy. I'm really confused by that. I literally think that I lost IQ, like my IQ level. Dropped so much from him. I almost started crying, like it honestly was. That was hard. It's literally here, by the way. No, he left. Lily left a while ago. OK, I was going to ask her. She's she's going to go look. She's going to look for some 10 inchers. That's what she does for her birthday. I was going to say I was going to ask her what NBA players taken out for her. But Mike, just a quick one. I so I have a shorter week this week for my work week because I'm traveling. I'm taking a few days off, but I'm kind of overwhelmed with a lot of work I have. And I don't know if I can get it done before like Wednesday when I'm leaving to another state, I'm taking off. I literally just had that happen with me in Boston. Yeah. And I mean, that's perfect. So like, what did you do to like make sure you get that fucking work done, even though it's so again, midnight to five. No distractions. That's why I go to bed so late. No, but no distractions. The one thing I can't I don't know how much work you have to get done. What I do know is that you're going to get it done in the most efficient way if you do one thing at a time. Right, right. OK, cool, cool. All right, bro. Thank you. All right, Mark, what's your question? Come on. Hey, my question is actually on theme tonight. How can you max out your return if you get invited to a very high status place other than photos? I got invited to one of those country clubs where people of NFL owner money go. And I'm wondering how networking is done there with people you have not met before without invading privacy or looking like a douchebag. No. So it's it's it goes back to small talk and listening. Yeah, I got that. And I'm really cognizant of like I'm coming with no value to these higher status people, and I have a limited time to talk to them. So. Yeah, well, again, I'm going to tell you the same thing. It's just going to be the same thing over and over again, like they don't know you, you don't know them. If I don't, I'm not going to walk up to Jeff Bezos and be like, hey, man, I have a great idea on how to fix your algorithm for blah, blah, blah. I'd be like, that's great, man. Get the fuck away from me. Get the fuck away from me. But if I was like, hey, man, good to see you, man. And then, like, let's say he's from Houston. Like, how about those Texans? Oh, man, I don't think they're going to do that good this year. Oh, very cool. How's you doing? Good. How's your family? Oh, my family's good. Small talk and then listen. OK, what is Kylie's interest with unusual farm animals? I mean, I'm definitely giving her the side eye every time I see these things. He wants miniature cows in our apartment or something. They don't say miniature. That's why I get it with the side eye. Because they're cute. Have you all seen the videos? I have a miniature cow. His name is Willie. We do kind of already have a miniature cow. He's sitting on the other side of his computer and he is twenty three pounds. It's a cat. He jumped up here. I thought I was going to break the table. We already have a cow. Yeah, but I want an actual cow. I want a furry cow. They're cute. He won't let me have one. I'm going to get one eventually. Y'all wait. I'm going to post it. Y'all all make sense. Got it. Answer your question, Mark. You want to know my obsession with them? I'm from Arkansas and I love her. Listen, I guess she's telling you, if you want, if you want to steal it, if you want to steal her from me, just get some cows. I think that interest is weird. Well, that's fine. All right, cool. Anything else? I need to knock this out. We've done three hours and 12 minutes. All right, I guess we're good, Michael. What's your question, Michael H? Hey, Michael. Oh, I'm sorry. I don't have my in my app doesn't allow me to put on my camera. So, yeah, I just had a few questions. So I come more from fresh and fit. And it looks like you made it yourself. Looks like maybe we lost my goodness. He may have accidentally. Hello. Yeah, it looks like he probably lost signal. Like we can hear him. Yeah, looks like it. So here we go. All right, Michael, try it again. Real Chris Adams. What's your question? Oh, baby. Yeah, I was ready. Stop. Stop real quick. Everybody stop. Give me two seconds, guys. Go ahead. Same thing. I lost audio there for a second. Ask the question again. Yeah, I was just curious if you had any updates on the swimsuit competition for me. None. It's really fucking disappointing. I have none. They told me it's definitely going to happen and we're going to have 130,000. It's probably only going to be five events. I don't know anything else. All right, they're going to they're going to fuck me, bro. There it's going to be. It's going to be I have five days to get 100 girls to show up. That's what's going to end up being. Well, I got a list, so I know you do. I know, Chris, that's awesome. My question on that is six weeks. Is that going to be spread out over like a couple of months? So say five weeks, it'll be one in April, one in May, one in June, one in July, one in August. OK, perfect. Yep. Awesome. Chris, got your question for us. What's your question? I mean, yourself. You know, OK, I lost audio questions. One more time. Say it again. Two questions. Can you hear me now? Talk loud, but. I have two questions. So first one was when you guys were talking about Fresh and Fit, right? And the whole situation. And then you said, you know, these girls still want Myron and all that. It's like that's like the type of girl you want to attract, though, because I feel like that behavior attracts a certain type of girl. Um, I think, well, I mean, girls go through different phases. I don't I'm not saying that every girl would be like that, but a lot of girls go through a phase where they like the guy who doesn't like them. You know, that's that's just something you go. I'm not talking about toys specifically. Your toy in a response video said that Myron's actually very handsome. In the video the next day, she said that for us, like I wouldn't. One of the things you need to be careful of and a lot of people make this mistake is they start thinking that there's these ho girls and then there's these good girls. And it's just not the case. We all have the same firmware. It has to do with stimulus and it also has to do with history. There's like a psychological makeup that happens. Um, yeah, this idea that like, well, these are good girls and these are bad girls. You're going to find out that when you meet your dream girl, she had some bad moments, too. Yeah, I feel like I'm at that point where I'm kind of scared of having a girl who would want to chase me because I'm not giving her enough attention because I'm like, OK, I have to play that game to keep her attracted. You don't you don't have to play any game. Start a business. Go to the gym. Do things with your time. Become scarce. You don't have to play any fucking game, actually be a scarce man. Can you be exceptional and be scarce with your time? Then they'll they'll have to chase. Don't play a game. Yeah, it's real. Make it real. I see what you're saying. Yeah, OK. So, OK, preselection, just get more girls. All right. People hit me up now saying, what are you doing on this day? Random girls I've been out with. It's a snowball effect. It didn't happen two months after I started. Not three, four months. It's like eight months. And now I started promoting in November for Boston. And now I'm doing like containers every other week. So, OK, I see what you guys are saying. OK, um, second question is, second question is regarding Jocko. So I listen to a lot of his podcasts and you know how he says, like, oh, play the game and like be fake. Like, you know, play, play the game. Like, don't be fake. But like there's there's a line between being authentic and playing the game. Yeah. Like, where is your where's your personal line on that? It depends on like, do I play the game or be authentic? So what's real is when I'm with you guys and with the people that are in circle one. I don't know for us. You're in M.O.A. Yeah. Yes or no, I can't hear you. Yeah. OK, so you remember the thing about circles, circle one of the people that I'm closest to circle two or people I like, but I don't they don't know everything about me. Circle three or people I'm neutral towards. I just don't know enough about them. Circle four people that I want to avoid, but I have to have them in my life. And circle five are people that I actually avoid. Remember that? Yeah. Yeah. So I just they're just in they're just indifferent. What was the original question? Like, where is the line between you being authentic and so the people in circle, people in circle one and two, I'm real with them. Everyone else, I don't have to be real because they're not real. So at what point are you playing the game? Like, let me ask you something. After reading Bulgarian's book, I think a lot of guys that go through sealed. are on steroids, a lot of them. So at what point are you playing the game? At what point are you being authentic? Do you think Jaco's on steroids too? I don't know if he took steroids, I don't know. But you should, I want someone to ask him, is it true that any guys going through Bud's ever took steroids? And then see what he says. Might be interesting. But I'll tell you one thing, as a citizen of the United States, you know who I want taking steroids? Fucking Navy SEALs. I want them taking steroids. There's no way Jaco's on steroids. Dude gets five hours of sleep, trains twice a day. There's no way, Anthony, that he doesn't take steroids. Yeah, probably. I don't know, I'm not saying Jaco's on steroids. That's definitely not what I'm saying. What I'm saying is, someone should ask him, do you think any of them take steroids? So, okay, back to the original question. So let's just say the level one and two, that you're real with an authentic way. Do you sometimes play a game with them? Because you just have to? What do you mean, play a game? I don't understand. Like, you know, you're being upfront. You're being authentic. You're being real. You're telling them straight up. It's not about upfront and authentic. This is a game, but I'm being authentic. If you do, if you're an employee of mine and you do good work, I reward you. If you don't do good work, I don't punish you, but I don't reward you. I withhold reward. Is that a game? 100% it's a game and it's authentic. Remember we talked about this reward good behavior and punish bad behavior. That's me being authentic. Why? Because I'm a high status man who has boundaries. Hypothetically. I'll give you like a scenario for example. Let's just say you don't like this. This person is like someone you don't like because they're not, they don't have full integrity or they don't have your back. Sounds good. And they're level one and two. Do you just get rid of them? I don't waste my time talking to them. Think about it like, what would Wes Watson do in that situation? Just avoid them. What would Brad Lee do in that situation? Unless he can make money from them, avoid them. But what if you're stuck with this person because let's just say you guys work together? I mean, I would try, I would try, guys I gotta be off in 10 minutes FY. I would try to avoid that person. And if not, then I would try to have non-passive aggressive conversations with them. If you could see that this person is so immature, to me it sounds like maybe a cousin or a coworker or something like that. In those types of situations, then you just tell them whatever you need to get by. If it's a situation where up top doesn't recognize the inefficiencies of this person or that this person is duplicitous, then you need to find a different job. Right. Okay, got it. I got the answer, yeah. Got it? Become the change you wanna see in other people. Fasado, guys, I got 10 minutes, fast. What's your question? What's up? Yeah, thanks for the first two hours of the call. It was a wild ride. I wonder what are your conclusions? You reached out beforehand about this being a good idea or some thoughts, how to go about these people with hit pieces and stuff. So do you have any conclusions? No, I wanted you guys to see someone who's just living in a delusional bias so that you can identify it for yourself. That's the only reason we did this. He's not gonna get any subscribers from it. He's living in a fucking fantasy world. As far as the hit pieces, no, I don't think it helps at all. You don't ever see me making hit pieces. And I actually could. I could go after every single fucking pickup artist and be like, and just dunk on them. Could I not? Tell me who's doing what I do. Name them, I'm waiting. No, I could dunk on all of them, but I don't because I'm not gonna do fucking hit pieces. Like when Jay Mould starts talking about, oh, this PUA and his girlfriend's ugly. You know what? He's right, a lot of them are. I'm never gonna do that because that's not a way to grow. That's not a way to grow. Does that make sense? There's no way to grow from, you can't build a business off hatred. Yeah, sure. It was geared towards like after, like now that the debate has ended, what are your thoughts on like how this went and how you would probably go about it in the future? Yeah, I would do the same thing. I got fucking geared up. You guys were very entertained. A lot of people were entertained. The fucking stream popped. We were up to like 200 people watching us in the stream at one time, which for my little ass channel is pretty good. I was excited. There was a lot of comments. It was exactly what I wanted, really good. And it also allowed me to display some truths. And you guys could choose whose life do you want, his or mine? Like that's the thing you could make the decision on. Do you want my client's life or do you want his life? Why, oh, here's the other thing you should ask yourself this question. Why should he ever improve? Because his fucking litmus for his status is his own mind. He gets to choose what his status is on a daily basis in his own mind. So why should he ever go to the gym? He can just choose in his mind to say he's high status. Now, is the world gonna reflect that? No, but again, if he's literally like living as a refugee, maybe this is the way he has to cope. You know what I'm saying? I didn't realize the refugees part of it. Yeah, it was very interesting to see that, but so you would do this again, like just- 100%, in fact, there's no one I want. So one of the differences between like me and like say Neil deGrasse Tyson, Neil deGrasse Tyson wants to educate. He doesn't want to debate. Debating is actually a different skillset. And I think I'm good at it. So I like to debate. That wasn't a debate because there's no like, there was, and this, by the way, this is what's gonna happen with the dude on the 26th, the numerologist and astrologist. We're not gonna really be able to debate because anytime I, he's gonna, watch for this, guys. Bing, like make a little bingo card. Somebody should make a bingo card for this guy. He's gonna say, we don't really know anything and nothing is real. That's how you could, that's the only way you can excuse astrology is to say nothing's real. See what I'm saying? He said, logic is not based in facts. He said that on my show. So I wanted you guys to see that. Also like how he consistently thanks everyone. And then he says, this is great when he's getting fucking roasted. Why does he do that? Because in his mind, he's gotten to the point where he's, he can just reframe anything in his mind, which is, by the way, reframing things. Like when you get fired, reframing it as, hey, this is a new opportunity. That's helpful. Reframing every single thing you do all the time is a psychosis. Okay? Yeah, I think- At some point you actually are broken fat and you need to do something about it. It's not time to reframe. Got it? Yeah, there were a lot of similarities. And then at some point you just like, one guy talks, the other guy talks, and then you ask yourself like, this is like, none of us are going anywhere with this. Yeah, but I loved why I did this. Honestly, I did this for Raj and Tristan. I just wanted to see the look on their face. It's just, I wanted to see those two go at it with him. I mean, there's still the slight possibility that you fabricated a fake YouTube account and hired a paid actor as a birthday prank for Rolo. That's hilarious. That's my situation. Unfortunately, this guy's been doing this for a couple of months. Yeah. Okay. Let's see. All right, man. Sound good? I need to get to these real quick. Viet Phong. Yes. So what's up, Michael? What's going on? Yeah. Hi, how are you doing? So I have two questions for you. First, do you have any tips for networking in a tech industry? Because on one call, you said that a lot of things in MOA will be hard to implement in a third world country. Yeah. Well, it is kind of difficult to do it, but I think it actually, okay, what's difficult is like some of the bigger events that you throw, but Vietnam is like, you guys have internet and running water. It's not that bad. And you also do have a tech industry there. So I think you also have a tourism industry there. There is a middle class, not a huge, there's a middle class in Vietnam. I think what you could do, I definitely think Vietnam would be classified as a third world country, but I think there are pockets of affluence there. If you were in that part, same thing with Singapore, same thing with Thailand. What I would do in that situation is just use the same techniques. I would probably like, say, fix your Instagram, become a more interesting person. The concepts of status are the same in Vietnam as they are in the United States. I think there's a lot of stuff that you could do there. If you want to take the program and you live in Vietnam, I mean, the thing is we have clients that are in India. We have clients that are in China. It's possible to do it. If you really want to do it, you can definitely pull it off. Yes, no argue. So the second question, I have two locations. One that is in the best in the nightlife industry, but somewhat average in the tech scene. And the other one is next to the biggest tech industry in the country, like Google, Facebook, Sony, you name it. The bus is in like in the middle of nowhere and take like a one hour uptry to reach the first one. So where do you think I should stay to grow myself to a point that I can afford MOA? Yeah, Viet, so my first thing is don't worry about affording MOA. I would take the first four step. I would do the first four steps in the program first before you even worry about driving an hour to go to some venue. Can anybody tell that I grew up around Vietnamese people when I was in Dallas? Yeah, so that's one thing also when I was in the military. So yeah, no, that's what I would do. Just do the first four steps. Viet, will you do that and just come back on and then ask me some questions about it. Just do the first four steps. Yes, okay, I understand. Thanks. Love it, man. Joel. Hey, what's up? So fast. It's Joel. I'm all right. So basically like three questions. One, how honest is too honest? I was in a relationship and I don't know. I know I definitely said some things to hurt her feelings. I know feelings are important to her, but I don't know what I did. So I just, I'm trying to think and reevaluate. Yeah, there is this sort of mesh point that happens where it's like one of these things where you're literally just being honest and that she just wants to be heard. And in doing so, where you just listen to her, you're literally leaving, you're omitting the truth. And from your standpoint, you're lying to her. But from her standpoint, she feels so much better because you just listened and absconded with the truth. The problem is, what happens? 20, 30 years down the line, you resent each other. That's the problem. And so it's very difficult because a lot of times, especially with really attractive women, they're not used to constructive criticism. And so when you give it to them, they take it very personal and they go into like a victim mentality. Oh, I can't do anything right. No, that's not what I said. What I said is it would be more efficient when we're doing this to do this for our taxes, for our business or whatever. And it just becomes very difficult because again, when you're in a relationship, you guys are a team. You're supposed to be chairman and CEO of the company and you're supposed to be able to give each other critical advice. There's an issue that I had with my mother. I could never give my mother critical, constructive criticism, or she would take it as very, very personal attack. Oh, I can't do anything right, Michael. And I'm like, what do I do now? Like, I don't know what to do. The problem still exists because we can't do that. So how honest is too honest? It kind of depends on how far you are in the relationship. And it also depends on how far the girl is in her own feelings. If it's a situation like, if you're dating a girl who's an attorney or a scientist, you're probably not going to have that big of a problem. If you're dating a girl who is, you know, living in a place or doing a job where she does not deal with a great amount of consequences, you know, or repercussions, meaning a huge model or a girl who's a trust fund baby, that's going to be an issue where you're going to like, tell her the truth. And she's just not going to want to hear it. One of the funny things is though, some of the girls that I've told some of the most offensive truths to, and I don't say it in an offensive way, they tend to want to be my friends or become attracted to me because nobody else will do that. The second question is I'm good at small talk, but I'm bad at like long talk. And I guess books, books, Joel, books, get on the book list, book list. Trust me, book list. You can talk about astronomy and evolutionary psychology till you're fucking blue in the face. Books. The answer is books. Got you. And then third is, I guess it's probably just books too. Like how do you not give a fuck about what other people think? It has to be books, right? Yeah, no, it's not books. It's abundance. Rule number three in MOA is abundance. So one of the things is like when I play, when I haven't hit 10 shots in a row, I just think about a game where I hit 10 shots in a row. You know what I'm saying? Like you can remember these accomplishments. This is really interesting. I had somebody hit me up yesterday and they're like, Michael, I've lost my confidence. I want you guys to think about this as confidence. And what happens when you're a little kid, you walk up to strangers and you have no problem doing so because you just have exposed confidence. What happens is as you get older and you start comparing, this guy's taller than me. This guy's girlfriend's hotter than mine. This guy has a Lamborghini. This guy has more status. This guy has more followers. The old that, whatever that is, that judgment sits on top of your confidence and you become less confident over time. Okay? That's essentially what happens. So gaining confidence is just removing whatever it is that stifles you. You still with me? Yeah, I am. What's the original question? So I make sure I get this right. No, you got it. It was right. And then also Rallo kind of put me onto this. So shout out to Rallo and then- Yeah, but again, so here's like five techniques. Number one, something physical in the gym. So get good at shooting free throws, get good at throwing axes, get good at putting up whatever, get good at throwing a football, get good at something physical, a physical thing that you can do that most people can't do. Okay? That's the first thing. Number two, a level of gratitude for your situation. Number three, remember things that you did previously that were huge accomplishments. Number four, present moment awareness, like we talk about in the power of now. Right. And I forgot what the fifth one is. I'm sorry. I'll think about it. But I was just answering this before, but actually going out and accomplishing a thing and then taking inventory of previous accomplishments is a great way to get into that winning mindset. Joel, if you really want to understand how this works, there's a book called The Winner Effect. Winner Effect. Look that book up. Okay? Yep. Thank you. Beautiful. Michael H., what's the question? And James, you're the last person. What's the question, Michael? Hey, Michael. So I just had a few questions. One of them is, how do I... So I'm tall. I'm like 6'2\\\", and I'm big. I go to the gym. How do I not come off intimidating to other people when I'm trying to start a conversation? Yeah, the answer is to smile. I'm 6'2\\\", 230. Smile a lot. Hey, what's going on? I walk through clubs sometimes, and I realize that when I bump into people, it's actually a tremendous... It's a large amount of force. I was a linebacker. I accidentally don't even recognize. Sometimes I'm moving kind of fast, and boom. And I dislodge people. And that can come off as... And then I dislodge them, and then I have an angry look on my face. I dislodge somebody, and I go, it's fighting time. Hey, oh, I'm so sorry, man. Excuse me, brother. When you're big and strong like that, if you're overly polite, it works really well. Got it? I mean, I can see like from the picture on your avatar, you just kind of maybe have a face with a big old beard where you just don't look happy all the time. You need to like fake it to where you look really fucking happy. Does that make sense? Michael? Michael's muted. Okay. Michael's having some trouble with his phone. All right, here we go. James Holman, would you like to? Hey, real quick, Mike, you probably answered this a million times, but what do you think about the blue check mark? That's what we should get. What? The blue check mark on IG, since everybody can get it. Yeah, I have the opposite viewpoint that a lot of people have. I think that nothing but scam artists were getting it recently. And the fact that you can actually pay for it where it's actually used for legit verification is a good thing. I hear all these people like, oh, this is terrible. I can't work with these photographers because I don't know who's legit. And the girl who's saying this literally bought her fucking followers. It's absurd. It's fucking ridiculous. No, the blue check mark was a status symbol and it should never have been a status symbol. It's verification. So verify people's identity. That's what it should be used for. If you want to come with something else for status, then come up with something else for status, but it's never going to work because IG as of right now can't even tell when you bought fake followers. So I'm 100% in favor of what they're doing. I think it's a great idea. I think it is. As someone who had multiple articles written about me and literally had people using my identity to get women to come to locations so that they could possibly traffic them or sexually assault them, I should, I deserve to have a blue check mark way more than these fucking Forex traders. And I didn't have one. The system was broken. And now to me, is the system not broken? What they've done, instead of elevating certain people to the blue check mark, they just lowered the value of the blue check mark and I don't give a fuck. It doesn't matter to me. But the whole thing was absurd to begin with. Got it? Got it. All right, man. I'll talk to you guys later. I'll see you guys on Thursday or tomorrow. Oh, those of you guys in MOA. Guys, join MOA. I'll see you guys soon. Hold on, one last thing. If you guys have not already done this, let me, for those of you who are, hey, put a one in the chat if you're not in men of action right now.
