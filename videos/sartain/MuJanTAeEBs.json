They're constantly victims of oppression of historic You know crushing oppression of the patriarchy and that's first and that they're also at the same time superheroes They're miss Marvel. They have Captain Marvel. They can do anything. They can be an astronaut They can do whatever the fuck you want. There's a really great like it's a like a two minute three minute video it's called it's not about the nail and What it is is it's like this couple and they're sitting on a couch and the lady and they're having this conversation I feel like I've got this really horrible pain in my head and it just won't go away and I just you know And she's just going on and I'm yammering on and on about this painter and the guys are sitting there He's like looking at her and they turn she turns and she cuts his nail that's stuck in her head And the guy goes, you know I bet if we took that nail your forehead that that would solve the problem and she's like Because she's arguing from the from an emotional as a female side of the guys the problem solver There's a nail in your head that appears to be the source of your problem and you probably would have the relief and you wouldn't have that headache if we could just take that nail out of your head and She just thought about the nail and so she you know, she goes ask how it got there. And yeah, exactly So you guys never listen, you know, and it's so it's your but what they're doing is they're talking past one another, right? So you've got the guy who's the really the empiricist? I know how to solve your problem because the fucking nail in your forehead and she's like I want to talk about it, you know, you men this you don't you listen to women and so it goes into this sort of Emotional diatribe when really probably the solution the problem is pulling a lot of your head. So how do you solve this? The thing is You end up with the nail, you know, but if you if you try to solve it now, you're mansplaining now You're seriously gives issue like the when you look at a distribution of IQs Aaron Clary who wrote about this A Which you'll find is that men and women score about 100. They're they're on average It's not like women are two or three points below They're about the same what happens is a far greater number of women score inside the first standard deviation Which is between the scores of 85 and 15 far more men score outside that distribution meaning the smartest Humans alive or men and the dumbest humans alive are also men. Does that make sense? So we're outside wider in the in the distribution extremes are where the difference is the differences were so just considered There's like two chocolate cakes here The difference is the women have this icing over their cake called emotions and the emotion like it clouds the logic They have the they have the intellectual horsepower to do things like become astrophysicist They have the ability to do that. But do they want to and so this this emotional? I don't know how to say how to say it, but it's like maybe just estrogen this thing that happens It clouds their ability to do things. It's like what is a Ronald Reagan said about Democrats is like Democrats are smart, too They just know too many things that aren't true, you know, so it's stuff like that It's like but what happens where the danger comes is that when your emotions are so strong That you start believing that your emotions outweigh objective reality Then we start getting into dangerous situations Then you're talking to your girl telling her not to drink and drive, you know when you're when you're talking around the phone But she's like no no, I did some coke and I'm you ever talk to somebody like that. I did some coke. So I'm good Hearing me and then you tell him was like hey just it's funny because I've done this before I had a friend of mine She was like drunk as shit. She snort some coke and I'm and she's like, yeah I'm sober now because I started coke and so I send her the study showing you're not more sober You just have a higher heart rate your heart rate has gone up because you did the cocaine But you're literally just as drunk and she's like, but she feels like she's sober. So she fucking drives anyway, bro Like it's it's a crazy. It's like well, it's like I'll give you another good example of this It's more recent is when you see transgender athletes like met biological men dominating female sports The emotion is well he identifies as a female and because gender is a social construct and we all want to play along and pander to this and we All want to say that he can be he can be just as much a woman as any biological female Therefore we have to let him Compete in female sports and what happens goes in there dominates. I think it was the the the best female swimmer is Like the 436 And so what you're looking at right there is your look as I said before you're looking at the conflict between empiricism and emotionalism Emotionally, we want to think. Oh, he identifies as being a female. He was gonna go in there He's gonna do that Zuby by the way Has identified as a female went in broke the world's record for for female deadlifting Promptly went back and changed his thing and went right back out because it was funny as hell and it make the news because because it's it's emotion versus reason and so when you see a woman who says Oh women could do anything men can do except for I don't know break down a door or be a good for you be a firefighter As an effective firefighter or whatever something that that create that needs physical physicality Is life or death in that particular job? Yeah, that's Empiricism smashing headlong into emotionalism right there. So whenever you and by the way, it's always biological men You don't see biological women who identify as male who come into male sports and dominate Did you guys know there's absolutely no rule in the NBA against women competing in the NBA There's no love that. Did you guys know that there's no there's no rule. I looked it up There is nothing in the world to stop an NBA team from drafting a woman to play nothing But there doesn't need to be a rule It's like it's one of these situations where it's like what you talked about before Women can do lots of incredible things, but they can't be a saw gunner in a Marine Corps unit They can't and it's a 75 pound rucksack. It doesn't work that way So there's just there's these different things that happen and when you hit that like you said the empiricism thing Here's the thing here's where we get like the confusion there are social constructs in gender But gender is not a social construct gender has to do with at the the the formation of the zygote Are you XY are you XX? That's what gender is now What's happened is we're gonna bastardize that word and say well gender is also a social social construct There are social constructs and gender just like if I am a Muslim man I may more be more likely to have different facial hair than if I'm a Protestant man That's a social construct that exists within a male gender, but it's a different social construct amongst different religions and different, you know Ethnicities, okay, that's fine to have that but that doesn't mean the entire gender is a social construct For instance, there's no it's not a social construct that men are more interested in casual sex than women when all When men are more interested in casual sex than women in all cultures That's not a social construct when I have 17 times as much testosterone as a woman does That's not a social construct. And so that's where people get this this confusion It doesn't mean I think but by the way, neither one of us have a problem if someone wants to transition That is not the issue. But what the issue is is I then say afterwards? I just want to let you know, even though you transitioned, you know, you're still a dude even though you transition to a woman You're still more likely to get prostate cancer than the biological female Sorry to let you know this if I were to say that that doesn't make me hate. No, I'm not because I was born a woman Yeah You just don't know but I am I knew and then by the way, but that's all fine Like again, I I fought I fought for the First Amendment when I was in the US military if someone wants to transition I don't have a problem with them transitioning Whatever problem with is then them then telling me I'm wrong for me still recognizing the fact that if we looked at a DNA sample You're still gonna come up XY. That's the problem. That's the issue Like I'm not hateful for telling you an objective truth But I still like again like if somebody if I had a family member and they were like, hey I want you to identify me as she her I would do it. I actually would not have a problem I would to be totally cool with it do whatever you want By the way, I feel the same way for the girl who makes three hundred fifty thousand dollars a month doing OnlyFans fuck anyone you want on your OnlyFans, but When there's a dude who wants to fuck your 23 year old sister who hasn't been run through Instead of you don't complain to me or say that it's misogynistic We told you this was going to happen if I start taking a bunch of fucking steroids And then by the time I'm 40 my kidneys give out I don't blame the doctor I have to take responsibility for my actions But for some reason when women do the same thing, they don't want to do so and then so that's where the issues By the way men do too. That's why I said the simple economy is growing. What is the simple economy? I didn't take accountability from actions. So I didn't get a better shape. I didn't build a business I didn't read any books and I stayed in my room and play Grand Theft Auto 6 while masturbate that Expectation that expectation of women to have to be able to like the bombs right there How's the first button to have a failsafe? Like what are you saying right there? They don't want to take responsibility for their for their actions that once again is Responsibility versus authority women want that authority to be free from judge. Don't judge me. No stop judging me They don't want to have the they don't want the responsibility But they still want the authority so that when the shit hits the fan they can still say well I'm a woman so therefore you're gonna have to respect my wishes The other thing is like when we talk about like feminism feminism, it teaches women to conflicting things One is that they're victims. They're constantly victims of oppression of historic, you know, crushing oppression of the patriarchy That's first and that they're also at the same time superheroes. They're miss Marvel. They have Captain Marvel. They can do anything They can be an astronaut they can do whatever \", \"segments\": [{\"id\": 0, \"seek\": 0, \"start\": 0.0, \"end\": 7.159999847412109, \"text\": \" Feminism it teaches women two conflicting things one is that they're victims.
