Live from Las Vegas, Nevada! Hey, welcome back guys, so happy to have everyone back. We have been gone for what, six weeks now? And we are finally back here for another episode of Access Vegas. Some people pay for therapy, I just host a fucking panel show, and that works out for me. So here we go guys, we'll get on with our guest here. She is from Las Vegas, Nevada. She is a sex phone operator, and she has engineered a box with seven holes in it. It is Elektra Barbie. How are you doing, Elektra? I'm good, how are you? So happy to see you here. He is the creator of the It's Complicated show on YouTube. It does a lot of man on the street stuff. It is John. How are you doing, John? Hi, how are you? Thank you for having me, Rollo and Michael. Fantastic, man, great to have you here. Good to get you here. From Canada, she is Zoe with the cool tattoos. How are you doing, Zoe? I'm great, how are you? Beautiful, beautiful. Make sure you guys talk into the microphone. Also, joining us again from Chicago, Illinois, she is a controversial podcaster and live streamer. It is Torsha. How's it going, Torsha? Good, how are you? Good, good. Sorry, I'm quiet. There we go. She's also an ASMR expert. All the way from Frog Level, Arkansas, she's a world champion bikini model and pageant model. She's also my part-time boss. It is Kylie McGehee. How are you doing, Kylie? Hey. Beautiful. Also, she's a Playboy model. She is a very spicy Latina, and she's a pro threesome giver. What is a pro? She's a pro threesome giver. It's Jessie Preston. How are you doing, Jessie? Hi. Nice, nice. She is also Penthouse Pet 2022 from Las Vegas, Nevada. It is the very lovely Amber Rose. AKA my wife. There you go. She's from Iowa. She's a fashion model and a bartender. It is Miss Monrare. How's it going? Hey. Could I get you guys to move closer to Amber real quick, because you're on the screen right there? Awesome. Very cool. So we're going to get to the whole thing. We're going to do a little bit different show this time. We have a bunch of videos to react to. We're going to let you. You wanted to start off with something first? I just want to let everybody know that I am now the sexiest man in the Red Pillosphere. Thank you, Date Cyc, for that backfiring poll. Do you think Date Cyc did this because he expected them to turn on you? Yes, absolutely. That's really interesting. By the way, Date Cyc, if you're watching this, we'd love to have you on the show. Thank you. You can come on now. You can come on anytime you want. He's going to unblock you. That's what will happen next. Beautiful. Okay, so do you want to go with some of these clips? Sure, sure. I think we should probably explain what we're doing here. We're kind of changing things up a little bit so we can sort of react to some of these things. So last time, I was going to have Ho-Math on the show, and he's done two episodes with me. And so we reacted to some of his videos on here, and they went great. You guys really liked it, so it's something we decided to do more. So what we're going to do this time on Access Vegas is instead of us just bringing up a topic like we usually do, we're just going to find a clip of that topic that probably went viral, and then we'll just turn it over to you guys and see what you want to talk about. So the first one we're going to start with, this is literally my favorite clip of Sidiya Khan. You guys know who Sidiya Khan is. She is a psychologist, and she's viral all over the Internet. Can we pull her thing up? Yep, got it. Ready to go. I was just also going to say, she's done a lot of stuff with Chris Williamson. She's been... God, I can't even remember how many people. She's not with us. She doesn't mess with the likes of us. We're the quote-unquote bottom of the barrel. Come slim it with us, please. There's only one thing that all women... Can we try this again with it on the screen? There we go. Hold on, let me back it up for you. Hang on a second. There we go. There's only one thing that all women want. People will tell you that they want money, they want someone tall. The reality of hypergamy for a woman is only by one metric. You can be shorter than us. You can be poorer than us. You can be dumber than us in all other regards. But if we can't trick you, we'll still give you some respect. But if you're richer than us, taller than us, got more degrees and more qualifications, but we can trick you and we can manipulate you and we can derive resources. We cannot see you as a body to respect. All right. There you go. There's number one. Absolutely. Very similar to this. And so Homeath has something also that he says similar to this. And I just thought it was absolutely terrific, this concept. Because what men think a lot of times, like, oh, you ladies only want a guy who's rich or only want a guy who's tall. And then you come in, some of you come in and you're like, no, I don't really care about that. So I'm curious, what do you guys think about what Sadia had to say? Jessie, you seem to have something on your face there. It's just because I feel like every time I watch these clips, I cannot relate. So I don't really have an opinion that would make sense to anybody else. Do you know what I'm saying? Like what she's saying, I can't fathom wanting to manipulate someone. Right. That's not in my wheelhouse. Yeah, but do you do understand though that your man has boundaries and you probably, right, he has a masculine quality. So that's, but you can't manipulate him if he has those boundaries. Do you understand? Right. And everybody has boundaries, a man and a woman. Right. What I'm saying is, what she's saying before is that, like, it's not, who here has seen a guy who was good looking but he opened his mouth and you just didn't find him attractive anymore because it's shit, he said. Ladies, okay, good. A bunch of you raised your hand. Guys, you've seen a guy who's rich who was trying to have sex with you and there was something wrong with him and you didn't want to hook up with him. Raise your hand if that has ever happened. Okay, cool. Right, cool. It's always exactly. Everyone. So the point is, like, what is the thing overall? And like, she's saying a man that you can't manipulate but you think it's, you don't necessarily agree with that. No, I think with the younger generations that are kind of coming out with, like, I should be able to do this and do that, they operate from a place of what can I have, what can I get from somebody else. I don't operate from a place like that. So in my personal life, I try to have an equal level ground understanding of what we both want, what we both need, and I'm only going to get from you what you want to give, not something I have to coerce out of you. Yeah, so I think that the difference is, Jessie, is like, you're not dating everyone. You're dating one person and you had to discern between all these other people to pick that one. Do you understand what I'm saying? In a non-manipulative way, though. I never manipulated. No, no, I'm not saying you did, but what her point might be is that you could tell when you met him that you couldn't manipulate him and maybe no one else could either and that's why you found him attractive. Do you understand? I never have that thought in my head. Okay, beautiful. Maybe subconsciously. Amber, what do you think about that? The concept of women liking a man that she cannot manipulate. I mean, I... Microphone. I think that she, obviously she has a point because I'm sure that a lot of females function that way, but yeah, I don't really think about how the amount that I can manipulate someone goes into a relationship. Obviously, there are women out there that use men and that's what they do. That's their forte. But in a relationship sense, I mean, I guess we would probably both have to agree that we wouldn't date someone that we felt that we could manipulate. I've dumped someone because he acted like he had no boundaries. And I'm not trying to sit here and have someone in my life that just does... I'm pretty sure he's autistic, but the point was... Welcome to the red pill. I'm not even saying it to be funny. I'm pretty sure he was autistic. He was part of a lot of autistic foundations and stuff like that. But this man just didn't have any boundaries and I don't want someone that I can walk all over and I don't want someone that will allow other people to walk all over him as well. I think we're kind of missing the point here. The point wasn't that they can or want to manipulate the man. It's that they're dating men they can't manipulate. And that's what you're saying also. The man didn't have any boundaries so you found him less attractive. Yeah. Kylie, what do you think? I mean, I think I understand her video. I think she just worded it weirdly so it comes across wrong. Yeah. So you think she did that like for effect? No, I mean, I don't know if she did it for effect or not. I just think... I mean, I hope she didn't because I wish she would have worded it differently. She's a licensed psychologist. I know what she was trying to say but the way that she worded it I feel like it came across differently. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. The word I've heard before also is like just having boundaries but not being manipulated is another way to say it. I think it punches more the way she said it. I got a take on this. Go ahead, Torsha, what do you think? Tori, what do you think? I don't know. I like a simp. I like a good simp this time of year. Yeah. I don't know. I like when they do stuff for me. I don't know. I don't know if that's manipulation if you're actually dating him. No, but I'm saying like if a guy were... Can you hear me? Yeah. If a guy were to not... How do I word it? If I'm dating him and I'm not walking all over him or whatever I don't think it would work out because he would be an asshole. I don't like assholes. Wait, so there's a middle ground between walking over your man and then him being an... You don't think there's a middle ground? No. Really? I don't think there's a middle ground. He's a complete asshole who has boundaries or... Or he's a simp. Or he's a simp. And that's it. It's very binary. That's incredible. All right. Is there like a scenario where the guy would be like incongruent? You know what I mean? Like he would be like... I hate that. Well, he would be like... You would see him as being sort of like strong and dominant and stuff but then does something that gives you the ick that like makes you like say maybe this guy isn't the dude that I thought he was. Or they're like soft in the beginning and then out of nowhere they'll turn alpha and then you're like, ew, why are you like this? Because it breaks character. Incongruent, yeah. Yeah, it breaks character. Yeah, so that's the other thing. So another way to say that, going back to boundaries, sometimes he has boundaries and then sometimes he doesn't have boundaries and that's incongruent. Well, that would be nuanced, wouldn't it? Because you want somebody that's kind of like that. I don't know. I don't know. You tell me. Yeah. I'm interested in what you want. There we go. Like I said, I like a simp. You like a simp, okay. I like somebody who does stuff for me when I ask. Nice, nice. What do you think? I think that manipulation in relationships is one of the purest forms of evil. Okay. I do not like to be manipulated and I will never manipulate my partner that I'm with. Sure. And yeah, I don't like manipulation at all. Okay. Are we understanding what she was saying differently? Yeah, I was about to say. Because the both of you keep looking at us like what we're saying has nothing to do with what you're saying. No, no, no, it's fine. It's fine because the thing is she's saying it to men. The majority of our audience is men. So I think she's saying it in a way that like captures our, because we're the ones who could possibly be manipulated. So it means more to us. I think from your standpoint, it might mean something else. You men are the only ones. No, no, no. In her statement, when we're talking about what women want. We're talking about what women want. Almost ripped this thing off. Yes. We all know that men do not manipulate women. We all understood that. That's whatsoever. That goes without saying that men don't do any manipulation whatsoever. Never. We don't do any whatsoever. Ms. Ronrare, what do you think? I kind of agree with her. Yeah? There should be no manipulating. It shouldn't even cross your mind. So I think that's the part we're missing. Yeah. Okay, one more time. I lost my mic. All right, so we don't. There we go. My mic's back. So the point is, it's like one of these things where if you have a guy with you who can fight, it doesn't mean he's supposed to fight, but he can look like he handles himself, right? You told me, Kylie and I were talking about this morning, what's more important, a guy who looks like he can bench press 300 pounds or a guy who can actually bench press 300 pounds? And she's like, I prefer a guy who looks like he can. Okay? We're not saying that you should or should not manipulate a man. What she's saying is that women find men more attractive when they know they can't manipulate him. Does that make sense? And so you guys are like, well, manipulation's bad. We all agree manipulation's bad. That's bullshit, because then girls wouldn't be dating the guys they know they can get stuff from. That's bullshit. That debunks everything. So no, but what she said was, so for sure, a woman will have sex with a guy because of different reasons, but she was talking about respect. The first beginning of the clip was talking about who does she respect, and I agree with that. Genuine desire and respect would come from a man that a woman knows she cannot manipulate. I believe that's the case. For sure, you and I know girls that are here, sugar babies, whatever, they take money from men they don't respect and have sex with them. Of course, that's not what we're talking about because they don't respect them, but we're talking about specifically respect. Anyway, Ms. Monroe, go ahead again. Well, if we're saying it like that, I guess when I think of a man that attracts me, it's not necessarily whether I can manipulate him or not. It's just I guess the boundaries thing is a thing, but also I want to get my way sometimes. I want a middle ground. It's a give. It's a take and give in all relationships. How about this? Just a way of saying it. When you do good things for him, he's going to let you get away with certain stuff, but if you aren't doing anything for him, then for instance, he might be more willing to drive 30 minutes to your house if you guys are in a consensual, monogamous, sexual relationship versus you've made him wait five dates and you don't have sex with him. Maybe he's tired of driving 30 minutes. Maybe he's set a boundary. Does that make sense? Yeah. Maybe something closer to that. Lindsay, what do you think? I don't know. I respect when a guy has a good understanding of his self and what it is that he actually wants because if he's upfront and honest and open about it from the get-go, then I am able to judge and see if we even are on the same frequency and it's up to me then to make my decision. Yes, this is what I want. This is what I'm looking for or no, that's not it. There should be no manipulation involved. It's a matter of, hey, do our energies match? If so, you want to come together. You want to help together. It's a partnership. If it's not, if they don't know, which a lot of people don't, then that's where chaos happens. Got it. I prefer peace. I was going to say, I mean, the point that the men are trying to get to, I think, is that women want a more alpha dominant. This would be one of the traits, yeah. This could be a popular trait. I think the way she's saying that, though, is that like not being able to manipulate someone would be one of those alpha traits, but another way you could say it would be to have boundaries. As long as there is still this element of you saying that I have boundaries and I cannot be manipulated, you should still be able to learn from your partner or learn from other people. Yeah. And when men hear the word alpha, they think that they heard something and made sense to them. They stick with it. No one can tell them anything. Otherwise, they're not open to learning from it. They're not open to another perspective or way of seeing things that might challenge that or change that narrative. And the thing that everybody's stuck on these days is everybody wants to be called the alphas. High value. And they all want to be high value. that they are it and they think that by repeating this rhetoric that everyone else in clips are saying that they're all sudden becoming those men but internally they don't learn they're stubborn they think of things one-sided there's no gray area to anything they lack the softness to be able to be empathetic to other people see here's here's why i think it's like that's it's more emphasized right now because too many guys have been like that for too long meaning like everybody has has decided that they're going to align themselves with their feminine they're going to be in their quote-unquote feminine energy whatever the fuck that means but they want to be they want to seem like they're more feminine identifying and have been doing that really for the last four gen really since the baby boomer generation to get in touch with we've been told this for so long man down man down and suddenly now everyone wants us to man up all of a sudden right well for four generations we've told guys to man down man down get in touch with your emotions get express yourself more get in touch with your female side you know uh you know do so what they took it too far well i think i think one of the reasons that we're sort of like seeing this is it's sort of detrimental to well society in general but like guys in general you'll hear guys they'll be like these i do this on my own podcast i i i compare uh different um different videos to other videos and those videos uh i set them off to kind of compare and contrast like the message from one to the mess to another message from another one and they tend to be like conflicting messages so you've got one one woman saying i want a guy who's like you know masculine and can kick ass and take names then you know he wants she want they want a guy who can like slit throats and change the diaper on the baby in the same day right so you've got this much like the guy that wants the virgin that's also a porn star exactly exactly so and and then honestly honestly i think that's kind of ridiculous as it is but the thing is is that we've been telling guys to be feminine and to sort of identify with the feminine for so long and everyone like for we're we're now in the fourth generation since this and so now it's a shock to the system when we say hey we want to if that's what you want then we want to take that to the nth degree we want to be but why why why can't you guys go from i make fire ah bro why can't you go from that to i make fire and have okay and then come here baby come in my arms do you want to learn how to make fire i teach you how because first of all first of all that's like that's a really a binary extreme right there second of all is this is that guys have been told that for so damn long right now that they that they played that card and they've used that card and hasn't bought them anything so not being playing the nice guy the nice guy card playing the i'm gonna be i respect women card that doesn't pay the bills when it comes to intersexual dynamics at this point and i know it's nice to have especially at different phases in in women's maturity so from the switching from the from the time you were like say 18 to about 28 years old you're wanting a guy that's much different than the guy that you're like going you know what i really want a nice guy and one really wants someone who's dependable and it's not like those assholes that i used to date back when i was 18 19 25 whatever it was and now i'm interested in a guy who has a little something else to him and that guy has to also not only be respectful but he also has to have some sort of like nice guy side to him like but that's kind of like alpha with a side of beta or a beta with a side of alpha this is what kills me about the the nice guy rhetoric you guys be a nice guy because you're a nice guy don't keep saying but i'm a nice guy why am i not getting laid why am i not getting this girl why am i not getting this so you're so you're worried about the complaining part of it the guy saying i was nice all this time and i'm not getting laid for it sounds like that guy thinks that he deserves to get laid right the problem with that is that nice guys guys will start being nice when nice gets them laid nice does not that means that they're not nice guys yeah no no hold on jesse do you understand that every single proclivity that men have only exists because women rewarded those proclivities do you understand there's no 100 like and i'm not talking about in the last 10 years i'm talking about the last 200 000 years 100 this is the chicken or the egg debate there's no for any time ladies complain oh these men are all narcissists then stop letting narcissists put their penis inside of you and stop having narcissus babies we don't know that they're narcissists at all until you're too deep in i said this the last podcast yes and you guys put those clips everywhere and the comments were disgusting the comments were oh here's another hoe that dated a narcissist and she's not responsible for anything that went wrong when you date a narcissist the problem with them being a narcissist you don't know that they're narcissists okay so just really wonderful people jesse let me let me just point out something i have some friends who've done the same thing where they've uh dated a narcissist and when other male figures or other figures that are outside the relationship are included they can clearly see the guy's a narcissist it's just the guy the woman who's having sex with him can't i just really think ladies i would just consider this if you had a a brother or a cousin or somebody a third party member come in and be like yeah he did this and this and this and listen to their advice but generally what happens i had uh was amanda uh nicole in here talking about don't get digmatized and like that's like that's the kind of situation where it's like you tell them and they don't listen anyway i just i have a feeling maybe not in your situation specifically but a lot of you ladies if you had had a third party come in and say hey what do you really think about my boyfriend you had some uh situations with him like he's rude to everyone i know i can't believe you're fucking with like you might want to listen to their opinion because they're not the ones sleeping with him so their opinion might be less biased you're talking about on people that know them no just go out with them go out like like as a couple can you have friends or as a couple does he not allow you to have friends when you're with a narcissist he doesn't even let you talk to your family okay you just gave me a clear symptom of narcissism so you can't tell me you can't tell michael that symptom came way later later okay that symptom came a year in not the first six months of love bombing and perfection where you thought this was the person you were going to die with you were going to get buried in this freaking spot and you were going to be with this person for the rest of your life the love bombing and the perfection everybody at work you know him they know him to be wonderful you just started dating him you date him for seven eight months and he's wonderful and so you're like yeah that everyone says he's wonderful and that is the mask that he wears you're a year deep yeah and all of a sudden the mask comes off and those symptoms start to come out okay okay that's not something that was shown to you and you just ignored all your friends telling you hey this is really weird hey this is really weird you're not ignoring them you're just not having to happen to you in a timely fashion so so while it only comes like i just want to add something and it only comes out to her right so everybody else he sure no that i've seen that yeah but that's a really big thing i want to make out with you right now i think all men are narcissists so yeah um so the thing is from a man's standpoint uh a lot of times from our viewpoint just understand this is how we see it uh we're watching us be super nice to girls and then not getting any attraction from it and then we pay attention to the men who are getting the girls we like and see a very stark difference and then we keep hearing women tell us that they want to date nice guys i have a i let's let's let's table the hold on let's let john will say something i want to table this okay go ahead we talked about because the reason i want to is because the one of the jamie lynn clips okay it's about narcissism just in reference to the video i just wanted to say that um the idea is that women will lose attraction and respect for men who don't pass their shit tests so what i would like to ask the women is do women consciously shit test men or is it an unconscious thing shit test define use a sentence fitness test um basically uh when a man is uh doesn't uh how many boundaries i suppose could you two move closer to amber and could you two move closer to john just for the camera go ahead answer john's question or do you guys understand well i mean so if he doesn't if as far as like a shit test right that's like a common yes no no for sure where it's basically uh the idea that um well first off i would even ask you know being in love requires you to be vulnerable would you agree with that yes absolutely 100 so how can you be vulnerable without being taken advantage of at some point are you allowed to let your guard down and truly trust your partner or are they just always going to be shit testing you and you're kind of having to kind of make sure that no boundaries are crossed in relationships when things happen i don't see them as tests i see them as something that we both get through together on the same conscious level of like this is how we would handle this if it were to arise but as far as like girls that test guys that what you mean yeah like let me see what he would do if my girlfriend hit on him or something like that yeah i don't again test his loyalty that is a form of manipulation and i don't function that way so i can't relate do you think many women function that way i've done a kind of a little test i wouldn't call it test you know what i mean but kind of like when i decided to bring a guy around my friends or my group of friends sure you know what i mean like how do you like we get wild we do crazy shit when we're out together like how do you feel how does it make you feel when you hang out with us like are you having fun or all are you having fun with my friends you know or are you sitting off in a corner somewhere not being social like either it could be okay but it just tells me you know what i mean if we again are on the same frequency can i let me let me so i don't i feel like there's more observation but it's like and that's why i said i don't really call it a test but in the same point in time like a conscious thing though is what i'm asking i don't think so i think it's i think it's completely subconscious i think that when well i mean so women will actually acknowledge it occasionally but it's usually when it's like so overt that they can't not you know acknowledge it i think i have done that so when i'm out with my husband and like my best girlfriends or whatever if he doesn't open the door for them or shut the door for them i will lose my shit see that's an act that's an act i will be really upset and i tell him we went to the beach and this girl was trying to lug this igloo cooler thing that was bigger than she was she was four foot eight and she's lugging it up these steps to get to her car and he's just standing there and i'm like he's like well i don't want you to feel like i'm overstepping boundaries like bro a woman is a woman you know respect and gentlemen is not just towards one you do know that if you're in san francisco did the same exact thing he's gonna get fucking way late for that right you're like i i understand what you're saying jesse but it's like this is something that happens whenever sometimes i deal with women is they're like i feel very strongly that men should do this and in the last relationship he was with a woman who felt the complete opposite do you understand that like if you you have to say that to him if you don't say that to him he's not gonna know i have though okay good did you you have uh do you guys see the curb your enthusiasm episode hold on we'll get you there's an episode of curb your enthusiasm where larry david like there's like he's not supposed to have the the uh the limo driver help his bags but it's this tiny little woman and so he does it she's like what are you trying to help me with my bags are you fucking chauvinist and then he she picks him up she can barely hold the bags and everyone's staring at him like bro why aren't you helping her with the fucking bags it's like that for us sometimes well so here's the by the way you know there's women out there that if you hold the door open for your girlfriend fine if you hold the door open for other women that woman will trip so you have to understand ladies just so we're clear just so we're clear just because you like a thing doesn't mean every woman likes a thing hence why i said i can't relate when you ask questions sometimes on these like and jesse i i agree jesse i agree you you do things that are very different from the from the middle of the standard deviations go ahead we're gonna we're gonna talk to lindsey first lindsey go ahead i wanted to say about that i was like you know that is one of my actual favorite silent tests like if a guy opens the door for me because that is the only way you can unlock the next achievement level where i reach over and open the door for you you know what i mean and i love that i love doing that yeah but do you love it for you yes i have so much fun with it because it is a fun little game but just i'm not usually with you know that scenario let's say we were all going together tomorrow to deadmau5 and your man was going to meet up with us you were walking through a door i mean then if he holds it for you that's a nice respectable thing to do okay what if i hold the door open for your man is that okay if i hold the door open for your man what if i smack him on the ass as he walks in is that fine i love how a shit test is just reduced to opening a fucking door i mean like there's so many other ways that women test no that was so fun though because i like opening the door for him but you only get that if you open it for me i'd like to ask a panel a question about opening up a door why okay why was holding the why has holding the door open become gender neutral when entering a building but you'll never see a woman opening up a car door for a man damn i opened the car door for my husband all the time so i don't know i can't relate i don't know i don't know but that again was taught generations ago that that was part of being a gentleman okay and and obviously some women find chivalry to be patronizing while other women expect it so as far as passing those tests i mean sometimes women will you know say hey he didn't offer to do this and so basically the man is guilty before he even knows what the woman expects out of him there's two extremes right now because we're leaving one like era of dating and entering another one we're in a traditional we left that a long time ago we haven't left it we're in a mixed bag some women still really want the traditional this and they still value that and that's how their families were and there's still younger women coming in that came from a house that didn't have those values and they don't want those things they don't they want to feel independent they want to feel like they did it themselves and the thing is that men keep trying to go for the woman that's in this bag while they're in this bag and the women keep going for the men that are in this bag while they're in this bag everyone needs to date on their level date in their era and date in their traditions that's it so what is the incentive for women to change when they can currently pick and choose the best of both worlds if we're transitioning what are we transitioning to like i just i just find someone that has the same values as you like guys want to date the hottest girls and then they're mad when those girls don't want to settle down with them cheat on them party all the time stop dating the party girl stop telling me that you're 45 years old and you want to date the 20 year old because she's you know youthful and that's what men want and we want untouched but then you're trying to lock down a 19 year old that doesn't want that part of your life all right that's not what she's looking for when she's 19 and 20 she's just graduated high school she wants a little she wants a little bit of life to be lived and then men want to hate women and say oh look at how these women just do us dirty you're dating the wrong kind of woman well that's because right now women want 20th century ideals they want 20th century quote-unquote chivalry which is bullshit to begin with it's they they want this 20th century sensibilities but they want 21st century privileges in that they want to pick and choose what it is that they want at any particular time because we were held back so significantly for so long we do zoe zoe you look like you had here so i don't i was just thinking that i a m before we started this i should have used the restroom I had a I opened the door for a guy yesterday and he said don't you ever open the door and I looked at him and I was like ooh it sent tingles to my happy place that's kind of what I was thinking about I'm thinking like what man would want a female to open the door for him okay we've gotten way off the subject the subject was about shit test so for those guys who don't understand we live in two different worlds we experienced life differently as men and women as a man i will tell you throughout my entire life women shit test me and have shit tested other men constantly incessantly all the time and it is absolutely subconscious and you don't even know that you're doing it you fail or pass no in the beginning i would fail because i would answer the shit test or get reactive later on once i realized oh that's not what this is about it's just trying to poke the bear to see if i get a reaction and then when you don't get the reaction you're showing you pass the test that's essentially what it is. Tori, Tori, give me a shit test right now go. Do you really think I can give you a shit test right now? See that's a shit test right there. Exactly. But a lot of times girls think that's flirting like they don't think that it's actually testing your worth and I say this all the time. Because they don't realize that that's part of the subconscious side of things there's there's active shit test and there's passive shit test for the for all the shit tests are meant to determine fitness is this guy the motherfucker that I think he actually is is he the guy that he's saying if you're fronting and saying I'm an awful male right if you give him this oh he thinks he's an awful male fine how about if I go on and try to get him in a fight with this guy over here and see if you see if he can like kick kick ass and take names that's an extreme example and I know Jesse you would never do that Jesse I know that but some women do that it's just it's to determine is this guy the best I can do so when women are first meeting a guy and they're having this talk this conversation with him they want to know that he's a good conversationalist and he could carry on it and he's actually he's if he says he's made partner in the attorney in the law firm he better not be a fucking sandwich artist at Subway okay so you have to find some way to determine whether or not that guy is actually who he says he is how do you do that you can't just go front on him like there what you have to do is you have to say well you know are you the kind of guy that would do this are you the kind of guy is he the kind of guy that would hold the door open for somebody is he the kind of guy who would protect me if somebody was going to attack me on the street is he the best I can do that's prior to getting into a relationship once people are in marriages and they're in long-term relationships the shit tests change it's how come you didn't take out the trash how come you didn't model on how come we don't make as much money mom my mama was always right about you I knew I knew you were would never amount to anything those kinds of things those are shit tests because it's did I make the right decision is he the best that I can do and he fails enough of those then we go see the the divorce attorney then we say you know what this isn't we're not gonna make it then we get to the ick then we get to the okay do you want to do do you want to go to another one of these clips or do you want to talk about Jamie well we will and here's we'll go to another clip here but I just also wanted to point out that Saadia Khan is completely wrong when it comes to hypergamy okay absolutely 100% what she's talking about is one side of hypergamy which is the bit the beta bucks which is the resources it's the protection provisioning and parental investment side yeah nothing to every last bit that she said there is all based on transaction everything she talks about is based on transaction he wants this he wants the pussy then he better be able to give me this this this and this and I need some benefits that's pretty much what it comes down to and she's completely lost okay so I'm gonna play devil's advocate here cuz it was just a clip and I've been misquoted in a lot of okay so this is what I think what she's saying is there's a bunch of different circles for what women want and all the circles merge and are concentric in this one area where we don't want a man who can manipulate us it doesn't mean that's the only thing every woman wants with every man that makes every woman attracted to every man but it is something that women in coke have commonality that they want that's why I agree and well and then again it comes back to the shit test as he was saying yeah for is it should test is the manipulation that we're bringing yes is he the guy that he purports he builds himself out to be because why in our evolutionary past our ancestral past a woman could die if she made the wrong decision with the wrong guy so if the guy can trick her into having a baby with her and he's not actually an alpha male he can't actually provide he's actually dead weight he's a narcissist he's a drug addict or whatever happened you find later on wait alpha beta male your baby dad tell us about your baby daddy but don't go ahead well but when you first met him okay so let's go through this you meet him you're physically attracted he was perfect tough to me he looked perfect yeah how'd you meet him how'd you meet him um just in a bar you met him in a bar you're talking to him in a bar he was was he smooth did you know you want to sleep with him immediately immediately physically you knew you want to sleep with him was the most attractive man you've ever seen and then you hung out with him in the first couple weeks what was it like like I was a princess and love bomb it was absolutely lots of love bombing okay he was a complete narcissist okay and manipulated me how do you manipulate you what do you do specifically just like everything everything that he did was just like I can't even explain it it's like you don't realize it's happening when it's happening okay let me ask you something now from what you've seen if you saw this happening to one of your friends or if some other dude tried to do this to you but you would would you be able to pick it out faster absolutely okay cool that's what I'm saying there are people out there they can help you that's all I'm saying what were the red flags yes that you ignored there was a lot so like I wasn't allowed to like go out with my girlfriends like basically my family was cut off I couldn't do anything everything had to be with him sure and it got to the point where like I wouldn't even leave the house it was him him him him and then like the accusations and like making me feel like I was the problem did he ruin holidays and birthdays for you absolutely yes I wasn't I didn't get any gifts for my birthday and it was even though you know you love Bobby in the beginning yeah then all that got away problem and then it came down to it and it was like I started realizing I was like oh no I was like what did I get myself into yeah you're too far in now exactly you're in love at that point and like you're willing to accept that kind of behavior you're hoping that he'll change and that's what we would discuss the last sure that you're just hoping that this person is in a bad way and doesn't realize how bad what they're doing okay with him acting like that as long as he was there which is how badly he manipulated oh yeah we're talking about maybe the five month period what what point did this happen it was like pretty instantaneous oh so he was very quickly started turning into a narcissist it was like two months in okay two months in yeah so there's a lot there's a few books on this about borderline narcissism and psychopathy stuff like this and it's usually right it's part of the five month period cluster B cluster B cluster B personality disorders was it MPD narcissistic personality borderline personality histrionic personality and antisocial yeah those are for that mad bad and sad bad or well we've done more psychology than any of these clips that I've already I'm always interested to hear this because what the thing is that's fine and I feel like you get one free everyone does but when you do two or three do you know the girl who's done this before the last three exes are narcissists and she's been engaged five times that girl and she doesn't go ahead we all know that girl yes that's my point I feel I feel like you all get the first one free everybody gets the front we all looked when you're young we don't know love feels good it's good it's fun to love love I love love right it feels great but then after a while it's just like wait a second I poured my whole motherfucking shit into this and then it didn't come back out the way that I thought and then it changes things and now you start to see red flags and those red flags don't mean anything to you especially I'm speaking just from a man standpoint when you're young horny dude in college those red flags don't mean shit she has a drinking problem sounds great sounds like a green flag to me sounds great she's covered in tattoos sounds great when when you're in your 20s later on as a man when you out when you have some experience you're like that's fucking red flag seems like a really cool girl to have on my show but not gonna fucking date her you know I'm saying so that's the way I look at it not specifically anyone here no nobody here you guys are all great there's no red flags here even seven holes over there she's there's no red flag hey we gotta do super chats I got I got a couple here let's do it $20 from irrational trucker love the t-shirt Michael is the manipulation Sadie refers to the saint of Sadia city refers to the same as coca tree meaning hot and cold before playing the hot and cold game I don't think women consciously think of manipulating men it's an algorithm Torsha I chose to be an asshole after 17 years of marriage I agree with the algorithm are probably an asshole the whole time yeah I agree with the algorithm part I think Sweden we do so many things you guys have to understand man you guys are the product of 178 million years of mammalian evolution like all of these these things that you have like there there's so much going on in your subconscious if you guys have ever read of the happiness hypothesis the analogy they use is a person on top of an elephant the elephant thinks it's in charge or the person on top of the elephant thinks it's in charge but the elephant really has more control and the problem is when you think you are the elephant there's really interesting thing where it's like your conscious mind is the person is the writer and your subconscious mind is the elephant and you can make the elephant turn right and turn left but you can't tell the elephant to never take a shit or to jump off a fucking cliff there's certain things you can't make the elephant do and so when you come to that realization you find yourself like I found myself getting mad at things for no reason why am I irritable there's no reason for me to be irritable but the awareness of it is making sure that you come to the realization hey I'm the writer right that's this is just my conscious my subconscious also has a say in here when people don't have that usually younger people when they're immature they don't recognize that they think the subconscious and the subconscious of the same thing right they don't understand there's anger in me they think I'm angry I'm angry is not a true statement you're not angry there's anger in you those are two different things there's a person there's an observer of the anger and then there's the anger and they're separating if you think the anger is you then that means you have no fucking control that means when you kill someone or ran your car over someone or shot someone that means you're not responsible for it and you are responsible you're responsible for your actions when you're young especially when you're really young you don't know you're responsible for your actions as you get older you come to the realization no matter how I feel inside I'm responsible for my behavior outside and the way I'm able to differentiate the two is by observing my feelings rather than fucking thinking that I am my feelings and now the DHS is really gonna come after me there we go okay date on your Ivan Leal says a date on your level tell that tell that to the 80% of women who want the top 5% of men and men want the top that's not true women men want youth and beauty sure they all want the girl that doesn't have to wear makeup and then she's just naturally beautiful and then she's just all these submissive and perfect men want that too they can't have it they can't get it but they all want that 1% to this narrative that women are the ones that only have these specific preferences they always get married who isn't that called settling okay ready there's a there's a reason there was an author she did a survey I don't I think I sent you this and they asked men this large group of men if you got 80% of everything you wanted in a partner would you be happy would you think that was fantastic and the vast majority of men were like 80% fuck yeah that's incredible then they asked a large group of women if you got 80 if you got 80% of what you wanted in your partner would you be happy and the vast majority of women said no 80% that's fucking settling all these statistics where they're coming from and who are these women are they standing outside of a bar okay so let's cool yes so so that's that's fire so let's let's one survey let's look at another survey let's get the 40 million people that are on dating apps 80 what those women find 80% of the men on those dating apps to be below average attractiveness you don't know unattractive that makes that has nothing to do with nothing because you're on a dating app you don't know that person you don't know that physical track I know but you don't know that person doesn't matter but you can still rate them on physical track 80% you can still rate someone on physical attractiveness even if you don't know attractive but you're not giving someone a chance no no no you're telling you're making my point for me you're making my point for me what I'm saying to you is you're saying that the girls are not going to give the men a chance because they don't know what I'm saying is you said before that men and women are the same and that they only want to date the top 5% and that is not true the top 10% of men on dating apps gets 63% of right swipes the top 43% of women get the top 63% of right swipes the top 40% of men get 96% of right swipes on dating apps it is so skewed towards the top four and a half percent of men on dating apps for men but for women it's the top 45% of women it's not even close 55% of the time men swipe right 5% of the time women swipe right women are pickier swipe right on oh sorry on dating apps or men are just desperate oh no but men are I agree men are desperate and women are picky but my point is her point was that we saw it the same and it's not true men are happy with an 80% solution and women find an 80% solution to be settling that's the issue we're saying and 70 to 80 divorces are initiated by oh god women you women men can't just go around doing whatever the fuck they want to do and acting however they want to act and be unhealed and think I would make fire and that the women are gonna stay forever agrees agree so so what we should do is an experiment where we remove men what we should look at is lesbian couples and we should look at gay couples and if what you're saying is true and the problem is actually men gay couples should get divorced at a higher rate than lesbian couples no one said the problem is men I'm just saying that this whole narrative you just said the problem is men the men the men that get divorced with most of the time are ignoring the woman that's playing with them to change or to level up again some way if what you're saying is true that if we looked at gay marriages and lesbian marriages what we should find because men are this problem is that men should get divorced at a higher rate than women do and what we find is it's three and a half to one lesbian couples get divorced more than than than gay couples do you know what a u-haul lesbian is you know but do not you guys don't know that term let no girls fall in love super quickly sure and they get a they get a u-haul and within the third date they've moved in together and they want to get married yeah because girls fall in love that's why the divorce rate with women and lesbian couples are so hot it could be that or it could be that or it could be that women just have a proclivity to get tired of a relationship easier than men do oh good Lord is that not a possibility doesn't make zero sense girls want so badly to have their forever partner and then so badly to leave their forever partner why would we want that's why it's mind-boggling and it hurts my brain hurts why would we want To have someone that we start a life with and then have to end it all to start all over again Because because it was only because you percent because only 80% of what you want to and you guys grew apart So that's why I don't want to leave no one No, but nobody wants to file it. That's the problem Nobody wants to file insurance claim for their house that burned down. I agree, but I said something important, but it's okay I don't remember. No, no, it's because it's about he's been smoking. It's about doing the work, right? And that's that's the biggest thing that is why so many women end up with narcissists and they stay too long and they do things that they shouldn't do because We have this hope like women have hope and we have faith and we have all of these things This is what inherently we carry with us. Like that's what the Creator gave to us That was that's that's our I love your egg, I love all of your anecdotal experience but like there's There's millions of studies that show this like twice like it's twice the number of men under the age of 30 or single than women So you have to understand that then that comes to? Maybe they there should be some light shed on the fact that men don't do a lot of like internal work So you and I get married and you're 25 years old and I'm 25 years old and in five years we're both 30 years old, but I'm 37 years old because literally I've grown and I've matured and I've healed and I 80 you think 80% of marriages are ending because of this Majority of men don't think that therapy or reading a book about inner work or healing is important to them Because the hard talks weren't talked before they got married I can tell you exactly go ahead go ahead roller because men and women Don't process emotions the same way because we don't have the same hardware Exactly. So because you are wanting to marry a woman and you want to be with a woman and you know that that's what comes With being in a relationship Longevity you want the forever that means okay Well if I know that women are emotional creatures and she's gonna want to grow and she's gonna expect me to grow with her And that way we don't grow apart and get divorced. I'm gonna have to do that work. How about this? Why don't you do the work for me because I don't process emotions the same way that you process Again it's like who's the priority. Well, here's my thing. I So, how do you how do you most men want women to to help them with those problems? Oh, no. No, you're misunderstanding. No, no six out of a thousand women even want to get married You guys are totally off base here. Women are not choosing men at all. The vast majority of women The vast majority of women are not attracted to the vast majority of men. That's what's going on 63% of men under the age of 30 or single 28% of men under the age of 30 are virgins Hold on. You didn't hear the word. I said Virgins and you're sitting there talking about life partners. Dudes are getting nothing. That's what I'm saying You guys keep saying you want virgins Why would girls start having sex with you if you keep saying you want virgins? Don't where are these women that you're gonna have sex with if all the women are needing a low to no body count Make it make sense. That's because that's because that plays very well on red meat podcasts Yeah, we've never said that you brought that up to us and I was like, I've never said that we so fine with you I've never said anything like you gotta understand and I'm gonna say this to everyone in the room that wasn't here. I am Traumatized by the fresh-and-fit Collaboration that they did last time because I don't operate from a place like that where you tell people that you have a low body count So you're worthy or you have a high body count. So you're a piece of shit No one wants to hear what you have to say. Um, like I don't treat people that way and I'm Traumatized I thought I got a Jamie Lin Yeah, I don't by the way, I totally agree with you But if you do have a high body count, I'm less likely to want to marry you But that's the difference. I mean, let me but I will be your friend I Definitely have you on my fucking podcast One more thing here really quickly men and women are different. Yeah, fundamentally mechanically biochemically down to the cellular level Different so the way that my brain architecture is wired is not the same way that yours are Yeah, the best thing about that is is that when you take to a man and a woman we are better together than we are Apart. Yeah, you put this them together. They are natural innate evolved compliments to one another The problem is is that you're trying to tell men you need to be more like a woman to be acceptable to me The problem with that is not doing the work or going to therapy or learning emotional intelligence Whatever the fuck that is What it is is it's not understanding that I'm not going to cry at the end of Titanic and because I don't Because I don't does it mean I'm emotionally stunted for not doing that Okay, and just because you didn't cry at the end of Saving Private Ryan does not necessarily But you get what I'm saying We lack the hardware so when women say oh men are going to therapy It would be so nice if they did just did that the problem is as you come back to the same thing We were just talking about a moment ago where we men have been told to get in touch with their emotions become more Express themselves get you don't have to do that in a feminine way exactly they don't but we're told that if we don't We're we're retarded or we're like in some or in some way like where we're defunct Clinical sense go ahead. I was just gonna ask is it harder for men to express their emotions or for women? Sorry, is it hard for women to withhold their emotions or for men to display their emotions? It's harder for men to explain it to express their emotions 100% I think a woman can hold back for a long time Which is why most women even get into relationships and stay in relationships where men are not good to them They hold back instead of just up and leaving and and how but a man has some hard-ass time for some reason saying hey You wearing that bothers me. I think it depends on how stubborn the person is Yeah, I don't I disagree that most relationships are ending because men are worse. I disagree with that. I'm sorry I just don't agree most really there's so I talked to these men and it's like women are leaving them because the guys were in a fucking raincoat But here's the issue here's the issue when you when you ask these women like what because they're surveyed on why they get a divorce And it's not because of what she's saying it is it so that's the reason why I'm saying this It's like when you guys say this, here's the other thing I'm gonna I'm just gonna point this out You guys are attractive you can get a type of man that a lot of other people can't you can attract the fuck boy that other People they come after you again If you're an attractive woman more fuck boys are gonna come after you and it's not a few more It's a lot more and so your experience might be different from the average woman who lives in, Wichita And by the way, the average woman in the United States is about 168 pounds. I'm from Wichita. I live in Wichita to st. Francis Street and fucking downtown Now my point is that the average woman is 168 pounds She's not dealing with this the majority of the time This is not what's going on That she can't that woman doesn't attract the same number of men or the type of men that you guys do and I agree that your experience may be Different Jesse your experience is totally different. You know, I find really interesting is I've said Men have these issues or whatever and you continue to go on and on and on and you don't acknowledge it Which is hot men do not take accountability ever ever a man Any time a girl says anything to a guy like hey, I think men should do something different They're like, oh you just date the wrong man. It's this a global problem like every woman. No, no that but but that You're turning it on Torsha she literally said we said 80% of divorces are initiated by women and she said 80% of divorce Divorces are initiated by women because it's men's fault. And now you're turning it around on me. I didn't say that So you don't think it's men's fault. I don't I don't think the majority of the reason why divorces and are men's fault Because then more men would fucking file for divorce. It isn't ridiculous. You would see gay couples Comfortable they're not gonna file for divorce when they're comfortable that girl that woman in Wichita the 168 pound woman her chubby husband would cheat on her in an instant if one of these girls gave him a look but most Momento cheese just not acting like a fuckboy like the ones that we encounter on a daily basis But given the opportunity that man will still do her wrong every single time So you believe you'll be your belief in your belief is like in Incessantly through evolution men are just flawed and kid There's no possibility of us having a relationship if women are all having a collective Experience and saying the same things about men who also don't go to therapy And I know I know there's like a thing the whole feminists But like men won't go to therapy Men won't Address their problems and they fight to like tooth and nail to say that it which which problems No, I'm not saying it has to be a woman You're telling me both sides have to work at it And then when one side stops to work at it Then they go and file for divorce and then women are incentivized to divorce men Because of the way the marriage laws were go ahead are men not collectively all saying the same things about women That's my point. We're having a common experience as well. That's the point I'm trying to make if you go on dating apps and 80% of men are deemed to be unattractive They're having a common experience as well. That's the point. I never said that that wasn't true I it's always men that anytime I say an issue that women have they always turn it back on themselves Why don't you guys take like a second for the third time? I've asked you for one thing that we're responsible, but I'm trying to answer the question. Are you triggered? Where's we got him girls We're trying to come to like a mutual understanding, yeah, that's what's going on for sure. Go ahead Torsha, what was the thing that I need to take accountability for can you specifically talk? No in general in men. What is the thing we need to take accountability for that? We're not taking accountability for mmm, I think men have a tendency to Do things out of self-interest and then they blame the women for doing unsavory actions Maybe unsavory act like I think men and roll known for example Like the boyfriend that stays out all night comes home at 5 6 a.m. And then does the oh, we knew where I was Like, I'm sorry, do you think most men are like it? Do you think most men are cheating? I think is that what you guys I mean, I I'm not I'm not saying that they're cheating I'm just I'm saying they're doing something that if yeah, their female counterpart was to do that They would lose their mind But you were saying that men do everything for sex, right No what I said with the original thing was in general women's Validation comes from attention and resources and men's validation comes from compliance and sex Yeah, so don't you think that because of their inherent nature that men are always going to operate to get that? So it's always gonna be self-interest. Like I'm gonna do this There's no way you can't say that about everyone and also the men who go die for their country that's not self-interest So yeah, men can have unconditional love for their country their family They're willing to protect and die for the tribe like self-interest Self-interest causes me to go kill the gazelle and keep it for myself not kill the gazelle and bring it back to the tribe That's why I don't think men are only interested in self-interest any more than men are the only Species in the world that killed their own kingship or whatever kill their own kin can no no lions do you talk about males? No, like lions and lions or like we are the only species males in particular that killed their own kind No, no, but I'll fit both seals only false. Yeah Elephant both seals like they all kill Tell me something right now Do you think that men in their 30s and 40s are going for women in their 30s and 40s? No, no, they're going for whatever they can get. Okay, so if the men are Having this experience where they feel like women are not giving them the time of day or respect or they're not good women It's because they're not dating the women that are ready to be wives or that are in the place of being that kind of woman They want to date the 19 20 21 22 year old that is at the bar for sure and they're surrounding their entire Narrative of women not being good and not giving them attention because they're all going after that and y'all immature woman got it who doesn't want so what they So what you should say is that a guy should wait till she's through that phase where she's young and immature He doesn't want to say about your age 20 year old woman when I'm 47. Why no, go ahead. Listen, why is that wrong? Why do you think that that 20 year old wants to have your children? She just graduated high school a year ago Maybe she she's out at the bars and partying if you're finding a girl That's 19. It hasn't left the house and done anything. It doesn't have a Urge or desire to go out and party and drink and live her life. Then you found yourself a unicorn. That's great Why for up if she's ready for that? I don't know any 18 19 or 20 year old girl that just graduated high school That's like I really want to find a 40 year old man depends on how conditioned by society you were Well, I'm sure in some small town That happens right small town, all right This idea that there's 35 year old men that are just able to date 20 year olds in some plethora is a fucking imaginary That's not what's happening. That's not what I'm saying. That's what they're going for So that's what their experience But they're getting nothing my point you guys don't understand you think you're getting nothing My point is general in men in general if you listen to Richard Reeves if you if you listen Richard Reeves or Scott Galloway There's the inequity with men. It's like you keep saying that these men are bad, but it's like the worst Can we replay the tape no when you when you were sitting there blaming men for these things before it's actually the men who have the worst Narcissistic most solipsistic fucking properties that are getting the most vagina Your argument is actually turned on its head because they're the best liars, okay, but that's fine Do you want to say that the best liars, but that's the thing the rest of men are looking. They're like hey Ben We're we're what about us then talk to your dudes Collect everybody all the guys Ding-a-lings tell them hey sit down. Okay. You you right here. You know we can't But when we do YouTube gets rid of our channel When we do tick tock We do the people are told to watch Disney movies and go watch the fucking Barbie propaganda. Why is that wrong? Why is it wrong that an older guy wants to get with a younger chick? It I don't know. Why is it? Why is it? Why is it wrong? It's not wrong that he wants to as long as obviously that she's of age What's wrong is that when he keeps making that his life goal? And you see that these women in that age range What about the women all chasing those small Percentage of high-value men and expecting them all to commit same problem. They are at fault for their own shit as well 100% if women are only trying to hold out for that 1% man that athlete that Drake that whoever then that's their problem So then that's also your problem And you need to tell all the chicks who have cooters at the table to go to therapy Chasing after drink both of you follow me I post on the daily on my story something about dating Ladies lock your legs up. Stop giving men stuff. They don't deserve it. Stop giving it to them. Stop giving it to them You are stop being okay with being the side chick Stop being okay with being taken care of by a man that treats you like a plaything stop giving it to them They're gonna keep complaining. They don't get laid Stop giving it to them period Everybody's held accountable for their shit. You're not held accountable, but he's not you're not held accountable But he's not everyone's accountable for their shit. Oh, I think she's wisely. Yes, not just stop giving it just choose wise No, no, I'm talking about like the okay with these Jessie power down for one second here. We got a new super chats Okay, here we go. Tiff Tiffany Fox of all people women want to be protected and have men provide But what do they offer to have it all from the man? Happy New Year's boys. See you soon. Happy 2024 Thank You Tiffany Fox box or fucks I Have a I have actually a fairly pertinent Jamie Lynn video if you Show this video go go go Can we pull it up here? Well, I see everybody headphones on so start it over and you have to unmute first It's a weird thing on Instagram And then I'm just they are not as good at expressing them depending on which culture you're in It's not always been the traditional way. Yes, of course women are the ones that bear the children, but I really I'm into Celtic culture. Okay, and The women actually in their culture were the only spiritual leaders so they when when they were going to Wait, that's not that's not the right one. Well my bad All women just The Celts were like just think of um, you know, we're on the island where England is no No, you're I island it so when you get to the northern part where Hadrian's wall is beyond that is where the Celts live the Scots Well, it's Scots would live now. Yeah Mm-hmm Yeah, I mean they had the sort of a pagan religion Yeah, this is this is before Christianity, which is referring to yeah No women that because the women are the portals like they were like the more powerful Yeah, I don't I don't know if she's corrected all the spiritual sages were women in Celtic culture She might not be right about that. I got it, but I really don't care one way or the other. So go ahead Yeah, here we go For you real quick, you know than women it's just they are not as good at expressing them and depending on which culture you're in It's not Anyway, she was she was talking about this was this was the this was Emotional than women to Celtic culture. Okay, and The women actually in their culture were the only spiritual leaders So they when when they were going to fight a war and hopefully I'm not like misquoting anything But when they would go to fight a war they would consult the women who were the spiritual leaders before they would go to the war and The women were allowed to fight in the wars so And then you have you know people like what Cleopatra. It's not true that that's always how it's been There's different types of women just like there's different types of men Yes, women were allowed to fight for the Celts and then they got completely eviscerated by the Romans. That's what happened Who did not allow women to fight I'm sure they did and then those Vikings were also eviscerated by the Romans the reason she's even bringing this up in the first place is she wants to in some way make a comparison that women and or men are more emotional than women or women are motion more emotional than men and the once again the Mistake that's being made here is that there's this idea what's called the blank slate that men and women are just there We're all the same and it's just the plumbing is different Depends on how much trauma you have and how much you're willing Do any of you here do any of you guys here believe in a blank slate ideology meaning if you just give women a tonka Trunk and give boys a Barbie doll that the boys will become feminine Maybe even turn gay and women will become more masculine. Did anyone here believe this? I don't believe that Okay, having I have a daughter. Okay, and she Loves paint like I'm not a very girly girl at all. Yeah, y'all can see but Loves pink but also knows every kind of construction for sure like loves Barbies But it doesn't make it doesn't make a female less feminine and it doesn't make a male less Your point is valid but that isn't the point that I'm making my point is the idea that I can make someone like that and my point is It make you more adverse and open up to I Think I think I think genetics and evolution have far more to do with how you turn out then then whether or not you had a tonka trunk or a Barbie doll and the reason why we know this to be the case is because they take monocytotic twins and put them in different Families, they don't do it. They just look at the experiment afterwards and they have the exact same traits Thank you genetics about it because genetics If gender is a social construct and boys are taught to be boys and girls are taught to be girls How do you explain the transgender argument that someone could be born with the wrong body or wrong brain? If a man can be born with a female brain you have to accept the idea that a female brain exists making it biology And not social socially constructed I think that again it goes to genetics like if you get if you have ever sat down with a geneticist and talked about like Traits that are passed down to children from like your ancestors. Yeah, like you're great. Great. Great. Great. Great great I think that a lot of those things are just inherently in people and that is passed down to you It's not I don't necessarily think that the way that we are created is wrong But I mean, I guess that could also be an argument I would tell you that you the way your personality ends up is probably 60 to 80 percent because of your genetics maybe 60 percent of your genetics and it's probably your environment is probably somewhere in the area of 23 25 percent and the last 5% is your parenting amber believe it or not parenting has very little to do with how people Grow up. What what hand do you write with? What's right with my right hand? My daughter actually is left-hand dominant. Oh, yeah, which is very like odd. It's not odd It's just 11% of the population say you sign your name with your right hand. I do Okay, I can sign my name with both hands that but you do your favor. You're right Okay But I could like tie your hand behind your back long enough and you'd be able to sign your name with your left hand Yeah, I mean if I tied both of my hands You couldn't do it in the beginning right what I'm saying is that you have a natural innate genetic proclivity to be right-handed I'm right-handed as well. My brother's ambidextrous on how that happened But but then people who are left-handed we I did we had this conversation on Dan's a project as well But the thing is is like that's a natural proclivity So that's and that's just common to people in general now There are natural proclivities that are unique to males and human females and human males as well So the problem is is that we want to we want to say that the way that women experience life and their natural Proclivities ought to be the natural proclivities for men And so when when when Jesse's here saying all you guys You need to go do that. You need to go do the the work you need to go do the therapy Whatever it is a problem with that is our genetic makeup is different than your genetic makeup But the problem is is that we're living in a world right now that says you are stunted There's something wrong with you because you don't experience life like a woman does and that's the correct proper way to do Well, how about this? So like I posed the question before What ways what ways help men? Express themselves better like how what what what would be more comfortable for a man? That's what the conversation that needs to be had right now But the problem is by having that conversation we offend an entire world of people Yeah because they are very in the ego invested in the idea that The way that we should be doing it as men ought to like the a more a more Well, okay, but here's it but it's not even so much offense It's it's just Taken for granted like that this is the way things ought to be and if men would just do these things the most the more perfect a man would be The perfect man would be like a woman. I Express himself and be exactly I I don't agree And I I think that a lot of women now have gotten to a point where they realize that maybe therapy Or I mean, there are many kinds of therapy that you can go through but there are things that work for some and not for Others like that's in every aspect of life. So a lot of women, you know, a lot of us are very open So we're like, okay, this doesn't work for you. What would work for you? Like tell me how I can better serve you tell me how I can I don't know that therapy of the way It's currently constructed is the answer since 5% of therapists under the age of 30 are man 5% the other issue with therapy is like where I the other thing with therapy that that kind of an issue is Therapists have to understand that as a man you have a burden of performance if the therapist forgets that what I think a man needs Is a performance coach not a therapist I think women can use therapy because emotions are so strong in them and there's something like a life coach a life coach Yes. Yes. Okay mo a mentoring comm go ahead. What were you saying? I'd like to ask you if most women aren't interested in a soft vulnerable, man Why are they often trying to get a man to express his emotions and be more vulnerable women are just trying to understand. So Our main source of understanding is usually communication. We don't necessarily need a man to be more soft We need men to be able to pinpoint what they're feeling and be able to compute Men's men remember we're talking about natural proclivities. That's a good point men's men But we do we do we default we default to it we to default to an emotion that people say is bad And that's it that's usually the thing so my my biggest thing is a lot of men and I think we talked about this last time But Talking to me we were we were talking about the insecurity of men so men spend all this time chasing women like You guys want girls like you guys want Instagram models you guys You guys want these beautiful women and then once you get them the insecurities that you have Usually are the downfall of the entire relationship so you have this woman that's doing all these things and you're so cool with it beforehand and then you get in the Relationship and you can't handle it and it's not like a Usually the woman will change whatever the thing it is Is bothering you but men will not say that those things are bothering them or will not say that they feel insecure about certain things Because you're a man and you don't want to feel weak Can you so I think because both of you kind of nodded your head when you say this but both of you have done modeling and I think you have a Narrow experience for a subset of women that I think the majority of men are not in that suit So what you're talking about before is I have this experience before modeling. Okay, when I was just a bartender, okay You're a super you're a super charismatic woman though, Lindsay Yes, you're super charismatic. The point is I just thought you did fun. I think I think You guys understand We'll have a bunch of attractive women on this show and then you'll ask him have you guys all been cheated on and they say Yes, if you were to ask him do most men cheat they'd say yes, but most men don't cheat. Most men don't get you I spent a lot of years working in the titty bar. I would beg the differ. Most men don't cheat I'm telling you right now. Most men don't cheat. It's not it's not even what you think That's not cheating Some of men wanting to cheat Look at the guys in the airport and say that guy could cheat that guy I Wish we did. Yeah, I wish we did the show at a Walmart We just we just walked around a fucking Walmart and you would look at some of these dudes and I said who's fucking that guy All sudden it would occur to you. Oh, oh Oh, okay. No, no, I get it now No one's fucking him because you guys are thinking right now and you're thinking about the experiences that you have with men Forgetting we're talking about all men men who are not good-looking or not Particularly tall or not particularly rich the 5 foot 5 cashier. He doesn't get recognized. He doesn't even get dissed He doesn't even get fucking recognized. I work at a bar With women like a challenge and if you're like not confident in yourself then How am I supposed to be calm even the ugly guy gets laid by the woman with no teeth? Watch it one more time the ugly the ugly guys not getting laid by anyone. No, I said even the ugly guy Oh, you mean now and now in the same age? He's not get laid at all anymore. So I have so many guys that sign up for my program Haven't been on a date in nine fucking years You said yeah, because they all act like they're freaking autistic Michael. We've talked about this before They have this like they come on MOA and they're like, okay. How do I have a threesome? Nobody's interested in doing the work. I'm being a better man Hey, my guys are you talk about let's dress like this. Let's act like this. Let's do this You know what? They hear nothing you you know what they did here the sentence that you said about how you only date a woman who likes other women I didn't hear anything else. And then I'll come on there and I'll just observe. I'll observe. And I've been on there 100 times with you. Every single call, there's guys asking how they can get their girlfriend who's not bisexual, how can I get her to bring a girl in the bedroom? Like bro, you already disappoint one woman, don't disappoint multiple women. This is like. I understand what you're saying. And I do remember what the conversation you're talking about. Just for context, Jesse comes on our free calls, those are not my clients. And yes, there are some of them that ask that question. And my response, Jesse, you have to be fair about this. My response is, what would it take for your girlfriend to tell you to go suck another guy's dick? And their response is, I would never do it. And then my response is, then why are you trying to get your fucking heterosexual girlfriend to have a threesome? I do say that. So don't put that one on me. No, no, no. The calls, the guys that are on the calls, all they wanna do is, how do I organize? These are Monday free calls, yes. How do I organize a photo shoot? How do I organize a photo shoot so I can get girls to come, so I can network with hot girls? They don't even have any business. They're not photographers, they're not models. They don't run any sort of business that has anything tied to models. But they wanna ask you how it is that you put them together. How do you put together events where you bring 50 or 60 girls? How do I get a bunch of hot girls to come over to this Airbnb that I rented for a photo shoot? And it's all because they want to try to get laid. These men are not taking heed to anything you're saying at all. I don't know what you're talking about. You're having a magnificent success in every single thing you're saying is working. I'm only talking about from what I've seen. Okay, no, you come on the free calls. So the free calls are all the idiots, is what you said. Yeah, the free calls aren't in my program. That's my point. You've been on the free calls. My clients are having fantastic success. I would love to hear the stories from your clients, actually. Okay, for sure. Why don't you come on a Tuesday call? She's on Monday calls. That's the reason why I was saying that. I can for sure come on a Tuesday. Get in there. I was just gonna say, you were saying earlier that the men that are cheating are the top percent guys. What about the married men that are cheating? One of the biggest reasons for divorce is infidelity. It's in the top five, but it's not the number one. It's second. I don't think it's second. The first one is financial. It's financial, then infidelity. I can look it up right now, but the first one is actually lack of commitment is the top reason. Do you see how all three of you have different answers? And this is why the internet explodes with anger over these things because, oh, women are the initiators. Oh, women are the cheaters. And nobody has the same answer for anything. That's why this show exists. Yeah. So we can give you those answers. Discuss it. I agree. I agree 100%. Can I ask a question about cheating? Which do you find to be more intimate, having a deep conversation or having sex? Deep conversation. If the answer is deep conversation. Get the fuck out of here. If the answer is deep conversation, why is cheating more about having sex than having a deep conversation with a stranger? I think when women cheat, they cheat mentally, but when men cheat, they cheat sexually. So then why should men be held to the same standards for cheating as women? Because they hold women to the same standards. Start all over again? Because you're talking about emotional cheating. I mean, I wouldn't want my boyfriend to get involved in an emotional affair with another woman, so no. We're just talking about having a deep conversation. What about me and Rolo? Is that okay? Is that all right, honey? We're having an emotional affair. We're having a deep conversation. Is that okay, honey? What is the deep conversation? Does this make you feel insecure? Yeah, you're angling it one way. They can have an intimate conversation about their lives or their marriage. He can come to me and be like, I have to talk to you about something really profound that I don't know what to do as a man. What do I do as a man? If a man and a female were having a deep conversation together and they were connecting and then the partner of one of the others, doesn't matter, felt a certain way and felt triggered as a result of them having this deep conversation, then that shows insecurity within the partner, period. If you and your partner aren't having deep conversations and then he goes and has a deep conversation with another woman. Well, at what point would you consider it to be? Then that would still be insecurity. Where does it cross the line? Because why wouldn't they be allowed to have that deep conversation? They should always be allowed to have that deep conversation. That's fine, they can have it, but that just lets me know, okay, I'm gonna grab my things and leave because you're not who I want to be with anymore. Just because of a conversation. They can do whatever they want. No, what she's saying is if a man is emotionally available to other women, but not her partner, yeah, for sure. What about if they're both? What do you mean? Not available to either? If they're both emotionally unavailable for each other, they probably should just leave. No, like if they're expressing themselves to you, but then they meet someone and they get deep in expressing themselves to them as well. That's fine, as long as it's not like an actual relationship. No, they should definitely leave then because that means they can connect. You can have relationships with other people, that's not the problem. I think what you're asking though is if he has a romantic deep connection with someone else, then that would be a problem in a monogamous relationship. Oh yeah, for sure, romantic, but I mean like deep conversation. Yeah, so I think deep conversation can mean a lot of things, but there's this study where they basically ask, these were psychology students, they asked them, the survey, they said would it bother you more if your partner, like you said, had a deep conversation with someone but did not have sex, and that was the caveat, they didn't have sex, or had sex with someone and there was no conversation, no connection whatsoever. And when they asked the question to men, or when they asked the question to women, women about 80, no it was like 60, 70% of the women said they were far more bothered with their partner having a deep conversation and connection with someone else even though they didn't have sex, and for men it was 97% of men said sex was worse. Fucking sex, for men, penetration, I'm sorry, for men, cheating is penetration. For women, conversation and connection is valuable. I will tell you that that is wrong because I have been in a relationship with a person that it was not their thought. Yeah, but my point is, so cheating was not, sex was not cheating? Yeah, oh no, no, sex, like intimate conversations were cheating. No, no, no, both of them were cheating, they asked them which was worse. For men, we can do a survey right now, if you ask men which is worse, she had a conversation with a dude and they did nothing or she fucked some guy, 99% of men are gonna say fucking the guy is worse. Because they value sex more than they value the intimacy that they have with their wife. So men know that having sex is cheating, correct? Yes, and men know that having sex is cheating. So then why the fuck do they do it if they know it's worse? Because for the same reason that women do it, because they're looking out for themselves. This is brilliant, Joshua, 10 bucks. Ladies, Tom Brady didn't cheat. I don't know who that is. Tom Brady, what? I'm done with you. Tom Brady cheated. Yeah, okay, good. I don't know. That is a great point, Tom Brady didn't cheat, Tom Brady brought in a ton of money, Tom Brady spent time with his kids and Gisele Munchen still left him, okay, that's the thing. I guess Tom Brady was the fucking problem. All right, I'm gonna read some Super Chats and then let's get to another video real quick. Siege D, thank you for the Super Chat. Yo, Sartain, I finally got the Evolutionary Psychology textbook behind you, I want you to get it to sign it for me when I come to Vegas, Sartain Psychology. I would like to, but let's make sure we get, why don't we get Dr. Busset to sign that first. That's from Geno, and then also, City Boy Farmer, I'm six foot three, 215 pounds, 38 years old, and I own a consulting company in Miami. I DMed Jessie and her response was, no thanks, see you in MOA, Mike. That's what he said, so hopefully I'll see you soon, City Boy Farmer, anyway, what are yours? Oh yeah, I got mine, let's see. Marriage causes divorce, he's one of my regulars. Never be emotionally vulnerable to a woman, women can't handle the truth, look what happened to Samson when he was emotionally vulnerable to Delilah, hilarious. With the caveat that it took like three or four times for that shit to go down, just saying there. One more time, can you guys move closer towards this way, can you guys move as much, you guys are so separated that the camera can't catch on. Marriage causes divorce. It's just nice hardwood between my legs that's making me go one way or the other. Okay, uh-oh. Lesbians have the highest divorce rate, women have the highest marital dissatisfaction rates, highest domestic violence rates, happens between lesbian marriages, hold the L, ladies. Yes, factually true. Okay, top reasons for divorce, you ready for this? Number one reason, lack of commitment. Number two, infidelity and extramarital affairs, as you might imagine. Next, the third is, too much conflict and arguing. Where's boredom? Number four, getting married too young. Number five, financial problems. Money doesn't rank until the fifth. Getting married too young, so like marrying the 19 year old when you're 45? Like Jesse, I'm with you, but most guys aren't trying to marry a 19 year old. No, no, Jesse. But that's your guys' excuse for why you chase after the 19 year old. Jesse, I don't know fucking five dudes trying to date a 19 year old. I don't know what you're talking about. Like if we were to do surveys, no I don't. Listen, if you're just talking about him, that's different, okay? But other than that, most guys are not trying to do that. I think you need to open up Instagram one day and scroll through the comments through some of the Hoodville or some of these posts, any of these posts, and see what is being said. Let's do a scientific survey. They're like, hey, let's, we all just want the 19 year olds? Yes, it's even, it's like, kind of creepy. It's disgusting. I agree that there's a lot of dudes who want 19 year olds. I'm saying the majority of men are not trying to. A big group together and one little accepting bunch. Okay, let me blow all of that out of the water. That has nothing to do with what you're talking about. It's like the two kids that met at church camp that got married at like 18 right out of high school. That's really what that means. That's what they're talking about, married too young. They're talking about both people being married too young. In this case, that's what they're talking about. Next one down, let's see, is financial problems. Substance abuse, number six. Domestic violence, number seven. Lack of support from family, number eight. Health problems, number nine. Religious differences, ranks pretty low at 10. And then the next one is little or no premarital education. I don't even know how that got there. Boredom should have totally been on there. By the way, the fighting is the boredom one. That's lack of commitment. The fighting one is the boredom one, actually. Yes. All right, cool. Do you want to do another clip? We can do that. All right, did you want to do the Jamie Lynn one? I'm like, can we find the right Jamie Lynn one? Did you find it? Why don't you look for it on your phone? I've got tons of them. I'm ready to go wherever you are. Why don't you look for it on your phone while I do this? Hold on, Michael, one second. That city boy comment, what does that mean? He said he DM'd me and I said no thanks. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, so he's making a joke. Well, I got rejected, so now I'm joining MOA. I'm married. I know you're married. That's why I was going to tell him. It's fine. I'm always going to say no to anybody who DM's me. I don't care if you're six foot 10 or whatever. You're going to be six foot 10? Okay. Yeah, no, I'm good. Even if it's, no, most girls are like six foot, six foot three is like kind of the prime height that women choose. But if it's a chick, you're good. No? Can we do this one? I like pockets. I like little pockets. Can you pull up the ick indicator? Let's give a shout out to Ho Mouth. Ho Mouth has been awesome. Ho Mouth is probably David Buss, Dan Bilzerian, and Ho Mouth are probably my three favorite interviews I've ever done. So I had Ho Mouth on twice. The video got 150,000 views. It was fucking incredible. So we're going to shout out Ho Mouth here one more time. Let's see if we can find him. Which one is it? Ho Mouth? Keep going. That's it, that's it. Is this it? Yeah, Ho Mouth. Okay, I got it. I got it. Hang on. Let me back it up a little bit. Does he spell it 304? Okay, here we go. Are you ready? Oh, wait. So do you know? Can you spell it like that? Okay, ready? Here we go. Can we start from the beginning and turn it all the way up? We can just look that up on the ick indicator. That's why I made it. There are two types. There is not enough of something, and then there is being affected by something. Wait, you gotta start this over because I know you're watching this. Okay, but let me bring it back in. I'm gonna just use this right here. What is this? When he takes a nap, it irrationally. When he takes a nap? Yeah, nap. Because they're awake and want them to be awake with them. Sorry, it's really low. Not enough of something, and then there is being affected by something that's too sensitive to sleepiness, having a feeling of sleepiness, and then we just find the degree. This is arranged from more understandable behavior to less acceptable. If he cannot swing a hammer, it's normal to be icked out by that, but not so much if he can't carry a refrigerator. It has to do with reasonable expectations. Is this like a skit or a spoof? So if you were discharged from him wearing a raincoat or carrying an umbrella, that would be an unsalvageable ick. I would try needing a nap somewhere in between making a big deal of a cut or a bruise and enjoying music a little too much. I'd place that right about here. That would be, who do you think you are? Yes, lady. Beautiful. All right, so I just wanna bring this up. So this is the concept of icks. There are some icks that are legitimate. Like if your dude got shoved by another dude and ran off and left you in a bar or whatever, that's a legitimate ick. Like ladies, I would recommend, like if I had a daughter, I would say like, you need to leave that dude. But some icks, I've seen, like he said, like the very first one, whenever he takes a nap, I find it icky. Whenever he wants to take a nap, okay? So the point is, what we can ask you is, what icks do you have? But some icks are fucking irrational. That's the point. So she's one of the women that is in the 80%, she would still not be happy in a relationship if she had a man that was 80% of what he wanted. I would say there's a pretty high correlation, yeah. Yeah, so she's one of those girls that you just don't listen to. Well, depending on how many naps he's taken. A deal breaker is taking naps. For sure. There was another one, we have another one where a woman's like, when my man's walking down the aisle, he had better be crying because he cares, but if I see him crying, I might think he's a beta bitch. So it's like, no matter what, he's shit tested. No matter what, he's wrong. Yeah, no matter what, he's wrong. Anyway, ladies, just curious, what is something that gives you the ick? Actually, I kind of relate to what they said in the video. The nap thing, I can see that as, so like, my child's father, actually, I became to the point where I was disgusted with him because he was so lazy. Okay. It's mental load. You were bearing the mental load. Just like, laying around and like, my side of the bed would be so clean, and then his side of the bed, they're just like trash. Yeah. That's an ick. Okay, that's an ick, right? Okay, cool. What about you, Amber? I don't even ask me what my icks are. I don't know what to say. There's no man good enough to even, to have icks. No, no, no, no, no. I've dealt with- She'll put up with anything. I've dealt with so much, and I feel like I am a person that is just very forgiving. So even things that ick me out, like taking care of a man, a man that doesn't work, or a man that is out of work for whatever reason, and taking care of a man. For most women, that's an ick. But for me, I always see it as, you know what? You would want somebody to do that for you if you were in that situation. So it's like, that would be an ick. That's a huge ick. But how long would you do that? I mean, how long have I done it? I've done it for really long times, stretches of time. in multiple relationships. What if you're with a guy who's like absolutely perfect? He's a good looking dude, makes some money and everything, but like he picks his toes or some shit like that. And you're like, would you be like, no, I can't do it. I can't do it. Would that be a deal breaker? I mean, don't do it in front of my face. Yeah, I'd either let me film it and sell it because there's a fetish in it. So we can make money. Nice, let's go in a business. I've gotten to a place, like the older that I get, I understand that everyone is different. Everyone has flaws. Everyone has flaws. And you're picking your toenails, doesn't affect. Everyone has flaws, everyone has flaws, so let's just divorce him. No, I'm saying that's gross, but no, that's my problem because I don't try to end things over stuff like that. Like I try to stay and I try to like help, I try to fix. So what's a deal breaker for you? His kicks are your inks, or sorry, his inks, his icks are your kinks. But for me, a person that asks for something from someone but won't give that thing, that's an ick for me. So if you want me to do something. That's like more of like a character flaw. I'm talking about like he doesn't brush his teeth the right way, or. Oh wait, it can mean men that approach you also. Yeah. Something that when men approach you, it's icky. Men that wear really, really, really tight, tight pants. Like the jegging material. I feel judged. Like have a big one. Massive amounts of cologne. No, I've never seen you wearing Peter Pan pants. I swear to God, never like that. I'm talking about. With like the low crotch and it's stretchy. That's how it is, packing. Doesn't even look like natural jean or denim. It's just stretchy, like a woman's leggings. Skinny pants. Skinny pants, but to a whole other degree. I agree. I love that, I love that. Wait, so you like those skinny, stretchy things. Isn't it funny how as a man, you're just fucked no matter what? Got it, okay, beautiful. So you like that. Tori, I gotta know, what's your, come on. I know you have them too. I have two. Okay. One of them is imagining whoever I'm dating running in an airport in flip-flops. Okay, that's okay, yeah. And like his backpack going back and forth. Running with a backpack sucks, it's true, yeah. It's very specific. And then another one is, this one's pretty bad, but if they're sick for too long and they, I don't know, you have to care for them. Isn't that crazy? Yeah. You lose attraction for a man because he's sick. Let me put on the nurse uniform and make you soup. Let's turn this into a role play. I just assume they're lying, so I don't know. She's like Munchausen, you think it's Munchausen. Beautiful. Aren't women supposed to be the nurturers? Empathy. Isn't it funny? No, no, I think the point is, again, Dr. David Buss' book, Why Women Have Sex, there's 237 reasons why men and women have sex, Cindy Messon and David Buss. And so there's a variety of reasons why women are attracted to men, but there's also a variety of reasons why women find men icky. This variety, like what she said is she liked those skinny jeans and she wanted to take care of a man and she thought taking care of a man for a long time for too long, he has Munchausen's disorder and he's making it up. Okay. Darling, what do you, what are some ics? What are some horrible things? What are some horrible things I do that are so icky? You're gonna get rid of me. Go ahead. Wearing kitty shirts. I don't, I don't know. I mean, like I have ics too, but yeah, I mean, like I think my thing is as long as they're not more than how much I like that person, then I'll just stay and ignore them. How about strangers who approach you? Because I know that I do stuff that annoys you. Me. You know what I mean? You never do anything that annoys me. One more time. But you mentioned stuff about strangers that approach you. Do you remember? Like I've used you as an example before when we talked about cold approach. Oh, I guess like things that ick me out about like random people. Yeah, I guess that's one. I hate like being out and just like random guy. Well, I don't know, because that's hard. Like, because we've talked about this, about like random guys just approaching me and just annoys me, right? But then again, and then he's like, well, but if this guy's like 6'10 and like whatever, you know, like, no, I'm not gonna be annoyed by it anymore. So like, that doesn't really count. Oh, it was like the movie. It's like when we went to the movies the other day. That would have never been the case if he was ugly. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We went to the movies. That wouldn't have been acceptable. Yeah, we went to the movies the other night. We went to the movie the other night and we were talking about how gross this would actually be. In this new movie, it's like a romantic comedy. This guy, or this girl's trying to use the bathroom at like a Starbucks and they won't let her use the bathroom because she's not actually buying anything. And there's a long line to get a coffee, to do anything in there. And this guy sees her having this problem with the employee that won't give her the key to the bathroom. And he's like, oh, that's my wife. She's gonna buy that loaf of bread and I'm gonna buy it for her so give her the key to the bathroom. Oh, that's nice. That was sweet. But she pointed it out to me. She's like, if he was fucking, if he was ugly and he put his arm around her and said, oh, this is my wife, it would have been creepy. Of course. Oh, I don't feel that way. If you just help me and save me, like, I don't care what you look like. Thank you. That's a good, that's a gesture. It would be so nice, but in the same sense, I would be sitting there looking at you like, nah, nah, like, that's so strong. One more time. You guys see, hold on. The point I want to point out is the variance that everyone has. In fact, if I were to ask you ladies what you find physically attractive, man, there'd be an incredible variance. I would be like, oh my God, thank you for saving me regardless of what you look like. Now, if you proceeded forward in our conversation, and you started to flirt with me, then I would be like, mm, come on, not anymore. I got a follow up for this. Is there anything like a guy has as a hobby that you would say is an ick? Rescuing cats, perhaps. Like a nerd. Figurines. Oh, shit. Little kid toy things. Legos. Fighting dogs. Or kid toys. Anime shit. I don't think, no. Fighting dogs? Yeah, that's, I have an ick there. What? Fighting dogs. You don't like dog fighting? That's horrible. Or like chicken fights? That's a thing in Iowa. I'm with you on that. I don't think. Animal cruelty as a hobby. I'm with you on that one. Anime? Hold on, hold on, wait. You don't like anime? I don't like the anime thing either. Who said that? Yeah, that's, I don't like that. Dude, I see dudes so obsessed with anime, and I don't get it. It just shows me that you're either on the spectrum. Oh, see, there we go. The girl next to her loves anime. Are you guys seeing? Is everyone watching this? It's a fucking whirlwind. There's no correct answer. Anime chicks are hot. Anime chicks are hot? There you go. I got a question for Amber. Amber, Amber, if you were dating a guy, and he was really into anime, and he said, hey, I want to go to Comic-Con, or I want to go to Anime-Con, where would you go? Oh, hell yeah. I would so go. Hell yeah, that's hot. I love anime. 100%, you want to know why? But what if over to, no, no, no, no. I love anime. What I don't like is when a man is obsessed with anime like he's a child. Yeah. That's the problem. Because they have like post-its and stuff. I love video games. Yeah, so-and-so would never beat so-and-so. I'll play Call of Duty for four hours straight, but if my man is sitting there playing eight hours, 10 hours, and I can't pry him out of it. So then it becomes something of an obsession. It's an ick. Yeah. How about if, do you have a nerdy hobby that, or any hobby that you think is an ick? Don't call my hobbies nerdy. No, no, I'm not saying, I'm not saying they are. I'm not just saying that, I'm just saying stereotypically. But Amber, you would go to an Anime-Con. Yeah. Yeah. I think anybody, any hobby could become an ick if they're obsessed with it. But there's a difference between like a guy whose hobby is like playing pick-up basketball after work. That's cool. But then that's not obsessed with it, because you're like, you're creating a time for it, you know? But you also have time for other things. If, say if they were playing basketball for morning to night, whether they're actually shooting the whole time or not, but they don't have time for anything else, then that's an ick. Yeah. I can't ask Lindsay this, because I know she's into cosplay. You're right, I am Electra. Yeah. Is there anything that's like weird that you, would be an ick for you? Like a hobby? There's lots of things that are weird, but like nothing's really an ick for me. It's just the hobby itself. You're who you are, you know what I mean? So do what makes you happy. Like if you do something so much to where you are now giving me excuses and you can't hang out with me or spend time with me, you know what I mean? Then that's a different story, which could maybe make somebody feel like it's an ick. I think that's pretty much what everybody's gonna say though. Does that make sense? Yeah, I think everybody's gonna say like, if you're done to excess, anything can be right. But I'm just saying like, is there a specific thing that's like, John's chomping at the bit here, what? I just wanna know, if guys are into red pill, is that an ick for a lot of women? Yes. I'm sure. 100%. Yeah, it's terrible. 100%. Do you have like a hobby? Like a guy has a hobby, you're like, oh, I'm out. If you worship and you date, you gotta go male. That's not a hobby. For these men these days, it is. No, it's a way of life. What's worse? I'll tell you what, men wearing colored eye contacts. I don't like that. I don't like that either. That's an ick. Yes, that's a big one. But actually it's an ick. Hobbies. Okay, a hobby that I do not like that most men do, play video games. Because why are you sitting there screaming at your TV? Like, I think that's terrible. I play video games, so I actually like that. It's a disassociate form. You know, there's a lot of girls that don't like when their men go to the gym, because for the men, it's mostly an escape. But the women don't like it, because why are you taking so much time out of your day and not spending it with me? You know what I mean? So I've faced with those girls before. So like, I think it just kinda depends. I just think it's gross when they're like screaming at their TV, and they're like, die, die, die! I'm like, ah! Yelling at a 15-year-old boy. That's when you just have to leave the room and be like, okay, babe, you have fun killing your imaginary friends. I'm gonna go with my girls to brunch, so I'm gonna do some real shit. I played Fortnite. I played Fortnite for a little bit, and I just like, I couldn't get behind it. I was like, what is this like? I love Fortnite. It's so much sexier. I can see you arguing with like 15-year-old boys all day. Oh my god. Every single day. I have every gaming system, but I don't know how to play it. I think I know what you're gonna say, but go ahead, give me a hobby. World of Warcraft? I was an undead rogue. That's an ick? What do you think that is? No, that's like a hobby that's kinda like, you wouldn't want your guy to play it. Oh, like Pokemon cards kinda thing? Is that what that is? No, it's a game. It's like a computer game. Oh, nevermind. I used to play that back in school. I can't really think of anything. Yeah, it's like a really in-depth computer game. Like anything at all? Like nerdy hobbies? I was an undead rogue, and it's still on my computer. See, here's my theory. I like nerdy shit. I know you do. I knew what you were gonna say. Here's my theory, is that women are okay with guys' hobbies as long as it's something that benefits them in some way, either directly or indirectly. That's why I gave you the basketball thing, right? That's something physical or lifting weights, for example. A guy's gonna come home and doing it right, and he's like, it's his thing. He's gonna come home in better shape, probably in better spirits or better mood or whatever. Maybe he's gonna be more muscular or something like that. But if it's something that is isolated or insular, where it's just him and the hobby, then that's something I think that women go, oh, that's a nerdy hobby. He's playing Dungeons and Dragons. He's playing anime or whatever it is, and he's really upset. That's why I asked, would you go to a comic con or would you go to an anime con? Because that's really what he's into. And would you do that because you're into it, or would you do it because it's like, okay, well, he's hot, but he's got this really nerdy hobby, and I have to get into it, too, because that means if I wanna stay with him, I gotta do it. I wish I had someone to go to a comic con with. It's all about being supportive. Amber and I will go once again, let's do it. I have the outfit and everything, I'm ready. It's about being supportive. I am a huge proponent of just supporting your partner in whatever way, shape, or form that you can. If you love that person, fuck, they could have the nerdiest, weirdest hobbies. They might like to go and fucking hunt water moccasins. How old is this man? I love golf. I've golfed my whole life. And I'm also a golf caddy. I'm like 20. But I think that it's important. We gotta watch Chick Flicks, you know what I mean? I don't watch Chick Flicks. I actually like to watch the most fucked up shit. If you guys have ever seen Saltburn, go watch Saltburn. My sister made my family watch it on Christmas. It's a movie. It's a movie, yeah. It's a movie, yeah. It's a movie, yeah. That was so good. On Netflix? Yeah, it's on Netflix. Please go watch it and then find me on Instagram and message me. We'll message you about Saltburn. Sounds good. Tell me how fucked up you are. We watched it on Christmas. Permission to jump in the DMs. Christmas, yes. Did you have that clip that you actually didn't want? Yeah, I do. Let's try that again. I've got also, let me get to this super chat real quick. Skyview Photography says, Jesse, I speak for the average man. We sleep with younger girls and save relationships in marriage for more mature women. I'm 43 and my girl is 38. Shout out to Mike and Kylie. And he wanted one of these. There you go. I'm the mongo, mongo, mongo. All right, let's see the video. You ready? I got it. Are we good to go? There you go. Oops, let me. Sorry, Jess. And they're like, well, she's a narcissist. And it's like, no, that's not the case. Hold on a second. Oh, is this like about Instagram girls? Yeah. Are getting likes and they're like, well, she's a narcissist. And it's like, no, that's not the case. Well, she likes attention. Well, who doesn't like attention? Everybody likes attention. That doesn't make her a narcissist. Is it a narcissistic trait? Sure, but that doesn't mean that it meets the diagnostic criteria for NPD or a narcissist. Let's use another example. Let's take children, okay? Do we call children narcissists when they're like, mom, look at me. Hey, look at me. Look at what I'm doing over here. No, that's a need and a desire for attention, but it's also part of how you build healthy self-esteem. So again, that's why these traits are getting so misdiagnosed because people are seeing that and they're labeling it narcissists and they don't look at it within context of the pattern of the relationship or their relationships with other people. They look at it, they take an isolated incident and they're like, yep, narcissist, you know? So that's just one example of how these things can get really misled. People will see a girl posting a pic on Instagram or getting likes and they're like, well, she's a... Okay, can I? Yeah, you may opine. Please do. I have so much to say. So just before you, hold that thought. The reason I brought this up is because we were talking about narcissism like earlier on in the show today, so go ahead. So these are also problems that I have dealt with, but a lot of guys don't understand, especially if they're not in that scope, if they are not in social media, like you gentlemen understand. Do you understand the algorithm, pleasing the algorithm and doing what it takes? So having a partner that thinks that you posted a picture to get attention, like these things don't, they don't matter. Like as a person that uses that as like a business platform, no matter of like these comments, these likes, they don't mean anything. I'm just trying to get more visibility on my platform. At no point when you were posting on Instagram, did you get any sort of satisfaction or validation from the fact that a lot of people liked you? The only time that I do, I will say like, honestly, if I posted something that I'm like very, very proud of, there's a lot of sexy stuff on my Instagram, obviously, but there are things that I really, really consider like art. And when I post those things and those things get a lot of traction, like that makes me feel good, but it's not like a- It's not a narcissistic thing, it's a creativity. So I think there's two different things here. Women wanting attention is different than being a narcissist. She's correct. And also because she's a marriage and family therapist, NPD, or narcissism, those are two different things. Narcissism is undiagnosed, it's just a person who's a narcissist, runs around. NPD means something went wrong in your life and you had to go seek counseling. A personality disorder. Yeah, now you have a personality disorder, but you're actually trying to get help for it. That's the difference between the two. And she's correct. In the function of narcissism, this person would have no comprehension that they're hurting other people's feelings, and they're just completely fucking out there full of grandeur and delusion. And I don't, and she's right, that's not narcissism. What I do think, however, is that women do really like attention. They do. They like attention from their partner, they like attention from people that, and they like attention more than men do. Like they really like attention. Not necessarily because you wanna cheat on your boyfriend. That's not what we're saying. But there is some validation that women get from posting certain things on social media and the validation they get from the likes and the comments and the shares. So I would understand that if, or I would understand being placed in that category if I was one of those girls that. And I'm not talking about you particularly. No, no, I'm just saying like speaking in general terms because of like what we're talking about, if I was that girl that was like getting done up all the time and going out and trying to be seen and all of that stuff. Wearing makeup to the gym and shit, yeah. Yeah, like I would for sure understand that point, but I have been told by partners that I've had that I'm just attention seeking because of certain things that I do that all of us do for our platforms to try and like further our platforms. So it's people lacking the basic understanding, the basic knowledge of what social media is and how you use it as a business tool. And they lack the comprehension skills to even wrap their minds around the fact that you're doing it to push something. I have contracts with companies to push a product. Obviously that needs to get more visibility. Those things don't get visibility on my page because that's not what my page is built around. I think because you make money from it doesn't mean you don't like the attention. But the attention doesn't matter. Like the attention that you want, like the attention that I want, I want from my partner. I don't want that from anybody else. Agreed, okay, so that's another type of attention. No, agreed. But here's my thing. I don't care who is in my DMs or who's liking my things or who's commenting on my things. I don't care. Like I really, really don't care. If I cared, would I look like this when I come on your show? Like do you know what I'm saying? But have you ever looked at a photo and noticed that this photo did better than this other photo? That's not something you've ever even looked at? You look at that, but you don't look at it in that lens. Like it's not, I'm not, I'm not. Wouldn't you just be proud of the fact that you've, your journey, your own personal journey, you've come a ways and you've completed your transition. Sure, but we're men not taking pictures without our clothes on. That's the difference. I'm saying there's a difference between the two. Like for the difference between. There's a difference between the two, the way the two genders process attention. That's all I'm saying. I mean, if I could finish a thought. How many selfies is too many? Hold on, let Lindsey finish. It's okay, I forgot. You know I smoke a lot. Okay, go ahead. Like I do, but I'm not with it, like it ends. I thought she was done, sorry. Damn, you have some good shit too. I always do. People listen. No, I just wanted to ask you, in your opinion, how many selfies is too many selfies? I don't, like selfies are not my thing. Like I. She posed like professional. Like I'm like a model. But I'm saying like if you saw a girl in the bathroom and she was just taking a million selfies, at some point would you attribute any type of narcissistic traits to that? No, you wanna know what I would think? I would think that she's trying to, she's trying to look a certain way for a certain person that she's trying to please. She has an idea of an image that she wants to create. And from that person, she wants attention. That's my point. Yeah, but is she trying to seek attention from one person or is she trying to seek attention from all these people? It doesn't matter if it's, okay, so here's the way it works. It's like. What if she's just trying to create an image that she sees in her head and it has nothing to do with anybody else? Yeah. That's a possibility, but that's not what we're seeing in general. Now, here's the thing. Going back to what you said before, here's their partner that she's in love with. His attention definitely weighs more than any of the likes from the weirdos she gets comments from on Instagram. But all of these together mean a lot. Meaning like the 10, 100,000 likes. What is the threshold? There's a threshold to where one means more than the other. There is. I don't agree, but I don't agree because that's just, that's not how I part of it. So the reason why I brought this up is because similar to what you were saying, because you were saying, well, all these sons of bitches that I'm dating are these guys are just nothing but narcissists or they turn into narcissists. After I've been with. They don't turn into narcissists. After I, well, they already were, but you just. They weren't displaying narcissistic. You discover the narcissism after, I don't know, six months in. After the mask falls off. Exactly. So with that in mind, with that in mind, at what point does attention seeking or attention, whatever you want to call it, when does, what is, where do you cross the line from attention, enjoying or seeking, whatever you want to call it? And narcissism, where's the, where's the threshold? Your behavior towards other people. It's a lack of liking a photo and wanting someone to acknowledge that that was a good photo of you or a good, whatever creative, whatever is completely different than wrecking someone's life. Then going into a relationship and wrecking someone's life, knowing that you're hurting them because this person is complaining. But where does, again, where does the, where does the self love end and the narcissism begin? So the question is, why does it have to be, why does it have to be between self love and narcissism for someone that is a model that is using Instagram as like an online portfolio as a business platform? Why does that have to be? I get called a narcissist all the time, by the way. Well, no, I know. But I'm just saying. I don't have nearly as many photos as this guy does. I'm really surprised by that. Because people just hate me. That's why. See, that's why I was saying, it's like, I think using the term narcissist is, as she was saying, very overused. She's saying it's very overused. I think we're smart, but I still don't fully understand the term narcissist. So if that's me personally, I'm like, there's got to be a bajillion of other women. There's a difference between. No, I don't, no, I've heard you talk. It's a delusion or a level of grandeur about your own self worth to think. Does that make sense? Go ahead, go ahead. I just think that it's, there's a difference between being vain and being a narcissist. Vanity. Yeah, and I'm super vain. Vanity can be a narcissistic trait, but it doesn't make you a narcissist. Yeah, like a narcissist would have to have a pattern of behavior. That's what it is. Which is what I just said. It's not about getting likes or attention. It's about what you're doing to the people around you. Sorry, we're making two different arguments. I agree with Jamie. I don't think that makes you a narcissist because you're like that. But I do think women want attention more than men do. I do agree with that. Right, but that has nothing to do with narcissism. If that's true, then why do we make a big fuss about men not getting swiped on? Because it's about sex. Because men, the validation that men want. No, it's about attractiveness. One more time, one more time. We're not on the dating apps for fucking attention. Women are literally saying that they're going on dating apps, doing 6,000, we're doing 6,000 swipes and not even talking to a single dude. They're doing 6,000 swipes. They're doing 16,000 swipes and not even going on 10 dates. That's what's going on. Here we go. It's okay. It's okay, it's okay. It's okay that you're triggered. This is my job. Tell us more, tell us more. One more time. Let's go on dating apps for sex. Stop. Well, they're not getting laid. Most men are virgins or haven't had sex. So if that's the case, that's pretty stupid and delusional. Women are going on dating apps for attention. Men are going on dating apps for sex. That's not what I'm talking about. I'm saying that if you're saying that this is getting, if you're saying that women are trying to get attention or whatever by posting pictures, well, guys are trying to get attention and it affects them the same way. But they're trying to get attention for sex, for a relationship. That's fine. But what's the difference between attention? Because one attention is just for, oh, here's the difference. Why does everyone need attention? One more time, one more time, guys. This concept where I see women do this all the time. They will go and text a guy that they're not, have no intention of going on a date with. They will flirt with him. They will lead him on. They will do all kinds of stuff. Men don't do this. We do not go on dates with women that we don't intend on having sex with. That's the difference. I'm not saying one is better than the other. But you guys do a lot of sex with everyone. I'm not saying one is better than the other. But what I am saying is that men's validation tends to come from compliance in sex and women's validation tends to come from attention and then eventually resources. That's it. Men are desperate to get validation from women. For sex. No, for everything. For sex. For everything. Yes, but that's what men do. He took out the trash. Got a throw party for him. Okay, but you even said in the beginning of the show that men do everything because of sex. Agreed. I don't disagree. So then you just proved my point. What do you mean? Is what I'm saying. No, you're saying attention for sex and then I'm saying attention. Men do everything for female validation, yes or no? Yes, but validation is not attention. Oh my God, are you joking? So for instance, you give two different people, they get two different types of validation. One person can get validation from their father. Their father did not validate them throughout their whole lives and they've been trying to get validation from them. Another person could have grown up poor and gets validation for making money. Validation is not one thing. In one case, someone needs validation through attention and someone else needs validation through sex. Those are two different things, but they're both validation. It's one piece to a big puzzle. Okay, go ahead. They mean the same thing. So sex and attention mean the same thing? No, validation and attention. But no, validation and attention do not mean the same thing. It falls under the same category. No, no, you can get attention from validation. That's like, you get validation from attention. It's what you're saying, because they're not going out of their way or something. Is that what you're trying to say? Who's they? Men, men. What are you saying about the difference between attention and validation? I'm not following your line. So a man getting sex can be his validation. If a man gets money, that can get validation. And you can get money without receiving attention. There's billionaires, you don't even know who they are. Okay, so there's different ways of getting validation. Men need us for validation. Women do not need men for validation. Well, I mean, you may find some people disagree with that. Oh wait, hold on. You were just saying one of your ics was guys coming on to you or guys who are asking you and some of them are below six feet and some of them are above six feet. And you were saying that one of them gives you the ic and another one doesn't give you the ic. No, it's not about height, Roland. No, that's not what I'm saying. Because if they're short and they're like attractive in the face, I'm not gonna be irritated by it either. I'll probably still have a conversation. To clarify. It's just they're like, they smell gross and they're weird. Certain guys' attention. We all know, we all know. I don't have to explain it because we know. Okay, so explain one more thing to me then. Are some guys' attention more valuable than other guys' attention? The person you like. Yeah, of course. The person that you're interested in. It's the guy who creeps you out. Is his attention less valuable than the guy who you're attracted to? It's not valuable at all. I don't want his attention. Then there is your validation in a nutshell right there. No, because the way you set it up was, you just set it up asking her a specific question. If you said, do you need male attention to live? To survive. To survive. No. But he's qualifying it for different types of, we're talking about validation. Do you need male validation to live? Yeah, and men don't need sex to live either. That's the point. It's valid, validation is not a survival quality. But if that's true, then why do we talk about all the issues with men? Like, why does being sexless matter? So there's different levels of need, like Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, and then the bottom level, we have food, clothing, and shelter. That's what you need to physically survive so the phenotype can continue to have mitosis. Biological. Biological survival. So a sense of need? Once you get above that, there's another need above that, and for the need for women is attention, and the need for men is sex. That's what I'm saying. It's a higher need, but it's not a survival need. Does that make me a man? I've never heard that. I'm sure my need is definitely for sex, than it is for attention. See, this is where I would throw Maslow under the bus. Sex is a need, because you will hear. You need it like air and water and food. How did we all reproduce, how are we sitting here then? That's not a need. I have gotten, I've written essays about this, I've gotten in so many arguments about this. I'm with you, Rolo. Oh, you guys just want to get your dick wet. No, and that's not what it's about. What I mean is the species goes extinct. Agreed, the species, yes. If you don't have sex. Ergo, sex is a human need, because if it weren't, we would not be here having this conversation. No, no, totally agree. My point is the individual phenotype does not need sex to survive. The species on a macro level does. It's not like oxygen and food and water. But if sex was not a higher biological need for men than it is for women, how would women, as a standard, manipulate men through sex as they do? Yeah, because it's a higher value for guys. But you guys come to us. You want something from women. No one's denying. No, but I'm saying, fundamentally, you're always going to be the ones wanting something from us, so we would never be in that position. There's another part to this. Fundamentally, you'll always be the pickier of the two genders, because in every two-gender species, the one that has more investment, it's called parental investment. Higher reproductive cost. Yeah, it's called parental investment hypothesis in evolutionary psychology. Women are always going to be pickier. By the way, I didn't blame anyone for anything I was saying earlier today. Women are pickier, which is why, when they say 80% of a partner, I'm settling, I don't want to do that. That's because women are pickier. Men have built buildings and sent people to the moon, built skyscrapers, and invented electric cars, all to impress women, for sure. We went to the moon? We did go to the moon. Shit. Debate next week. We did go to the moon. We went to the moon six times. Anyway, so the point is, I'm not saying I disagree, but what I'm saying is, or I'm not saying that it's anyone's fault. What I'm saying is, evolution made men one way and women another way, and because of that, women are more selective. The point that we're making is that they've gotten so selective now, because of social media, that it's gotten to the point of delusion, where they think, because I fucked a 10, I can get a nine to commit to me, and they can't get that nine to commit, and the next thing you know, you meet the girl who's been engaged five times. Go ahead. Is it delusion, or is that just nature? Like, with no constraints, women, hold on, if women now can provide for themselves, they don't, they literally do not have to depend on a man. Hold on, let me finish. You're correct about that. You're not correct about who they can get to commit. You didn't let me finish. Men, men do not even, Land the plane, Torture. Sorry, okay. Let me go to different things. Okay, so if we take all the constraints off of women, and women are picking the top percent of men, that's nature. Yes, but the top percent of men that they were exposed to. That's not delusion. That's fact. No, no, no, time out, time out. You know what I'm saying? It's biology. There's what they're choosing, that's fine. What you're choosing is not delusional. What you think you can get, the difference between what you believe reality is, and so this is reality, and this is what you believe reality is. If there's a massive separation between the two, that is delusion. I agree with you about how, but you forget. That's what we were we've been getting at all night is don't forget to mention that We just talked about earlier add that right after you say the women thing add it right after say all right But men are delusional too because men also Expect this to this exact, you know, whatever from a woman or they expect this look from a woman, but they can't get that either Okay, add that right after Agree I Will be I'm putting into my nose right now. All right. Thank you We need to make this show with the condition that the next time we say, you know, what guys are fucking delusional I expect you to go. You know what bitches are delusional, too Yes Let's do this catharsis so we can all just just shit out our emotions real quick, right ready Men are delusional in part men are delusional in part mainly because of pornography and OnlyFans They're delusional in like what they believe sex is going to be with a woman and that does make them delusional They're also delusional when it comes to the idea of like what they think they're going to get as far as like body count and The world is trending in one direction men are delusional when they think the world is gonna trend back in the other way Men are often delusional. I don't disagree men are also delusional in other things that are not intersexual Like for instance I know a lot of men have had business partners who believe that they did over 50% of the work and they didn't even do 10% men have issues when it comes this men also suffer from nurse from a narcissism more and they also suffer from autism more Like twice the rate that that women do of course they do and those clips don't go viral That's the difference when we say this Virally But we do mention it all the time there's several clips where I talk about this Have to be red and flaming one more time red flaming boots Can I ask a delusional question go ahead go who is more delusional Sexy women who say they dress for themselves or high-level men who say they improve for themselves Is it summer or winter? Oh god, can I women women saying they dress for them? I would say it's more delusional I've written a whole chapter women dress for other women guys They do but fuck like at between those two the women dress It just depends if you like playing dress up or not If you're always that person who is involved in costumes and love playing dress up and especially if you have an arts background Like you look for any and every excuse to dress up. Yeah, here's the thing. I can be a girly girl Is that my nature on my day-to-day? No, I love lounging around in sweats But give me an opportunity give me a chance to put on my heels to have my hair done my makeup done I don't do it myself. I have a makeup artist. I have hairstylist. Give me that opportunity to be glamorous I fucking love it and my girls that are down with me like we love it, too So when we go out together, yeah, we stand out but you know it that's because we love it Not every girl has to love it. That's beautiful. Why don't the three of us do the same thing? Hold on No, I'm just curious. Why don't the three of us do the same thing? Why is it can what do you mean? No, why don't we want to why is it not? Why is it not in our proclivity? You don't care, but we're the ones who are narcissists. Hold on one more time Why do the three of us not want to do that? Why is it there's not this I'm not trying to attack you I'm just asking you. Why is it three? So why are why is it that the three of us in general we don't want to go out and wear sparkly shit and get a bunch of attention Right, okay That's a secondary answer But the answer is because we are not as it is we are not as necessitous of attention as you are You can just say you're boring I think and they love it because to them that's their passion They're all into it. And so as a result of them having this shoe collection to where they love You know what? They got that love for it. They got it from queer. I for the straight guy There are guys that definitely take pride in how they look and how they dress and I don't have a problem with it I think that's something that can be very attractive if they're not if it's not too far to where they are then Because I think I represent a happy medium between the two I would say since I am the hottest guy in the red pillows from Well, because like you guys have seen me on my when we were doing the Halloween or his birthday guys remember we did his birthday party. Yes So yeah, so we're driving every all the girls get to dress up like boy you didn't get the full effect from what I was gonna dress up as but As as far as guys like presenting themselves I think a lot of a lot of guys there's there's a certain demographic of guys who will say well A real man doesn't doesn't care about the way he looks bull shit Every guy knows that there is he is presenting himself in some way. You don't go to a funeral You don't go to a job interview. You don't go to a wedding. You don't present yourself. You don't you've been in the military What happened well guys both of you what happens when the dudes give up on trying to get women when what happens when the dudes Give up on that sexual validation. Do they become skinnier or fatter? Do they stay inside more or less good when they stop caring about what what women think? Do they become more attuned to their attractiveness or less? What do you think Tori? I would argue that most men don't give a fuck about what they look like. They don't even bathe regularly Most men do but I don't think that most men don't bathe. I think it might be a little bit hyperbolic They don't spread their cheeks to wash their ass. That's what's funny because you guys top one percenters You don't realize that like literally I think I think I'm top 50% I don't know about top I'm just saying like you guys can't fathom it, but it actually it is I don't think I don't think most wait But the point I was trying to make before is you understand what I'm saying when men give up on the idea like you heard 50% of men have given up on dating when men give up on dating Do they take more consideration or the physical appearance or less? I don't which goes well, I understand, you know, okay. Thank you Men are suffering. I don't care My point is when the drive when the drive for women Rightly or wrongly when the drive for women dissipates then all sudden their necessity for attention also dissipate Because their validation comes from Sex women. Yes, and women's validation does not come from men anywhere to the same extent Okay, hold on. Jesse has to go Jesse. We want to tell you that we all I thought you were living Oh, I'm sorry. It's amber We want to tell him that you love that guy But for the for to be fair amber is going home to be a good mother We have no problem with amber going home. We love amber. So we don't want to anybody think anything's wrong with this Amber is a good an incredible She's gonna make incredible wife for some red pill guy someday somewhere down the line Make sure you make sure you guys follow make sure you guys follow amber and and masturbate to her pictures Just kidding The mom life, that's for sure good you being responsible they say you're not but you are Okay, so what one more time you because she was asking what a 304 is so we'll let her know 304 is host spelled backwards Be a hoe There you go. Now. I was gonna say as far as like like personal appearance I mean, there's guys who are just basically style coaches as well. So it's not like guys don't care about their looks it's just like they don't because they have this mentality that like you like a real man doesn't care how he looks he just goes in there and you know wears Jeans or Dockers or whatever and you know get some hard days work done. And that's that's all he really needs to do There's a really great book It's by author named Tanner Guzzi and it's called the appearance of power and it is all about the dynamics of men Dress up. Well depends on what it is that they like to do You already know that I like playing dress up as far as like costumes and stuff or something like that makes a comment Are you like cosplay or whatever that difference? I think you mean different kind of dress up lead to like some Don't look up the This is all another podcast Do not Google yiffy. What stop? Hey, you know Do not do let's do this real quick because because we're talking about about men being delusional So I even have a clip rolled up about men being delusional. Can you pull up the very first clip this one? That's the one that's what my man Bismarck. Can we go ahead and pull that up on the screen there? All right, then go ahead and make sure you're a man. Jesus Christ Am I unmuted? No, there you go. Okay, we're ready to go and see here we go. Good to go Being ugly is a choice. And here's why most men are not ugly They just put little to no effort into their parents or image, but expect the most results I got guys who try to argue with me that dressing well as a man is doing too much Yeah guys who argue with me that being groomed up is doing I can look at a guy that claims He's ugly and I can point out five different things on every single guy watching on how he can improve his looks You're not ugly. You just not putting your effort There are plenty of things that you can do to improve how you look if you put in the effort to be a better-looking man Stop being lazy. You're going to start getting the results you want. If you don't you're going to stay the same You're going to keep complaining. You're gonna keep being picked last Where he said something that actually sounded intelligent Really the one clip that he's I've ever seen of this motherfucker. The only clip When do you see Bismarck, I'm curious like why do you say I'm curious why you would see clips of Thinking maybe your husband. No, no, my friend will does like videos talking against what the red pill Okay, I can't say and he watches the clips and then tells you his opinion on it And this is almost every single video this man shows up saying some fearless. Absolutely Delusional Before before we besmirch my friend Bismarck real quick the What is you do agree with what he said there though men men could do a lot more isolated clip I'll bet you I could find you 20 clips you agree with him I bet I could I bet you about 50 clips you agree I also see clips where I hear Andrew Tate say absolutely ridiculous things and then I hear him say things like Treat a woman well marry her one woman's better than a hundred women and then in another clip He'll say just rotate girls. It's like none of it ever stays consistent It doesn't matter if I like this clip as a whole what he's about. Okay, but you do agree with this But we were talking about men being victims here. And so this is a constant men being delusional Yeah, men be delusional men same thing men being victims and men being delusional One of the things is I have to deal with because of my company I have to deal with male objections and male limiting self beliefs and one of the main ones that I have to deal with is for men is that I'm not good-looking Enough and a lot of these guys aren't good-looking But the thing is not only can they do things to what we call looks max But also women do not care as much about a man's looks as men care about a woman's looks, right? So you agree with that? It goes over several things. You saw how that first picture of him with the weird haircut and then how he looked later He's completely changed the way you look. Do you agree with this? Also? Look at most women's baby daddies. They're ugly Lindsay have you have you seen a man level up before I care about looks but yes, I have seen yes You think they can what do you think? What do you think why I was gonna say a lot of things that women hold against men are things that they can't change They can't change their height. They can't change the size of their penis. They can't change if they're balding. I mean, maybe Injections and they can fix those things a man can get his Anything like I said, because you like the idea of something doesn't mean you'll actually go through with something You have to more than like the idea something you actually have to want it, right? We're talking we're talking about basic He's talking about basic shit like like fucking brushing your tongue and using moisturizer on a regular basis like growing a beard Getting a ball thing. You'd be surprised how how men Dress for their body. Yes. They don't know what haircut actually. Yes their frame of face Some they don't like I know that you preach a lot of like Tell the MOA guys to wear a simple shirt and jeans and where shit that fits them. I don't care what they wear I don't know what colors they were Like oh and when you're really rich you Shave time off your day by just wearing a plain black shirt and some jeans and whatever that works for the billionaires You're not a billionaire. You don't have to dress like that You can put style in effort into your looks and a lot of times guys feel like it's too gay if they Do things for themselves like moisturizer or like conditioning their eyebrows or getting their eyebrows waxed Listen when you have a full-on uni brow and your hair looks like what's that thing that comes out of the trash can? from Sesame Street When you look like that and you could be not looking like that you're choosing Because you're like, oh, it's gay if I get my eyebrows waxed or threaded or plucked like you just see I don't think that they Necessarily think it's like a gay. I think they don't see the point like I'm ugly and what's the point of me doing that? Because I have so many things like that are wrong with me that just plucking my eyebrows is not going to Get me out of depression And I agree with you I'm just saying the mentality though is Why should I bother because it I'm it doesn't matter what I look like. I'm five five Yeah, so I'm and you guys know that I'm vain, but here's the thing Thousands of dollars and into my face my body and Hours and hours of my time and my time is my most valuable currency So I do this so I can look amazing naked and that's what I want for myself. So here's the thing I told you I'm vain. So if I'm looking for a partner I want somebody who cares enough about themselves to be the best version of themselves to them as well And if you feel like the best version of yourself is to be a slob Well, then that's that's your train of thought John that doesn't mean it What I'm searching for would you turn down Jason Momoa if he wasn't showered or shaved? Yes. Yes, that's absolutely. I don't know. We have sex for 72 hours and we're all fucking You know Stuff that's like hormonal like women don't want to sleep with guys that show any kind of affection or something said again They don't want to sleep with guys to do like women evolved to seek out men that don't signify Illness and shit and things like not showering scent women have more of a sense I think there's a I think there's a cultural There's a little bit of normalcy like I think a man coming back from the gym and like but he still showers on a daily Basis, she might like his smell a little bit more, but I think for the most part the fetish for that Yeah, for sure But more there's like a rut with the lumber sexual these guys who look like lumberjacks that women find attractive or whatever They're like, I'm sure they find that attractive. I'm sure I'm sure there's some chop wood I think smelling bad is just smelling bad. I think it would be harder to find things. You aren't attracted to Well, you said that guys don't see the point because if they feel like they're ugly, they're already ugly Let's say that you improved or tweak something and got 10% better-looking just by doing something different with your hair Just that extra 10% is an extra 10% of right way So it does matter and it should be One thing just do one thing and that one thing leads to something else Next thing, you know, you're a whole new person like as a We're talking before about male delusion as a performance coach all and he's the same way all we deal with his male delusion When men come to us, they are always filled with beliefs that aren't true I had a buddy got a guy come to me the other day. He's 32 years old He's like life has passed me by I was trying to date a woman, but I think I'm too old to date now Years old well, it's just crazy these beliefs that these these some of these men have and so I'm constantly dealing with with With with male delusion and that's one of the reasons why I have to deal with these When we just just you even saying that like there's so many like so many people who are like critics of the replica Oh, they never talk about this stuff bullshit. We talk about all the time But when we talk about it, we talk about way men can improve constant And when we talk about men improving you want to know what happens? It doesn't go viral. That's the difference They don't do anything to change it or because no, it's just nobody just the Internet in general To have to change anything. No, it's because the end we're talking about the Internet the Internet in general wants conflict and chaos And and those guys and this is such drama Queen And this is why you hate them so much and I understand this I can definitely give you is they don't care about self-improvement They don't care about like being better. They don't care about trying to play the game better They want the game to change for them rather than them to be being better. So let's go to Columbia Exactly. And so what happens is this is that they they it's like giving up? I understand that part But the thing is is that they the reason why they're doing this is because they would rather see a woman get held accountable That's the the buzzword for it. But really what it is is it's comeuppance They want to live vicariously through somebody who's like, oh you guys aren't hard enough on these bitches on access Vegas That's why I don't want you on sub like, okay fine Don't fucking watch the show But that you're still got to go home and jerk off to whatever you've been jerk in the next window over you got to go Do whatever you're gonna do, but the fact of the matter is is that they would rather see that you know what goes viral he was saying this to the you know, self-improvement does not go as viral as a Stoicism video where the guy it looks like some, you know, rock solid a Greco Roman, you know Zeus walking away from some bitch who's like crying like here like they love That walk away Well It says it's not what it's what it says is it yes But it also implies a hopelessness because well What difference does it make if I pluck my fucking eyebrows because I can't I would rather it's easier Lower investment to get a better reward to have somebody Vicariously say oh, but you ain't done you ain't nothing but tricks and hoes like that's that to them. It sounds like a better High or a better dopamine hit or an endorphin rush than it does to say, you know what? We should really get our fucking asses in the gym and do TRT I'm gonna ask you guys Have you guys ever seen a guy who was physically unattractive to you and then later on became physically attracted to you? Is that ever happened 100% this happened to you? You just see them and they're ready-made you just get the pie out of it and it's whatever Yeah, you get the pie off the the bait of out of the song as the hottest guy in the red pill So a question for Tori Are women's dating standards too high or are men just lazy? I think that women are evolved to have standards I have a different take with this a little bit. It's evolved a little bit I think women are always going to seek out specific traits and if men aren't trying to compete You're not gonna have your genes going to the future It's not sad, yeah, but like objectively speaking you either level up or die out You want something we have correct But but they also think you can your genetics can die out if you wait until you're 40 because you're waiting which is fine But we don't care about that. Like the men care about copying their fucking genes No, not the same way that men do not the same legacy thing But you guys having kids because maybe not legacy, but you think women don't want children as much as yes Why do you think most the happiest women are single women with no children? Actually, that's not that's that those those women that are single with no children are also the ones on the most amount of Prozac and fucking Antidepressants, maybe it's cuz I'm a man Prozac Let me let me throw in monkey wrenches. You have heard of this thing called maternal instinct, correct? Mm-hmm Biological because what I'm saying what I'm saying is that there is a there's a well we can get into sexy sons there But what I was gonna say is like there is a for and some woman will say I don't have a maternal instinct So it must be fake. Well, I'm sure there are some people with some women who are so like self-absorbed But then you got someone like Jennifer Aniston who's probably wanted to have kids her entire life But never found love and so there she's working now. It's menopause can't do it now but the thing is is there comes a point and it's usually the Biological clock ticking and these days it happens to be right around when the woman's 30 But there is such a thing as maternal instinct where women want to have children. They want babies. They see a baby and I go Smell the head of a baby and they go Wait, but what I'm trying to say is that men talk about how they want to spread their seed, correct? They want multiple women to spread their seed. That's ideally right but to spread their seed It means what like to push their impregnate But women don't they want to pick the best mate if the best mate doesn't come around They're not gonna pick anybody. You know what I'm saying? So so which is so who's more delusional then? Why is that delusion? I'm talking like at a basic biology like part hypergamy versus monogamy Basically, I would rather stay single than end up with a beta or whatever for sure. I Understand that but that's not delusional. What's delusional is thinking as you get older you're holding out for the alpha that you didn't get before Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's delusional Know their standards, let's say and they know that men aren't really gonna meet them Maybe she met one guy that will it's like no what I think the delusion comes is they have sex with men that are in the class that they want to settle down with and Believe that they can get those men to settle down with them and they can't Right. I agree with that. That's what the delusion is That just doesn't play out and like the stats like I I see that in my life And I'm sure you do like in the party party scene and stuff, but I don't know if that's at large That where women think that they can get someone better to settle. Yeah 80% they said 80% of what I wanted wasn't good enough and I'm settling. Yeah, I do By the way reality reality if you guys talk to couples that have been together for 80 years They won't say that my partner's 100% of what I wanted realistically 80% is actually really fucking good So for women to say I would I'm settling for 80% that is not in congruence with reality That's my point, but I didn't say I didn't say like I didn't put a number on anything. I'm just saying in general I agree with you if somebody was like, I need a hundred percent. Yes, you're insane Yes, like I agree, but I'm just saying that I think that men from a bio biological Whatever standpoint they want to copy their genes into the future. I don't think that's the same for what are you saying? The instinct is different. I mean, maybe I mean, that's that's something we could debate But the the thing I was saying is like so the evolutionary lens, so Women wanting to choose the best find the best partner that they can to protect them and their child, right? You're saying that my point is that evolutionary lens that women have that evolutionary algorithm that evolutionary You know the hypergamy algorithm with that thing because it is there's an evolutionary mismatch where women still have the same desire for a higher Mate, it's just because of the internet their exposure to higher status mates is now infinite paradox And it and it and it disassociates them from reality. They start to believe it I just I see this so often where they start to look they see these men and then they look at their partner as wanting That happens so much more frequently now. The difference is do men do the same thing? They do the same thing with porn They do the same thing with only fans. The difference is they don't leave their partner. That's the difference I just thought they cheat exactly not to the same extent not women leaving a relationship is far exceeds men cheating It's not even it's not even it's by a factor of 10. It's not even close Someone says anything about cheating. They're like instead of just cheating just leave So if women are doing that and they're leaving rather than cheating or doing something else Isn't that the more respectful way rather than staying in I don't disagree I'm staying in the relationship that doesn't suit them with someone correct, but he just but he just talked about it It wasn't the number one reason why people were breaking up Cheating cheating with infidelity Was down list that was the first thing. The second thing is most men don't cheat They just don't but the problem is you guys don't see you guys do not know the guy can't most men Married men can because they're picked Sort of I mean if they lose if they lose their physical attractiveness, no, maybe they can't cheat either But we're just poor you can still be poor and married. You can still be unattractive and married You can still be heavily autistic and married. I don't think that necessarily makes it makes a difference That's the thing like the things that make men unattractive still account for a drug. It's in pre-selection the number one thing It's a big thing Fame is probably a bigger thing than preselection If you know how to use money then money could be a bigger thing than preselection I would say preselection trumps other than the status or whatever. Yeah, I think status would be number one Yeah, and then I was his preselection. So a woman guy that's married. That's preselection, right? There's so many women that wanna Okay, what I'm saying is while I do understand what you're saying I think he still needs to be somewhat attractive to just any guy who's married like if we go to Jack-in-the-box later and you See the assistant manager and he's got a ring on and he's like morbidly obese. You're knocking him. Well, you know what? He's giving that dick to someone. Let me go ahead and jump in They cheat the most I'm sure they do because they're around other people who want to cheat When women want to care when women want to cheat sex manifests when men want to cheat most of the time There's no one there to cheat with them. That's the point we're making so because they don't actually get to act on it there You know, what can can I say something that bothers me that I just thought about I always forget, you know, you know when That like a lot of guys in the space will be like if you if the girl finds out you cheat She says do you love her? I? Disagree, I think women ask did you fuck her first? You know what I'm just in the survey they did they found that women are more often There was a survey on every I didn't know there's no no I just heard guys say like the first question that a woman asks the guy when he cheats is do you love her and the first And the first question like he asked her if he fucked her. Yeah. No women are asking. Did you fuck her period? I don't think they're asking love comes. I don't know I've been cheated on and that's what I asked first Because no Thing because if I find out like if a man is cheating on me and he's having sex with another woman I feel like the relationship could be fixed. There's obviously a problem But if he's cheating emotionally and he's in love with another woman, I can't be paid. How did you know? Like how do you know how far he went like that's what I'm saying It's like the first question that somebody asks is did you have sex? It's not did you love her right away? I mean Obviously the sex is going on There's a reason why we split hairs with like infidelity for guys Are you having an emotional affair with like no sex has occurred? But it's still feel that you still have the jealousy trigger in that happens as a result of that possessiveness Because for women it is a capital loss because women of course have a higher reproductive investment when it comes to the relationship So that's usually did you fuck? Okay. Well, we discerned, you know Have you fucked or are you just like talking to her on on Facebook or whatever? It is, right? Are you having an emotional affair or are you having like a physical affair with this person? there's a qualifiable difference between those two because usually the guys who can actually do that they're higher up on the you know, so higher value men not high value at higher value guys They could but see here's the thing is that that the reason why that's a thing in the first place is because women when it comes to relationships it is a Getting out of that relationship and putting themselves back into the sexual marketplace is a whole lot Bigger a deal for women than it is for guys. So then women leaving marriages Well, it's because and again, that's why when women do leave marriages It's usually between the average the average Duration of a marriage before it gets to divorce is anywhere between five and nine years usually seven That's why they call it the seven year age, right? So huge and the root there's a reason for that because right around that so what's the average age of first marriage for women today? 30 right now. So if that woman is 37 She's not this side of 40 and she's still hot enough where she can hire a personal trainer Get out of that marriage and find a guy who is the best she could do as a result of that And so what happens is there the capital loss like if you like for instance, like what's wrong with that? I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that. I'm just saying here's the mechanics of that So the mechanics are this is that for when women are get jealous over infidelity It's usually because it's at a loss of capital for them because the older you get the less marketable you are in the sexual market Like he trades you in for no way man. My blowjobs are unmatched. Oh, so we can't But that's why you get that that's why you get archetypes like the trophy wife Yeah, right or that's why women are scared shitless that they that they don't like they don't want to submit to a husband Always be like if you don't settle down you're gonna die alone, but I'm seeing women divorce these men I feel like they're dying alone at like if they stay with the guy like that. You're saying yeah It's a bad relationship for sure. The thing is there's a there's another thing. It was in a bad relationship It's a bad investment of your sexual capital in that guy because it could be better spent on another dude I don't know why you keep saying no one's attributing fault. We're talking about evolution evolution of desire in evolution of desire in the book in the book the evolution of desire one of the We all understand what's being said they don't witness it they don't see it they don't live it So when we get blamed that we get told you guys are hoes you should have picked better You got two baby daddies. Now. We have to take care of your kids from previous relationship Why are we not like we're at the fact that he's a piece of shit, too, right? And they don't they don't live that life. They don't see it. They hear statistics. They read off stuff off the internet Oh, this study said they don't understand why should women care about men's feelings like honestly if they can't even say don't they don't That's the point. Well back to the beginning of the show. They don't care at all, right? But they're saying that women are evil Okay, you you one more time. You have to stop saying like Rolo and I have never said that You're saying that you see women going out and dating these guys or whatever. You're saying that in your experience Why is it bad when I say what do you mean bad? Well, what do you mean? What did I say when I when I'm saying that I see this you're telling me no you said like you don't believe me Which thing which thing are we talking about be specific? Specifically yeah, which thing am I saying? It isn't real don't gaslight me. I'm not Apologize I just don't remember what you're saying what I say never do So just so we're just so we're clear just we're clear. I think women are more interesting than men I think I enjoy hanging around women more than men. I'm not blaming women for anything What I'm trying to do is describe the rules of the game and describe the dimensions of the football field That's all I'm doing. I'm trying to describe the rules and the rules are That's what I'm saying, she said why should we care Objectively right she didn't say we don't care about men's feelings She said why should we care because you guys said you don't care about ours, right? We don't care what your feelings we have to care about your feelings of course you have to You guys have to pretend to care about our feelings so you can get the sex and the things that you want You don't literally care about our feelings because if you did care about our feelings the self-help and the healing and all the stuff that You do that bothers us that we come to you and tell you bother us you would actually change them You wouldn't keep doing which went self-help. What are you talking about? Like I feel like I'm like talking in a circle like you just you I need it specifically I don't understand what you're talking let's say for example I come to a man and I tell him and this is not something that happened to me But I'm just saying if I tell a man you're liking Instagram pictures and looking at only fan models I'm doing all that that bothers me sure this man wants to be stubborn and say well And instead of changing it he'd rather keep doing what he's doing or he'll just delete the whole Instagram since I can't I can't do anything He doesn't actually care about her feelings. Yeah, he's not actually trying to be like, you know, let me go to therapy Let me find out why I am so obsessed with looking at naked girls or looking for a specific kind of Without going to therapy. No, no, no, but I'm saying yeah men would rather Pretend like they're okay. I won't do it again so they can keep getting what they want from this woman and then not actually care about how it's affecting her a Woman will ask a man how he feels about something and she'll take that into consideration Most of the time most not every woman. I don't find that to be most of the time, but okay In your situation. Absolutely. I think I think Jesse Preston does that 100% but see we're doing that thing again That's one of my biggest pet peeves. It's like women will tell you something and you don't believe us No, it's not that we don't believe if I can find statistics that show something different. What if I said that like me? What if I said you're delusional for thinking that men on these apps are actually 80% unattractive like fuck your stats You know what? I'm saying? It's like the same I don't why would I care but I wouldn't care that you said it was delusional It would either be a fact or not. We know you don't care Yeah, I care is what I'm trying to say. Like we're trying to tell you every time we say something you like No, that's not the case or no, that's I don't believe Do you think that trust should be given or should it be earned? but Guys expect us to just give it to them right away. They need Yeah, I'm confused I'm trying to describe I'm trying to describe an objective reality and you guys are describing an anecdotal reality. That's the only difference No, I'm sure the statement that you made the only thing that I'm touching upon I don't know if it's exactly what she's trying to say The only thing I'm trying to say is that the men on social media and in the red meet whatever All that they keep saying women don't care about it feels and they keep repeating that narrative and that's not the case men Majority of the time do not care about a woman's feelings. They do not take it into consideration Enough to huh? I feel like a lot of men get annoyed Yeah, they don't care enough and if they do pretend to be caring of her feelings in the moment It's only because they want sex or something out of her men don't predominantly care about how women feel about things Okay, what you're saying is that women don't care about man. Here we go. Let me cook here. Okay? It's not that they don't care about your feelings. It's that of the money. No, that's okay. Thank you Thank you for making that is because I know Because it's not about the nail. Okay. Okay. No, it's not about the nail now. Here's it. Here's it Here's a point. So there is a I should I would dig it up, but we'll probably get a copyright strike for it There's a video. It's a skit. It's a comical skit It's it's a man and a woman sitting on a couch together and the woman is talking and you don't see it right away but just because of the way that they this the cameras angled but you see this woman and she's talking about this this Horrible pain that she has in her head and she's talking about I just I don't know. I can't get any sleep It's just this horrible pain in my head and the guys looking at her and it finally pans over to her and she's got this Nail like a big old construction nail stuck in her head. And so the first thing the guy says, well, you know We could probably fix that if we just pull the nail out of your head And the first thing she does is scream at the top of her lungs It's not about the nail and so what she does then is go back into saying Oh, but I have this horrible headache I get these migraines yada yada and the guy's like Okay and he's trying to listen and trying to be you know attentive and listen to the problems and do the Therapy and do the work and be emotional and listen to what she has to say and listen to those problems The problem is is that when that guy? Converses with that woman he's trying to solve her problems Pull the nail out of the head if we pull the nail out of the head, then you're fine You don't have the pain anymore, right? But the problem is that women would rather vent and talk about the nail in their head Instead of actually solving the fucking problem because once you solve the problem, there's nothing left to talk about anymore There's no more venting. There's no more emotional stuff. There's no more conversation There's no more Bad listener or he's a good listener because the problem has been gone has been taken and solved and everything because men are innate deductive problem solvers and when they're having a Conversation with when we're talking together and we do this all the time You guys just said this you guys talk about your stats and your information your data and your statistics and da da da da That's because when men talk with men we prioritize information Because we're trying to figure out how can we solve a problem? How can we how can we be better? How can we be bigger? How can we meet our burden of performance? And here's some information exchange when women talk to other women you guys are frustrated with men because we don't listen or they don't they? Don't have this Connection this emotional connection with them and they need to go to therapy to learn to be more emotional The problem is is once they do that, you've just turned that guy into your girlfriend And so now you're having that conversation one extreme to another. No, it's not Part of the process for some people in order to be able to Communicate the same If you know that the woman is keeping the nail in her head because she's using it as her as her tool to Communicate and talk to and have something to say to her husband Then what does that say about the fact that the man knows that about her? He knows he she doesn't want her problem solved. She wants to vent. She wants to talk So know what let's solve this particular problem But you as a man as a husband as a boyfriend or whatever be consistent in your opening communication Sometimes you just need someone to listen, you know, bring intimacy and bring up conversation and bonding with the woman So she doesn't have to use the nail in the head. Is that what you're saying? But no, what did you hear I just said you I feel like you can take the nail I shouldn't you now wouldn't exist roll the nail wouldn't exist The nail would not exist if the woman was looking for a problem solving only from you She would go to you and you take it out But if she's not looking for the problem to be solving she's looking to vent what she's saying to you is that she needs more Intimate conversation and stuff from you in a pot in a bonding way So now if as a husband or man, you were consistent with her like hey, babe, how are you feeling lately? What's going on with you or you talked about? Other things and it didn't take her having a nail in her forehead to get conversation out of you Then you wouldn't have women that feel like they have to use the nail for a way to talk But you see the nail is just a metaphor. I get it Okay, but in this case is let's have something to talk about Place, but I'm saying so man was consistent with communicating and bonding and initiating intimacy outside of sex But you do understand you do understand though that when guys are communicating with women and they're speaking Male language versus female like they're talking in terms of context information Data problem-solving as opposed to here's how I feel women enjoy the act of communicating as it is together It doesn't for guys who want to solve a problem who want to be more deductive That's why there is a disc. That's why there's a disconnect between men That's when we talk past each other all the time So you're saying well men need to come over to my way of thinking and they need to be they need to be better Communicator you just Emotional they need to be they need to be more no You've got three women telling you that's not what I said. What the fuck are you saying? I'm trying to pull the nail out of both of your fucking head Let me have two minutes of speaking without anybody else chiming in okay, that's not possible there is There is a difference a woman in this in this context She's using the nail and she's leaving it in her head because she is desperate for connection with her spouse She's looking for a way to talk to him and initiate intimacy outside of sex She wouldn't have to have the nail on her forehead and use that as a way to talk to him all the time if he on his end Initiated more intimacy outside of sex This is the problem When a woman gets unattractive in a marriage guys will usually be like my fucking I don't know what they would say But they would be like she got fat. I don't know what to do Without seeing that maybe she was taking on a lot more of the relationship issues Causing her to not care about what she looks like. That's more of a realistic scenario Yeah, so he's trying to make this like metaphor like a Sesame Street metaphor and you guys have come to like this I'm not saying you're what your metaphors are incorrect. It's just there I just gave you like a level of complexity that really was a part of the conversation, but I understand what you're saying No, it's directly correlated. The nail is in her head and she's keeping it in this in this metaphor The nail is not in her head because of anything he did and she's not using the nail to communicate with her husband She has a problem that needs to get solved and she's doing anything and everything she can except solving the problem. That's the Guys Men do are solving the problem you live in a world with antibiotics and transistors the world's do men do solve the problems But that's no I'm talking about women and men. They're obviously not communicating. They're not doing well in relationships Tori, why? Why do women think Why do women think they are entitled to sympathy and special treatment just because they're emotional are men entitled to sex just because we're horny Wait, why why do women think that's because I'm not entitled I'm telling you guys why women don't want to be with you. What I'm saying is What I'm saying is is that if women are emotional they think that it is our job They want often want sympathy rather than we just want to connect with you Sex sex is a way for men to connect with women. Is it not? Yeah, but in order That's not the only thing it's usually the first thing but it's not the only thing the only thing if it was the only thing Then why would men be in relationships? Then most relationships will be friends with benefits they wouldn't But why are most relationships not friends with benefits because women get what they want men no because men No, because I can't handle it. Most people can't Chase on social media is not we can't find a wife. We can't find a good partner the narrative That is all that men are complaining about that's all that they got the first thing that they want That's the problem. That's the first thing that that they it's the first hurdle. They're trying to get over It's not the only thing it is the first thing You're such a good friend I feel like I can tell you anything that that guy's not gonna get laid John John is describing my entire 20s. John is describing my time. I was an incredible listener. That's always what I got I got it, Jesse. Okay. Why is only fans so popular right now? Why is why are so many guys log? I don't think you're not only fans anymore. I am I just don't They know naked period no, yeah, it's accessible. No, here's here's Okay, they can stay anonymous and it's I think I think what you're saying is why is it more popular than porn? Why is it more popular than pornography because because if getting off and getting Getting sex, even if it's virtual, then why would OnlyFans be a thing if they can just simply jerk off for free? You're saying because they get to connect with a woman that they find attractive? So it's not just about the, let's see if I can get my... No, no. Hold on, hold on. When we have Brandi Andrews in here and we ask her, like, what is the number one selling thing you do? Is it the hardcore sex or is it the girlfriend experience? It's the girlfriend experience. Of course. When I ask my guys long term, it's like, do you want to just sleep with a bunch of women or do you want a long term relationship in the end? All my guys eventually say, I want a long term relationship in the end. Eventually. Eventually, yeah, for sure. Eventually. Yeah, but that's not what you said. We have to wait. That's not what you said, though. You said that men don't care about anything other than sex. That's what you said. That's what you said. All they care about. And then they want us to sleep with you and then we sleep with you and then we're whores. And then we're whores for sleeping with you. But then we don't do that and we're prudes. No one here is calling you a prude. And then we have to wait. No one here calls you a prude or a whore. And then we have to wait for you to get done fucking everybody. But then we're old now because we waited on you. Do you see how there's no win-win here? So what the fuck are we sitting at this table talking about? Who cares? Let's get out and get fucking. Who cares? Why are we even sitting at this table talking, guys? Get that body count up, guys. Why are we even talking about it? Is there anything better for us to talk about? Sushi. Sushi would be great to talk about because I'm craving it. How about how to keep a woman? How about how to keep a man? Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. This is what bothers me. I want to know who's going with me to sushi after this. That's all I'm going to say. Jordan, you can respond to this. I can go now. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I can't get a word in. Here we go. Let's go eat sushi. Here we go. Sorry to leave the bus. $10. Tori, you're wrong. You want to make it a blame Olympics. Your story, if refute by stats, you're wrong. You can accept your point. We can accept your points. But please, it doesn't make it right. Men and women are different. Easy. Correct. Fine. But why is it that this whole space blames women for their choices? Exactly. And then I come here and say. I'm not blaming women for their choices. Hold on. Can I just point out something? I'm not talking about you guys. But this show literally exists because of what you just said. Of what? The two of us literally decided to have a show where we don't blame you. We were not. And what happens is halfway through the show, always one of you guys comes up with some anecdotal thing where this guy on the internet said this. And me and Rollo are sitting here taking fucking strays all the time. And I get it. Because some of the Red Pill guys, they take things a little too far. But my point is, the whole goddamn point of this show was because I knew you guys. And I wanted to give you a voice and try to understand the situation that you were coming in. But at the same time, objective reality stepped in. And there are some realities in there that I wanted to express. And sometimes when these realities don't agree with what you're saying, it's like, I don't know where you got your statistics. You just said that we don't have an objective reality. What I said is objective reality steps in. I didn't say you don't see objective reality. No, but you're saying that as a hit to me. You're saying that I must be delusional. No, I think you're thinking too much into what I'm saying. Going back to the nail thing, I'm not saying you're delusional. I mean, they're crazy. You're doing it again. You're throwing strays at me. I did not say you were crazy. At no point did I say you're crazy. At no point did I say anyone at this table is delusional. I am just catching strays like crazy. This is the point I'm making. You guys are just making these anecdotal shots at us. Okay, I'll just shut up then. No, no, no. No, I'm not going to keep saying stuff and then be told that. Okay, so let me explain a couple things here. This is one of my biggest pet peeves of the whole thing is we'll have people who will say, I hear Jamie Lynn, for example, one of the reasons I even brought her up in the first place here is because we're catching strays. We're constantly associated. The red pill says this. Who the fuck are you talking about? My name is not Pearl Davis. I don't know. That's what I want to. If you're going to say all these guys or you're going to do a reaction clips or whatever, that's fine. Let me know who the fuck you're talking about. And I'll tell you if they have. Who are you talking about? When you're talking about all these girls are doing this. All these girls. All these women are delusional. Which women are delusional? Which women are delusional? And am I saying this? All women are delusional because they want the top 1% of men. Which women are delusional because they want the top 1% of men? Because right now y'all are saying all, which is now why we're attacking back and saying y'all. Do you get it? Do you get it now? Are we starting to come to a mutual agreement? Do you want that mail out or do you want the actual answer? Because I'm helping her because she's just getting shut down in a thing we don't understand. The actual answer is not all women are delusional. Specifically what I meant. Women's preferences are not delusional. They're an evolutionary adaptation. That is not anyone's fault. What I said was we are getting into a situation where because women have an exposure to a disproportionately, like five orders of magnitude more men than they did in their ancestral past. Because of that it is creating a dilemma of choice which is causing women to believe that they can get a certain type of man to settle and a different type of man is actually willing to settle. And the difference between the two is a delta which is a delusion. I think men are delusional. Got it. So that's your argument. Men are delusional. We sounded delusional. You're right, but they are delusional as well. By the way, what I said was completely accurate, but men are delusional. That's true. It is accurate. No, you can't support that. It is accurate. And then right after that, men are delusional in the sense that they watch porn every day and think that now they can only get on by this type of girl. Agreed. I totally agree. Kylie, stop, stop, stop. Both of them are correct. Kylie, you asked me 30 seconds ago which women we thought were delusional, so I gave you a specific answer. If you want a macro answer for all of it, yes, of course, men are delusional too. We've said it several times. I wouldn't have a program. I wouldn't have MOA if men weren't delusional, and I wouldn't be good at my job if all I do was fight against male delusion. That's why I'm here. That was it. That was it. So now that that's cleared up, we're good. No, I have to honor my agreement with you, okay? So whenever we say, oh, women are delusional, and he was just saying it's this paradox of choice, there's also another side to this as well. Guys are delusional in the sense that they say, oh, I want a virgin bride. Oh, I want this. Oh, I want this. Oh, you know, no diamond, no hymen, no whatever the fuck, you know. Passport, brother. Oh, God. And delusional for the same reason, because it gives them an eye. Where women have this paradox of choice, men have this paradox of scarcity, because they think that they can't, I can't get with that chick. I've got to go break my legs and add an extra inch of height to me so that a girl will actually pay attention to me. That exists because of the internet for the same reason that it exists where women are like spoiled for choice right now. So yes, are men delusional as well? They sure as fuck can be, because we just talked about it a minute ago, how we're trying to help guys level up. Thank you. But that shit doesn't play. Thank you. That shit doesn't play, because all they want to do is talk about how women are going to get their comeuppance. How are we going to hold these bitches accountable? Right. And that is also the same reason. Sadistic, okay? The same reason. The fact that men want to see women be berated on these podcasts, and they want to see, oh these three or fours, tell her off. The fact that men want that and that's what goes viral and that's the only thing that plays should speak on what women are saying. They're more emotional. Okay, so here's the issue. They're more emotional. Not only are you correct about that, but it's that they want that more than they want to improve. That is our point. Yeah, but that's why I have an eight-figure company, was basically on the point I just said. I know. That is our point. So everyone keeps saying women this, women that, women this, and women keep saying no, but this is how we feel, and you just put it right on the head. They would rather attack women and say that women are at fault than actually improve themselves. And we've always been on the same point. The two of us. And that's the only reason. Michael, I have been asked a million times. You know what I say? One blowjob cures everything. Blowjob! I've been asked a million times why I come on here and why I don't do any other podcasts, and I say the exact same thing every time. You two are the only two people in this realm that I have seen that are respectful to the women for the most part, and do not come on here to make us look dumb or feel stupid. You are respectful. Even if you and I agree to disagree on something, I don't leave here feeling like you disrespected me. You and I have a friendship outside of this, and I feel like you respect that. The other podcasts, that's not their narrative. And they literally bring girls on there, and they bring the dumb young ones. And I'm not saying that to be offensive, but they literally bring the dumb young ones so they can say something that's... And then try to get one up on them. Can we make that a Tic Tac clip? Can we make that a Tic Tac clip? Don DeMarco. That's hilarious. It's their life goal, and it makes them so happy to see someone tear down a pretty girl. Like, oh, she has an O.F. She's a... And they don't care about anything else. They don't care about what she has to say. They don't care if she's intelligent. They want to ask her dumb questions to make herself look young. I agree with you on the first part, but not the second part, because I know how they recruit girls, and they're not specifically looking for dumb girls or young girls. It doesn't matter who they have on the show. I've seen several master's degrees, several girls that come on there. Now, here's the difference. With whatever podcast, women are flying out there that have OnlyFans specifically to get attention. That's different. For Fresh Afit, it's not quite that way. They won't let them wear their shirts for OnlyFans. They won't let them do it anymore? No, they never did. He didn't do a show or something. Brian's like, the price is right. Everybody's in a fucking costume. Who listens to this tweet? He's the biggest-looking nerd, and he acts like he's some hot shit that can get your attention. You're talking about Whatever podcast? The Whatever dude. I don't know his name. Whatever his name is. Let the girls wear the shirt with their at sign, you know? That's funny. No, I mean, Myron wouldn't do that either. I mean, they wouldn't let them... Yes, Myron would. Myron would let them wear their at sign? Do you think he would? Yeah, like at Torsha? Probably would. Yeah, he would. Myron would. I've never... I've just never seen it. Why wouldn't he? Well, let me... We're coming up on time, but Jesse Preston, let me say, shalom aleichem. We're also the best-looking dudes in the Red Hills. Not me. Not me. Rolo. Alex Dasek, let me know I'm not as good-looking. I'm aware of that now. But anyways, I also want to point this out, because I've been catching a lot of strays lately. Especially from like the more moralistic sort of like trad con, traditional conservatives right now, who want to like throw rocks at me by saying, Oh, you guys get these whores on your show, and you just... They're just showing their tits and their... Because we... I don't think maybe you realize the fact that we also have... There's a sort of a demographic of people who throw shit our way, because we have... Because Kylie's on here, because you're on here, because we have, you know, because of this right here. And so there's... We're also... Not only are we taking it from the side of guys who are like saying, Well, why don't you... Why aren't you harder on these girls? Why don't you like be more accountable? And then we've got the trad con side saying, Well, I can't believe you have these whores on there. How come you don't have Bible study or some shit going on? And you're, you know, around your table kind of thing. You're not going to make everybody happy. Yeah, it's never going to happen. It's never going to be. And you guys are a different kind of podcast, so it shouldn't... Exactly. It shouldn't be about that anyway. And then the other part of this is, I think that people really... Like when they see us talking about like stats and figures and evolutionary psychology and David Buss and, you know, whatever. We've got our books and shit. When we're talking about this, I think people will take that and they will presume that we align with whatever the fuck it is that they think is their prescription for life. Like we're part of their team. We're part of their tribe. Because, well, they held these girls accountable, so they must be on board with these... The berating of women. Berating of women, right? Or because they're on here, they must have some... Like Rollo's married. He's got kids. Oh, he must be on our team as well, right? I don't give two flying fucks whether you have fake tits. I don't care. I don't go to WEPA public bikini contests. I don't fucking care. Because nobody like asks me like, well, what's your opinion on stuff? I don't give opinions. I don't give prescriptions. I don't give you here's how you ought to live your life. I give you fucking empirical data and let you sort the shit out for yourself. But because I do that and because of the nature of the information that we deliver to people, they presume that we must be on board with voting for Trump or for whatever their fucking pet ideology happens to be. I will tell you right now, I love every single person that comes on here. I've never had a problem with a single person that's been on this show. I like the people that I work with. I like the people I love fresh and fit. I like Brian. I like all these guys pretty well. It doesn't mean I'm going to go into business with some of them, but it all doesn't mean that I necessarily have a problem with them just because of the data that I am delivering. So I'll let me state for the record right now. I don't care if you got bigger tits. Yeah, go right ahead. You got Brazilian butt lift, whatever. But whatever makes you feel good. Cosplay, fuck, rock on, right? But people never want to really dig any deeper than what they see in a 45 second fucking TikTok clip. They don't want to dig any deeper than a reel or a YouTube short because they just don't have the fucking attention span for that anymore. The emotional intelligence. And I'll just leave with this. You can't tell people any kind of information, any kind of data, any kind of empirical statistics without telling them how to feel about it. Because if you don't, they will fucking hate you for it. And they will insert their feelings and what they think you mean just by you giving them that information in the first place. Because if you're giving it to them, you must be giving it to them for a reason. You preach this. You teach this. Your ideology is this. The Red Pill movement is this. It's none of those fucking things. And I will be the first one to tell you that. If you want to come to me and say, Rolo, what do you think about living your life this way or that way? I'll be happy to tell you that. Not on this show. But I will tell you that privately on a one-on-one or whatever you want. If people want to know, oh, well, Rolo, how come you're not going to Bible study or how come you're not going to, I don't know, synagogue or whatever the fuck it is your weapon happens to be your thing. I'll be happy to tell you that too. But the thing is, I think people want to insert their own emotions and what they think you mean just by having that conversation with you or having you give them that data and that information. So they presume you must be a misogynist. You must be an asshole. You must be a freaking liberal or a conservative or insert whatever your pet anti-outgroup tribe happens to be. But you will never find that out unless you ask me, unless you actually have these conversations and that's why these shows are important. Yeah. So this show is meant for something different. And just so you know, I'm very nonjudgmental to the point where I get criticized by my own audience for not being. I've never judged a single girl for doing only fans. I've never, I don't give a fuck. Do whatever you want. Now, if you want to go sleep with 500 dudes, that's fine. I definitely want you on my podcast, but I'm not going to marry you. I can still be discerning, even though I'm not judgmental. Does that make sense? I can still make decisions, even though I'm not judgmental. And that's the way, that's what I generally ask men to do is not be judgmental. Now the problem is because this arena is so filled with what you're talking about before about, you know, you know, bashing women or whatever. And I talk to my media team all the time, I'm like, we cannot come off as bashing women. We have to stop that. But when you do that, when you have that situation happen, when you bring up these topics, a lot of times they bring up uncomfortable ideas, and then it comes off like you're bashing women. And that's not the point. The point is, men are delusional, women are delusional too. By the way, you know, maybe I'll use a different word, because I know Mac and Murphy and Date Psych have a problem with this. Maybe I'll just use, there's a delta between reality and what they believe reality is. Maybe that's a better way of saying it. Maybe that's what it is. But if you read the definition of delusion, that's what delusion means. But that's the reason why we say that. Anyway, the thing is, this is nothing personal. We always want you guys to come on. And yeah, we made this show for a different reason. We made the show because we wanted to try something. We said, what if we just took out the women bashing and just included the science and see what happens. And the problem, and the thing is, again, where I disagree with you guys, I don't think Fresh and Fit is specifically looking for dumb or young girls. They have a lot of professionals that come on that show. That's not the issue. Oh, no, I'm not saying every single one of their episodes is like that, but a majority of it is that. And a majority of the content that goes viral is that. That's what audiences enjoy. My point is, though, there have been girls who are like faithful mothers who have master's degrees who have also said delusional stuff on that show. It's not necessarily because they're young and dumb. Delusional to who? To you? There's been some highly intelligent redheads that have been on that show at least twice. I would say it's more about how they set up their questions out of anything else. I know. I experienced it. That's what I'm saying. There's no bias for dumb women to come on that show. And I'm not saying I'm not saying that, like, literally, I'm saying that they have the intent to make the girls look like that. That's a possibility. Yeah. But the intent and the clips that they push are not the clip of a girl saying something smart. You say tomato. I say tomato. A lot of times the girls are saying that they really shouldn't say. Hold on. Here's my main issue. The fact that women go on there and then make these, like, arguments knowing you're going on a show with four million subs or like a million and a half subs and you did no research and you just took that big fucking L. At some point, women do have to take responsibility. Why do you think I always ask you what's the topic before I get here because I'm not going to be put in that situation. Of course. I agree. I totally agree with you. But just I want you to consider this. If you guys, if I was going to go on Joe Rogan and I was going to talk about he wanted Joe Rogan wanted me to talk about certain some issue, I would go back and reread and I would need to know that I am fundamentally sound. Bro, this is an incredible opportunity for me. Patrick Bed David wants me on a show or Tom Bilyeu wants me on a show or Lex Freeman. You know, I will be studying my fucking ass off, but a lot of girls will come on shows where this is the most exposure they've ever gotten for anything in their life and they do zero fucking studying and they take this fucking L, but I'm here to protect you, Lindsay. I'm here to protect you, Lindsay. I would agree with you about a person coming on there with no knowledge about what they're talking about. If it weren't for the fact that they purposely try to make people look dumb. Name me 10 countries like trying to reach three, whatever it is. They're always trying to make the narrative that these girls are dumb. It's not about the fact that they didn't have enough research on the topic that they were going to discuss on that podcast. They'll do anything to be like, oh yeah, well, your point is invalid because you have an only because you can't name three countries here, here, here. People don't watch NASCAR to see who wins the fucking race. They watch NASCAR to see who crashes and burns. That's why they watch NASCAR. Okay. Wait, what? It's to see people lose and get hurt. It's to, it's people. People don't watch. People don't watch boxing to see the parody. They watch boxing to see someone get knocked out. Do you know, do you know, do you know who Lee Atwater is? Right? No. Okay. Lee Atwater was Ronald Reagan's campaign manager. Okay. Guy was, he was on top of this game. And one of the things he said is that professional wrestling is one of the most honest sports. Yeah. It's funny in a minute. It is funny. Yeah. Because all you're doing is you're getting, I mean, everybody knows it's fake, but we don't know it's fake, but people know it's fake so that they play along with it. And what are you getting? You're getting the hero. You're getting the villain. And you just want to see a good guy. You just want to see a good guy beat the bad guy. That's all we're talking about right now. We're talking about a near give people a believable emotional narrative so that they can feel good at the end of the movie and go home and fuck their wives and eat Cheetos. I'm a fight back is all I'm going to say. Thank you for letting me. I'll let you both. No, that's terrible. Men don't want a woman that's going to speak back. Submissive. Obedient. All right. So real quick. Are you still with the guy in Chicago? The redheaded firefighter or something you are dating a guy? What happened? What happened? What happened? Like a year ago, actually. So you're saying that all these people who watch your shows and our shows, you're, you're open for business. They can go sit there. They can shoot their shots. Slide in the DMs. I'm liking the natural red hair. No, I'm just, we're asking, we're asking the question. Can they or can they not? The people want to know? No. Okay. No. Uh, you're saying you came out here to see, see your boyfriend, right? From Canada. So you're, you're off the, unless there's something else going on here, nobody should shoot their shot. Open relationships. Stay out of the DMs. Oh, stay out. Wait. Oh, it's an open relationship, but stay out of the DMs. Okay. Good. Okay. Decide if you're worthy. We probably should have asked you that a long time ago. John, what's your question? I'm sorry, John. Uh, what is your relationship status? I'm single. I'm single and just open to whatever. Okay. Open to whatever. All right. Nice. And then Lindsey, if you could move like 10 feet to your left so we could actually see you again. I'm watching the show. Keep coming. Keep coming this way, Lindsey. Hey, Lindsey, have you met my single friend, John, right here? He's got a huge podcast. Lindsey's status is whatever. What's your status? Um, I've been single for over seven years. By choice? Like you don't, you don't want to be in a relationship? It's not that. Just what? I haven't found anything that I've wanted or want to invest my time in. I believe in equal energy exchange. So if I don't have that, then I'm not interested. Not settling. Good. Good for you then. And you are happily married? You just skipped her. No, I'm getting to you. Oh, yeah, I'm happily married, but I'm open to a beautiful woman. Okay. Who also thinks that me and my husband are beautiful. Okay. All right. So, what's your status? I'm single. I'm single. I'm single. I'm single and I'm open to whatever. All right. So, what's your status? I'm single. I'm single and I'm open to whatever. All right. So, what's your status? I'm single. Yes. Exciting. Why? Are you interested? No. I'll show you pictures. No? No. I could never be. All right. All right. And in your situation, what is your situation like? I have prospects. Prospects? But I am a single woman. Okay. I do not have a boyfriend. Got it. Got it. What? You look confused. Wait. Single woman, but you don't have a boyfriend. No, that's not. That makes sense. No, she has prospects. She has prospects. Exactly. She considers boyfriends, and some of them she just considers. They got potential. Do any of them think that they're your boyfriend? No. Oh, you're not playing the game right, honey. You forgot the part about the manipulation. The city of conflict. Look, I'm the simp. Oh, yeah? People think I might be your girlfriend. Oh, no. Okay. Awesome. Awesome. Anything else you want to go over? Yeah, my status is. I mean, sometimes you don't get no hoes, man. Yeah, that's your status. That's my status. She wants a simp. Yes. All right. We had a bunch more things, but they were pretty long. A bunch more clips to react to, but this went by really well. We got more for next time. And by the way, we're doing it next week. Next week. So, we'll go over some more of these. We have some like super. You know what I was going to get for next week is these super, super white night, like horribly simpy TikToks that go incredibly viral, and just pick them apart. That's what I was going to do. That sounds good. It seems like it's going to be a lot of fun. It seems to be popular, actually. That's a good conversation starter. We'll say that. It is. It is really great. It's a good format. Awesome, man. Guys, does anybody else want to shout out your OnlyFans? Anybody? Anybody have a deal for like my nightclub? Elektra Barbie. Elektra Barbie. That's it? Elektra Barbie. There we go. But I'd rather you jump on my panther so I can talk to you and give you exactly what you want. Okay. Oh, sex panther. Yeah. Got you. Rare. Yoko Ono. Did you have anything you wanted to promote? Yoko Ono. Just to imagine you know what that is. I have those glasses. Awesome. Awesome. Torsha, what about you? Are you still doing? You're still doing the live streams?

Just It's Complicated channel on YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, Rumble. I'm on all the platforms. If you want to collab on anything, I'll go out there with you and we'll do some crazy shit. That'd be fun, man. I enjoyed this. We should all go do that. Let's do it tomorrow. Do you ever do it with your phone? Or is it always with a camera? No. I always use a camera. I always edit stuff. So I'm open to trying. What I'm asking is because there's some places I can get you into, but you can't use a camera. You have to use your phone. That's the only thing. Let's do it. Yeah. Maybe do some It's Complicated, but at Wet Republic. That'd be fucking incredible. Yeah. Yeah. That'd be amazing. We can get you places. Awesome. Lindsay, you wanted to promote your Ms. Monrare? Sex Panther. Sex Panther. Sex Panther. I have nothing to promote. Nothing to promote? Wow. Okay. Jessie, what do we want to promote here? Anything? I do all my content creation on TikTok and Instagram. You can see all of it. Nice. Very nice. And Kylie is a new star on TikTok. Kylie. Have you seen her TikToks? No. They're amazing. She told me the other day she has some TikToks. They're really good. And I was like, she doesn't want to post them on Instagram because she thinks they're not good enough. Look at them. They're all good enough. Your new shots. Your new photos are like really good. They are. Yeah. Yeah. They definitely are really good. I was looking at them the other day. Exceptionally. Yeah. Yep. This is my life. Everyone's obsessed with my girlfriend. That's what it's like all the time. Every day. She's like, I don't know what I said. Everyone wants to go out with you. Everyone's literally all the time. I texted her to go to the movies the other day and she goes, who else is coming? I'm like, just you and me. But I mean, who else do you need there? Because I just want to spend time with you. I'm not looking to spend time with Michael. Yes. Exactly. That's what she said. I was like, I only have like three friends. I told Kylie she's Wilt Chamberlain the year that he led the league in assists and scored 55 points a night. That's fucking mean. It doesn't matter. Me and Michael go play golf. Yeah. I love golf. That's cute. That's adorable. That's cute. I'm also a caddy, you guys. Can you hear me? Oh, a caddy? Topless caddy. I'm in. I'm in. All right, guys. Tomorrow or next week, the 18th. We'll be in on the 18th. Tomorrow night. Yeah. Tomorrow we'll be here. I'm sorry. Tomorrow. Next week. Next Thursday. We'll be back with a different cast of characters. It should be really exciting. And then on the 25th will be the weekend of AVN. So we're going to. That is industry night. Yeah. So we got, we've got, we've got some interesting people. I believe Danny Banks has tentatively said she's coming on Ivy Ferguson and some other people like this. All in porn. But we do have a lot of people flying. Domo's coming too. Yeah. Domo's going to come on. So that should be a lot. Sarah Jessie. And if I can get Sterling Cooper. Sterling. Yeah. Sterling would be awesome. We need a dude. We need some more dudes. I can.
