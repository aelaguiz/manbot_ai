It is a we just we just recently in the 19th century came into this idea of happiness You know the idea of you and me picking who we married that didn't even exist you people read Romeo and Juliet They're like, oh my god. It's a love story. It's not a fucking love story the point of the book is how stupid these kids were to get themselves killed because they were told who to marry And love getting married to who you want to get married to is a folly that was William Shakespeare's Point and we read it today and in the 20th century and we're like, oh, well We misinterpret it to think that it's a love story. It's just it's so crazy So like this whole thing that we experience again, we have a hundred years of choosing who we marry We have 20 years maybe a little less than 20 years of social media 300,000 years of evolution and we're trying to compete and we're just like oh, you know what? I should act this way because I saw something on social media or the reason why men act this way is because social media keeps Putting these female figures and for no No, man We came with a certain amount of programming in us and then we have certain preferences on top of that But anyway, so I just keep going to this right? Yeah, because I listened to your podcast I love them so much and like there were so many times when you were asking questions and I was like I got I got The answer I can tell you what I can give you six books and some people don't want that some people just want to like keep going in this rabbit hole like you said that's when you get in that toxic loop and that's why I tell people all the time like When are you gonna be done talking about this and actually start understanding like why you're experiencing this so you can move forward because I was Like Christina, how did you get better so quickly? How did this how did that cuz I was in a really fucked-up place, right? I really was like, how are you sitting here like this now? and I'm like because I stopped trying to dive down this path of just being a victim and trying to understand why Something happened to me and just understand what I need to do now Yeah And that literally shot up my growth and I'm not trying to put myself on the pedestal that'll shoot up Anybody's growth for sure anybody's and you had gratitude for the situation I wake up thankful every fucking day because I am NOT depressed anymore and I Can't tell you what that's like because I thought there was gonna be I would have days where I didn't think I was ever going To feel better right ever again, and that was inside my relationship and after yeah, but I started practicing a lot of gratitude I started listening to a lot of Joe Dispenza and I started really trying to like figure out how I can rewire my thought processes so that I can Live the best life I possibly can and it changed everything Did you ever have a problem a feeling where like you're kind of in crisis mode for a period of time and then your body? Just kind of gives up. Yes, and you're almost a year Jamie Lynn. It was like fight-or-flight mode Jamie Jamie Lynn who was on here a couple weeks ago I was at a party with her and she was telling me this she's like your body can only be in Crisis mode for so long and then it just stops being in crisis mode Like you just you're you're I guess I is it the renal glands that produce cortisol the core to the stress hormone You can only produce so much and then your body physically can't produce any more stress hormone And then that's when you kind of that's when you hit rock bottom and you open up the power now It's kind of like when you hit that point. Mm-hmm. That's interesting Yeah, and I didn't actually realize I was experiencing it until like after then I started realizing like oh my god I've been in this place for so long and then it became scary because I'm like, how would how was I lit? How was I? Operating like this and I started realizing how much I was like blacking out Blacking out like blocking out. Yeah Just to survive and not survive like physically but like mentally like I wasn't I was so stagnant Because I was so stuck in my own head and my cortisol levels were through the fucking roof I couldn't even my coach was like your body isn't Progressing and this is the reason why you're falling off your preps is back in 2019 Because your body is so stressed, but he obviously didn't know what was going on with me Yeah, I wasn't open about talking about those kinds of things and he's like we got to figure out what's cool No, I told my trainer I straight up to my trainers. I hate mentally. I'm just telling you I'm going through a breakup right now. Yeah, it's like I'm gonna I'm gonna cuz it's hard to eat Oh my god, I couldn't keep the protein. I couldn't get enough for one also stress makes your body Bloat and it makes it in it has a lot of inflammation inflammation can lead to disease where they say stress kills It can lead to a lot of like chronic issues and I was experiencing all of them Yeah, and it was just funny like not no not funny but when you take yourself out of environments how you can start to get better and you start to kill yourself from the inside out and Do you have positive triggers like dogs ice cream dubstep anything like that? I have lots of them now too because I mean I never used to be a morning person I'm awake every morning to see the sunrise because it is like the best part of really And I see the sunrise too, but it's not when I'm waking up. I know well, I don't know what it I don't know what it was, but there was something that I started actually, it's probably on one of Joe's podcast He talks about like how when you're a little kid Yeah you're so excited to go to Disneyland and you can't sleep the night before cuz you're so fucking excited and it's not just cuz of Disneyland you're excited about this like Experience you're gonna have the next day cuz it's so Magical and you don't know what you're about to go into and there's endless possibilities But as you become an adult you get so jaded and you're like, oh fuck tomorrow I have to go to work and my boss is gonna be like this and so-and-so is gonna vent on me and whatever and you Stop looking forward to it. So you don't want to get up You want to hit snooze a million times just to like stay asleep But if we can adopt those mentalities that okay tomorrow is a new day for something like really exciting to happen Maybe we can start rewiring and there's he goes on and on about I'd probably butcher it trying to like regurgitate what he says but yeah something hit home for me and I started practicing gratitude in the morning and waking up at sunrise and Feeling like those quiet still magical moments and wanting to change my life \", \"segments\": [{\"id\": 0, \"seek\": 0, \"start\": 0.0, \"end\": 3.5999999046325684, \"text\": \" Happiness that we experience now that didn't even exist 200 years ago, right?\", \"tokens\": [50364, 46224, 300, 321, 1752, 586, 300, 994, 380, 754, 2514, 2331, 924, 2057, 11, 558, 30, 50544], \"temperature\": 0.0, \"avg_logprob\": -0.2753354609012604, \"compression_ratio\": 1.7507787942886353, \"no_speech_prob\": 0.013844004832208157}, {\"id\": 1, \"seek\": 0, \"start\": 3.5999999046325684, \"end\": 7.679999828338623, \"text\": \" It is a we just we just recently in the 19th century came into this idea of happiness\", \"tokens\": [50544, 467, 307, 257, 321, 445, 321, 445, 3938, 294, 264, 1294, 392, 4901, 1361, 666, 341, 1558, 295, 8324, 50748], \"temperature\": 0.0, \"avg_logprob\": -0.2753354609012604, \"compression_ratio\": 1.7507787942886353, \"no_speech_prob\": 0.013844004832208157}, {\"id\": 2, \"seek\": 0, \"start\": 7.679999828338623, \"end\": 13.039999961853027, \"text\": \" You know the idea of you and me picking who we married that didn't even exist you people read Romeo and Juliet\", \"tokens\": [50748, 509, 458, 264, 1558, 295, 291, 293, 385, 8867, 567, 321, 5259, 300, 994, 380, 754, 2514, 291, 561, 1401, 33563, 293, 33532, 51016], \"temperature\": 0.0, \"avg_logprob\": -0.2753354609012604, \"compression_ratio\": 1.7507787942886353, \"no_speech_prob\": 0.013844004832208157}, {\"id\": 3, \"seek\": 0, \"start\": 13.039999961853027, \"end\": 15.039999961853027, \"text\": \" They're like, oh my god.
