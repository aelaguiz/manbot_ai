We cannot possibly agree We cannot possibly say it's 50 50 and like again There's no evolutionary psychology study that doesn't say that men care more Men obviously care more about physical attractiveness than women do even gay men do like it's just it's a thing inherent in men when it comes to the um Most lawyers date other lawyers. It's like duh. They're in the same social circles How many people how many people are you around that aren't lawyers? Like I know a lot of engineers because I do engineering I agree with you So that's why proximity is also a big thing But i'm saying with the onset of dating apps and all this opportunity. We're still seeing that lawyers typically. Yeah, but even with that point um I also think that that brings back the point of women can be a little delusional about their sexual Marketplace value because even though we have more options that doesn't mean that those options are real ones Doesn't mean Options are determined by people that are in your stat in your status level Generally in your iq now men are more likely to go down on some of those But in general your options are still at least for long-term mate prospects marriage still reflect where you are. You whoopee But my point is that you saying that most lawyers marry other lawyers isn't Isn't representative of the fact that men want to date women of the same status. It's just who they are around. So more it's the same It's the same thing. It's the same thing. I'm like saying Are the red winners but it's like duh most more of us are single. So yeah, we're the red Please let her finish her point and then So go ahead so say that again that part again with the uh, it's almost like it's the same thing as saying like most black Women are the breadwinners in their relationship. It's like if we're single duh, you're automatically the breadwinner. So it's like Extrapolating My response to that is exactly you tend to be around I would say this if you have a specific type of woman or type of man you want to marry Surround your social circle and surround like if you want one of these virgin good women go to church go to mosque Go be around these people because that is how you're gonna find. No, I don't think anyone was disagree But then you can make the argument that it's not status why they got with the woman it was proximity I agree proximity is a big thing. But generally people tend to want people that are But they're more likely to marry their lawyer the lawyer than the paralegal who's around them all the time too Uh, okay again like the real reality is that it's proximity not necessarily status because like I said before based on what I said If that woman decided to leave and lose her lawyer status because when she leaves she's gonna lose that lawyer status The man ain't going nowhere, but if it was the other way around the woman is gonna leave so status matters But what i'm trying to say is for instance a personal office He's more likely to marry that receptionist than a random person that's not around him But he's gonna be still more likely to marry that lawyer It's still proximity though. Oh, you mean well, I mean they probably work together. I mean My point my point is proximity matters But even if there's proximity men will still lawyers instead of they're more likely to be with the other lawyer than the other Okay, you know what? Hold on. What are the stats for that jasmine? likely to hire to to marry But if you literally look up What profession lawyers marry most it is other lawyers. He even agrees. Yeah, but it's not it's not 50 lawyers That's what i'm saying. I agree with that But also it tends to be they also tend to marry people. They don't they're not marrying like virgin cbs workers That's also no, I get that but but what i'm saying is that you're you're making the argument that status matters for men And i'm saying it doesn't but it And the argument that you're making is literally based off of more proximity versus their stat No, i'm trying to say proximity matters In fact, I brought that up the first time I was on here that I brought up the proximity But what i'm saying is proximity still because the receptionist is just as close and they see them just as much as the lawyer Colleague that's across from them, but they're still more likely to marry that lawyer than that receptionist Even though they have the same level of proximity. They see each other every day. They're working in the same firm I still think that's more. I still sorry. I still think that's more proximity because they're probably around more lawyers and receptionists No, I mean our paralegals work hand in hand with us more School with you ain't going to law school paralegals You're going to law school with other potential lawyers and I agree But what I mean is also when people meet in the workforce, they're not they you Proximity matters, but they still tend to marry across now Men are male lawyers are more likely to marry their receptionist than female lawyers are more like of course I agree with that, but you're still seeing this general people that like to go across But that proves my point that status is not as important for men boom You're trying to make the argument that status matters for men and i'm trying to tell you no It really doesn't matter that much the proximity thing is the reason why the proximity thing is happening is because of the proxy meaning they're They're marrying across because that's who they're near. I don't know my neighbors I just like I go to work. I go to the gym and that's like we don't live in the same communal society We had before we're just on our phones That's it and then there's the people that we come across on a day-to-day basis, but like That that generally what you're saying before is like they're gonna marry the people Yes, they're working 80 hours a day with a lawyer. That's who they're gonna end up fucking Just the paralegal but you said the men are just as likely to date the paralegal and then you see What's it called uh, gray's anatomy, they're all fucking in the break room You all the doctors are fucking in the other doctors That's because they're around doctors and like the thing is you're never going to break that they're always going to see people In the same socioeconomic class dating each other, but it's not because that's the only person they want It's just because that's who they're around. I agree That's why when I first came on I said the biggest one of the biggest predictors is proximity But even in proximity when there's a hierarchy you still see that men even though they're more likely to go down in the firm hierarchy They're still prefer the women like like even if you look at iq I mean ty lopez said this last time men don't high high iq men can go like one standard deviation They don't start going super lower. I what's your deviation is pretty high. That's an 85 Let's put it this way. If you have a woman you have the woman's like same attractiveness, whatever Um, one is a cbs worker and the other one's a lawyer Which one do you think is the same attractiveness, of course, but you're talking about what you're saying is a one percent tiebreaker If the cbs worker looks like my girlfriend and the lawyer does it then i'm just telling you they're gonna choose The point that i'm trying to get across is that if you just look at one by one then yeah Like we can clearly see that. Hey if it comes to uh profession same socioeconomic status level That is something that matters. We can't pretend. It doesn't matter whatsoever. So that's why i'm trying to God fucking damn it, but it doesn't matter that much like yo, can you guys you guys are trying to put like equal footing with like If we were gonna weigh the two would looks outweigh status for women When looks outweigh status for women if we're gonna weigh the two Do you think a man cares more about her physical attractiveness than her status? What do you think they care about more? I think a woman in general is looking for a man a man a man a man Is he gonna look does he care more about her looks or her status? What do you think he cares about more? Um, I think Well, okay, I think it depends if he's looking for like yeah, if he's looking to just fuck then look even no long-term or short-term Okay, intelligence is gonna be a tiebreaker I hope you really don't think that intelligence is like man She's ugly, but that intelligence I have a question No, no, no What i'm trying to say here is that usually if a guy is looking to have like a long-term prospect and partner Um, maybe they have like a mid to average girl, but she's like really smart and she's really nurturing and she has a good temperament Well, yeah, it does matter because if you're gonna have a wife, why would you want like a fucking? I think what we're gonna debate is i'm saying that all those other things besides looks are maybe 10 to 15 percent of it And you're saying they're 33 percent and but they're not 50 50 We cannot possibly agree. We cannot possibly say it's 50 50 and like again There's no evolutionary psychology study that doesn't say that men care more make obviously care more about physical attractiveness than women do even gay men do like it just it's a thing inherent in men men look at Signs of replication like in signs of youth and like that's what I want is number fucking one, man Like this is incredible that you guys are literally trying to argue with us that like looks are comparable to status I have a very simple question incredible You couldn't even answer Just one thing I wanted to say like socially speaking like if status was so important Why are trophy wives so popular? Like why are men like bringing around these like really hot women that have absolutely fucking nothing to add to any sort of conversation Are you finding that like lawyers and doctors have the hottest wives because you would be i'm not saying that at all But i'm why why is it a social phenomenon that trophy trophy husbands aren't? I I I would have answered that question a lot quicker than I would agree that looks matter more but usually there's a threshold What's what's on the rice can I interrupt sugar daddies, is that the real time so he's been on the ride Because we have a curfew at three and I didn't even realize what time it was Yeah It's curfew time \", \"segments\": [{\"id\": 0, \"seek\": 0, \"start\": 0.0, \"end\": 5.840000152587891, \"text\": \" I'm saying that all those other things besides looks are maybe 10 to 15 percent of it and you're saying they're 33\", \"tokens\": [50364, 286, 478, 1566, 300, 439, 729, 661, 721, 11868, 1542, 366, 1310, 1266, 281, 2119, 3043, 295, 309, 293, 291, 434, 1566, 436, 434, 11816, 50656], \"temperature\": 0.0, \"avg_logprob\": -0.24090270698070526, \"compression_ratio\": 1.7203947305679321, \"no_speech_prob\": 0.09661971032619476}, {\"id\": 1, \"seek\": 0, \"start\": 6.800000190734863, \"end\": 9.920000076293945, \"text\": \" But they're not 50 50.
