What would be good etiquette for a guy in a social situation, so let's just say convention, nightclub, whatever, to come up and talk to you guys? What would be the the proper way to do that? Or is there a proper way? I hate when guys come up and talk to me at all, like, I hate it with a fiery red passion and it's probably just because I've had so many annoying guys come up and ask me the same annoying questions. Like what? Tell me the annoying questions. Like, you just get, like, and it's honestly not annoying questions. Like, if it was just one guy, like, every now and again coming up to me asking me these questions, it probably wouldn't be a problem. It's the fact that four guys before this guy just asked me the same four questions in a row. And I'm like, oh my god. Like, it's just so entertaining. Like, like, what do you do? Why are you, who are you here with? Like, I don't, like, what's your middle name? Like, I don't know, just, like, dumb questions that, like, I'm like, why do you care? Like, what's your favorite color? I'm like, what? You don't actually care what my favorite color is. Just like, I know what you're doing. You're just trying to, like, take me home. Like, this is just stupid. Like, just come up to me and be like, hey, I think you're hot. I want to take you home. And I'm going to be like, yeah, I don't really care. I already knew that when you looked at me all weird from across the room, you didn't have to come up and tell me it. Like, I already know, bro. And then just like, walk away. Like, I just don't want to talk to him. Like, it's just irritating. There are actually dating coaches out there that believe that men should show more intent with women. And what I love about what you just said is like, no, you don't need to show more intent. They know you have intent. I think that men need to stay in their, like, dating pool. Like, the thing is that there's a lot of men. That's a good one, too. That is true. There's a lot of men who go outside of their dating pool. I think that's the first problem. Explain a dating pool. What do you mean? What's a man leaving a dating pool? Like, there's a guy that's a four that goes after a nine. And that's the first problem. Because if there's an attractive guy that comes up to me, I might be like, okay, am I going to be interested in this conversation? Yeah, and isn't that a little bit different? But he also can't come. So there's like a guy who's like probably like in my dating pool that comes up to me. He also can't be a douchebag because I've had that happen. And I'm like, oh my God, I'm going to vomit. I can't handle this. What does being a douchebag feel like and look like from your standpoint? So for instance, there's this guy who like came up to me and was talking to me one night and he was like, so you look like my wife. And I was like, wow. That sounds great. That sounds awesome. Hey guys, have you ever, just curious, had a guy either bark at you, try to pick you up and spin you around? We were barking at the girls. I was barking at the girls last night. Have you ever had a guy try to pick you up and spin you around? Oh my gosh. Or the hand of God where they just go up and they just grab you. Have you ever had that? What's that been like? The worst. You know what I think the worst is? What? Like all of those are pretty wild too. But what I hate like more than anything, this happens like I'm pretty sure like every girl all the time like this has happened to every girl. It's like when I'm trying to have like, if you come up and talk to me and they'll ask me a question and they legit are just like staring at my boobs the whole time. Like I don't even know what color their eyes are at this point because all I can see is them staring at my boobs. Yeah, that's a problem. And I'm like, what's going on down here? What's happening? Babe, I knew you for five months. I didn't even realize you had boobs. No? I just looked at you the whole time. Thank you. No, but definitely like, I've definitely had people try to pick me up and spin me around. That did not end well. They ended up on the floor. So stabbed or sliced? Well, that would be a slice. That'd just be a fight. I think like, so like even like, okay, staying in your dating pool, but also like come up and like just have like casual conversation. Don't sit here and bring up like the like lines or like ask like, so like, can I like, like the first line, like buying a drink, just like be casual and cool and calm and collected. Like you're talking to like a buddy, like a best friend, like say like normal shit and like treat me like a normal human being. And then after like we have a little bit of a conversation and we're cool and then like you finish your drink and whatever is happening. Like, oh, like, do you want me to get the next round or like when she orders it? Like, Hey, I'm going to buy that one. Don't sit there and go automatically. Like I'm going to buy you a drink because then it just feels like, okay, you're here just to get me drunk. And yeah, like are coming up and automatically being like, you're hot. Like that's really annoying. Yeah, it's annoying. Like I know. I see myself every day. She's like, I know. I see myself every day. Like you're hot. I know. I know I'm hot. I see myself every day. I get to look in the mirror. You just interrupted my conversation with my really good friend right now and we were having a great conversation just to tell me something. I know like it's like walking up to me being like the sky is blue. Like I know. I'm sorry. That's so funny. Oh, but yeah, just kind of like being like more normal and not making it so like, you know, just obvious and just like, you know, \", \"segments\": [{\"id\": 0, \"seek\": 0, \"start\": 0.0, \"end\": 4.440000057220459, \"text\": \" men need to stay in their, like, dating pool.\", \"tokens\": [50364, 1706, 643, 281, 1754, 294, 641, 11, 411, 11, 10689, 7005, 13, 50586], \"temperature\": 0.0, \"avg_logprob\": -0.2693418562412262, \"compression_ratio\": 1.8825503587722778, \"no_speech_prob\": 0.0031229620799422264}, {\"id\": 1, \"seek\": 0, \"start\": 4.440000057220459, \"end\": 8.479999542236328, \"text\": \" What would be good etiquette for a guy in a social situation, so let's just say\", \"tokens\": [50586, 708, 576, 312, 665, 42177, 3007, 337, 257, 2146, 294, 257, 2093, 2590, 11, 370, 718, 311, 445, 584, 50788], \"temperature\": 0.0, \"avg_logprob\": -0.2693418562412262, \"compression_ratio\": 1.8825503587722778, \"no_speech_prob\": 0.0031229620799422264}, {\"id\": 2, \"seek\": 0, \"start\": 8.479999542236328, \"end\": 12.079999923706055, \"text\": \" convention, nightclub, whatever, to come up and talk to you guys?
