And a few things go on. So one thing that goes on in the brain is you start to stack. So we can stack thoughts in a negative way and we can stack thoughts in a positive way. So for example, if you ever woken up on the wrong side of the bed, if you don't catch your focus, your whole f***ing day is negative. Tire pressure's off, I gotta go to work, Betty at the work, you know, all of it, just stack and stack and stack. And so I started to stack thoughts when that girl said that to me and the thoughts were, well, maybe she's right, maybe I'm disgusting. Now that I look at it as an adult, I wish I could go back and I can hug her and love on that little girl. You see, you have compassion now, you understand what she was going through. What is that little girl going through at home and with her own s*** that she had to take it out on me, a man with no legs and arms, she must have been going through some s*** and she just had to take it out on me. And so now as an adult and with perspective, I have compassion and empathy for her, but back then I didn't have that. \", \"segments\": [{\"id\": 0, \"seek\": 0, \"start\": 0.0, \"end\":
