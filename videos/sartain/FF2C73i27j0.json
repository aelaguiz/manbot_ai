Welcome guys we're excited to have you guys on here. And we're going to explain to you what it is that we do on these calls so this is basically a q amp a session if you guys have seen other content creators, they do live streams, and we do live streams of that kind of content. The difference with us is that we do our q amp a's over zoom so that you can see people live. One of the things I do not like is this whole idea of talk about it, but don't be about it. So we want you to ask your questions live because I think one of the main components is when you see guys asking these questions, you don't have all the context you don't understand that, you know, there's a bunch of other weird stuff going on right. And one of the other things that we like to go over on these calls is the fact that you're able to broadcast your voice normally, and the fact that you're able to understand things like lighting when it comes to content creation is so fucking important guys. And so that's the reason why I make you ask questions live on the call whereas other people will do super chats, and we can do that too by the way we you guys can hit us up on super chats if you want to. I'm going to post the link to the, I'm going to post the link to the call in on YouTube if you guys want to join us on YouTube you guys are still welcome to come on and join us from there, but the point of these calls is not for me to make a bunch of money on super chats or not for me to get a bunch of followers on YouTube. The point of these calls is for you to improve your ability to communicate. So one of the things we have is we have a lot of different girls we have several models come on the call. We have guests we've had you know everyone from Spencer Cornelia to roll it to Massey we have adjusted while we're on the call, we have a Flint plans for a bunch of future people today, we're having rollo on, and we're going to have ice white on ice and I are going to go over some stuff as far as social circle is concerned, you guys are going to ask your questions, and we're going to go till 11 o'clock at fucking night we'll do seven hours if that's what it takes for me to answer all the calls I do that one of these calls, twice a month, and you guys are always welcome to come on these calls for free. And another thing I encourage you to do, and very few people take me up on this but I always encourage you, bring girls on the call. One of the things that we do that's very different than other programs is we don't hide in the fucking shadows, we're not creepy little weird fucking dudes who hide in the show. Oh my god. Oh, oh, let's talk about our pickup shit. Oh, there's girls around. Let's be quiet. They'll find they'll discover our secret group of pickup technology. We don't do that loser shit in MOA, so we want you to bring girls on the call I can, there's nothing I say in MOA that I won't say in front of women because everything I say is true, right, you guys have seen me on fresh and fit. You guys have seen me on those shows right so I don't, it's not a function of accountability or blue pill simple any of that shit. We say things because they're true. So we ask people to come grow okay Rollo just join. All right, beautiful. Hold on, let's get roll on here. Guys, the Godfather Hold on here. Here we go before before we start there he is right there, gentlemen, he is the author of the rational male, he is offer of the rational male preventative medicine, he is offered author of the rational male positive masculinity, he is the author of rational male religion, he is the author of the players handbook, and he is the Godfather red pill welcome Rollo Tomasi. I had your entrance music I forgot it man my bad you're muted. Oh, there you go. Is that better. Beautiful. Got it right. Very good. Yeah, it's heavy as fuck too. Is it. Yeah, it's not some lightweight thing is like it's an old school roads, it just I don't know acoustically I like it the best so I love it. Okay, so I'll tell you what we'll we'll just you know just so we don't, we're not promising people things we can't deliver. Let's go ahead and start off with the. Let's go ahead and start off with the statement that Justin had. Okay, read that aloud me to read that or you know I can read it, I can read it. I don't know if you can pull it home let me see if I can get it here. Where's it at he just sent it to us. It's our group here. Okay, there we go. I can read it if you want. I can read it, I can read it. I don't know if you can pull it home let me see if I can get it here. Where's it at he just sent it to us. It's our group here. Okay, there we go. I can read it if you want. I got it. All right, here we go. He posted this. This is on Twitter, I've spent countless days, weeks, and months at a time with Andrew and Tristan Tate. Never have I seen Andrew or Tristan act or speak or otherwise insinuate anything illegal. Believe in further support and love both of them. They are innocent, I have zero doubt. So that's what he's saying. All right, so let's, let's go over just a couple of things that are going on here first. Before we respond to that whole thing, obviously Justin is close with with Arollo and I, we had a conversation with him on the night of the 31st. First off, you can see the extreme spectrum here, where you see kind of guys like Hassan, who are just like yeah I told you this was going to happen. And then you see guys like you know Myron and Fresh and they're like he's completely innocent and let me explain to you why. Then you see kind of a moderate level like where Patrick Bet-David is, and where you see where Spencer Cornelio which is, this is fucking stupid for us to comment on this unless, unless we have all the information. And so, let's go over a couple things. First off, Rollo, you had a show yesterday where you went over some of the rumors that you dispelled. Can you talk about that? Yeah, yeah, yeah, I did. I did about a five hour podcast with, and I generally go for a pretty long time as it is anyways, but I haven't done that long a podcast and I think the first like probably like third of the show was dedicated to just the Tate, doing a breakdown of what happened with the Tates. I can't say I spoke with Andrew on Christmas, but I had some texting and we're just saying, hey, you know, pleasantries and stuff, you know, Merry Christmas kind of thing. That was the last time that I had any kind of like personal contact with him and people are saying, well, how come you just don't call him up right now? I'm like, well, I don't know. He's in jail, dude. What are you going to call him up right now? But I think both of us are, I mean, you and I both have personal contact with him and certainly Justin does as well. There's a lot of guys that are involved in Hustlers University. Sterling Cooper is one of those. And of course, Justin is another. Justin is very, very close with Andrew and I think Andrew in particular, but also Tristan as well. The last time I was, let's see, last time I saw them face to face was about a year ago on Fresh and Fit. We did a show, myself, Justin, Sterling Cooper, and Andrew. And that's really the last time I think he's been in the United States. As you guys know, and since we're in a private Zoom call here, I can actually. No, we're on YouTube. Then I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll reserve my word. I'll, I'll try to be careful with my words a little bit here. I, I was asked to do a, a daytime talk show that we, we foolishly did a, a, a Access Vegas style breakdown of later on, but they really wanted. Hold on. They, hold on. They asked you to fill in as a guest. I said, yeah. They wanted you to, they wanted you on this doc on this daytime talk show. They wanted you to fill in. Okay. Got it. Got it. Yeah. Yes. Anyways, the, the premise of it of course was, you know, the, you know, are we corrupting the youth of America with the math, you know, the red pill and, and they really wanted some, they really wanted a proxy for Andrew. And I went in there and I went to bat for Andrew. I talked to him right after that. I talked to him before that. He wouldn't go on the show simply because he couldn't, he won't come to the United States. He has, I think that's pretty much common knowledge at this point. So I broke that down. I said, here's why he's not coming to the US. And then of course the producers of that particular show asked me if there was any way I could get him on a particular remote. And I said, no, he's not going to do that because it was right when he had converted to Islam and he didn't want to take any chances with doing like a more Westernized, I guess. A talk shows or podcasts or anything like that. At least that's what he told me. However, I know that he was planning on relocating to Dubai permanently. And I think he was trying to establish residency. And one way to do that, of course, is convert to Islam. So I think, again, this is all speculative. I tried to be as clear as I could be with respect to like what we know now and what I'm like, I've got sources that are sort of behind the scenes. And I got, I'm also looking at people on Twitter and I'm looking at some new sources and seeing what people actually know and how that gels with what I know from other people, such as Justin, such as Sterling, such as there's some other people that I know as well that are sort of in the Hustlers University as well. And a lot of the guys in HEU right now are actually kind of in the dark as well. So it's an interesting situation. I think that the response right now from accounts and podcasts and entertainers who really wanted to jump on the Tate bandwagon back in, like, say, June or May or June of last year and wanted to be a part of that just simply so they could put Andrew Tate in the title of their videos. Now you're seeing who's really on board and who's not. And I was pointing this out yesterday. I said a lot of people are either too happy or they're too pissed off that Andrew got arrested and Tristan got arrested. As it stands right now, they're still arrested. There is a possibility that they could appeal the 30-day detention on January 5th. That's the earliest that they can do that. That I know for sure. They had a \\u2013 I don't want to call it an arraignment because they're technically \\u2013 and I didn't know this, Mike, but they're technically not arrested yet because the way that the Romanian legal system works, I guess, is they can hold them for up to 30 days. And as much as \\u2013 I think 180 days maximum is the most that they can detain them. So they haven't been charged per se with a crime yet, but they have enough evidence to convince a judge that says, look, we need to hold these guys for at least 30 days. They can appeal that, and of course Tristan and Andrew have a lawyer in Romania, and they're going to appeal it, but they can't appeal it until January 5th. So there's a possibility that they get out on January 5th. If not, then they're pretty much there for the next 30 days. The charges that are on them right now is there is sexual assault slash rape. There is human trafficking, which I think is pretty much everybody already knows about. There is an organized crime charge of some sorts that they're trying to make stick, which I think is kind of interesting because the organized crime part of it is an international thing, and they're talking about how it goes from the United States to the Great Britain and then to Romania itself. The Taits have been trying to get, I guess, residency in Dubai for a while. I don't know that they necessarily saw this coming where they're at right now, but they did \\u2013 they have been \\u2013 Andrew has been talking about getting picked up since as far back as when I was interviewing him in 2018. So when he starts talking about this stuff in September of this year, I'm like, I got to kind of take it with a grain of salt because he's always talked about that. But I think the timing of the arrest is also \\u2013 or the detention, I should say, is also key because they picked him up, what, the 30th I think, so two days before the end of the year. I think they \\u2013 I think the prosecutors and I think that DICOT or Interpol or whoever is picking him up did it on purpose. They had to do that for a reason, and they were going to hold him for 24 hours and then decided they wanted to hold him for 30 days. And they went right up to the wire, I think it was like 22 hours or 23 hours, and then they got the judge to detain them for another 30 days, like a solid 30 days. I don't know where they're at. I don't know exactly if it's a prison. I don't know if it's a detention center or whatever, wherever the heck they are. They were also picked up with a female former Romanian police officer. She's been arrested, and I forget. I think it was Tristan's PA. Was it his girlfriend or his \\u2013 I don't know if it's his baby mama or whatever, but she was picked up as well. She was released, but so now they have Tristan, they've got Andrew, and they've got this Romanian female police officer that are being detained for whatever these crimes ended up being. The other part is I don't think a lot of people realize this is they did not pick them up at their house. They did not pick them up at their \\u2013 where they do the podcasts and everything. Andrew and Tristan own lots of different properties throughout Romania, and they picked them up at one of these other properties. The raid that you see on the video is them going into that house, but they were not there when they were actually picked up and brought into the detention or wherever they're at right now. So as far as that stands, that's what I know now. I can go \\u2013 I'll pick up the news feed here and I'll read it to you if you want me to. Yeah, please do that. Okay. Let me go look for it. This is what I was sort of relating to everybody on my show yesterday. Let's see if I can find it here. There's been some updates since then, but these are \\u2013 you got to remember when I'm reading this to you, remember this is like from like three days ago or four days ago. So if it sounds a little weird, that's why. Okay. So I want to go over one thing that you brought up before. So in the United States \\u2013 Let me look this up. Go ahead. So for those of you from the United States who are not familiar with U.S. law, one of the things that we take more seriously in the U.S. \\u2013 according to our constitution, obviously you can say, do we do this in practice? You can make an argument we don't. But according to our constitution, the right to private property and also the right to a jury trial and also a speedy trial and also the presumption of innocence until proven guilty. These are things that \\u2013 these are core tenets in our U.S. constitution, right? And so one of the things that we have in our law is this idea that we cannot hold someone for a long period of time unless we charge them with a crime. We have to tell them what the crime is and when. they go to trial, they get to face their accuser, okay. This is not like on Instagram where someone can take your account down by mass reporting you, but you never get to see who these people are that get to report you. In the United States, that's where the whole believe all women thing came from because the idea was a woman was supposed to be able to charge a man saying, I was assaulted or raped by this man. And then when, when they go to trial, she should not have to face her accuser when the United States, you do have to face your accuser. Okay. So I've got an update here for you Let me just say this real quick in the U S they can only hold you for, I believe 72 hours. It depends on the state, apparently in, um, apparently in, uh, Romania, they can hold him for periods of 30 days, depending on the judges, uh, whatever the judge feels, uh, and they could in their added periods up to days, up to five periods of 30 days that equal 150 days. They continue to hold him without charging him. That's not something we can do in the United States. You would need to have sufficient evidence in order to charge. And then when that, when you charge them, then that charge then goes in front of a grand jury. Uh, and then the grand jury then States, okay. Whether or not you're, this charge is going to go forward and you could go to trial. If you plead, um, if you, you know, if you say that you're innocent or whatever, I'm getting the order of operations, uh, out of order, but that's the way it works in the United States, right. It is a jury of your peers and a grand jury that chooses whether or not to charge you with certain things. Anyway, keep going. All right. I've got this for you here right now. Okay. So this started on December 30th and I have some updates here. That's going to actually kind of, I didn't even know this right until right now. Uh, this is, uh, December 30th. Uh, the Tate brothers were currently are currently at a hearing. The, the prosecutors requested the 30 day detention, which you already know, uh, the legal opinion, uh, it, I expect the judge to approve the prosecutor's request, which they did. Uh, let's see, uh, right now, uh, where are they at? Uh, they, they, they, you guys already know that they're holding them for 30 days. They were going to appeal it. The appeal was overturned by the way. Uh, I'll, I'll read that to you here in a second. Um, the accusations expand beyond Romanian territory. They are suspects, uh, in committing crimes on an international level, including the United States and the UK, at least for the sex trafficking part of it. Uh, judicial sources claim the Tate brothers were wiretapped and under satellite surveillance for months. So all that shit you hear about Greta and the pizza box is just bullshit. Okay. So like, don't, they wanted to create a narrative and they wanted to have their kind of like, haha, gotcha moment. But, uh, the pizza, there's three, there's three things here. Number one, immigration would have known that they were residents of Romania. Immigration would have known they had come into the country. Okay. Number two, they had posted on their social media that they were already in Romania, but after they got back from London, remember she had, uh, Andrew had done a live stream and a live stream, but had done a recording with pearly things in London. That was not live streamed pearly things posted that several days later. So it would become her 100th episode after it was posted. Uh, Andrew was already back in Romania around the time that that was posted. And he posted on social media that he was back in Romania and three, there were people already investigating him. Greta Thunberg had nothing to do with this. And anyone who posts that just automatically, the reason why Rolo and I are bringing this up is that I'm not trying to proclaim innocence or guilt. What I am trying to proclaim is now, you know, who the fucking idiots are. Yeah. Now, you know, who the fucking idiots are, the ones who were saying he was captured. Like even Hassan is like trying to hold on so tightly. No, it was partially because of the pizza box. I know if I gnash my teeth and clinch my butthole, I know the pizza box, the pizza box had fucking nothing to do with it. Okay. Had nothing to do with it. So I just want to make sure, but the reason why is that really that big of a deal? No, he's still arrested. The point is when you see people proclaiming it was the pizza box, now you take a big fucking X and you say, this is not a reputable source for anything. You can now say, okay, now I know this is not a reputable source for any subject whatsoever because they run off half cocked and they spout rumors that are not true. That's one of the reasons why we wanted to bring up some of this stuff. We want to impeach the credibility of some of these people. We still, I would still have even talked about whether or not I think he's guilty or innocent. We'll get to that later, but I want to start with what the things are that are clearly not factual. Okay. Let's, let's go over that first. Keep going. Okay. So yeah, I wanted to point that out to you. I try to do, I always put a caveat out in front of all my, my shows, if I'm talking about stuff like this, because a lot of people will say, Hey, you said this. I was like, no, that was the information I had at that particular time. As you guys know, I always try to stay as objective about things as possible. I'm close to the, to the Tate's as well. I'm not, I've never been a part of hustlers university, but I have known Andrew and Tristan since as far back as 2016. So in, in the interest of fairness here, all I've been trying to do up to this point is to just relate the news. Okay. I just work here. I'm just telling you guys what's going on. So what we know right now, though let's see, they were the Romanian press are going all, we're going crazy over this. Of course he is, you know, he's got private jet. He's got all, by the way, he's got six different passports. I think people need to remember that too. Let's see the okay. So they said, here we go. The court had an issue with their translator. So this was delayed the decision. But then now they are being held for 30 days. It looks like they might be being held longer than that. Now with the updates that I'm looking at arrested, arrested for 30 days, although I don't know if it's arrested or it's, or it's detained at this point with the potential of 150 days, as in, as the investigation continues some of the stats that could give you an idea of what the Tate brothers could expect in. Okay. So in Romania, prosecutors opened 552 new trafficking cases, indicted 234 alleged traffickers, and got convictions for 142 traffickers as per the United States, US state department. Andrew and Tristan Tate lawyers are already have already appealed the decision for the 30 days, but that got overturned. As I'll tell you here in a moment, Andrew and Tristan Tate, as well as the ex-police woman are still under arrest, but Georgia Nigel, I don't know if you know who she is, Mike, she is Tristan's PA was released. So apparently they, they arrested her and then they released her. Let's see, they, the judge that they have. So apparently she wasn't using the lover boy method. No, apparently not. I know that that's been, we're going to, by the way, we're going to go over that later on. We're going to go over that later. All right. So Andrew and Tristan are, are facing a very tough prosecutor. This guy's name is Mr. Reres Petru Stan is a chief prosecutor behind some of the biggest cases in Romania, oversaw the case of the biggest drug trafficker in Romania. And it gets worse. One of the toughest anti-mafia prosecutors who dealt with famous cases, including the fire in collective club. I don't know. I don't know anything about this. So if you're from, I remember this collective club was the one in France that burned down. Right. That's the one. Yes. I think, I think so. I could be wrong, but I believe it was some American rock and roll band. 186 wounded. Yeah. He's he's used to working under stress as he's received death threats multiple times and has 24 seven security special forces watching after him. So he's up there up against a pretty interesting prosecutor to begin with. So that's that let's see. Moving on. Where's the rest of it? They, so they were supposed to appeal the, the, the 30 day detention as of like January 5th, they did not accept that there was any justification to expedite the process. Although in cases where they feel it is warranted, they can hear an appeal within 24 hours. Now, this is the update that I didn't know about the latest updates. Unsurprisingly, the appeal has been rejected. This isn't a surprising considering Tate brags about his many passports today, they announced the seizure of Tate's mansion and his car collection in Romania. So I that's, this is a new development that I did not realize. And where did this go? Okay, here we go. I mean, if you want to know what his car collection is, he's got a Bugatti, a BMW, a Ferrari, another Ferrari, a McLaren, a Porsche, Lamborghini, a Huracan, Mercedes, Mercedes, Rolls Royce, Aston Martin. So that's what they've got. Let's see. Andrew's Romanian mansion will also be seized this week. The former warehouse turned bachelor pad hosts massive parties, the podcast studio, Hustlers University room and Tate's gym. This was also expected to be or expected considering the severity of the charges the Tate brothers are facing. So that is where we're at right now. I had no idea that they were going to seize the seize the property at this point. So I mean, that's an old role before you go forward again, in the United States for those because there's a lot of people on here watch this that are from Eastern Europe. A lot of my clients are from France, other countries, you guys don't have the same respect for private property that we do in the US. If you commit a murder and murder 50 people and you have a car, the state can't just take your car. I know it's crazy in China. If you if you commit an act of treason, the state can't take your house in the United States unless there's a legal precedent for it. Now, they can eventually sell it if you go bankrupt. But they can't take your assets even if you're guilty of a crime and get the death sentence in the United States. Your assets are your assets till you die even if you're convicted of a felony. In other countries, I've seen this in other countries. We have what's this the guy, the guy who created hex guys, Richard Hart, when he came on, he talked about this when he was in certain South American countries, the state just takes your shit. Okay. In Romania, maybe that's the case. We don't know. I'm not sitting here pretending to be an expert on this. But one of the things I want to do is compare and contrast how this would be going on different in the United States versus here. He would have been charged Andrew and Tristan would have been charged sometime before 72 hours, or they would have been released. They would have been put in front of a judge, the judge would have said you are charged with this crime and bail is X amount now because Andrew and Tristan are of means and have multiple passports. There's a possibility that they were a flight risk. They may have seen the same thing in Romania and say there will be no bail because of that. I don't know. We're just speculating. But I just want to bring up I'm just going to compare and contrast what would have been like in the United States versus what they're going through here. Because even like when the with Myron on Fresh and Fit, Myron talked to somebody from the Romania, a Romanian legal official about this whole situation, because Myron used to work in law enforcement in the United States. So he's just like me, we're not we're not, you know, we don't really understand. However, Romania is a representative democracy, we do assume they have a, you know, a constitution, people do have rights, but we don't know if they have like, for instance, the right to not incriminate yourself in the United States, it's the Fifth Amendment, the right to have illegal search and protection from illegal search and seizure, that would be the Fourth Amendment, the right of freedom of speech, that would be the First Amendment, the right to bear arms, that would be the Second Amendment. We don't know if they have those exact same rights in Romania. Yeah, I got okay. So now that's, that's as of, I'm just quoting one of my new sources here. This is another one. This is Nick. So this is from Twitter. And this is Nick Sotor. This is unconfirmed, but a source close to Tate has told us that Tate's arrest is in relation to money laundering, not rape. Tate will reportedly be held for an extended amount of time. Human trafficking is still an ongoing investigation, but it is on the lines of money laundering. The terrorism charge, there's an associated terrorism charge here, is in regards to a conversation about the Taliban, which were posted online, including some videos. I think this is bullshit. They're just fishing for this. That's why counterterrorism got involved. The money laundering charge stemmed from finding 10 million euros in cash in the house. That's why they brought him in on money laundering charges. Authorities have been digging into their crypto wallets on Binance as well. This has nothing to do with the Romanian pizza box, we already know that. And I thought this was kind of, I wanted to point this out too, because I think this is kind of kind of getting lost in the weeds here, is there are also money laundering charges. And that might be another reason why they're seizing property and they're seizing the cars. I know for a fact that they were going to seize at least one or two of these cars. I didn't know it was going to be the whole collection because they had, according to the sources- Rollo, what if this was the whole point? That's what I was going to say. So here's my, okay, so those are, that's rumor control. That's what we know up to this point right now. And I think it's, I think too many people don't really do their homework on all of this. I do it because I know the guys and I want to know exactly what's happening. Now, I also have to point this out in, and I know Justin has confirmed this. I have seen this myself. I know he's taught, I've actually, in interviews I've had with Andrew, I know for a fact that they own two casinos in Romania. And you don't buy casinos in Romania because you really like gambling. So, and I was going to say, you also don't have to watch too many issues, or too many episodes of Ozark to know that casinos are a primary business for money laundering. I don't know what's going on. Again, this is sort of me connecting dots, speculating on what's going on at this point. I'm thinking, and this is me spitballing here, I'm thinking that the sex trafficking charges and the, everything up to this point has sort of been a cover, some reason to get them and to detain them, arrest them, and hold them so they can get them on something bigger. And it would appear, at least from what I'm seeing right now, that the something bigger would probably be a money laundering charge. And that, if that's the case, then you get international law involved, depending on who the players are. So again, those are out there, the word's out there. They did find 10 million euros in cash in their place. I don't know how normal that is in Romania, but is Romania part of the European Union, correct? Am I right about that? I don't think it is. Is Romania part of the European Union? I don't believe it is. Is it? Because I'm wondering why there would be euros there, if that's the case. Well, no, I mean, you can spend euros anyway, just you can spend dollars in Qatar. Okay. Okay. I was just, I mean, that doesn't necessarily mean- I was just curious as to- I would imagine you will see US dollars and euros in Turkey. I would imagine you would see them in like all countries all over the world. I would imagine you'd see them in Ukraine. But yeah, I was not aware of this. So forgive me for not knowing that. I was not sure if Romania was part of the EU. So anyways, that's the facts that we know. Up to now, I had no idea that they were they'd seized the car, all of the cars, I thought maybe they were only a pickup like one or two, because they mentioned that there were car carriers there as part of the raid. And I'd had them up until just now, I did not realize that they were actually going to, I guess, seize the property as well. Again, I don't know, Romanian law, I don't know anything about DIICOT as far as like what they can get them on, Interpol, that kind of stuff. What I find very interesting, though, is like you were saying before, you've got these guys who are trying, like, for instance, I watched Patrick Bet-David's take on this whole thing with Adam Sosnick and those guys. And they're kind of fence riding right now. And then you see someone like, say, Jedidiah Bila, or you'll see Lea Heilpern, who are the true believers. And so everything's the matrix and everything is there. They finally got them kind of thing. Or, you know, he said, you know, it was going to be like this. And I'm wondering what, you know, as far as processing all of this, once, you know, all of the facts come out and what, you know, whenever they're going to trial for whatever it is that they're trying to get them on. I'm I mean, I'm very much concerned for my friends, of course, but like I'm also I think this is a critical time, as you were saying before, to watch what other people are doing and watch how they're either they're scattering right now. And they, you know, they never knew who who Andrew was or else they are like all out. They're all in. They're doubling down on it. So so Jedidiah Bila is doubling down. I wasn't aware. I didn't look at her. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. She she she just I think it was right after the arrest. She was, you know, she I won't say conspiracy theory, but she's like very much wrapped up in the whole matrix theme and the narrative that that's sort of been crafted, really, I think, since like about August or July or August this year. So, again, I think it's important to stay objective. I think it's important to be like sort of realistic about what's going on. I'm not again. I hope I plan for the worst and I hope for the best. So that's pragmatism as far as I'm concerned. I want to know what's going on. I want to see what's happening, especially when I see narratives like the Greta Thunberg thing and the pizza box thing and everything. And then you see someone like Hassan or you see like Ethan Klein, they're jumping on it from one the extreme of one side. And then then you got to like a lay a Heil Pern, who is really kind of a zealot for for Tate, right? For all the Tate's period right now. And so somewhere in between, I think, is is where we kind of need to be right now just to sort of see what's going on. I either way, it's it's not reflective very well on what's been sort of promoted as this big narrative that's been going on for the last year. You know, 2020, I think it speaks poorly of YouTube in general. I think it speaks poorly of a lot of talking heads in general. You know, I'm not I'm not going to say whether or not you know what I think I will. I'll say this. Spencer Spencer Cornelia had made some critical videos about Andrew and on his video that he made the other day. He said he goes, it doesn't seem likely to me that a guy was making ten million dollars a month and was surrounded by women all the time was trafficking women. That doesn't make a lot of sense to him. And he doesn't like Andrew. And he said that. Right. And then the same thing where they came at it from two different angles, which was Patrick, but David and Lucario and Hassan all saying, you know what? The reason why he did this was because he poked the Matrix. He kept they all three agree, even though, you know, Hassan doesn't like him and PPD does like him. They all said you kept poking the bear. You kept poking the bear. Guess what was going to happen? You kept poking the bear. You know, I'm going to talk about this. This is real morbid. And I want to talk about this because I just I just want to bring it up. And I want to bring it up because I don't want him. I don't want this to happen to him. You understand what he said. He has three lives, right? He said the first life was that they were going to cancel him. And that happened. The second life was that he was going to go to jail. And you remember what the third one was. And I just hope that him being so public about, you know, him getting hit with a suicide gun in prison, the fact him being so public would possibly inoculate him from that happening, because I'm not saying the Romanian police are out to kill him. I'm not saying that. But I think someone is. I definitely think someone I think I definitely think they're the level of just insanity that we've seen from both sides, to be fair, from from both sides, the level of fucking insanity that we've seen. I do. I do understand why he walks around with six huge bodyguards. I do believe that on some level, there's some crazy nuts that are out there that may want to do something to him. I don't think Greta, you know, Greta Thunberg had one thing or nothing to do with it. I that's my only concern. I just hope I am talking about it publicly. I agree with that take. And I also think that and I had this conversation with him when OnlyFans started to become something bigger. I had him on my show. Let's see. I've had Tate on my show twice as an interview. I've had him on a Q&A once or twice. I've had Tristan on my show once. Of course, I've been on Fresh and Fit with them. But in that time when we were talking about like they've been running cam girls forever. OK, so this is nothing that that people don't already know about. They've been they've been running a cam girl operation since at least 2017 when I first started interviewing him, because that's what we that's what we talked about. How do you make your money? That's how they were doing that. And then right around the end of 2019 into sort of 2022, it's like I was like, hey, you know, OnlyFans is starting to become a it's I hate to say, but it's kind of like going to put guys like you out of business because now girls can just do it themselves, right? All over the world. And it's like the number one, you know, shift or pivot for women to, you know, get out of whatever they were doing during the pandemic. And now they want to, you know, make money as sort of digital prostitutes on OnlyFans, whatever it is. However, how does I asked him this? I said, how does that impact your business? He says, well, you know, it's us running things from behind the scenes. And the most successful OnlyFans girls have like sort of handlers or digital pimps or whatever it is you want to call it. But it was all about board. He hasn't been he's been talking about this forever. So that's another reason why I don't think that the sex trafficking charges are really all that legit. That's why I was saying they wanted to get him on that so they could get him for something bigger and go fishing. And that's why they needed to seize the properties. That's why I need to get him off the property so they can go hunt for whatever it is that they were looking for. Also, I should point this out. You want to talk about narratives? I talked about this on yesterday's show. The videos that they were showing on like Sky News and the BBC and some of these other European news sources, they had to show you their arsenal, right? And so they've got like some I forget what the guns were. They look like glocks to me. But yeah, it looked like they had a couple of glasses or something. Yeah. Yes. And so they have these on the table and then they had their phones and they had, you know, stuff. So that's legit. They had those. And then they were showing like all of these pictures of like big like collector's knives and axes, as if that's their arsenal and they're going to go medieval on someone. And then they were showing sort of this this table, which is an art. It's like an art table or whatever. They had there was a gun that was sort of sandwiched in between this glass and their shells and some euros and stuff. It's like sort of, you know, tough guy furniture kind of thing. They're trying to portray that as if that's what they found. But that's actually just the table that is part of their that is a part of the coffee table, basically, is what it is. So you have to remember that what you're like, believe like nothing that you see from the news and believe half of what you hear right now, including myself, because I could be wrong about this because I'm only getting it from from other people as well. But the other thing that I think now, here's my spitballing speculation side of things. I agree with you 100 percent, Mike, because I think that there's something bigger to this. I don't think it's the mainstream. I don't think it's the matrix or whatever. I think it's possibly whoever he owes money to. If if, in fact, the money laundering charges are legit, how like who are they and where that where who is he laundering money for? Who has he been laundering money for? If that's a case. Yeah. And I think that if anybody wants to kill him. Yeah. Probably the people who he owes money to or the money laundering thing was not panning out or something. Something went down, something went bad. And and I mean, maybe I'm going all Netflix, you know, documentary here. But like, that's my main concern, more so than, say, like the sex trafficking thing, because everybody knew everybody knows he's doing the doing cam girls. Yeah. So the issue is where he, you know, talks frequently online about being involved with rough people. Right. He talked about this frequently. And then there was a complaint. I mean, this is what Patrick Bette David said, is if you consistently talk about this, also what Hassan said, if you consistently talk about that, you know, at some point, some of those people might be like, hey, bro, stop talking about us. This is what happened with John Gotti is he got out of prison and he made his very what was a very private battle with the federal government into a very public battle. Right. And other mafia bosses were telling him, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this. I'm not making an argument for or against what he did. I'm just saying this is an argument that I've heard. The other one was I mean, a couple of things. The idea of they thought he was going to move again. This is just speculation. I'm not saying this is going to happen. But the idea that he was going to move all of his assets to the United Arab Emirates, Romania, realizing that they were going to lose like what? The 20th or 10th wealthiest, wealthiest person in their entire country, you know, to move somewhere else. So let's abscond with his cars. Let's get a 15 million dollar bond. Let's get a bunch of money from him so that when he leaves the Emirates, at least we have all this. That's a theory. I'm not saying that that's that's essentially what happened. But I mean, there's a bunch of other things. And then the last one and one that I've discussed with you before. Of course, I'm not saying that this is what happened with Andrew, because I don't know if he's ever done anything illegal. But what I am saying is, what about the possibility of him getting? So I know that back in Texas, if you wanted to get involved in, like, say, owning a strip club, there were certain people you had to like hand envelopes to. OK. I'm not going to I'm just going to leave it at that. I used to work as a manager of strip club in Texas. There were only certain people that could own strip clubs in Austin, Dallas, Houston, et cetera. And so in order to break into that racket, you had to know one of these people. I would imagine getting a casino in Romania is a similar type of process, probably a little bit more intense. But at the end, what happens when you have a let's say we have a casino and the casino is making me two million a month or a million a month profit? OK, but I still am beholden to these individuals that let me get into this industry. Now I start Hustle University, the real world. Now I start the war room and I'm making 10 million a month, 20 million a month. And I kindly go to these other individuals and I'm like, hey, sorry, I'd like to not be involved with these casinos anymore. I'm going to move to Dubai. Peace out. And then they're like, no, the fuck you're not. You're not leaving. I'm just saying this is a speculation, a possibility. That's a theory. That's a theory. It's just it's just a theory. And then they go to the police that they've already bought and sold. And like, oh, yeah, the guy, Andrew, who thinks he's going to leave. He did this, this, this, this and this. Yeah. And then and then another envelope is passed along. So Tate had the seized car collection of Bugatti, the BMW, two Ferraris, a McLaren, Porsche, Lamborghini, Huracan, Mercedes, Mercedes, Rolls Royce, Aston Martin. Do you like? Do you think you do? I think they got that from Camgirls. Do you think does he have that car collection? And the money to buy that car collection from just Camgirls. Let me ask my producer, Kylie, do you think he got that money from just running Camgirls? No, she doesn't think so. So there clearly has to be. I know. OK, I happen to know that at least half of those cars he's had for quite some time. I know he's had the McLaren for a while. So I and I've always asked this. I said, do you make that kind of money? Are you living that kind of lifestyle? Are you going to, you know, super lounging around on super yachts in the sea of Oman and having a private jet based only on a Camgirl business? And I'm not saying that you can't make a millions off of it, but I'm not you're not making that much of it. I think I think I think the rest of the money coming. I think you can make that much from affiliate marketing. Yeah. Well, yeah. But remember, his affiliate marketing only what you're saying, because it was a long time ago, last like six months, though. So, OK, so you're saying you're saying because he's had the cars for a long time. That's why that's what you think. Well, and I've always asked this, too. I mean, this has always been sort of a, you know, a curiosity of mine. It's like, where's the money come from? Because it can't just be Camgirls. That was one of the things I said back in 2020. I said, is that how is OnlyFans going to impact your business? And they were kind of they're really defensive about it because they were they were thinking that, you know, well, people need to be behind it. And I don't know, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe you can make that kind of money off of Camgirls. But now that OnlyFans is a thing, I'm I'm I'm skeptical that two guys in the chat just said he was doing Amazon FBA. Amazon. Yes, of course. He bought all those supercars from Amazon FBA. You too can you too can make this much money from Amazon FBA. Join us right now. Pay $29.95 and join my course and I'll teach you how to do Amazon FBA. Just like the Tates did. Is that what you do? So can I? OK, so I'm going to put on my tinfoil hat and go full Alex Jones on you right now. Let's just say for sake of argument, he's got two casinos, possibly more. I've worked in casinos for pretty much half of my career. So I've worked with the Carano brothers in Reno. I know the people. I know lots of people in Vegas. I know lots of people. And actually in Mississippi, I know a lot of people who I've worked for. And I know how casinos work. And I know the kind of attention. And it's like a full time. It's like it's an 80 hour a week job is what it is, OK? These casinos that the Tates have are not like the kinds of casinos you would go to in Vegas, OK? They're like gaming halls where they've got like video poker and slot machines and stuff like that. Honestly, why would you have casinos in Romania? Because you really like casinos because they're a revenue thing. Maybe that's maybe that's a thing. But I mean, as I said before, you don't have to be a fan of Ozark to understand that casinos are a primary cover for money laundering. And now we have the money laundering charges right here. OK, let's just say for sake of argument, that's the truth. Who would he be laundering money for in Romania? In the proximity between Romania and say, oh, I don't know, Ukraine and Russia right now, who would he be laundering money for? Speculatively speaking, again, here I'm going to put on the tinfoil hat. Let's just say, for example, like who runs the Russian country right now? Is it Vladimir Putin? No, it's it's mainly Russian oligarchs who have a need for money laundering. If that's the case and they go to war with the Ukraine. the deal went bad that they had before and now things go south. I don't know how, but perhaps the people who would like to kill him are actually the Russians who he owes money to or for whatever happened with the money laundering thing. This is me going full speed. I'm not saying this is what's happening. I might be completely wrong with this. I probably am. But is that a working theory? I mean, possibly. I mean, like, again, we can't, let's do what Patrick MedDavid said. We don't know shit. We just really don't know until some of this stuff comes out. I mean, I'll talk about what I do know. I just, I find it, we talk about Delta and trading. I find it maybe like a five Delta, a one Delta that he would actually do. Like, it's just, it's to me, the idea of Andrew Tay, like physically holding women interested, physically holding a women down when thousands of attractive women guys, I've been there. I've been sitting next to attractive women, literally asking me to send videos to Andrew on WhatsApp so that he, so that he'll write them back. I'll show you the videos. Okay. Really attractive women doing this. The idea that a guy making 10 to 20, 20 million a month and having women throwing themselves at him is now human trafficking to me is equivalent to Warren Buffett robbing a McDonald's. Yeah. There's no, why would he need to? That's my point now? I don't know. Trust me. If the evidence comes out and I'm completely wrong, I reserve the right to be wrong. The thing for me right now is it just doesn't make sense. If you told me that, you know, Michael Jordan's, you know, he's, he stole a pair of jump man Jordans from some kid. I would be like, Hey, there doesn't seem to be a lot of motivation there. That doesn't seem to make a lot of sense to me. Do you understand what I'm saying? So I would probably not believe that. And that is kind of where I'm at with this thing, because what they're saying is the, the crimes were committed in March. He's still a very, very wealthy individual in March. Okay. Uh, that that's what they're saying. Right. And all the way up till recently. So I'm supposed to believe that this guy who, you know, 200 million, even as it were 10 million, 20 million is going off and doing this. I'm just having a hard time believing that this would be the equivalent to me of a girl making $500,000 a month and only fans and then turning tricks in a fucking casino for 50 bucks. It just doesn't, you know what I'm saying? It's like the motivation doesn't, it doesn't equal out. It doesn't mean it's not proof positive. I can't prove anything, but it just doesn't make sense. Part of the timeline though. I think we, I neglected to cover is in April of last year, they were detained for five hours because they had one chick that was there that said something about like, Oh, I'm being held here against my will. And it was interesting to see that. I mean, they got, I mean, they were released within five hours. They held them for questioning and they let them go. And according to the prosecutors now, that was just what triggered or was like part of an ongoing investigation that had been going on for all up to now about eight months, nine months, I think. And they had one, they had one girl that had said something about that. Now there's a total of six. So it may, it may be that it took them a while to get enough women to corroborate stories or whatever, so that they could pick them up on something else so they could get them for something larger. I think the very fact that they had one, that's one thing. If they have six that are saying that have the same story, then maybe they can hold them for, well now 30 days so that they can investigate and find, you know, find something else or hit them on something that they're really going after. It's kind of like Al Capone got picked up for like tax evasion, right? Al Capone's Al Capone, but you know, tax evasion was what they needed to get him into, get him into prison. And then they get him for something bigger. That's what I think is sort of like the, the, the MO of this whole thing. Yeah. I mean, it's, it's I mean, again, this is, this is all just speculation. I don't know what the something bigger is, but it seems to me like that would be the process. Yeah. Do you want to take any questions or do you have any other? Sure, sure, sure. Yeah, no problem. Okay. So a couple of things I want to do. Number one, if you have a question for Rolo and you're in MOA, cool. If you have a question for me and you're in MOA, let's take those questions tomorrow or else we're going to be here till midnight. Okay. So if you're in MOA, yes, if you're not, once we get later on, once we're not talking about this subject and we get into more like, you know, uh, questions about lifestyle, social circle, if you guys are in MOA and you want to step up and answer some questions from some of these other guys, especially networking coaches, you guys have my full permission to do that. Okay. I want you to do that. You're all, all of you are grownups. You're allowed to unmute yourselves and do that right now. Let's stick to questions specifically for Rolo Tomasi. Let's try to keep it to the tapes up. If not, if you want to ask Rolo Tomasi about, you know, um, about a player's handbook, that's fine as well. Let's stick to that. Or, you know, maybe evolutionary psychology questions in general for Rolo and myself. Let's do that right now for this next hour. And then afterwards we'll move on to other stuff. Ice White is going to hang on and we're going to, he and I are going to do a Q and a at the very end. Okay. So we're going to start off right here with, uh, my, uh, Hey, Somali from Austin, Texas. What's your question, brother? Yup. Yup. Yup. How are you doing guys? Uh, I'm kind of in a recession, like work hole right now. So making money is the number one thing, but I want to maintain my relationships with like successful entrepreneurs in Austin. I was out during, uh, new years and some of them like, didn't recognize me because I've been so focused on like solar sales the last couple of months. So I want to ask you guys, how do you go about maintaining work relationships or with entrepreneurs that could be valuable, uh, down the line? Um, I would, okay. So when I'm maintaining my relationships with anything, whether it's friendships or it's, uh, it's business, um, I mean, I think it's, I think, um, Mike, you'd probably agree with me on this. And I know, I think it was Justin that brought this up is Justin likes to hang out with people. Not only you guys share common interests with, but some like people that he knows that he can sort of, um, uh, build something with like whether it's business or to build, to build on something. He doesn't want to be friends unless we can make money together. Exactly. More or less. Right. Yeah. I don't know if it's funny. Cause if we start talking about putting together a white label brand of, um, a bourbon one time and I'm like, yeah, cause I've worked in wine and spirits for a while now. And so I thought that was interesting, but we also have like, you know, personally we're good friends. We have, I have, I host them up in Lake Tahoe in August and we go ride jet skis too. So like, we have lots of things that we like to do. Uh, my personal opinion, all of this is find something that, uh, like that you do that the rest of these guys also do. I, I, as I said, I used to work in a wine and spirits. Uh, I played golf, uh, pretty much all my time, all the time I was in Orlando, Florida, when I was, while I was working and living in Orlando, Florida. And I got better at it because that's all these guys wanted to do. So the only time you were building business relationships and networking is when you were on the golf course and you were talking. And so you're there and you're doing something, but you're also communicating and networking as a result of sort of this, uh, uh, you know, shared interest or hobby or, or sport or whatever it is that you do. Um, my, the best advice I've ever, you know, I think I've ever taken or I've ever given as well as find things that other guys do, but also use that as sort of like the, uh, the environment or the context in which you can actually talk to other guys and then, uh, and then see who you can work with and who you can't work with. And then that also maintains the relationship. So it doesn't, I said, it doesn't have to be like golf. It could be there. You meet these guys at the gym, right? That's like I have workout partners. So I have, I have actually done, done business with guys who I met at the gym who ended up being my workout partners. So I know I'm seeing them there at a particular time of day. We're working out, we have a mutual interest and then we're also having conversations as we're doing things. So, um, my, my, my, my biggest, like I have these guys who say like, I want to roll a, we really want to make this, um, this, uh, uh, rational male book group. And we want to, we want to sit down and we want to read the book and we want to have questions. I'm like, that's great. Please do that. But don't just do that. Like go fishing and talk about the rational male, go to the gym and talk about the rational male, go and like fix a car or something like have something that's going on right there, because men tend to communicate better when they're doing something. And that's also translates into networking as well. So find something that you're doing that you can do on a regular basis. Here's what we do. Um, number one, if you have engaging social media, you're able to maintain relationships with thousands and thousands of people, very, uh, inactively. It's one of the things, uh, uh, bull bulls, Aaron talks about this in the setup. He's like, social media is a way of showing high status without looking like you're try hard because people, because you're passively showing my status. Okay. If I post a mean, there's a bunch of people that I usually network with on a regular basis. And they're there. I'm just at top of I'm top of mind because they saw a funny meme that I posted also. So that's one of the things is having engaging social media is a way to maintain relationships. Whenever I see people I haven't seen in a long time, first thing they say is, dude, I love your podcast, dude. I love. Okay. So you see how I'm maintaining a relationship with someone that I don't, I don't send them text messages. I'm not sending them fucking chocolate covered apples every fucking month or whatever. You know, I see all these send them notes or what Patrick bed, David said is he sent it up a box with one shoe in it, right? These are all great ideas, but in order to keep contact with thousands of people, the most scalable thing you can do for free is YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Snapchat. Okay. That's the first thing. Second thing I'll tell you is that these events that I throw. So for instance, if I have somebody who wants to hang out with me, I get these questions all the time this week, or there's so many people here for CES. And there's so many people here for ABN and they're like, Hey, Michael, just want a minute of your time. Let's go have coffee. Like I don't have 500 clients, right? There's there's right now while we're doing this, there's 700 people watching us on YouTube and there's a hundred people. There's 90 people in this fucking chat room and I'm just supposed to pick up and just go have coffee with you. It's ridiculous, but I can hang out with you at Babes and Ballers where we raise money for, uh, for troubled youth. I can do it then. So we throw events and at those events, those charity events, then you would invite all of these, these high status individuals where you're raising money for autism. You're raising money for domestic abuse. You're raising money for human trafficking. You're raising money for, uh, animal rescue. You're raising money for troops overseas, and you're raising money for homeless children. That's what I would do. Does that make sense? So social media is scalable. Charity events are scalable. There's an, everyone would have a great time at a charity event. If like, for instance, if there was somebody that Rollo didn't really like, and I wanted him to like settle, like bury the hatchet, I would do it at like a Christmas charity event. I would introduce Rollo to some like piece of piece of shit and be like, okay, now, cause they can't fight. Cause we're at a charity event, right? We're at a charity event. And maybe we take an unironic, funny picture at each other with them, choking each other, something like that. That's what I would do. Okay. So I find networking at charity events to be fantastic. And the third one, this is just for me. I like pageants. Obviously swimsuit USA is a massive networking event for the judges. There's 61 judges and swimsuit USA. The judges are every one of those judges is worth eight, eight figures. And all of the judges there, they, uh, they get to network with, with each other and build, they've built businesses and built ideas based on, on that type of networking. Okay. So that's for pageants. Now, most of you guys aren't going to run pageants, but that's, that's another way that I would, that I would maintain relationships with people. Sound good. Yeah. Sounds great. Charity events. That's the way to go for sure. Uh, one more thing. I did apply for the high ticket position, got prior experience. I'm in stage three, Miguel. If you're on this call, I'm trying to work, man, as soon as possible. I'll drop all my other offers. Hey, Hey, Somali, have you, have you finished the program? No, no. So this is my second free call, but I do want to take the program. Okay, cool. At some point. Yeah. That's a, that's the thing, but you will have an advantage if you take the program. That's just one of the things we like to hire with from within, but I love it. I love that you're excited about doing that. Um, the other thing I want to tell you is, um, yeah, just as far as networking is concerned, like when you think about how did I meet Rollo and Justin? So Andrew sent me, he connected me with Justin Waller. So I had Justin Waller be a judge at the beginning competition. And then with Rollo, when he came in town, he, I wanted him to be caught, hang out with me and be an efficient, if that's the proper word at my, at my, uh, at my birthday party, just in case, you know, somebody had to bail me out of jail. And then, and then, uh, Jason Hartman came to that as well. Right. And so did Miguel. So those are the kind of things I use these events as networking opportunities because networking is an evolutionary adaptation and that's what I teach in MOA. Yep. Thanks to you. Awesome. Beautiful, beautiful man. Let's go to Anton. What's your question? All right. So, um, you can hear me, right? Yep. Sure. Yeah. So I got a business question and a evolutionary psychology question. So with the, with respect to the business, I really look up to like you and Justin, you've built like, you know, very great businesses. And, um, you know, I'm trying to start an app development company. Um, I even got the name tattooed on my arm. Like I'm really, you know, really, that's my goal for 2023 to, you know, to get that started. So how would you go about like, um, finding clients, like what channels and what avenues would you use? Like, I'm thinking maybe like, I'll go somewhere like Facebook groups, like, uh, LinkedIn, I've actually found musicians on, um, you know, Facebook, uh, on different Facebook groups, but like where, what would be your approach to like getting, getting the business started and, uh, you know, finding people I could, you know, write apps for and write software with. So a couple of things that I need you to do. Number one, we have no fucking idea what your business is. Yeah. Right. There we go. So this is really important. Why this is really important. Why bring you guys on camera? Why make you fix your lighting? Why listen to the way that you speak is because you have two sentences to make me fully fucking understand what you understand. It sounds good. You get two sentences. You don't get five. All right. Two sentences really quick. You have 30 seconds with me on an elevator. I'm worth $400 million. Go. What do you do? Gotcha. I'm trying to start an app development business. How would you go about finding clients more time? I am for I'm worth $400 million. I am on an elevator with you, Anton, close your eyes. Imagine the scenario. You have 30 seconds to describe your business to me. I have $400 million and I am looking for things to invest in. You have two sentences, 30 seconds to explain to me your business. One, two, three, go. I write apps. Uh, what, you know, what can we build together? I guess that's the best I can do. So now this is the, so the first thing we we've discovered, cause this is why, this is why I love coming on these. The first thing we discovered is you did not describe what your business was when you asked us the first question. No, I'm sorry. You have nothing fucking approaching an elevator pitch. No elevator. You are batting zero right now. You are not even close to an elevator pitch. Okay. At men of action. What is men of action? Well, I try to teach networking, but it's an evidence based approach. using all evolutionary studies to teach men how to become better networkers. That's action. That was two sentences. That was 30 seconds. Do you see what I'm saying? Yeah, I see. I gotcha. Anton, if you can't, it doesn't fucking matter what I tell you as far as getting leads, it won't make any difference about is what I tell you as far as getting leads, because I don't understand your business. It has to make such clear sense to me. The other thing is your audience, no matter what you think, even smart people are becoming 12 year olds with ADD on TikTok. Everyone has this very, very short attention span. And because of that, you have to be very careful and you have to get it out there very quickly. If I were to explain to you what the rational male was, it would not take very long. I would be like, it's an explanation of intersexual dynamics using evolutionary studies. That's it. That's what the rational male really is. It's the truth when it comes to intersexual dynamics. Do you see how I can do that in two sentences? Yeah, I feel like there's no like, or um, or um, or like, there's just very, it's very different over the call versus in person. I'm used to like approaching people and talking over the call. It's different. And Tom, that's the third lesson that I want to teach you. Get used to this, your business for app development. Where do you think you're going to be having your meetings, buddy? Zoom. Yeah. On Zoom. That's right. So you need to have a Zoom studio, Zoom lighting, a Zoom microphone, Zoom headphones. You need to make this motherfucker perfect. You need to look like you're living in the matrix. Like Rolo does right now. Rolo looks like he's in Tron right now. You know what I'm saying? He's about to blow up your fucking motorcycle in Tron. That's where, that's where he is. Right. Do you see the difference? Okay. But we haven't even got to your question, but those are three things that you need to learn beforehand because I'm so the pitch bro, the sales pitch or the app pitch or the sponsorship deck. That is my specialty. That is the middle of the middle of my wheelhouse of the things that I teach in MOA. Does that make sense? Yeah, it makes sense. Sell me this pen. Yeah. You have five minutes go. Exactly. So Anton, I will tell you real quick, your, your, your, uh, the way people perceive you on social media, LinkedIn would probably be the most LinkedIn and Facebook would be more important for you than Instagram. Instagram would not be very important for you. Twitter probably next up to that. Okay. The way people perceive you on that is going to be more important than the meritocracy that you did the meritocracy that you believe that you live in. What I mean by that is if you were asking me to be an app developer and for me to invest in you, if I saw you as a talking head on CNN and MSNBC, anything from even Rachel, Matt, out a Tim pool to whoever the fuck, if I saw you as a subject matter expert on that, on your podcast or someone else's podcast, I'm way more likely to listen to you rather than sitting there and judging your code. Does that make sense? That sounds good. Yeah. I guess I need to work on, on that. It makes sense. But do you say it with me? Anton networking, networking is an evolutionary. It's an evolutionary adaptation adaptation. Okay. Networking is an evolutionary adaptation. Networking is not this side thing. It's not this thing we sort of do as humans now, part of survival. Okay. Makes sense. Yeah. And what people think of you matters way more than what you can actually do. There's a lot of people who look like they can fight. There's a lot of people who look like they're good with women. There's a lot of people who look like they're really smart and they really aren't. And they make a ton of money on social media because that's what matters. And so I'm going to ask you a question, right? There's a trick question. Everybody in MOA knows the answer to this one. Anton, you're throwing a party, ready? You're throwing a party. What's more important? What's more important, the photos and videos of the party or the party itself? What's more important? The photos and videos, obviously. Got it right. You're ready. You're ready, bro. You're ready for your fucking elevator pitch. Using that analogy, that's how this works. I have that evolutionary biology question also. So you talk about a lot how Disney shows us a fairy tale. I feel like the biggest lie is that they show us Prince Charming. That's what you need to be. But can you go into how actually as a man, you need to be competitive? Is there an evolutionary, like biological reason that like women are drawn to assholes? Because that's that's like what I've realized. And I'm sure like you've seen it, too. Rollo, you take this and then I'm going to let my producer. All right. All right. So I've had this a lot of time. OK, so are you familiar with a word called a term or a phenomenon called hyperstrophilia? I've heard hypergamy, but I haven't heard the hyperstrophilia is actually you'll find it in the in the diagnostic and statistical manual for psychology right now. And so what hyperstrophilia is, is it's a tendency for almost uniquely women to find convicted criminals sexually attractive to the point where they will. I don't I know how this is in California. Anyways, they will separate the prison guards in California, female prison guards in California from male the male population because they had so many incidences of female prison guards falling in love with convicted crime like rapists, killers, murderers and breaking them out of the there you go, breaking them out of prison. So here you go. Sexual interest in and attraction to those who commit crimes. In some cases, this may be directed towards people in prisons for various types of criminal activities. There you go. And that's from the Weish ass American Psychology Association. Now, primarily, this is women creating fan clubs for guys who are like, say, let's say Anders Breivik, if you know who that is, or Nicholas Cruz, or what's the guy from the Boston Marathon bomber? I can't remember the guys. The Night Stalker in Riverside. So those are the now the reason I gravitate towards that as an example first is because those are the most extreme examples. You can see that why is it that like, like, it's primarily hybristophiles are female. And they're looking for like guys who are like the bad boys to the point where it's like, I don't care if he's a criminal, that's hot to me, because he has the capacity for violence, he has the capacity to kill another individual. And in our evolutionary past, the highest form of demonstrating higher value is to kill your rival. And so there's a there's a part I bought this is there you go. There's a part I think of women's missionary firmware that finds a guy who has the capacity for violence. I'm not saying he has to actually have gone out and killed somebody, okay. But you'll hear some, you'll hear even people who I generally disagree with on time to time, like say, Jordan Peterson will tell you that it's important for you to be a dangerous man, it's important for you to actually have the capacity for violence, and then sort of use it judiciously, I guess. But the point being is that every man should be able to defend himself, every man should be able to have a capacity for violence. And that's also something that up until recently, I think, has been part of sort of the evolutionary code for for human males for a very long time. Our propensity for aggression is not something that we learned, it's something that is innate to us, it's part of our evolutionary firmware. Women respond to that because they are looking for primarily when in a long term mate, they're looking for protection, provisioning and parental investment. And when things were a little bit more balanced, a guy who was muscular, a guy who could demonstrably have be violent with other people, with other men could prove that he was also a good protector against say, the woolly mammoths and the saber tooth tigers as well as an invading tribe. So there's always going to be a muscularity is always going to be selected for a capacity for violence is always going to be selected for attraction cue or attraction trait, simply because it implies security. Can this guy protect me? Can this guy protect my children? Can this guy protect other people who are part of our tribe as well? And how invested is he in that? It's one thing to be sort of like the berserker psychotic guy, it's another thing to be able to have that and to use it in measured doses, so that when the time arrives that that guy will actually be somebody who can confidently kick ass when he needs to. That's where the, I guess, the germ of the idea comes from. That's where the, you know, when we say, oh, chicks dig jerks. No, they dig jerks, because there's a there's an evolutionary reason for those guys for the for women to want to get with those guys in the first place, taken to its its most illogical extreme, it becomes high bristophilia at that time. So it's, it's really a protection instinct. And by the way, it's selected for. So when we look at like traits like jealousy for for men, men are moved to anger and violence when it comes to jealousy and mate guarding. So that's that that that links in perfectly with the idea that women are looking for a guy who has capacity for violence. They want a dangerous man not to kill them or beat them up, but to beat anybody else up that might actually want to have to harm them as well. Because we used to live in very chaotic uncertain times. And that was a at least a cue for long term security for women. I agree that that's awesome. I feel like going through hardship is also part of it. Like and I've actually fought for my life. So I agree completely. That's awesome. Hold on. Let's ask Professor Kylie. Kylie, what do you think about this? Okay, women, like guys like that. I just I think that I mean, women don't want like a puppy dog guy that's just gonna like follow around and listen to everything that she tells him because it's not attractive to any female like no female finds that attractive. So yeah, like what Rolo said about like, it's like a protective like I mean, it's a mindset like women get into like this guy's gonna protect me like if he cares about me enough, he's gonna make sure I'm okay. My family's okay. So it's kind of one of those things as well. It just makes it more attractive. It's awesome. Yeah. Let's go fuck serial killers, man. Let's go do it. Yeah, you guys are my heroes. Thank you for, you know, clarifying that. That's awesome. Thank you. Sure. Hope it helped. Let's go to the next question. Mark, what's your question, brother? Mark Munier. Like, usually, like usually caught me in the middle of eating. What are you eating? If you sure it looks like we caught you in the middle of sex. Are you sure? You want to you want to just sit in there fucking on the side? You sure? Go ahead, Mark. What's your question? If you dated somebody famous in the past, can you use that to boost your status for dating other people? Or does it look creepy? Say it again. Famous. Somebody famous in the past. Could you use that to boost your status for dating other women? Yeah. So if we weren't on YouTube, I would give you specific examples. So if you guys who watched the Carlotta Champagne episode that just came out last week, she talks about a certain rock star that was trying to dance with her on the dance floor at the Playboy Mansion. And this guy was, you know, he was he's just out of touch. There's a bunch of guys who come to some of my events that were famous back in the 80s and 90s. And they just expect you to one know who they are. Girls don't. A lot of these guys have blown all their money. They're not wealthy at all. And then they just expect people to like them. And you will find so occasionally, like a 41, 40 year, 41, 40 year, two year old girl who starts going after, I'll just say it like, you know, Corey Feldman, who comes to a bunch of my events, or someone like that. Or I love this. I love the Paulie Shore is the same. Another other example, where Paulie is, by the way, Paulie still, you know, he's still relevant, like he still goes out does stand up comedy. But there's a lot of times where, you know, and I'm not talking about them specifically, a lot of guys will go out and be like, because I was the drummer for this 80s band, then therefore, you're gonna let me into every club for from this point forever. And like a lot of people know now that's just not the case. Like, do you understand how famous Jenna Marbles was now? I bet you have Jenna Marbles went out and fucking Los Angeles, hardly anyone would recognize her. It's just like you're famous for a little while, then you're not famous anymore. So it's I don't know, it's weird, Mark, I think it could help but not with a younger girl, a girl who's like, if I were to ask, like, like, I'll give you an example. Kylie did not know who Pamela Anderson was. She doesn't know one more time. Watch. Does not know who Pamela Anderson is. Okay, so Mark, that's the thing, right? So I think to a certain extent, it probably wouldn't matter that much. I wouldn't. I think it's a fight. I don't think it's the flex that you think it is. That's another thing is I, I have, and I know people will give me shit for this. But like, I've always been against guys saying like what their notch count is to their girlfriend, like when they're asked like, like, how many girls which rule is that guys, which rule is that an MOA keep going? Yeah, anyways, it's, it's iron rule number two, I believe, or two, two or four. I can't remember which one. Anyways, the the reason why I say that is because a lot of guys say, well, you know, if I have more if I have been sexually select, successful in the past, and I can broadcast that or I can telegraph that to a girl, then she'll think that I that they're trying to what they're trying to do is generate social proof. They're trying to generate pre selection by saying I've fucked 40 women, right? 40 women have approved of me so much so that they would have had sex with me. And I think that in some ways, it kind of is an insult to the woman in the first place. Because the woman wants to figure you out. She wants to figure out if you can fuck she wants to figure out if you're actually a high value guy. And you don't buy you going and just broadcasting that it sounds really try harder. It sounds in some ways it might be creepy, but it sounds like try hard for sure. But you what the reason why it sounds that way is because you're trying to generate social proof and pre selection that needs to be generated from a third party from somebody that's outside. So if you're if you're strolling, if you're rolling into the club, like, like Mike does, if you got like three girls around you, you don't have to say, hey, I've fucked 40 girls, you got it's right there. It's self evidence. So it's like demonstrate do not explicate. And that's a primary thing that I talked about in my books is if you feel like you have to sell yourself or tell your say, hey, I'm, I'm a rich guy, I'm a king, I'm a whatever it is, if you have to tell people that and they can't figure that out, just by seeing who you are, and how you hold yourself and what your presence is, and like what your conversation style is, and who you are, you know, personality, professionally, whatever else, if they can't figure that out, you telling them is going to sound like you're trying to that we call people try hard, because what they're trying hard to do is create pre selection. And that's another thing. So if this is kind of like, to me, anyways, like if you're, if you want to say, hey, I dated Pamela. Anderson, my wife, Morgan Fairchild. I used to hang out with her. I used to be famous. I used to rub elbows with famous people. That sounds like you're trying to generate social proof. And that is something women are trying to figure out. Is this guy really who he says he is or he isn't? Why would he need to tell me that if he was really that way? I would be able to figure it out on my own. So it's a form of trying to generate your own social proof. And that always comes off as try hard or creepy. The other thing I was going to say is it's the other way around with this particular person. I'm going to give away who it is without saying their name. When I knew them, they were a stylist for Rockstar. Now they are on the cast of SNL this season. Hmm. So you nailed one of the chicks on the show? Somebody who's on it now wasn't done. This was back in 2010 when I knew them. Ah, okay. Okay. So it was a while back. So you're talking a decade ago. Yeah. All right. So yeah, that's not a flex anymore. Trust me. And then almost none of it's a flex. The only thing that matters is how everyone feels right now at this moment. Nothing else matters. It doesn't matter how cool, if you won a Superbowl in 83, it doesn't matter if you were in the Lost Boys. All that matters is how do people feel about you at this moment? Make sense? Right. Do you understand? For those of you who are over the age of 40 right now, Andrew Tate is more famous than Joe Montana. True. What? The thought of that is fucking mind-blowing to the 13-year-old Michael Sartain. Andrew Tate's more famous than Joe Montana. You want to know something even funnier? She has no idea who Joe Montana is. No clue. She didn't even know who I was until half an hour ago. Exactly. Okay. That's funny. But I'll bet you this. I'll bet you that Kylie knows a lot of people who have blue check marks. Kylie, do you have a blue check mark? Does she have a blue check mark? No, no. Kylie isn't really on social media. Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. She's a special. She's a unicorn. It's funny. It's like when I was on Fresh and Fit, Fresh was trying to get me a blue check mark. I'm like, do I need one? Was he trying to tell you how he was going to do it? Yeah. Purchase it. That's pretty much how a lot of people do. Because I just turned 200,000 subs on my YouTube channel yesterday, which was great. Yeah. And, and then I've got, what am I at right now? I'm at 70,000 followers on Instagram. And I'm over what I'm 120,000 on Twitter. I have no blue check marks on any. That's like, do I need them? But apparently you do. I was, I was, I didn't realize just how big a deal like having a blue check mark was for some people is to some people. It definitely is. Some people definitely is. One other thing, guys, just from this point forward, you are, you guys are going to all follow Kylie on, um, on Instagram or you're kicked out of MOA. Just real quick. You're going to follow her or you are going to follow Kylie or you're kicked out of men of action. Okay. Just want to let you know, it's a requirement to join. You're going to follow her. You're done. You're done. Also, she only has 700 followers. So Kylie's really not that big on social media. Yup. Yup. That's it. This is, this is the thing. Otherwise, realize, man, I feel like I should do a plug for Torsha now. Yeah, you definitely should do it. Let's do one for Torsha too. Torsha, Torsha should have way more followers than she does. Um, I helped her get, I helped her get off of Tik TOK and onto YouTube. So she's doing good. I'm getting to the, I'm getting to the point where I think she's like probably outgrown me, but she's doing well. You guys should definitely, you guys should definitely have more people go. Let's go back up again. Fucking eight, 27,000. That's not too bad. Not too bad. Very nice. Very nice. Okay, guys. Very cool. Let's get to the next question here. Let's go to Gabriel. Gabriel, what's your question? Shoot. Hello. First off, Gabriel, we got to do something about your IGN. That's not, we can't really do anything with that. All right, scrotum. Beat Sheldon Latin. It's just an old gamer tag. I'll, I'll change it after this. Yeah. All right. I'll do a quick elevator pitch real quick. I'm Gabriel, 20 years old. I'm trying to create a new convention in Florida, trying to get roll of Tomasi on that. Yeah. If you know my history of conventions in Florida, that's going to be a real hard sell. I'm willing to listen. Go ahead. No, that was just a joke. All good. My question was, is when doing stuff for like research and stuff, cause I was trying to find data on like paternity fraud and stuff like that, like peer research, I'm having a hard time finding data on that. Is there other sources I can look for? Do you mean paternity fraud in the sense like cuckoldry, like deliberate, like proactive cuckoldry? Yes. Okay. That's going to be really difficult for you to find. And I think the reason why you're having a trouble finding it on, on peer research, it's not something they really want to publicize. I think even if they have done the research themselves, you might be able to find I think you have to get creative with stats like that. Look state by state. That's the first thing. Whenever I do a show on like say abortion, it is like impossible to find accurate abortion. Like were the reasons for why women have abortions, right? Unless you go state by state. So, because in some states they don't even collect that data. Florida is one of those. So I look at Florida as my first kind of go-to place. So it might behoove you to go and look and see if there's state data, as opposed to like peer research, look for, look in other, other places. Pew's okay. There is a, here, I'll give you, here's the best thing you can do. Go to, there's a site called Statista, Statista, I think is what it's called. And I think it's S-T-A-S-T-I-S-A. I believe it's a, it's a pay site. You will have to pay by monthly kind of thing, but it will, it's an aggregate of like research and studies. And so like, if you're in like doing research papers for school or something like that, it's, it's fantastic. If you're one of these people who has to write like blogs or has to write articles, and you're looking for particular statistics, if they exist, Statista will have it. Okay. All right. Thank you. And then, Oh, let me say this real quick, as far as the cuckoldry thing. So there are, there are some studies that are out there, but one of the problems with the studies is they're using, they're using profiles from people who contact genetic testing services. The likelihood of you suspecting that your partner is cheating on you, if you suspect your partner is cheating on you, the likelihood of you contacting one of these genetic testing services is higher. So the population that they're serving is sort of skewed in the relation of being cuckolded. Does that make sense? Every man who thinks he's being cuckolded is going to go to these genetic testing services. So when the numbers come out, let's say like 20% of men are being cuckolded. Well, no, these are 20% of men who suspect that they're being cuckolded. And so they go to a genetic testing service. What are you, what do you need the information for in particular? I just got bored and like writing stuff down. Just make sure I get good grab, good grasp of their praxeology and stuff like that. Go check out Statista then. I thought maybe you had some research papers. Oh no, it's just, I like to keep track of knowledge and stuff like that. Statista will have what you're looking for. Okay. Thank you. Beautiful. Justin, what's your question? Hey guys, thanks for taking my call. So the last six months I've been creating sales funnels for course creators and coaches, been very active in Facebook groups and building a personal brand. But something I'm struggling with is really finding those good qualified leads. So those people that have successful businesses that would need these kinds of services, even though I've been engaging a lot on Facebook, what would you recommend to do to find more of these people? Rollo, do you have anything? So my, I would say develop an email list is what, does that apply to what you're doing? I mean, do you have a giant email list? I know that like, if you're, if you're talking about like funnel marketing, you want to get into something where it's like, you're trying to develop leads. I know that a really strong email list is, is key. The other thing is, is I hate to say it, but harvesting other people's email lists as well, so that you've got those leads to see what you, what it is that you want to get with. Also remember that there are certain leads are going to be more, let's say valuable to you or fruitful to you, I guess, than other ones. So if you've got somebody who's like sort of the big fish, those big fish tend to have other little fish that follow along with them that might also want to be a part of like, whatever it is that you're selling to them. So my, my, for your particular, your particular, I guess, business or whatever it is you're doing, I would say like a really strong email list. If I, that would be the first thing I would think of. All right, Justin. So it's going to be all of them. If you want me to get specific, the guy who taught us how to find a lot of leads is Cole Gordon. Okay. Cole Gordon does 30 million a year in, in sales with his sales team that he teaches other people. He, he, he is a sales trainer. He takes home a million a month from his business. Like that's, I took, I went out with him the other day for his birthday. The guy's insanely good at what he does. He's given us and my sales team, incredible, incredible ideas on how to up our productivity. Now you want leads specifically. So I'll tell you where we get ours from. The number one thing is the organic brand that I built, but my, my brand is built differently than other coaches in my arena. Do you know why, Justin, do you see why my brand is different? Well, there's a lot of different ways I could answer that, but what's the reason my brand is different because I rarely talk about it and I only show you. Yeah. Yeah. Demonstrate. I only, I only demonstrate in my, in my, with my brand about what I do. I do not talk about, Oh, I do not talk about it in my organic copy. I only show you what I do. I do not talk about it. Does that make sense? Yeah, it makes sense. Okay. So that's the first thing. That is the first moat that I created. That's a little bit different, right? The second thing is, um, the testimonials were like probably the greatest thing to generate leads for me. I tell people to be skeptical. And when they're skeptical, one of the problems is just in a lot of guys that go do sales, they're doing sales for things that they don't believe in my sales guys. I love it when they come from inside my program because they're animals. They want to sell the program because the program helped them so much. Right? So one thing that I do, and I'll tell you, a lot of businesses would not feel comfortable doing this, right? A certain guy that is in a lawsuit. Well, I'm not going to say what his name is, but he would not want you to, he would not want testimonials after you finish this product. For me, I put a bunch of Instagram testimonials and I copy and paste them and I send them to everybody. These are Instagram testimonials also on MOA mentoring. You're going to find 50 testimonials on that. So, so it's irrefutable and it's unassailable. You still with me? Yeah. Got it. That that's the brand I built. And then when it comes to the, uh, the other stuff I you'll notice with my copy on, on, um, my, so my, my Facebook ad gets about 26 to one ROI. When you count Facebook, it's a little different on YouTube. It's about 20 to one on YouTube. It gets massive ROI. The reason why, again, because I show, I don't talk about it. Number two, you'll notice I don't ever touch any of the girls in any of the videos. They just touch me. That's something I told them. And the word dating is nowhere in my copy because I don't want a fucking Facebook coming after my dick. So that's their, their specific strategies when it comes to that. Okay. Listen, what exactly do you do? Like what's the, what's your area of expertise? I mean, I got a general idea, but what exactly are, do you do? So my business is I build a high converting sales funnels for course creators and coaches. So anyone looking to sell their coaching programs or any sort of info product. So you just, so are you like, are you like an advertiser for them or do you actually help them do like the video and the, he builds funnels. I build the pages of the funnels themselves, help write the emails, write the copy and do the design. Got it. Got it. Got it. Okay. I was, I was wondering like, what's a, because there's so much that goes along with that. I was like, unsure, like what you were talking about as far as like the, the, the direction of what your business happened. So Grant made this for me, Rollo, he, he makes this for other people. These kinds of these, sorry, it's loading slowly. So here's my opt-in, but also on my page. Again, I show you, I don't fucking talk about it. I show you, this is one of the things that made this process so different for me is that I show you. And so that was one of the things, Justin, the thing you have to understand is like, when you first probably got involved in this, as of now, this market is flooded with scam artists and hacks. Okay. That cannot produce anything like what they say they can. So all I do is show that for my marketing is basically showing I'm not a hack. That's it. That's all my marketing is. I'm not trying to impress you with anything I'm doing. There's, it's just receipts. That's the reason why my, our, our funnel does so insanely well. And if you want to take a look at what you know, our offer was written by Nick Cosman. And then our, our sales funnel was, was created by a guy named Grant Jordan. He's one of my partners. And then our sales team was trained by Cole Gordon. That's essentially what we did. But as far as it's getting leads, the other thing I did is showing subject matter expertise. I probably made several, you know, tens of thousands of dollars when Andrew Tate reposted me one time, several tens of thousands of dollars when I went on Fresh and Fit, several tens of thousands of dollars when I had Rollo Tomasi because of subject matter expertise. Do you understand? Yeah, I got it. I got a lot, I got a lot of leads from YouTube. There you go. We got to get those residuals. I'm going to talk to the MOA guys right now. We got to get those residuals to you. And then and then the other thing is on Instagram, taking the content, showing subject matter expertise, taking that content and then cutting that content up into 90 second digestible bits that other people can watch. Got it? Got it. That's the easiest way I've seen to generate leads now without spending a bunch of money. And then if you do need to spend a bunch of money, then I think the best way to do that is for some reason, it is not letting me go to my page. If you do want to spend money, then the thing is to find an ad that is going to get you just a massive ROI and just feed into it. Basically, here in my garage, add that Tai Lopez did. But just like really clickable, very, very clickable type of social media content that people will find shareable. This is another thing that helps. And then you'll see up at the top. It says, want to network desirable women, high-status men, link in bio. That's where we get a ton of, this is still where I get most of my leads still from this. Makes sense. Cool. Yeah. And I'm sure it would help to incorporate some attractive women into my posts as well. Sure. We're sure. But it's not even attractive women. How about I sell whatever and I have a Lamborghini or I have a yacht. Like, seriously, there's a bunch of guys who do this without using attractive women. 100%. A ton of ways to do this. We got a ton of ways to do it. Look at Bradley. If you want to see him do this without attractive women. Okay. Look at Cody Sanchez. Cody Sanchez is a great example. So female, she's married. She doesn't, there's no attractive women in her shit. How about Alex Hermosi? It's a great example, right? Those are, those are the ways to do it. Here's what happens. It depends on your market too. I mean, if you're selling farm equipment, I mean, you want to see what you're buying, right? And so it's. So here's the, here's the other thing, Justin, is don't do what other coaches do and make a coaching profile. Those are fucking boring. Yeah. Yeah. You know, I was going to say is like, one of the things that kind of turns me like, well, I've, whenever somebody says, Hey, you need to check out this guy's page. Hey, you need to check out this new guy. Hey, there's this new guy who's like doing these classes or whatever. Whenever I go and I check out like their their landing page, or I go and I check out what it is that their, you know, their program is, if it looks like a template, especially if it looks like a Joomla template, or it looks like something that's like they picked up where they just, you know, insert your data here. And now you'll have a thing. If it looks like it's been prepackaged, I get real turned off to that, because that to me says the guys is trying to actually, you know, produce something that is just a hustle. It's just a it's formulaic, I guess. When I like, for instance, I'm right now in the process of doing video for a set of, I guess, can't say teachable, like a masterclass kind of videos right now that are based on my fifth book, the player's handbook, I could very easily sit here in the studio and do what I need to do. But I'm not going to do that, because I want something that's a little more polished, I want something that's a little bit, it's going to stand out from guys who have those template kind of things. And maybe looking at say, how can I do this a little bit differently? How can I, how can I make this not look like the standard sort of template, a template, a templatized, I guess, you know, funnel marketing thing. Especially when you're looking for guys who are like higher end, who are really about it, as opposed to just saying, Hey, this is my new hustle. I got out of this office gig. And now I got I want to turn my side hustle into my main hustle. Okay, so Michael, go ahead. Yeah, I just wanted to say, because you mentioned a coaching profile, and not to do that, what are some of the components that would make up a coaching profile that so the standard, the standard coaching profile has over 100,000 followers, where clearly you don't deserve any, you've been posting fucking still photographs that show a Gantt chart, or some kind of fucking matrix of how your program works. And clearly, no one looked at it or liked it, because you don't understand Instagram. When you posted it, it got like two likes, but somehow you have 200,000 followers and a blue checkmark. I wonder how the fuck that happened. Just looks terrible, just looks fucking terrible. Whenever I see that. It's the guy who clearly got a guy the other day, try to come on my podcast. And he has 700,000 followers, he does not have a blue checkmark. And I go look at every one of his posts, and it has 10,000 likes. And then I go look and see who liked the post. And I have no common people that like his posts. I go look at his followers, no common followers, his followers all speak Farsi or fucking Portuguese, right? Or they're from India. And and then I go, I go on his YouTube channel, and his YouTube videos get 16 views. That's fake, Justin, that's fake as fuck. There's there's so many coaches are doing this. There's so many simple tells you go to this so many, you can go on fucking social blade and I can see the day you bought your followers. Don't do that. Just don't do that. Okay, Justin, I know it's got like, if you have like half a million subs on YouTube, and your your videos are not are not good getting above like 8000 views or 14,000 views, you should be getting like in seriously in the hundreds of 1000s of views for that kind of sub count. So when I see somebody who's got a million subs and all of their, their videos are only doing like, say, under 10,000 views, I realized that they're they're purchasing, they think that subs equal high quality or like the impressiveness. And if you know anything about YouTube, you'll know that that, well, first of all, subs are vanity metric. You've also got comments and likes, like the video, that's just that has nothing to do with the impressions. It has nothing to do with actually pushing you up in the algorithm. The only thing that matters in the algorithm for YouTube is impressions and click through rate and really audience retention, depending on how what the video is. But those are the two main metrics that that you that people should be focusing on. But to tell us if you want to see if somebody's a hack or not, it's usually they, they overemphasize, I've got a million subs, that doesn't mean shit to me, because I've seen shows like Fresh and Fit be way they've been under a million subs just up until about December here. But they are the they I've seen them make the top 10 most super chatted shows on planet fucking earth. So they're making money hand over fist with under a million subs. So like subs don't make all that big, it don't mean that much to me as far as like conversion. But it does tell me when people overemphasize certain things like subscriptions on on YouTube, that they think that you should find that important, or that makes them a better show, because they've got 5 million subs, that's how much you what's what's the revenue you're generating off that show means nothing to me unless your actual views match what your actual subscriptions are. Yeah, Justin, the organic function of it is just so important. It's not a meritocracy and trying to buy your following. I think it worked. Obviously, I don't know if you know this clever investor, I think that's his name. I can't remember what the guy's name is. He, he admits to buying his followers, and it worked for him. And I think it would have were I think, dude, before 2017, if you bought a bunch of followers and got a blue checkmark, good for you. Yeah, good for you. Because it worked. It definitely worked got buying a blue checkmark right now is really a bad idea. The people they're coming after people and they're taking those things back and getting rid of accounts. I really would not I would recognize I would not do that. Got it. In fact, if I really hated someone, Justin, you know what I would do? I would go on one of these websites, and I would buy them a million fake followers. Then they'd have 100 likes a post with a million followers. That's what I would do to just make what a great idea that is. That's what I if I really hated someone, that's what I would do. I would just fucking destroy their fucking platform by doing that. Right. So that's what that's what a lot of guys are doing. So that's what I would tell you, Justin, just don't look fake. If you want to see some great examples, just go through. You're welcome to just go through my funnel and see some of the stuff I can't. The only thing that breaks in my funnel is I don't have enough salespeople. Other than that, the funnel is been incredible. And Justin is because we steal and copy and steal and steal and steal and steal and steal and copy and steal. And we have this much ego. Learn to use AI. Learn to use chat. That's all the rage. Let me tell you something, man. Get on that now. Get in. Be an early adopter for AI because it will help you. It will help you grow inward. I mean, everybody's going to get into it. It's going to be saturated. But if you get in now at the bottom bottom floor, you start understanding this shit and you understand how it applies to what it is that you do. And if you can, as much as you can automate, man, automate, automate, automate. Beautiful. Hey, so I just did something real quick in the chat. Somebody was saying that we're all scams. So here's what we're going to do. It's fine if you guys want to call us all scams, but I put the link right here in the chat. So what you guys are going to have to do is you're going to click the link and then you're going to tell us why we're scams. I'd love this because you don't have to turn on your camera. You can make your Zoom name, whatever you want to call it. You can put a little picture of a fucking deer or a piece of poop or whatever you need your avatar to be. You can jump onto Zoom and then explain to us like, no, no, this guy's a scam. So some guy named Scott Mooring, jump on here, man. Click the link. Don't talk about it. Be about it. If we're scams, I love it, dude. I love the skepticism. But stand behind your words. Be a man. Be a man. Stand behind your words. Jump on here. Click the link and then talk to us about it. Explain to us why we're a scam. And then I'll go step-by-step and explain to you how nothing either Rolo or I said is even a slight fucking exaggeration. Okay? Not even a slight exaggeration. Awesome, Justin. Thank you for your question. Henry, what's your question? Henry. Hey, guys. I can't speak very loud because I'm in France right now. So it's nighttime. I think my question is more for Michael and Rolo or Kylie. But I might be wrong. Michael, I saw you talk about breaking value in one of your videos. So I was wondering what it was and how can you use it? Are you talking about breaking rapport? Oh, yeah. Breaking rapport. Rapport. Okay. So breaking rapport is my term. It doesn't mean... So if you listen to Jordan Belfort, it's a different... When he says breaking rapport, he thinks it's a bad thing. When I say breaking rapport, I think it's a good thing. So for instance, with Rolo, several people had wanted to do interviews with him. So what did I do? I read all of his books. I read every single book on evolutionary psychology. And when I did an interview with him, I had 80 questions. And I probably did the most thorough interview anyone had ever done. That's a breaking rapport. Four hours long, too. Four hours long. Four hours and eight minutes. That's called breaking rapport, Henry. Does that make sense? Okay. You walk outside of a club. Okay. You're talking to this girl. She's stunning. She's so beautiful. And she's sitting there talking to you, and she's kind of blowing you off. And then while you're doing this, Heidi Klum comes up and kisses you on the cheek. And she's like, oh, Henry, I love you. It's so fucking good to see you. And you're like, thank you. And then your fucking Bugatti pulls up. Then all of a sudden, the girl who was ignoring you, all of a sudden, the girl who was ignoring you, her view of the matrix has changed. Her view, we're breaking what she believes is the status quo. Henry, you're just a normal looking guy. Normal looking guy comes up and talks to me. I'm a super hot woman. Therefore, he's low status. He's beta. Why did this super hot girl kiss him on the cheek? Oh my God. I follow her. Wait, a fucking Bugatti? Who the fuck is this guy? Watch her eyes get big. Her pulse will increase because you broke rapport. Whatever the status quo, whatever she believed what was going to happen, you changed what that is. So what's another great way to break rapport? Humor. What's another great way to break rapport? Pre-selection. What's another way to break rapport? You take your shirt off when you're at the beach and you're fucking ripped and she didn't expect it. These are all ways to break rapport. Does that make sense? You walk into a party. She has 4 million followers. You have 30,000 and everyone at the party knows you and doesn't even know who the fuck she is. That's a way you break rapport. Does that make sense, Henry? Yes. You walk up to Zouk inside of Resorts World or you walk to Omnia inside of Caesar's Palace. All the hosts know your name. They wave you in, charge you nothing, take you on stage to the VIP. You shake hands with Steve Aoki and then the owner of Tao Hakusan comes up and gives you a hug. She's like, who the fuck is this guy? And you don't have to be rich to do any of it. I can tell you firsthand. You don't have to be rich to do any of that shit. Can I give you a story? Let me tell you a story. Justin and Miguel were actually at this. It's a very good example of what you're talking about. Justin, myself, Miguel from Dollar Cost Crypto, my wife, my niece, Tom was there as well, and another couple of girls that were there as well. We were at the Chart House in Lake Tahoe. I'm sure you're familiar. It's a very high-end seafood steak restaurant kind of thing. And this is in Lake Tahoe. It's like up on the hill, you can see the lake and everything. We're just there and we have a nice table that's already been reserved for us. And we're just sitting there. We're just kind of shooting the shit. And so my wife's there. Everybody there at the table is pretty much familiar with me. My niece is just sort of like, you know, wondering what all this is all about, but she knows me and she's very familiar with me, right? Up comes a guy from one other table, comes up to our table and says, excuse me, are you Rolla Tomasi? And I'm like, yes. And he's like, I love your stuff. I love your work, blah, blah, blah. He comes up to the table. So up to that point, we're just having this very familiar, you know, almost like a family dinner where we're sitting down there and suddenly someone comes to the table and wants to get my autograph and wants to get like an Instagram shot with me and then realizes that Justin Waller's sitting there too. And then Miguel's there, so Justin got a picture or two. But when you have this sense of familiarity or you're with someone who has this sense of familiarity and then it's broken by this, like you were saying, breaking rapport. I would call that breaking familiarity, I guess, like the idea that you're comfortable and familiar with. Subverting expectations. Something from someone from the outside gives you preselection or gives you social proof and they weren't expecting that. Oh, you are kind of a big deal, right? Another story. And so my niece was like, she was like, you're kind of a big deal. Yeah, okay. I realized this is the first sort of incidence where this has happened. I wasn't expecting it to happen in Lake Tahoe. Also, I was at, I think it was, we're at the CME, we're at the convention, Donovan Sharpe's convention in Florida in May. And I've been working with Torsha for a very long time. Well, since August, the previous August. And so we're there, she knows me, I know her, we've been, you know, back and forth, Kevin Sabo and the Sabo brothers are there. We have this familiarity and this rapport between the two of us. I get to the CME and I am swamped by guys wanting to have, you know, and get a selfie with me or they want me to sign their books or whatever. And Torsha comes up to me afterwards, she goes, you're kind of famous. I'm like, Jesus Christ. And I hate, it was all I could do, Mike, it's all I could do to go, do you know who I am? Like, I didn't want to say that, but it's another one of those situations where you had that familiarity and it's broken because people come from the outside and they, they want to be associated with you. They want to have something to do with you because they know who you are, maybe from the internet or from what, and it's not just necessarily me. It could be like a rock star. It could be an actor or whatever else it is. It's that familiarity that is broken. And usually it's in the positive because it's got, there's somebody from the outside who breaks it for you. So you've got, you've got social proof where you got a preselection if it's, if it's the opposite sex and now they're breaking into that. And now somebody else thinks you're a big deal when the other person that you were with, who was familiar with you now can say, oh, you are, I'm with somebody who's a little bit higher value. The, the idea of like, I mean, social status at that point. Maybe when you're familiar with somebody, people want to think that they're like, even even with you until such until you get that third party dread is what I would call it, right? When somebody from the outside gives you that pre selection, and suddenly you're a big deal. Whenever I'm talking to guys who are married, and they say, Rollo, I can't get my wife to fuck me anymore. She's just not hot for me anymore. We have where I live in, I'm in a sexist marriage, yada, yada, yada. Generally, it's because all of the things that made that guy very, very attractive before they got married, are gone, because there's too much familiarity there. It's familiarity breeds contempt, right? So what I tell these guys, it says, but especially after you get married, or if you get into a long term relationship, the depending on what you do, and depending on who you are as a person, but for most guys is is insanely hard for them to generate any kind of social proof or to to have like a third party come and say, Oh, your husband's kind of hot, right? Well, I would do them. If you don't want them, I'll take them that kind of thing. It's that third party dread or that passive dread that is breaking that rapport as Mike was saying. So does that mean it's never something that you can do? It's like always something that's happening to you? I think it's if you do, if it's something that you I was told, like I was telling the other guy a minute ago, if it's something that you have to say, Hey, I fucked this really famous person over here. That sounds very try hard, because what it is, is you're trying to generate social proof and pre selection for yourself. I'm not saying that it's impossible to do that you can, but if you get caught, you're fucked. So it's sneaky fucker game is what it is. But if it's better when it's organic, and it's authentic, and it's genuine. Obviously, I know, I know guys who have the ability to run game to the point where they maybe they've got like a wingman or they got like, like, I forget what they're called, like an assistant that makes it seem like it's organic, but it's actually not organic. It's very easy to generate social proof. It's very easy to generate, especially in today's day and age on, you know, selfies and Instagram and everything else, you're only getting the highlight reel of what your life is all about. Obviously, it's all about perception. And as Mike says, who cares, you know, that's the that's how things work. He doesn't want to go and put the dog filter on his face. When he's doing, he's doing reels on Instagram, but he does it because it works. It's not because it's a, it's a, you know, authentic, you can, you can generate that. But again, if it seems like you're trying hard to do that, then it comes off as creepy. And then it comes off as disingenuous. Okay, so Henry, you can build these things, right? You can build a lifestyle to where these things are just shown. It's like you going up and bragging that your plastic surgeon versus her like on the way driving home seeing your billboard. Does that make sense? You can, there's a different way. It's really difficult. Not you specifically, I'm not talking about you, Henry, specifically, but your generation has a hard time between telling somebody and showing them. Your generation likes to tell. There's a lot of these rappers with fucking purple hair and face tattoos, talking shit, like they're going to shoot each other like they're hard, and then they start snitching to the cops as soon as they get in trouble. Because they like to talk, they like to tell, but they can't show. They're not actually tough guys, right? So that's, that's the thing you need to understand is the, when I say breaking rapport, you're showing you're not telling, but you can do that by being funny. You can do that by the places you go. You'd be surprised, Henry, you message a girl and you'd be like, Hey, I have a red carpet invite for the Maxim party. That's a breaking rapport. She doesn't expect that. You're just a normal dude. She doesn't expect that from you, right? That's what I mean by breaking rapport. Okay? A lot of times I'll have a girl, she'll come on my, on the red carpet and she's super formal. She's in a dress. She's like, Michael's going to ask me some tough question. And I'll look at her and be like, Hey, you're doing great. Awesome. How fucking drunk are you getting tonight? And she's like, what? That's a breaking report. Okay. I've seen that. Yeah. You understand that that's something that if you go, well, you want to see some breaks and report, go and watch my interviews that I do with all those girls. There's over 300 of them on my YouTube channel. Just go to the playlist titled interviews. And you can just see me breaking rapport literally for 10 to 50 hours. Okay. If you guys want to see examples of that with comedy. Okay. Hey, Henry, why is marriage so expensive? Um, because it's a symbol. I'm sorry. Why is divorce so expensive? Because it's worth it. All right, man. Take care. That's a breaking report. Got it. Awesome. There you go. Let's go to. Let's go to Eminem. What's going on, man? Well, first of all, Rolo, thank you very much. I know you've received this every day, but thank you very much for your work. It's really, I appreciate it. You changed my life. And also, Michael, thank you for the book of very important people. Yeah, I want, I want, I want Rolo to read that book. It's kind of like not quite in the wheelhouse. So very important people is written by a sociologist named Ashley mirrors. And by the way, the her, there is a very woke bent to the book, but her, her observations are 10 out of 10. Her. Yeah. But later on her perception of it or her interpretation, I would give a three out of 10. She's talking about there being white supremacy when half of the promoter she was working with were black. She's talking there about there being a patriarchy when women are getting flown to France for free drinking anything they wanted eating like a five star restaurant sleeping with celebrities and then coming back home, and then networking with people who got them jobs, but they're being exploited. Like it was, it was, there are examples of what she's talking about. She made very poor examples. I'm going to try to have Professor mirror or Professor mirrors on my podcast, but basically she was a model who went undercover for two years as basically a bottle wrap. Yeah, the other book. I was kind of seeing it that she was like emitting the feelings with the actual sociology or security. She's at Boston University is one of the most liberal universities in the country. She had to get her, her, her that that book is a manifestation of her doctoral thesis. She just had to make it woke ish in order for it to get published otherwise it wouldn't have got published. If her, if she had said at the very end, all this excess waste is an evolutionary adaptation for men to be able to, you know, so their wild oats and have sex with as many women as possible. And this is just a function of evolution, it would have never gotten published, she would have never gotten a PhD, but if she, but instead she writes, hey, all of this is a function of men being patriarchal and misogynistic, it gets published. She's now a bestselling, actually wasn't a bestselling author, but the book did terrible. And, and then she gets her PhD. Now it's getting better because of you. Yeah, no, it's getting better because of me. I, because, dude, the all the references to Rollo when you, I'm going to introduce you to Jason Strauss at some point, all the references to Jason Strauss in the book are fascinating. Jason Strauss has two, there are two Harvard business studies done on Jason Strauss. He is the... Actually Mirs, okay. I was just trying to figure out how to sell, I was looking it up. Yeah. Incredible documentation, not quite accurate interpretation, but I think it was one of the best books I've ever read. It's really good. I have like two business questions. It's more towards you, Michael, sorry Rollo, but it's more towards you, Michael. Since you mentioned on one of your podcasts that you were like a videographer for like an event or something like that, I just want to ask you, I am like a photographer slash videographer. And I just want to ask you like, how do you manage like your time and clients as like when they come a bunch at the same time? Like they want to ask you in the same week, in the same month, getting projects done and stuff like that. One more time, say the question one more time, the first part of it. So I am a videographer and also a photographer. And my question is like, when you get a bunch of clients on the same week, on the same month, and they're like just coming at you and saying, hey, I need this done by this day, or this other project done by this time limit. And I just want to ask you, how do you retain and also maintain those relationships as you progress through the project? So it would be the same. You could ask Rollo the same question too. You have too many engagements, too many things to do. Rollo building a studio in his house and me building a studio in my house is a way for me to say yes more often and for me to extend my boundaries on what it is that I'm capable of doing. The reality is you have to learn to say no. When I got to go film at the Playboy Mansion, I'm never going to say no to that. That was incredible. That's hard for me to do, by the way, to learn that. Yeah. So many fucking celebrities. Of course, I'm going to say yes to that. But it has gotten to the point where there's some club promoters that I've been friends with for 10 years, and they're like, hey, man, we're going to go do this thing. And I'm like, man, I got to make money. I have a responsibility to my partners. I have a responsibility to my employees. I have a responsibility to my clients. I can't just go to a party for nothing. You know what I'm saying? It's like some fuck-all's birthday. I can't do that. And so I have to learn to say no. Emanuel, that's the thing. So if you're at the point where you're in such demand that you have multiple bookings, you've got to raise your hand. No, right now. But I am doing so much strategizing and so many content that is in the back of my computer right now that I'm about to publish. And I just worry that I will get so many people that it's like... So the actual problem is, and I'm not saying you're neurotic, but the actual problem is a function of neurosis. Have you ever heard the guy who's like, I don't go to the gym because if I go to the gym, I'm going to get too big? Have you ever heard guys say stupid shit like that? Really, really stupid shit. This is not something you have to worry about, Pam. You're telling me that you're worried about being too successful. Stop. How about just become successful first, and then when you actually do have that happening, then hit me up. I had a guy the other day come on my show, and it just drove me crazy. No, it wasn't my show. It was on the Thursday call. He came on and he was telling me, hey man, what do I do when so-and-so starts complaining about me? I was like, has anyone complained about you? And he was like, no. And we're all just like, what the fuck are you talking about then? He goes, yeah, what if that happens? I'm like, bro, you have so many problems in your life. What's your bench press max? How much money are you making? What the fuck are you worried about this stupid shit for? What if the meteor hits tomorrow? Yeah, so this is not a problem. There is a correct answer. I'm not going to give it to you. You need to fucking get to that point first. It's just that I'm planning to do a certain video for TikTok, and since TikTok, the algorithm is so crazy, I just worry that too many people tend to DM me. Most of TikTok is fake. I mean, of course. TikTok means less than nothing to my business. I'll give you points, though. At least you're planning big. I'm going to be so fucking successful. I'm going to have so many people that are hitting me up. I need to solve this problem in advance. Yeah, it's just that I already did the whole banking stuff. You push until things break, and then you fix what was broken, and in the meantime, you have money. It's better to have these problems while you have money in the bank than to have these problems when you don't have money and you're sitting there. You understand what I'm saying? I don't hire a bunch of salespeople hoping that I have a bunch of sales, and then the salespeople have nothing to do. I hire salespeople when my current salespeople can't possibly maintain their pace. Understand? Okay, you're not there yet, so don't worry about this. This is not something worth wasting mental energy on. Keep that attitude, though. Thank you. I love that you think you're going to be successful. That's great. Just don't worry about this yet. Okay. Get there first, and then worry about problems. Got it. Also, the second question. Since I read the book, Very Important People, I just wanted to ask you, how can I get towards promoters helping them out with their girls? I don't know what you're saying. Model agencies. Model agencies. Yeah, yeah. So how can I, in a way, get to talk to a promoter first so I can get to the models as a guy that gives value as a photographer? Cool. Yeah, the answer to all these questions is going to be the same thing. It's the first question. Step one is fix your Instagram. Step two is build your list. Step three is find six events to take people to. Step four is find six girls to go with you to these events. Okay. Okay. This is a question I would like for you to ask some of the networking coaches in the Discord server. They will walk you through this whole thing. Okay. We even provide step-by-step invites on how to do this in MOA advanced. Okay. Got it? Yeah, but just join the Discord. It's all free. Just in the free side of the Discord server, ask anyone. There's 500 guys in there. Like, there's at least 40 club promoters. They'll all help you. All right. Got it? Yeah. Beautiful, man. Let's go to Ryan Ingram. Ryan, what's your question? Hello, everyone. Can you hear me? Yeah. What's going on? Okay. So, first of all, thank you for taking my question. And my question is, how are you able to give away your best strategies for success in business and relationships? This is a great question. Rolo, do you have some of this? Because Rolo, you do create competition for yourself. Yeah, constantly. Yeah. Thanks. I'm the research and development department. He's R&D for the red pill. The rest of us are just using his shit. Yeah. Yeah. You'll know you're successful when people accuse you of plagiarizing yourself. That's when you know you made it. It's a constant struggle. It's a constant battle for me because I've got a lot of irons in the fire right now. I mean, we're doing Access Vegas. That's one. I've just finished the outline for another book that I'm working on. I'm hoping to have that out by maybe the beginning of summer. I think it should be more easy to do than the last two. And so I've got a lot of like I got people who want to have me on their shows. People want to debate me. People want to throw shit at me. People who want to pick my brain so that they can use that to start their own podcast or they want to start their own red pill thing. And some are better than others. Let's just be honest. I had to at one point say, you know what, I know people are going to lift my material. I know people are going to use my work. And it's, you know, I got to start. taking it as sort of flattery. But also, I'm also creating my own competition. The problem with that is, is that you can't be in the public light, and you can't be in the public eye, especially today, you can't be on Instagram, you can't be a quote, unquote, influencer without somebody influencing someone to actually do the kind of stuff that you're doing as well. So there's a lot of people who want to imitate fresh and fit, for example, or they want to imitate my writing style, or they want to imitate, you know, they, they want to maybe, you know, quote, the same sources that Mike does, when we're talking about evolutionary psychology, that's free for them to do some do it better than others. But I have to also sort of take it with a grain of salt. And what it does, for me, anyways, is it motivates me to, to be better, like to get back to work to go and do something that's new and more. Most people are not innovators. They're fast followers. So they're very I work with innovators, Mike is an innovator. There's a few people that I could name, I can name names right now who I would consider idea guys. There are I don't know if you've ever maybe Mike, Mike, have you read this before? Have you read the the biography of Steve Jobs? Steve Jobs, the biography of Steve Jobs, Steve Jobs dated a bunch of supermodels. Yeah, same goddamn eight EC Miyake sweaters, every time he went up on stage, wouldn't acknowledge his goddamn daughter, kept driving around in Porsches. And then finally, when he was older, he met as a Syrian father who owned a goddamn restaurant and found out that both of his parents had fucking PhDs. And people want to tell me intelligence is not heritable. Yeah, okay. Well, that's okay, died of pancreatic cancer on my birthday. Right? Well, one of the things here at Grola, did you know this? You know, you know, Alan Turing is right? Yeah. You know, the whole idea that he that the reason there's a bite in the apple in the back of the Apple computers, Alan Turing committed suicide by putting cyanide in an apple and eating it. In 1955. He was found out to be a homosexual. He was a he was a professor at Oxford. And he was a socialist and an atheist. When all of this came out, he had lost his tenure and he committed suicide. And that's why there's an apple on the back of the computers. I had no idea. He here's the here's the one Steve Jobs says Alan Turing is his biggest idol. And when asked, is that the reason why there's a bite in the apple? He goes, that would be a cool story, wouldn't it? He did not say he was or was not true. Confirm or deny? Well, I so the reason I'm bringing that up is because I've I've, I found this to be true working in the liquor industry, for sure. But one of the one of the concepts that Steve Jobs brought up, he said, there's three kinds of guys, when it comes to business, there's three kinds of people, there are ideas, guys, there are salesmen, and there's the guys with the money, who are going to be able to bankroll and fund whatever your ideas are, and then you need the sales guys to sell the ideas, and you need the money to actually produce the stuff that the ideas guys come up with, so that the guys can sell it. And so it's sort of this, you know, this symbiotic relationship between those three types of guys, the companies and the, the brands, the businesses that work the best are when those people all know what they are, right? I'm an ideas guy, I'm in no way a sales guy, because if I was, I'd be a lot better paid than I am right now. But I produce books, I'm about the ideas I always have been even when I was working in the liquor, liquor industry, I was about the bottles, I was about the product. And I work with guys who are sales. The problem was in every single business I was a part of when that business imploded, it was because one of the sales guys thought they were going to be the ideas guy, or it was the guy with the money who says, No, I got a better idea than you. And those ideas never panned out, because they're not ideas, guys. They're the guys who are very good at the business. And they're very, very good at the back end. And then there's the guys who are the sales guys who don't give rats ass about whatever the fucking product is, whether it's good or it's not, their skill is in selling. So when you have those three guys lining up, and you've got this, this perfect kind of symbiotic relationship together, that's when you have really good successful businesses. The problem right now is I have to be the ideas guy, the sales guy and the guy with the money. So if I'm going to be a one man show, and I'm going to be an influencer kind of thing, then yeah, you have to remember that people who are salesmen are going to use your ideas, because they want to sell your ideas, they're not coming up with anything new, they're going to take your work, and they're going to repackage it. And they're going to, they're going to try to outsell you because they have better networking and got something else. But they're not really doing anything original, you come up with something that's a new idea. And you can move things forward world, they're still stuck trying to sell last year's model. So that's the way I kind of look at it right now. Chas, the book is called I believe jobs. And it's by William Isaacson. I believe that's who wrote it. Yeah, it's a it's really good. Um, I love that. That was great. It was a Walter Walser. And I actually read that book, like with like, the book book and still listen. Yeah. Ryan, does that make sense? Yeah, that makes sense. Thank you. It's tough. It's really it is. It's really tough. But I guess a couple of things, a couple of things before we go on, because we've been on here for two hours. So like, I definitely want to make sure you guys all you all need to make sure that you subscribe to the rational mail, get up to 300,000 subs, get them to 300. He got 200,000 subs yesterday.

Make sure you guys subscribe to rational mail clips. Make sure you do both of those things. As far as I'm concerned. For those of you who are not in mo a put a one in the chat if you are not in mo a you're not in men of action. There we go. Beautiful. I love it. All you guys, man. We'd love to meet all these new people that are not in mo a. Love it. Ryan. There we go. Got it. Beautiful. Awesome. Schedule. Beautiful. All right, guys, check out that link right there.

We have a bunch of videos for you to watch. And here's the other thing. If you are the slightest bit skeptical out of this, I will give you 2030 40 clients that you can talk to and you bring your skepticism to them. Tell them all the reasons why you know this is wrong. This is a scam. Nothing in mo a works. All the shit that he does is fake. That's fine. Do that. I'm fully I'm totally fine with you doing that. But just stand behind your words. Don't be a bitch. Let me say that one more time. I know we're gonna get deep platform YouTube. Don't be a bitch. Stand behind your words. If you want to call you want to say something I'm doing is scam. That's fine. Stand behind it. Click that link and then just join on here we go. Just joined a few days ago amount you learn is unreal. Yeah, man.

There's 116 modules in the program mo a and mo a advanced plus there are a bunch of networking coaches that will come help you in each one of the networking coaches specializes in a different field and they'll help you out with different stuff. Okay, awesome guys. Let's keep going. Nathaniel, what's your question? Thanks, Ryan. Hey, hello. Hey, Michael. Thank you. Thank you for everything. Amazing value today. I had a quick question. I think this might be relevant for both of you. I know you're really big on proof. What's your thoughts on creating a swipe file of stories that you could tactically deploy in like business scenarios, networking events that have like subtle displays of high value, like the prime directives, like willingness to emote, risk taker or protector of it's funny. Willingness to emote is literally who taught me the thing that you're asking me about. And, yes, I just wanted to know your thoughts on that. Swipe file go. Okay, here we go. So the answer is obviously unassailably unbelievably irrevocably. Absolutely. And totally. Yes, I use it for everything. If you guys look, if you look on my Instagram right now, you're going to see highlight packages that are up at the top of my IG. And I use those highlight packages for sales. I actually don't use most people don't go through my highlight packages. Those highlight packages are when somebody says, Hey, man, what was Babes in Toyland like, I just send them a link to the highlight packages on Babes in Toyland. And now there's 100 clips that show irrefutable visual evidence. It was the best party in Los Angeles. Does that make sense? Nathaniel? I also have. This is kind of petty. But back when, you know, back in the day of a girl like stood me up, I had a fucking folder on my phone called fire. And when a girl stood me up, all of a sudden, Michael's in Ibiza on a fucking yacht with 40 girls, what the fuck's going on? You know, I'm saying all of a sudden, when when we were supposed to be on our date, during that time, I'm posting on IG story, the most petty shit you could possibly imagine. So yes, 100%. I agree with doing that. For sure. Whenever that I would definitely I would definitely do that. Because that's one of the things you want to use in order. Again, you're again, it's not you specifically Nathaniel, but your generation likes to talk, they don't like to show, you're going to be different. One of the ways you guys stand out in this current environment is by not being a scam artist, just by not being a scam artist, you stand up. If you're a person, you sell a product for $50. And you just provide any value whatsoever, you're already in the top 10%. You know why? Because the other 90% are scam artists. There's no way doesn't matter what the price is $1 $50 $500 for a technical analysis product, because technical analysis is fake. It's not real. There's no such there's no price on a on a fucking Forex product that you could possibly pay, that's going to be worth it. They need to pay you because Forex retail trading and Forex is a scam. So you just not being a scam is helpful. Now with pickup, is it a scam? No, but it's you're just getting really good at 2% of game. You're really, really good. You understand? Taking pickup would be the equivalent of just doing calf exercises every day when you go to the gym and never doing bench press. That's what pickup is. It's definitely necessary. You need your calf muscles to do shit. But it's just like it's just it's almost like just inbounding the basketball and basketball. There's so many other parts to gain besides pickup. And so that's the cold approach, not pickup specifically, just cold approach. Yeah. Guys, yeah, J mob disagrees. Oh, sorry. Don't sue me. Don't sue me. Don't sue me. Yeah, so so so that's, that's what I'm in the mail. That's what that's what I would do. Nathaniel. Does that make sense? And when you can't deploy the actual proof on your Instagram, would you create actual stories that you could? You could do so we steal an MOA we steal from each other. We steal each other's stories all the time. When guys throw events, they throw they show picture images from MOA or from MOA or for all the time. Yeah, one guy will one guy will throw a photo shoot with another guy and the other guys will loan him irrefutable visual evidence for his photo shoot happens all the time. We share an MOA we are a team in this program. Okay, that's why teamwork is one of the one of the things we talk about in in men of action. Men of action is actually teaching you kind of in a weird way as a civilian to be a US military officer. I'm kind of teaching you that level of like discipline, leadership organization. That's what I'm doing. Now the reason why you guys join the program because you like hot girls, I get it. I'm not stupid. But that's not the point of the program. The program is to teach you entrepreneurship, social networking, a winning mindset, evolutionary psychology, and how to and how to be leaders. That's what I really want you guys to learn. You're gonna, you're gonna get to the point. I mean, we all of us in the chat and everything, we're gonna get to the point where we're not going to be able to distinguish what's been created, like through like, artificial intelligence, or like, if there's a like, right now, I see people use this all the time for like, Twitter storms, like tweet storms, like they'll have a chat GPT will create, you say, okay, chat GPT create a Twitter storm for me. And let's talk about Andrew Tate and what's going on and blah, blah, and include these words, yada, yada, yada, and they'll it will generate a populate all of these things. And what you do is you simply take all of those, and then you put them into a program like HypeFury. And then you schedule them. And it seems like you're freaking, fucking genius, right? You didn't do a goddamn thing. You had GPT do it in like, three seconds. And, but here's the thing is like, when you were saying, Oh, should I manufacture my own stuff? Should I, even if I'm not living this, you know, fantastic lifestyle, I think we're going to get to the point where it's going to be so easy to generate that kind of imagery and that perception. And it's not even just you like stealing anything. It's like you using, say, an AI program of some sort, some some kind of app, where everyone else is going to be doing it themselves. And they're not technically stealing, they're getting it from an auto generation. So how is that any different than say, like, Oh, I'm going to go and manufacture, you know, this, this public persona. And I'm going to put this out there, even if whether I use like, an AI to do it, or I did it myself, what if you can't tell the difference, then does it really matter? Nathaniel, like, you probably think that Kylie is real. She's not. Kylie is actually this is I'm in a room by myself. This is an AI generated body. There's nothing here. It's just like, she's not even this works. It's a pretty good. It's a deep bank. This is actually a 59 year old Asian man. He has to turn me on and off every day. Yes, I need I need that filter. Can I get the Kylie filter? You want the Kylie filter? Yeah, yes. All right, Nathaniel, that answer your question. Yeah, perfect. Thank you. Awesome. Alejandro, what's going on? Alejandro. Come on, man. Right now. How you guys doing? Yeah, there you go. Go to the front. My question is to roll Tomasi. What is feminism's purpose through the lens of psychology, evolutionary psychology? Or if it has a purpose, there's a nuance to it. I have thought about this question. Yeah, I thought about this question. Go ahead, Rollo. All right. Well, as far as I mean, you can apply this to a lot of different things, but feminism is pretty easy. Primarily, it's to. From an evolutionary through an evolutionary lens, feminism is I could give you the real vulgar way and say it's just so that fat chicks can actually get laid, right? Like so that they can reproduce. It's like helps it to help women who wouldn't otherwise be able to solve their reproductive problems can if they can control the game. And I've said this before. I'll give you the example here. When the WNBA became a thing, there was talk of lowering the baskets in the game so that the women could dunk. Because at that point, they thought we're going to go bankrupt because we can't put enough asses in the seats because the game is fucking boring because all these women are dead. It's like it's no no better than like, say, high school, you know, volleyball or something like that. So what they were talking about doing is lowering the baskets. What happens, though, is you fundamentally change the nature of the game to suit the to suit the skills of the player. That's what feminism is, it's an attempt anyways, to change the fundamental nature of men's nature and women's nature, to put women at the advantage so that women are the primary selectors when it comes to reproduction, when it comes to who they get to select, when I've talked about hypergamy in the past, it's a social adaptation that is meant to solve an evolutionary problem. And so what happens is when you have, feminism, by the way, is just one step in gynocentrism. So if we're talking about, oh, we need to talk about equality, we want to talk about women's right to vote, all this, there's little sub issues that go along with that. But when you take it into total, it becomes what we call gynocentrism, which is the, it's what I've called the feminine imperative. It's a social imperative. The way to experience life is through the lens of the female, the feminine, right? It's like the anti-patriarchy up to this point, you know, it's a man's world, well, it's no longer a man's world if we live in a gynocentric social order. And so what happens is the fundamental purpose for feminism or gynocentrism in total, I guess, is to solve a reproductive problem that puts women as the primary sexual selectors in the human race. And we've done that pretty well, I'd say, since the sexual revolution. There's one invention that has facilitated that, and that was hormonal birth control. What that's done is it's allowed women to be, for the first time in history, the sex that gets to decide who gets born and who does not get born. And so until we have like a male pill or we have something else where men can sort of level the playing field, the social imperative of feminism, if you're going to look at it in a nuts and bolts perspective, it is to promote the... If you look at hypergamy, you look at the Alpha Flux and Beta Bucks, the Beta Bucks side is, of course, the security side. We've got provisioning, protection, and parental investment. Get that. Then once that's been settled, then we're going to look for who we want to be entitled to the guy who is the best looking, the best genetic specimen that we can get with. That's what feminism ultimately leads to when it comes to a genetic evolutionary perspective. Now, there's other... I can talk about the psychological, I can talk about the social, but we're just going to boil it down to evolutionary principles. It's meant to put women into the position of being able to decide, to facilitate their mating strategy. That's really what feminism comes down to. Alejandro, you there? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Okay. All right. Listen up. Imagine when you're a little kid and the first time your big brother pushes you or whatever and you go cry to your mom, and when you do so, you notice that you get a little bit more attention. You legitimately got pushed and you had a legitimate complaint, but you recognize, wait a second, there's a little bit of power in being a victim. I wasn't aware of this power, but you legitimately are a victim. Don't get it twisted. In the beginning, when we talk about civil rights actions or we talk about feminism, there was a legitimate need for feminism at one point when men could just impunity, just beat the fuck out of their... Men could kill their wives and not be charged with a crime. That's a little too far. Okay. That's a little too far. The idea of marital rape wasn't real. I think you can rape your wife. That's just me. I think that's the case. Okay. So I think there's some cases where feminism, I think, went a little bit too far. I do believe women should be able to vote. These kinds of things. So you need feminism. For sure. You did. Then it was one of these things. It was like, wait a second. Whenever we cry, we get legislation passed. We get money for this shit. What the... We write books and people read our fucking books. All we do is play like we're victims. It's fucking incredible. Okay. So have you ever watched Patrick Beverly? He's the backup point guard for the Los Angeles Lakers. If you ever watch him play, what does he do? He throws his hands up in the air. He flops all the time. He's trying to get calls from the referee. That's what a lot of... I'm not just going to pick on feminism. By the way, there's several different types of feminism. I'm not just going to pick on feminism just for this, but there's a lot of these ideals that are based in victimhood. Okay. Yeah. And when you... Now, when I put the cloth of victimhood around me, I'm protected. Okay. Ready? I'm a victim. I'm a victim. You disagree with me. And then I'm like, hey man, check your privilege, bro. You're white and I'm brown. And that's why you disagree with me. You see what I just did? Victimhood. Bro, look at this fucking armor I have on me. It's incredible. I'm a woman and you start disagreeing with me. Oh, you're disagreeing with me? That's because you're an insecure fucking stalker with a small penis, a small dick energy. You see what I did? I'm a victim. Look at me. I'm oppressed. And I just put this armor of victimhood. And I'm safe. I'm safe. Just see the... Safe. Safe. You can just do anything you want. When they went after Andrew Tate, did Andrew Tate go, yeah, pretty much you canceled me because I'm black. He didn't say that. No, because he's not a victim. They didn't fucking do that. You understand? When you watch David Goggins, David Goggins pisses so many people off because he's 47 and he's out running ultra marathons with fucked up knees. Okay? My guest on Wednesday is Zion Clark. Do you guys know who Zion Clark is? He was born with no lower body and he just won his first MMA match a couple of weeks ago. MMA. I'm not putting this guy down. He was a collegiate Ohio wrestler in Ohio at Kent State University. This guy went like 18 matches in a row without losing. He doesn't have fucking legs, Alejandro. When people make excuses and they're victims and they see somebody like Nick Santo Nostasso or they see somebody like a fucking... When they see somebody like Zion Clark, and it's funny, whenever you meet Zion Clark or you meet Nick Santo Nostasso, they also have, they always have mindsets like I have. Like Rolo has. I never have to ask. People who have survived shit like that always have this fucking mindset because they're about survival. They always get this. And so in this situation, that's where feminism led. So now here's the thing. Now what do we want as human beings? We want higher sexual selection and we want higher status. Look at this way for me to get higher status and higher sexual selection. I get more attention because I have cried foul, flop, technical too, flopping. They actually made a rule in the NBA that you could get a technical foul for flopping because these European players would come into the NBA and they would flop every time they got touched. That's kind of like what you do when you cry foul. This is why I said there's a difference between BLM and BLM. BLM, the idea, after George Floyd got his neck stepped on, you better fucking write, yes, there was a problem. There was a problem that needed to be addressed. But BLM, the organization, were a bunch of fucking thieves. They weren't even caught. They weren't even socialists. They didn't even believe in anything. They were just thieves. Okay? So that's the thing we have to understand. We've used the victimhood mentality while we're doing it. We're stealing money from you. We're taking away your power. Right? You understand? And then we weaponize words. We weaponize words by calling, again, you know what? I make a lot of money at work and I have a deep voice. And I like to, in my relationship with my family, I like to teach my children the religious beliefs that I had. And my wife leads when I, my wife follows when I lead. I'm toxically masculine. Do you see that? So it's just two words, throw them together, and then you don't even have to make an argument against me. You've weaponized these words. And then by de facto, ipso facto, I just lose. I lose because you weaponize these words already. And then you just use these words against me. These words already have power baked into them. Why? Because of the victimhood mentality that we talked about before. And then you just, Hadouken! You know, toxic masculinity. Hadouken! Emasculating someone by shaming tactics? Emasculating by shaming tactics? Yeah. So I'm explaining to you why, I'm explaining to you why feminism feels good to feminists. What I'm not explaining though, is that, where does this fit in evolution? So what it does is it gives you higher, it gives you higher status. It gives you higher status. And so by mistakingly this higher status, they think they're going to get higher sexual selection. But of course they're not. Because what they do, what they've done is conflated higher sexual selection. It's like a man sends a woman a dick pic because he believes that non-contextual views of private parts is attractive to him. So if a woman, really attractive woman, sends pictures of her naked body to you, Alejandro, you might be like, that's strange, but you're not going to be like, fuck this dumb motherfucker. You'd be like, oh, that's nice. Like, those are nice tits. Nobody doesn't like nice tits. Nobody. Nobody gets mad. No one gets mad when you send them pictures of nice boobs. No one. No one gets mad when you do that. Because we're men. We see that. We're like, oh, that's nice. Well, she was nice enough for her, for her to post those pictures of her boobs on social media. Here's a picture of my dick. So we were confused, but we're confused as men were confused. So women get confused too. They're like, why do I like this man? Because he's smart. He makes a lot of money. He does all the, he's a leader of men, all these things. So we're just going to acquire those same characteristics on herself and we're going to be boss bitches. Yeah. I'm a boss bitch. I make more money than you. Why don't you want to fucking date me? My dick is bigger than yours. Why don't you want to date me? Fucking loser. I'm a boss bitch. Like, like Cardi B say, I fuck them. Then I get the money. Just like, like, like Cardi B said, why don't you want to date me? You fucking loser. Cause my dick is bigger than yours. You know why you don't want to date me? Ready for it. Everybody. Cause you're insecure. I do. I do. You're insecure, man. I do. You see the power in that word. It's a victim word. That's it. We created, we use that word. We put some, we baked a little victim hood into it and now we can just use it anytime we want. You know what? You want to know something? Republicans did the same thing though. What did they do it with? Do you guys know what it is? If you support Democrats, you're a child sex predator. They did the same thing. They did. They did. Not all Democrats are child sex predators and not all Republicans are fighting against the child sex predators, right? It's ridiculous. Like, you know who, what Epstein's good friends was Donald fucking Trump. It's not like that, but Republicans did the same thing. They got tired of being called racist. So they fight back with sex, child sex trafficking thing, by the way, child sex trafficking is a real thing. It's a serious problem. I did a, on my show yesterday in addition to doing the Andrew Tate thing, I was also doing a breakdown. I was riffing on the video and it was Vice and Vice got, I think about a dozen women together. Two of them I knew one was Sydney Watson from, well, I don't think she's still at the blaze anyways. And the other one was pearly pearl pearl from pearly things. And then the rest of them were all sort of dyed in the wool feminists. And of course the conversation for about 45 minutes was about feminism and it was this back and forth and you could just see the vitriol. It's basically YouTube blood sports is what it is. But one of the things that I, and maybe this is like relevant to your question here. One of the things that kind of hit me when I was doing, when I was riffing on this is that the women who were feminists were very pro feminist. All were of a mindset that they were entitled to certain things just because they were female. So when we have, when you look at the women, like I think one of the more common complaints you'll hear from guys today is like women are very hubristic. It's hubris. Like I'm not going to settle for anything less than the best, that right there. I'm not going to settle for anything less than the high value guy who's six feet tall, six pack abs at 10 inch cock and make six figure income and has a, you know, drives this kind of car because I'm entitled to that. It doesn't matter what I look like, you know, because I'm sexy at any size and sexy at any age and whatever. It doesn't matter when I talk about like how women want their sexual agency to be evergreen. They want to be sexy at 22, at 32, at 42, at 62, whatever they want to have that same level of control and power that they did when they were 21, 22, 23 years old, because their sexual agency is their key to power. Feminism at least sells the idea that that can be perpetuated as long as by doing what? By changing the nature of the game. If men don't find you attractive, Paulina Porzikova at 57 years old, it's not your fault. It's not because you are 57. It's because men need to change their idea about what is beautiful and what's arousing. It's like trying me trying to convince you that a morbidly obese woman should be, should pass the boner test, right? It should be someone that you are aroused by. On a social level, feminism has led to the idea that women are entitled to the best of the best. They should never settle for anything less. And one of the reasons why women are going to be single and childless in great numbers by 2030, according to Morgan Stanley, is because of that mentality. Well, what is the source? What is the reason for that mentality in the first place? Alpha fucks and beta bucks. The best of beta bucks has to be taken care of, and now the best of alpha fucks has to be taken care of too, and nothing less than the best will do. How does that relate to evolutionary standards? It is, I get to decide how I'm going to feel about these things, first of all, socially, but also I get to decide that I am entitled to the best of the best, irrespective of what my quality is and what my value is on the sexual market, in the global sexual marketplace right now. So when we look at feminism as a social imperative that relates to women's evolutionary principles, it is to give women maximal control over their mating process while putting maximal restrictions on men and their mating process so that women can facilitate the best of the best all the time, the top shelf alpha fucks and the top shelf beta bucks. That's what feminism is supposed to do. Now I also put this in the chat here real quick. This was from my fourth book, which is called Religion. There's actually a part where I get into feminism a little bit. Feminism upholds two conflating principles or propositions, that womanhood is both a superpower and a disability, knowing that it leaves their audience in perpetual confusion over their own worth. The end goal isn't liberation, it's about submission. So you'll get the boss bitch message, you'll get the Captain Marvel message, the Mary Sue character, you'll get the super powered one, but by no other virtue than the fact that she has boobs and a vagina, or so you can be anything you want to girl, we give the message that you can go be an astronaut, you can go be a surgeon, you can do this stuff, but you're also a perpetually oppressed victim all the time. And I'll tell you, man, there's nothing more damaging. than that while simultaneously telling women that they need, they are entitled to the best of the best, the best alpha fucks and the best beta bucks because that's what feminism is. That's the sales pitch for feminism is you deserve the best of the best irrespective of what it is that you actually do. Not only are they superpower superheroes, they are also victims at the same time. Does that make sense? Also like think about Kyrie Irving and Kanye West, okay? I'm a victim, I'm oppressed. Wait, pay no attention to my hundreds of millions of dollars but I'm oppressed. Do you understand? If they're rich and Kanye West is just a billionaire, he doesn't really have any victim power anymore. He can go back and adopt victim power by saying that you're racist saying that you're racist and he's being oppressed even though he has hundreds of them. Just don't look at the hundreds of millions of dollars. All these Jewish people fucked me over. Just don't look at the hundred. That's the way he has to do it. Otherwise he doesn't have a chance. Does it make sense? And victimhood, bro, you can get so far. You get all the way to the Supreme Court with victimhood. It's incredible. You can make a lot of money with victimhood. We just choose, I just choose not to do the show. Now here's the thing, Alejandro. As a man, victimhood is not quite as effective as a tool for you as it is for a woman. As a man, you get very little. You can use victimhood but you're still gonna be broken a lot. Got it? I understood. Yes, sir. That was great. Great answer. Beautiful. Awesome. You can't use Hadouken when you're fucking Blanca. You have to use it only when you're Ryu or Ken or maybe. I think Saget can do it also. Saget. All right. Yeah. Here we go. Val, what's your question? Hey, Michael. Hey, Roland. Pleasure to meet you guys. Yeah. I wanted to ask you guys a quick question. How pathetical actually. Let's say you have to start over from scratch maybe at a situation like the Tate's where all your assets were being seized. What would you do knowing what you know now to quickly build a substantial social profile slash business and what are the most critical skills and components to focus on based on what you've learned and experienced so far? You wanna go? You wanna go first? Yeah, man. I got that one already, but you go. Go ahead. Dude, a hundred percent. I do high ticket sales. I would go back and do high ticket. Yeah, for sure. I do that. I would do it from home. I'd build something like this studio. Like we made, God, we've probably made over 3 million off of just off MOA. And I made it in this studio. This studio is $800 for me to build that I'm in right now. Yeah. There's no, no, that's a hundred percent. That's what I would do. Yeah. I would do fucking just off the first program. That's how much we made. So like, there's no a hundred percent. That's what I would do. High ticket sales, some kind of setting. I'd probably get into copywriting. Just something like that is where I'd start from. As far as building a social profile, I would just go find out what, that's the greatest thing about social media is you can just copy. You can just steal the good shit. And a lot of you just don't do it. I highly recommend you guys just go steal shit. That's what I would do. What about like copyright infringement and things like that? No, you don't copyright. No, no. I mean the theme, like make photos like my photos. There's nothing to stop. Oh, I see what you're saying. You take a picture in front of the fucking Louvre in France. You can't, there's no copyright infringement. You have the right to take that fucking pictures for your social media. It's fine. Just steal. That's what I would do. Just is I would do what other people are doing. That's been very successful. That's all. That's as far as a social media profile. So right now what's successful? Reels. I'm telling you reels won't be successful very soon. It'll move on to the next thing. It'll be fuck a gram or I'll be on. I'm looking, I'm waiting for Instagram. I won't fuck a gram. I'm much copywriting that now. I want the Instagram equivalent to rumble. I want the Instagram equivalent to rumble. When the Instagram equivalent to rumble comes out and when people post lascivious shit, they just get not safe for work. There you go. Once we get that and people start moving over to the Instagram equivalent for rumble, yeah, Instagram equivalent for rumble. So basically you post whatever you want. You're not taking off the platform for making political beliefs. And if you post a picture of your titties, they just put a not safe for work sticker over your shit like they do on Twitter and life goes on. People don't fucking die just because, oh my God, a nipple slipped out. Shut the fuck up. Like life would go on. It'd be fine, right? So if you go back to that and we can all just express our views. And as soon as that platform gets a couple people with a couple hundred million views, what TikTok did was the smartest thing. TikTok was an irrelevant platform that made up a bunch of views and engagement and comments. So it made you think it was relevant. And because you thought it was relevant, then you're like, dude, you gotta get a TikTok. Has anybody come to any one of you? Guys, you gotta get a TikTok. You gotta get a TikTok. Why did you get a TikTok? Because you had a buddy who had a video that had 10 million views. If you think your buddy really had legitimately 10 million views, you're a fool. None of that shit was real. There's a company right now that we're at $36 a share. Now they're 66 cents a share because they put their entire marketing budget into TikTok. TikTok engagement is almost entirely fake. It doesn't matter. At some point, it will be real. At some point, TikTok will legitimately pass Instagram because they picked this whole marketing style. This is what's going on. So that's it. So that's the thing you have to understand. So that's what I would do. I would just pick, okay, what is the thing that is hot right now? And I would just copy. And then the other thing I would do is I would go through the first four steps of MOA. Step one, fix your Instagram. Step two, build your list. Step three, find six events that you can take people to. Step four, find six girls that will go with you to those events. We go with those in depth. You can just go on the Discord server and they'll teach you the whole thing. Yeah, I was gonna say, I mean, so as I was saying to the other guy, there's sales guys, there's ideas guys, and then there's the money guys. Clearly, if you've been zeroed out, you're not the sales guy or the money guy. I don't have any problem with generating new things and new ideas. Would I get into something else? Maybe I'll go write the next book, that's all. I have been zeroed out several times in my life and had to start over from scratch once again. But here's the thing is I have the confidence in myself to know that I have generated income and I've generated good ideas that have become income in the past. And I know I can do it again. I have creative intelligence. So following Mike's lead here, yeah, go with what is sort of like the zeitgeist of the era. What's going to make you maximum, especially when you get like to my age, like when you get up in your 50s or something like that, it's harder to sort of recover from being zeroed out. But when you're 20, no problem. When you're 40, you can go, okay, well, I can rebuild. But when you get a little bit older and stuff, at least if you have the confidence that you have generated options in the past, you know that you can generate them in the future. It's very much like when women ask you, or you ask women, what are you looking for in a guy? And they'll say, oh, I want a guy who's confident. So guys think that confidence is this magical freaking, you know, manna from heaven or some bullshit. It's not. Confidence comes from options, being able to say, you know what, if this doesn't work out, I got three other things that will. So how do you do that? How do you generate those things? How do you have confidence? It's like, you don't go to, if you have a job and you're going, hey, look, I got a job from Joe down the street here. And you go to your employer and say, I need a raise, or I'm gonna, here's my two weeks notice. You don't do that unless you have the option to go out and do that, or you think you have the options to be able to go out and do those things. So if you have irons in the fire and you have options, your confidence is derived from the ability to know that you've got those things going for you in the background, if you can. Now, if you get zeroed out and you have no options, the best position that you can be in is to know that you've generated those options in the past and you can do it again in the future. So when I have been zeroed out in the past, that's what kept me going. I can come up with a better idea. I can come up with something new. The best part of this is, yes, go and steal. Go and let good artists borrow, great artists steal. Thank you, Pablo Picasso, okay? Go with that. Everything is perception. Knowing what you know about like your own particular market or whatever it is that you're into. Like for me, it's gonna be, I'm an author, so I'm gonna write another book. I know I can write another book. I probably got several more in me. That's what I would do, but I ain't you. So if you guys get zeroed out, the idea is this, is having the mentality and the mindset. I hate to even use the term mindset, but have the psychology that says, I've generated success and options in the past and I can damn well do it in the future. I can rebuild this and I can make something better in the future, but you have to also know within the environment and the context that you're talking about. So right now it's digital media. Now it might be funnel marketing. Now it might be whatever, I keep bringing up AI. Maybe that's the new thing. Stay on top of that. Maybe that will help you create options in the future. What impresses me most about guys who are like, these success stories, isn't that they're making a shit ton of money right now and their success is now. It's, did you have it in the past? Did you lose it? And did you remake it again? That guy is always gonna earn my respect more than the guy who's just like, yeah, I always had this money and I always had this great idea. And it's like, that to me is marketing. Whereas a guy who's lived it, lost it and built it back up again, that guy shows creative intelligence. And I think that right there is probably, you wanna talk about something that is the most valuable asset in the, what's the most valuable asset in the world? You, everything about you. Can you make it happen again? You are your most valuable asset. Are you an ideas guy? Are you an innovator? Or are you just gonna sit there and copy stuff until you come up with the next great idea? Being able to generate options also is how you can generate confidence as well. Got it. Thank you guys. You got it. Nice, let's keep going. Jay, what's your question? Hey, good evening, fellas and a young lady. So I do have two questions, if I may. First one, I'm hoping it's gonna be a pretty quick one. So I do know a lot about you, Mike. And I also do know a lot about Rolo and what you guys do, but what I don't know is who you are as people, right? So my first question is, what's the happiest day of your life and why? I'm supposed to say either when my daughter was born or my, I got married, right? That's what you're supposed to say. I'm happiest day of my life. Probably when my daughter was born, I guess that's probably the happiest day of my life. Cause I didn't realize how happy I would be when that happened. I mean, it's, you know, yeah. I would say probably when my daughter was born. What do you say, Mike? When were you happiest? When I walked into your life, when I did four hours with you. Honestly, man, probably been in like May of 04. My dad, it was like the year before he passed away, a little bit more than a year before he passed away. He came and he saw me get my wings at Randolph Air Force Base in McConnell or Randolph Air Force Base in Universal City, Texas. He showed up and, you know, as a father, you got a lot of questions. Is my son gonna end up being some kind of fucking weirdo and living off me for the rest of his life? And is he gonna, you know, did I raise him right? And my dad got to watch me get navigator wings pinned on my chest, you know, in front of him. And from that point on, I was a military aviator. I think that was probably, I don't know. If I look back on it, it's probably the happiest memory I have. Probably the happiest day of my life was probably my last birthday. That shit was fucking madness. I was there. Yeah, my last birthday was fucking madness, bro. That was, or the year before, that was fucking mad. Like, I'm just sitting there and just dis, but like, I gotta be honest with you. The look on the people's faces around me that Bilzerian was sitting at my table drinking tequila was so precious to see. That was pretty good. I mean, there's so many, like, I can't, I will tell you, there was a concert where I was on stage with Skrillex for like three hours and I was like dislocated my hip from dancing so much. I was pretty fucking happy. There's a lot of them and there's a lot of like, you know, super happy times that I've had, but you know what? I honestly, the first time I hosted the Maxim party, that's it, I hosted the Maxim party and I got to interview Joe Jonas. That was pretty amazing. Oh, really? Yeah, that was because I was nobody and I threw up just complete accident. I'm the host of the Maxim party, which opened up so many doors for me. I ended up hosting Babes in Toyland in part because of that whole situation. So that was all pretty good. And also, I actually feel like coming back to Babes in Toyland, for those of you who don't know, there was some drama. It has nothing to do with Babes in Toyland, where I wasn't there for one of the things and I came back because somebody told some lies about me. And then I stood my ground and turns out, I got everything back. So that was pretty, pretty amazing. And there was this fucking girl from Arkansas I kept annoying when I was in Mexico a couple months ago. That was pretty fun. That was pretty happy making. Nice save. Awesome, thank you guys. The second question I have is, so I've been following you, Rolos, about 10 years from now. That was the very first time I read The Rational Mail, the book number one and number five. So I've skipped in between and now reading number five, halfway through. And a lot of what you guys say does make ton of sense, right, especially in what you write in your book. It just makes absolute sense, right? So the issue now I'm having is with the people that I love and respect, and anytime this type of a conversation happens, and anytime I voice my opinion or anytime I'm short, when I see somebody is kind of going the wrong route and I'll say no to someone, they get alienated. How do you guys deal with that? How do you deal with keeping the people that you love and respect close? Not necessarily the outsiders that don't come and lead your life, right, basically. So are you worried about being called a jerk? No, I'm not worried about being called a jerk. I'm just, I just want to have the family, people that are close. So a pretty inseparable family through thick and thin. I mean, growing up with food rations all the way coming to the United States. I mean, they've been there for me, but they're noticing, they're like, oh, you've changed, you've changed. Yeah, you're going to get that. This is very common. Guys, they go through two stages. One is the one you're going through right now where it's like, you've changed or something. And honestly, sometimes it's hard to take that as a compliment. particularly when people are expecting you to be the same person that you already saw. And one of the reasons why people will try to discourage you or they'll say, oh, that's misogynist or that, or, you know, when you, especially when you're like sort of changing your life. I've had guys who I've, I've literally saved their own lives because they read something in the book. Right. And they really want to be evangelists for the red pill. They want to like tell their brother about it. Do they want to tell your dad or whoever, you know, cause I mean, why wouldn't you, right? They're not ready to hear it because, and then the, the alienation part of that comes from them wanting to see you be predictable. They want you to have your same personality all the time. So when guys like, and this is, by the way, this goes all the way back to like the, you know, the mid two thousands when like the game was a thing, guys would learn this stuff and they would literally become different people because they're like, oh, now what I'm doing actually works. I've changed my personality so that I can get the results that I want from life. What happens is the people who knew you before, they think you're poser, right? They think, oh, stop being someone you're not. You'll hear that all the time. You're trying to be somebody you're really not, right? It's like, no, I get to decide, it's my personality. This is me. And this is how I, I get to decide who I get to be like, that's, you know, personality is mutable. Right. But the problem is, is like your, especially your close friends and your family, they're expecting your personality to be consistent over and over and over again. And the problem with that is when they have this, you have given them this sense of predictability all the time and you break that predictability, they're uncomfortable with that. They don't know who you are. They don't know what to expect of you. When people tell you you're trying to be something you're not, it's usually because they want you to go be back to being what you used to be because they could put you in that box. They can put you in this category. He's an extrovert. He's an introvert. He's this way. He's that way. He's always depressed. He's always happy. Whatever his thing is, they want you to be consistent because human beings have a endless need to see consistency. They want to have security to know that the seasons are always going to be the same. They want to know that the, that we see, you know, we're very good at pattern recognition. We want to see normalcy. We want to see this thing. We expect that from the personalities of the people that we're with. And when we see that change, it's usually because they think, oh, he's on drugs or there, or he's had, or for instance, if you go on deployment and you go and you see combat and you come back and you have PTSD, you're not the same person that you were before you left when you come back as when you come back. And I'll tell you what's funny is people are more willing to accept the fact that perhaps you have PTSD from a combat deployment than they will for you to actually change something about yourself. Maybe you're on a diet. Maybe, you know, I don't, I'm sick of being fat. I'm going to go to the gym and I'm going to, I've changed my mind about myself and I'm going to get in shape. That right there, people will fight you on that. They won't fight the PTSD. They'll fight you on that because like, oh, you don't need to do that here. Have an extra scoop of rice, you know, here, you know, you're, you're getting too thin, right? They don't want you to improve, not necessarily improve. They just don't want you to change because they like the predictability that they already know about you. And it's comforting. It's rapport, right? That's what I was just saying. Breaking rapport. If you're, if you're unpredictable, that's hard for people to process, particularly people who've known you your whole life. So just, I mean, maybe knowing about that, like, yeah, you know, knowing's half the battle. Knowing that that's going to be the response, adjust your own response or your own expectations for people who are giving you that, that, you know, that back and forth and say, look, I know where I'm going. Don't worry about me. I'm still the same old me. I'm just changing the way that I'm doing things right now. Thank you. Mike, you're muted. Go. That sound good? Yeah. Any other questions? No, no. Thank you so much, guys. Like whatever you're saying, it makes total sense. You know. I never got the happiest question. That's good. What's the happiest day of your life? First person to ask me that, Jay. Let's do that again. Let's do that again on Friday. By the way, guys, we're doing Access Vegas on Friday. Yep. We've got incredible paragons. I think, I think the mayor of Vegas is coming on. I think we've got some incredible people. AOC might be coming. No. We'll probably just have four porn stars. We're going to have porn stars. From Navy. Sorry. Thank you, John. I appreciate it. Awesome, man. Steve, what's your question? Unmute, man. I'll be quick because I know you're busy. So, I built a website. It's a therapy website out here. And so, the question is for you, Mike, because I know you, you built this by like the ground up. I've seen you, like hustling online for years. So, so, yeah, the question I have is basically, I built this therapy website for the Caribbean. It's been actually getting a lot of traction, well, amongst like therapists out here. So, the idea is to make it, to make a safe space for people of color that with mental health issues, because there isn't really like a better help or anything like that in the Caribbean. This is in Jamaica? This is specifically in Jamaica? Yeah, in Jamaica. Yeah, of course. Okay. So, yeah. So, I built it, designed it. Like the, the group of Jamaica Jam Psych, the organization of therapists, the head of it likes it. So, the idea I have now is to kind of build traction for it. Now, I'm, I'm struggling to figure out how to market it because I'm doing the whole thing. I built the website. I've like reached out to the therapists and like for them to sign up. So, now I'm trying to figure out how to, to help build it up in terms of like SEO or how to, to build it up marketing wise. I'm struggling to figure out how to market it properly. Well, the thing is, one of the issues is like when you, when you do something like that, that isn't really sexy, because for a lot of people, it might not be, you're going to have to ask for public money sometimes. That's where, you know, where a lot of that stuff will come from, Steven. So, it's going to be difficult for you to do that. The thing is like, I'm just curious, like how is that perceived in Jamaica to do something for a safe place for people of color when, you know, the country is, is about, you know, over like 89% African? I'm just curious. Like, how does that work? Oh, yeah. Mental health is not really, it doesn't have a- Not mental health. You said for people of color. I was just like, it just, it just seems like you wouldn't see something like that in like, like Lagos or Kingston, you know? You might see something like that in Johannesburg, but like not in, that's why I'm a little curious. Oh, no, man. People, so yeah, when you say people of color, I mean, normally when I tell in Jamaica, it's just Caribbean people, but the majority of people in the Caribbean are black. So normally when I'm saying it to like Americans or, you know, I just say POC because it just makes it easier. But it's still in Jamaica, right? That's why I'm a little confused. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, man. It's still in Jamaica. It's still, it's marketed specifically to Jamaicans and I, it's going to, the plan is to expand it toward the entire Caribbean. But I just, no, because like, you've, you've, you're very good at marketing. Like you've really marketed your own company to a very, you know, it's built enough traction. So I'm just curious as to how, you know, what would be a good advice? I just don't know that I do a mental health people for, for like one specific gender or race or socioeconomic class because it's mental health. You see what I'm saying? It's like, we all deserve to eat and be happy and that's the only thing I would be a little concerned about doing is having like some narrow, narrow band for it. Now you might do it for like, say teachers, mental health for teachers or mental health for, you know, firefighters. I could see that possibly. It's going to be hard. You don't, it's not really a sexy thing. You can, I mean, it would have to be some kind of public service announcement. Maybe a testimonial would probably be the best thing I'd look for, but Steve, here's the actual answer. Go on Tik Tok, put in, put in keywords for the things that you're talking about right now and then find an example of what you're talking about. I would just type mental health in Jamaica is two separate fucking keywords in, in Tik Tok and I bet you'll come up with 50 different things. I mean, yeah, man. So yeah, it's just, there isn't any type of like resource in the, on the Island. Basically that's, that's the only reason why I built the site because I know there was a gap so I knew I could, I could probably make money from it. Dude, Steve, have you, I understand it's a gap, but like most of those things are like publicly funded. You, I would, I would talk to the government about that. Okay. You understand? Yeah. Not money. I understand what you're saying. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah. Yeah. I hear what you're saying. The government. Yeah. Most of the time it's like PSAs discussing like mental health issues. It's generally not private practice. People will go to private practice stuff for that. It's a lot, it's very expensive, but you don't have a degree in it. You're not a therapist. I don't know. I don't see how the model works. Hmm. Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. See what I'm saying? Yeah. I, I mean, I get you, but I mean, it's, yeah, it's, it, I'm pretty sure it's gonna work, but like, yeah, I get what, I get what you mean. I get what you mean. Now let me just ask you a second question. The first thing, the first, if you, if you had brought this idea to me, the first thing I would ask you is have you asked for public grants? Because they would, it would, it would be the government's responsibility to do something like this. Okay. I don't, I don't have it. I don't have it, but I, I, I'm going to apply to USA because I have some friends that work for the U S embassy and like, wow. So yeah, I'm going to apply for us. That's what I would do. This is not really, this is, this is not really a supply and demand issue. You know, it's, it's a terrible, it's, it's, it speaks to how the world works. It's not a good thing, you know, but for the most part, when you're like, oh, I have mental health issues. One, I expect to get help and not have to pay for it. Seriously. I mean, it is the case, you know? Yeah. So yeah. But no, man, so 100%, I'm going to apply for some USA grants. Like a friend of mine works with USA that he's willing to support, but I still have to build it. So that's why I made sure I built the website, built the resource, but yeah, I understand it's not really a entrepreneurial subject or it can be not really make as much money, but yeah. I get what you're saying. Yeah. Let me just ask you a second question then, since, yeah. Yes. There's this, a friend of mine, she's, I think she's, I don't know if she's interested. She's like been spending a lot of money on me and I've been like, she hasn't really like shown any, like when we go out, she hasn't really shown that much physical interest. You know what I mean? We dance, you know, I don't know, you know, Jamaicans dance, but it's like, she's spending a lot of money on us. You guys get pregnant when you dance. You breathe on them when you get pregnant. What did you say? You guys, you guys like share a biome when you dance, like bacteria. Yeah. But that's very casual dancing. You know what I mean? It doesn't necessarily mean the person is interested. It's just dancing. Yeah. You know, but she's been spending a lot of money and I'm kind of been like. Spending a lot of money. Yeah. So I'm just kind of like, is this person really interested in me? You know what I mean? Because like if a girl spends money, would you take that as interest? Like she's actually interested. Callie, what do you think? Callie, what do you think? Um, I don't know what to think of this. I've never. I've never heard of this. You've never like spent money on your girlfriend? Is she like, is she way older than you? Because I'm confused. Nah. I was going to say, that was my first question. Is she older than you? Nah. She's my age. We've been going to like, there's like a bunch of expensive concerts this weekend in Jamaica. She bought my tickets. Like over $500. How old is she? She's like 36. There it is. How old are you? I'm 37. Yeah. Does she have any, does she have any kids? Was she here before? No. She's in the army. She's actually in the air force. Hmm. Yeah, she's in the US air force. She's probably like. I don't know. I just. She's having a hard time. So wait, you think, you guys think that sounds like interest to you guys? Because you've never spent money on a guy? Has she seen me naked? Has she seen you naked? No, we're just, we're just friends. I thought we were just friends. The thing is, you're 37 and she's 36. So you're actually younger than her. Yeah, technically, technically. You are younger than her. Yeah. You understand? Yeah. I get you. I would say it's her trying to check. She, she's, she sees you as an option for sure. I mean, if a woman's spending money on you, she's 36 years old. She has no kids. She's never been divorced before. Actually, she's been divorced. Huh? She has been divorced. She got divorced in the house. Okay, so there it is. How long was she married? Hold on, hold on. I have an announcement, Rollo. Everybody, get ready. Everybody, hold on to your dicks. Ready? The porn star Bridget B will be interviewing Rollo Tomasi and myself at 11 a.m. at the Adult Video News Awards. Hall of Fame porn star Bridget B is going to be interviewing myself and fucking, and Rollo Tomasi. You guys excited? You guys excited? I'm going to see if we can live stream it. Let's go. Let's fucking go, dude. Let's fucking go. It's called Dirty Blonde. Her name of her podcast is called Dirty Blonde. And she's going to be interviewing Rollo Tomasi. Oh, whoa. I just Googled her. Okay. Yeah. I would say there is definite interest there, Steve. But it is most definitely motivated from the fact that she probably wants to, to cash out. She's probably trying, at 36, does she look good? How does she look? She looks good, yeah. And she's paying for shit, right? Steve, she's trying to see if you want to be like a baby daddy or something. Yeah. It seems to me like, at that point, if you, here's what you do. Steve, go read my second book, which is Preventive Medicine, and look at the timeline that's in there. You'll see where she lines up at about 36 years old. She's looking for a future security at this point, especially if she's already been married before. How long was she married? About like five years, five, six years, yeah. Five, six years. So she was married at 29. She's done with him at 36. Yeah, that's right on schedule. But is she interested? Yeah, probably. But I would be very careful with that, because you are in a prime position of selectivity, and she is not. As Mike was saying, you are actually younger than she is in this situation. Okay. Here's another idea. You live in Jamaica. Just go find another girl. Exactly, I know. I wasn't that interested. Go work at Hedonism. Go work at Hedonism. They pay you to have sex with the fucking, they pay you to have sex with the swingers. Go work at Hedonism. Get a job with the entertainment staff, and they pay you to have sex with the fucking swingers that go there. Got it? There you go. I'm trying to come back to the States, man. But yeah, I hear you. All right, man. Daniel, what's your question? Yo, what's up everyone. So, so there's a fashion event coming up for a charity for domestic abuse. Is that the kind of event where you just invite all the girls from the list and I'm also going to invite personal friends as well. Yes. Pretty much do everything. How to win friends and influence wise and then value content wise. Find the organizer. Give them a list of influencers you're trying to bring girls good and free guys have to pay. Yes, it's exactly right. Okay, and then when we bring like 30 dudes and 70 girls, that's what we do. Okay, so Because I'm not going to be able to do it. You're not going to be able to do it. I'm just saying try. I know, but we have a list of like 1000 people. I can't listen. I know, but I mean, I'll send the invites, but I'm not going to be like, oh, I'm going to invite. Well, I could I'm asking, would I just say I'm going to invite 1000 people because that to me sounds weird if I say that you're not going to tell him he doesn't need to know what your inner mechanics are. He doesn't need to know you invited 1000 people. Daniel, you won't get 100 people to show up if you invite 1000 you won't get 70 people show up. Yeah, no, I'm just using random numbers. The question I'm asking is like, because I'll have to say in a certain amount of period of time before he's confirmed bringing attractive women. Generally, when there's an event and you're saying I'm bringing attractive women, they don't tell you how many they just like keep putting them on the list. By the way, Daniel, if they don't pick another event. Oh, yeah, that's fine. If I went to see Fowler, I'm like, hey, man, I have 100 really pretty girls coming. The idea that he would say no, don't bring them is so fucking absurd. Of course not. Okay, cool. People that are that close minded pick a different event. Okay, fair enough. Yeah, that's cool. And then just get as much content from it to then post it on Instagram for whatever. Any dude who wants to come with you needs to have his fucking phone out the entire time filming at 60 frames a second and HD fucking 4k. He needs to be filming every, every fucking step you take and every step every girl takes, and the lights need to be on the whole time. You guys need to look like fireflies while your cameras out filming everything. Yes. Cool. 100%. That's it. Appreciate it. Let's keep it going. Delane what's your question. Hey Mike. Hey Rolo. I just finished the player's handbook, so it was, it was pretty great read. Thanks for that. And I also like the long form content that you run so it's not just the clips that are good. Thank you. So, I guess. Yeah, so I'm a little bit more of a writer like you Rolo. I'm a copywriter, but maybe Mike you could handle this as well. I was wondering, well, Mike you especially talk about like the sliders for our video game characters. Right, trying to get them all to 99. If your social skills are average. Right, and maybe you're still battling with social anxiety, then what can you do to work on that social skills to bringing them closer up to the, you know, your level. And it's for men and women, just to clarify it's not just women. Yeah, it's immersion, so that the trick is immersion the trick is to put you in the fucked up situation over and over again, I promise you the six or seven times you jump out of airplane, you won't even notice it. You'll be, you'll be halfway down and be like man I forgot to pee, and then you just pull your record it won't bother you it's immersion the answer is immersion. The answer is immersion, if you want to learn how to speak Spanish, move to Mexico for a month. You'll speak Spanish. Eventually you will social skills are skills they're learnable that's actually what it is it's social learning it's like it's learning to read. I think one of the I don't know how old you are there, Gillian but. I think that probably from the look of you, you're, you're what Jen probably Gen Z, so you're probably been brought up online and a lot of your social skills I'm not going to say are retarded but I mean, you know, in the clinical sense but like stunted let's just say. And so you probably don't have the opportunities to go out and learn face to face. Talk with people understand, you know, body language and there's a lot more to social skills than just like holding a conversation because I can hold it sounds like I can have a good conversation with you already just by the first five minutes here. But when you're out there, and you are. And again, it doesn't have to be in the clubs, you can go to the gym and talk to people make eye contact with people learn body language get out there and as he was saying immersion by doing start at the gym start at your school start at, you know, wherever it is that you whatever it is that you like to do, get out of the get out of the room get out of your room, go outside touch grass or snow as in my case. And get out there and find something that you have like a mutual affinity for if it's like fishing if it's snowmobiling if it's sports if it's a hobby, whatever, go to the game store talk to those guys down there, whatever it is, you'll find that when you create tribes and when you when you have like a regular thing that you're doing and you're immersing your version, immersing yourself in social situations you have no other you can't help but get better at least, you know, by margin by little by little so I 100% agree with with Mike on this it's it's all about getting out there and doing guys who are clinically depressed guys who are like introverts guys who are who complain of that they've I've seen these just got these research numbers from I forget who was doing it it was I forget which university but they're saying that people who are depressed when they got into social situations and they got into networking they they must say cured the depression but their depression certainly went down as a result of them being out there and doing things with other people. Depression gets bad gets worse social anxiety gets worse if you don't go out there and you don't actually put yourself out there it's like not so much a fear of rejection, as it is getting out there, going and doing it and see you know maybe you fall on your ass occasionally but you come back and go out and do it again you get better wax on wax off. Like, I'm, I have a fear of girls with big boobs. So I hang out with Kylie because she doesn't have boobs and it makes it easier for me. You guys get it. So yeah, I'm just trying to get over my immersion. Makes sense. I'm also afraid of women from Arkansas who stab you. You know, I'll tell you what's fun here I'll give you one last example here, people. When I went on that certain daytime talk show. Back in November, people said hey you're going to go on commercial TV Wow, and you're going to be on with this guy. Are you nervous. I'm like, no, I'm not nervous at all. I do this all the time. And when I got into the studio and they sat me down and I looked around the audience there couldn't have been more than 200 people in that audience maybe three max. Man, I have more people in my waiting room for one of my shows than was in that studio I'm looking around going let's do it. As there's no nervousness no nothing there's once you get to the point where you're comfortable and you know what you're going to say there's confidence in, in what you get you know the material well enough that you don't need a fucking PowerPoint, you're going to go out there, you can be confident about it. And when you see that you're no longer going to be nervous you're not going to have that anxiety anymore. Simply because you've done it before, and it's not even that big a deal because you played the bigger audiences. Interesting. Thank you. Our program here in Vegas where we bring guys down it's called Vegas immersion specifically for this. Come out to Vegas going, we'll get you over. Sweet. Woody what's your question Woody. Woody go you've been waiting a long time I've been watching you. I've been waiting. Yo, Mike what's up see you again. Rollo nice to meet you. Quick, quick thing before I answer the question I had one takeaway on the lanes question on that. It's something I experienced when I first moved to Miami, and it was literally me getting a job at a nice restaurant in the heart of Brickell in Miami. I was immersed myself into the, to the social scene in Miami, and I was forced to work pay my bills and literally connect and meet people every day. That's how I restaurant Moxie's Moxie's in Brickell yeah yeah yeah yes they I get it. Yeah, yeah so I worked at Moxie's for about eight nine months. That's actually I met fresh there I met Myron there. No boys there. I'm surprised I didn't see you there well I know you posted up there a couple times I've been in Miami probably every month. And, well, from August, all the way back to actually December of last year so bullshit. I go man you can ask where I get all my, that's where I go to eat. It's a fresh and fit podcast cafeteria is. No, it literally is, that's where I met fresh months and months and months ago. But that was just my little takeaway was I got a job at Moxie's and literally my life entirely changed, but my whole network all my friends are from Moxie's. But yeah, anyway, just thought I'd give that little anecdote. So, my question it's a little broad. Really, I just want to understand from your guys's point of view, like, I think I have a lot of potential in life right so 24 years old, running a marketing agency which I kind of recently just started, but I really I think I have a lot a lot a lot of potential a lot of untapped potential. I'm like doing the statistics I really think I'm only utilizing like 10% of who I am as a person, and not even scraping that other 90 right now, I'm asking both of you roll and Michael. Any resources any strategies like what would you recommend to like start to unlock that potential and really kind of like dive into that rest of that 90% of what I really have. Because like I want to start like doing like modeling and stuff to not even for like a job or for business but just for the status stake of it. And then I also like get on a reality TV show as well things like that. I just think I have so much unlock potential that I haven't tapped into yet. And mostly it's because of like finances as well because like not gonna not gonna sugarcoat it I'm not like swimming in money yet. We're working on it but so any resources strategies anecdotes. Say what do you want the concrete answer do you want the. Do you want the mindset answer. I mean, preferably both but you give me whatever, whatever you think suits best. Shoot, go ahead, Mike you're, you're on. See the chat. That it. There you go. Those are your reading list right there. 29 bucks to go through. I don't hear any fucking excuses. There you go unlock the other 90% it's in there I promise you it's in there. The very fact the very fact that you're on this and you're talking to me you're talking to Mike leads me to believe you've got a fire under your ass. So that's, that's good here let's let's count the pluses first okay. You're 24 years old you're Jen, you're Gen Z. You just by being in this and, and, you know, relating all that to me right now that makes you an outlier already. Okay, so because most of the people that I am most of the guys I encounter and women that I encounter of your generation are their list list their lays, especially guys right they're kind of purposeless they're the what Jordan Peterson is called the lost boys generation right they don't have a purpose. You have the fire you have the motivation if you got to Orlando or Miami and started working at Moxie's clearly you've got something to something going on for you and you want to start a marketing agency I think at this stage I'll give you the he's he's giving you the concrete stuff here. I'm just going to say this is that look for opportunities and be, be ready for those opportunities when they hit a lot of times when you see guys who are like, like, overnight successes, it's not because they had some like brilliant idea or something like that they were in the right place the right fucking time in the right fucking niche and they were ready or prepared to go and do it and they hit it like I was talking to Big Mo on rule zero on, on Saturday, and his story is this is he. I mean he's probably what is he 28, I think, but for the longest time he wanted to get into sound engineering he he missed opportunity after opportunity, he got he got rejected for like audio schools and stuff like that. And he was just like biding his time learning his shit learning his craft and waiting for that opportunity and sure as sure as hell, it came up when Myron when Trey finally left the show Myron put this one, one single Instagram reel or whatever, saying hey we need a new sound guy, he was families right there and now he's been a part of the show for well over just over a year right now. So look for those opportunities. My other thing is, my other big deal is this is like always say yes. Like, do you want to be in a movie? Yes. Do you want to do this? Yes. Do you want to, even if you're like, I mean do things you want to do obviously but like say yes to things that you would not necessarily be part of your field you like hey do you want to take a improvisational acting class? Yes. Do you want to do that you want to go deep sea fishing? Yes. Do you want to have this opportunity? Yeah, whatever it is, even if you hate it, you can say I did it I know I don't like it I'm gonna move on to the next thing because a lot of times when I have like in my past when I have said yes, even if I didn't like it, it might lead me to something that I did like, and I might go okay I can I can go and do this there's a lot of little sub related areas that's why I say networking is very important right. But always say yes, because even if it's even just bullshit, then you get the part of that bullshit might be something that's real and you might want to move on to that and then you're saying yes to that and moving on. I think that's one of the problems that a lot of guys who complain about like not having a purpose or not having a like people stop looking for meaning that's all horseshit okay look for a purpose look for something to do. Guys who are depressed you know why they're depressed because they're not fucking doing anything they're not right you will your depression will be instantly cured if you actually get out there and get off your ass and go and do something you'll be too busy to be fucking depressed right you're dealing with discontent creatively rather than destructively. So, I mean keep that in mind, as far as like marketing and what is it exactly that you do specifically as a marketing guy what do you want to do. So right now I have a couple different offers but mostly we focus on production, so we do short form video content, photo, video, podcast, etc. Okay. Hit me up. Here's your yes moment. Hit me up. Email me. You can find my, it's on my in my descriptions of my videos. I need somebody to do short form. So hit me up. If you want to do short form for me, we can do it too, bro. But you got, you start off as an affiliate and if your shit kicks ass, then we make you, then we hire you. Email me. Email me. You know my material already. So email me. He doesn't have, he needs somebody to post in shorts on his shit every day. Like what, like on mine. Yeah. I need my, I need my, I need my TikTok to explode. Yeah. I got you. Do you need someone who does like manage your stuff too? Cause I have like social media managers. I'm in a really weird position. I think probably Mike's in the same position too, is like, yeah, it's one, I have, I've got people coming out the yin yang and want to do this shit for me. They don't know my niche. Right. And there are people that I can't really trust implicitly. I can't, I need a Tom is what I need, Mike. I need it. I need a guy like Tom or Palo or Pablo. Woody, I hire guys who've done the program. So my, the guys who didn't make my 10 minute clips have, they, they watch every episode of my podcast. The guy, the girl who does my shorts watches every one of my podcasts. I hire people who are in, who are like already in the culture. I don't really try to go outside the culture to hire them. That's why I'll put my email in the, in the chat here real quick. Yeah. I'll send you an email right after the call. Beautiful. Instead of a yes, that's a, that's a fuck. Yes. Well, that's a fun one. Yes, exactly. If you still have any capacity, you can do it for me too. Nate, what's your question brother? Let's do it. Let's do it. I appreciate you gentlemen. Thank you. Of course. Hey, what's going on guys. Real quick. My name is Nate Santos. I bring you the famous dancing horsemen, the famous dancing horses, creating unforgettable memories for you and your loved ones. I'm also the most bad-ass cowboy plumber out here in the West, AKA the pipe wrangler. Happy to be here. Awesome, man. Kylie said she's about to leave me for you. I bet she was. The ladies call me Mr. Plumber because I lay the pipe. That's exactly that. She told me that. She said she was checking you out on your OnlyBands. And that's what she told me. Yeah, don't let that dirty Nate Santos on here with his dirty-ass pipe. She'll tell you about it. Okay. All right, man. Nate, what's the question brother? Hey, I got a couple of questions for you guys. Earlier, you guys was talking about, you briefly mentioned something about a late count and whether you should speak on it or not. And I was just curious on your guys' opinion about that. I know a freshman said something like 50 is a goal. Donovan Sharpe says 35. So I was just kind of curious to get your guys' perspective on what your opinion is on that for nowadays. I don't know their late count. Oh, I know my late count. It's too high. What are you talking about? Public knowledge. Let's see. I've said in the past, like it's, I don't think that if you've read my fifth book, I've said this before. I said, I don't think that late count needs to necessarily be the metric for good game or bad game. Okay. The reason why I say that is because you come here to Nevada, you come to Reno as a matter of fact, you get off the plane, you have give me $500 and I guarantee you, I will increase your late count by one. I will take you to the clubs. I will take you to the brothels and in Mound House. I'll take you to Moonlight Bunny Ranch and you will get laid. Now, you got laid, that's your notch, plus one. Is that an evidence of good game? Probably not. If you're paying for it, probably not. So should that be the metric for it? I think that when you're learning gaming, you're learning your social skills and everything else. I don't think that like your net necessarily, your notch count should be the metric for that. However, game needs to have results. And so therefore, if you're not getting laid, then perhaps you need to like reconsider. Hey, hold on, time out real quick. Nate Ice, if you can stay on, I will, I will keep going with you, buddy. I apologize. We should have gotten to this a while ago. So we'll, we'll get to you in a second. Ice, if you're giving me right, yes. In the chat, if you still want to do some Q and A with us, do you want Rollo to stay on? Let me know too. We can sue that. I got a bug out pretty soon here, but go ahead. Nate. No, here's the thing, man. Have you ever, you know who Biggie Smalls is? Oh yeah, Big Papa. Okay. Do you know that song, the 10 crack commandments? Yes, I do. Nobody needs to know where the fuck you live, homie. Nobody needs to know where you stay. Nobody knows where you be at. They need to know where the re-up is. They don't need to know how much cash you got on you. I'm saying if you're trying to apply for a home loan, then they need to know how much money you make for sure. If you have a bisexual girlfriend and there's a girl you guys want to bring home. Sure. You can talk about who you have sex with. Other than that, no one needs to know this because you're qualifying yourself. You're qualifying. Now, if it's an academic situation where a dude is like legitimately asking a question and it's like, Hey man, I need to know. Cause I'm just thinking about dating that girl. Did you sleep with that girl? And you might, that might be a case where someone needs to know, but other than that, nobody needs to know shit. For sure. You're qualifying yourself. You're qualifying you. There are attributes that you can have as a man that would make a woman believe, wow, that guy sleeps with a lot of women. And then there's attributes that she, that you could say that come from a man that make her think you don't like bragging about how many women you sleep with would be one of those low status attributes. Right. Okay. Got it. Yeah. I feel that. Yeah. Just, I was just kind of thinking about that from personal experience and like, based off of the numbers that, you know, I think Rolla has said in a couple of different videos, uh, like around 40 for himself. He just doesn't want to, he doesn't want to disappoint you guys. I've been with biological females too. Well, right on guys. Another question I had is, um, I met you roll at the CME this past year. Um, and, uh, I met Javari out there also. I chopped it up with him for a little bit. It's just kind of like a, I really like what fresh says when it comes to like providing value. Um, the dancing horses that I bring in, we show, we train, uh, we've done some music videos with a couple of, uh, artists and I wanted to offer that to you as well. I offered it to Javari and I was like, I know you guys are more like rock style kind of music, but horses got some long ass mains like down to their chest. So like imagine a horse dancing and his main swinging around to a fucking rock song. No one has seen that. No one has done that. Thank you for the offer. I'll keep, I'll keep that in mind. Yeah. I, I'm sure we'll be doing videos in it this summer and trial of ascension. So yes. All right, Nate, if you, if you want to promote that, just go to MOA mentoring.com. We'll do that, man. All right. Here's the thing. Here's what I'm going to do. Uh, Scott and, uh, uh, Faraz, we're going to hold on. We're going to get to you in a second. Ice. I'm bringing you up real quick. Ice. Here we go. Um, what's going on, man? Ice, what were the questions that you had? You said you had one for Rollo so we can let ask it. Then we can let Rollo go if he needs to go. All right. Uh, yeah. I sure in Lima, Peru right now are no, um, right now I'm in London again. So it's like, uh, three 45 in the morning, pretty crazy, but that's what you got to do. And you, um, you were the one who planted that evidence on Andrew. That was you get you to bed. Let's get you to bed. I said, uh, well, anyway, I wanted to say, uh, first of all, while, while Rollo was here, uh, we, we can make Michael a bit jealous here because he's the only one out of us free who hasn't written a book. What are you going to do with Michael? Uh, at some point, someone's going to have to kind of chat GPT. Some AI that can write the book for me. I definitely will do that. The thing is like, I don't really feel like I have like the arc, it would be a self-help book probably, but I don't feel like my story has the arc of that, that like Netflix would look for it. Does that when you're 50? Yeah. The white, the white passing guy who like makes money, like nobody that's not going to work. You know what I'm saying? It's always, if I failed, then, then, then it would be a cool story. I think that would be a better story, but that's not what's going on anyway. Go ahead. Yeah. I'm sure there's a way, maybe there's just structure for it. Anyway, uh, for, for Rolo, um, since I don't, I don't know too much about you, but, um, good opportunity to ask this question, which I was going to ask Michael anyway, there's all this, uh, Blackpill stuff, which I see being very negative and being kind of like shooting yourself in the foot. Her name is Blackpill Kylie. That's what we call her. We just literally call her BP. Blackpill Kylie. Go ahead. Yeah. Blackpill, uh, my, from my perspective, it's really, um, not really helping anyone. It's just complaining a lot of whining. What's your perspective on this and what kind of things should these guys do instead of making excuses basically, or believing in this very narrow point of view. Okay. So when it comes to Blackpill, the Blackpill, Blackpill is a person, is a prescription. I think that's, that's the first thing that people need to understand. The red pill is descriptive. The Blackpill is prescriptive being a trad con trad, traditional conservatism. That's a prescription. This is what we should do. This is the best practices. The Blackpill is usually populated by guys who are asocial or antisocial. Um, they, uh, they tend to take the information that the red pill gives them and they, their prescription is to do nothing or it is to, uh, bitch and whine and moan or, or, um, or maybe even worse. It's the same thing for guys who are quote unquote in cells. That's a prescription. They take the same data and they take the same information and they interpret it through this lens that helped that is like, I would like to say is like, it's like self-loathing or it's this, uh, this, um, co-miseration amongst themselves. So we can say, oh, uh, we're all, we're looks maxers and we'll never be, we'll never be better looking. We could go to the gym, but it won't fix our faces. It won't fix our jaws. We're chin cells. We're whatever cells, right? It's, it's a prescription for your own failure. And it's a reason they, the red pill becomes a reason for them not to do something instead of a reason to do something. Now, if you've read my first book, or actually I think even my third book, which is in positive masculinity, I, I described this as the abyss. Okay. So what it is is when you are in this blue pill kind of delusion where you're believing that, uh, whatever your, your mom and dad, your, your, your, you know, popular media, pop culture, psychology, your religion, your school, whatever has taught you here's the, these are the real truths, the Disney truths about, uh, you know, intersexual dynamics. And then you suddenly take the quote unquote red pill. And now you, your eyes are open and you're aware of how the, how you've been living your life has been according to a set of rules that no one is actually playing by. And so now in the red pill, you say, oh, now I'm aware of intersexual dynamics. I'm aware of, of women's nature of men's nature and the confluence between those two natures. And instead of seeing that as an opportunity to live a better life and to change, you know, like we were just talking about getting zeroed out a minute ago, instead of seeing that and saying, oh, now I know the rules. Now I can fucking level up and I can kick ass in this, in this new red pill paradigm. Instead of doing that, what guys think is I really wanted that blue pill dream, but I can't have it anymore. And I'll never be able to be in success because now I know my eyes are open and the world is just nihilism and despondency. And, you know, let's read a lot of Nietzsche and, and, and, you know, uh, beat ourselves up emotionally all the time and do nothing and sit in our rooms all day long. That's a prescription because you've taken the data that is the red pill that's given you made you red pill aware. And rather than taking that and seeing it as an opportunity and seeing it as something that is constructive, people see it as destructive and they want to beat themselves up. And in the data age, it's very easy to find forums and long ass podcasts and user groups that will help you commiserate with other people who don't want to cross the abyss. And by me, what I mean by crossing the abyss is going from that blue pill to the red pill. And then from that red pill, seeing the opportunities that are in that, because now you are playing by the real actually have actionable information. You have accurate data now that you can use either to burn your house down, or you can use it to light, let you warm your house and, and, uh, and, and cook your food with it. When guys get into the black pill, it's because they don't see any hope for themselves in this new red pill paradigm. Whereas before they would probably very much love to go back to their blue pill delusions because it was comforting. It was gray. I can't have the white picket fence. I can't have the, you know, the golden retriever in the front yard. I can't have a wife and three kids. No, you have to go forward with this new information and you can build a new life in the red pill paradigm. They just don't see the opportunity and they lack the creativity. So I'll, I'll leave you with this. That one thing that I've, I've been noted for saying is that the human condition is defined by discontent. And that is a feature and not a bug of human nature. Okay. You will never be content. And that's a good fucking thing. Because if you were content, you will stagnate. You will do nothing. You'll end up like, yo, I'm happy. I'm, I'm, I'm fat and happy. And I don't have to do anything anymore. Those are the guys that you leave behind and you keep going. Right? So when, when I'm talking about discontent and contentment, you can be content for a little while. Like you go to four years, you get your college degree and go, oh fuck, this is great. I got my bachelor's degree. What's next? Oh, I want my master's. Okay. I'm discontent with the bachelor's degree that I thought was going to make me happy, but I'm happy in the process getting my next master's degree. Okay, great. I got the master's degree. What am I going to do with it? How about the doctorate? Let's go and get the doctor. Like whatever the next plateau is, is where you think you're going to be content. And that's a, like I said, that's a good thing because that, that levels you up. It progresses you. It's supposed to progress you. The problem is, is when people deal with discontent destructively rather than creatively, that's when you get the black pill. That's when you get guys who are doomers. That's when you've got guys who can't cross the abyss and they don't see the opportunity. and they don't see know what to do with themselves. So instead they are in this pit of misery and there's a bunch of other guys that are go, yeah, yeah, it really sucks. It really sucks for all of us. We're all fucked, right? If you hear that enough times, you're never gonna leave that abyss and you're gonna stagnate and you're gonna be wallowing in discontent that is destructive rather than creative, I guess would be a better term. That's where I kind of, I fall down on the black pill side of things. It's despondency, it's nihilism, it's reading bad Nietzsche. That's really what it's about. And I think it's fundamentally, the cause of it is this misunderstanding that you're never gonna be content and you weren't gonna be content in the blue pill and you don't see any possibility to be content in the red pill. The problem is not the blue pill or the red pill, it's your understanding of being content. You're never gonna be that way and that's a good thing. It's okay to be discontent, just do it creatively instead of destructively. Yeah, that's very interesting. I never knew about any of these blue pill, red pill. I know it's kind of a metaphor based on the matrix, of course, but would you be able to kind of give a quick summary for those who know nothing like myself before this call what the red pill actually is, like a quick summary to someone who knows nothing about it? Do you know what I do? I don't do quick summaries. There is no elevator. Frollo Tomasi, what's the red pill? Hold on to your dicks. You're not gonna go to pee anytime soon. The red pill is, by my definition anyways, is it's intersexual dynamics. It's understanding the evolutionary psychology, evolutionary biology, the anthropology, by the way, sociology, the psychology, the political science. I mean, there's so many different subfields for the red pill. It's kind of hard to like say it's about one thing. When people ask me for the summation, I just say this, it's about the, it's a praxeology of intersexual dynamics. It's understanding men's nature, women's nature from a evolutionary perspective of evolutionary psychology, biology, all that stuff I just said. And then how do those work together? It's the praxeology of all of that. And what I mean by praxeology is it's the study of human behavior in that human behavior has a purpose to it. That's how it dovetails into evolutionary psychology. To me, that is the red pill and it is cutting yourself away from this blue pill idea of all the things that you've thought were the old set of rules and red pill is the new set of rules according to what we know now when it comes to all of the sub fields that I told you about. And we're more aware of it now because we live in the age of the internet and we have access to studies. We have access to Dr. David Buss. We have access to books. We have access to all of the research data that everybody that we quote, we're connecting dots. And some of them might be accurate and some of them aren't but it creates what we call a predictive framework. And in that predictive framework, we say this is the red pill. This is how we can create best practices. Some people take it and they turn it into black pill doomers, right? Other people such as myself and Mike, we say, you know what? You can live a better fucking life with this information and this here's how we're gonna do it. So it's how you're, it's one thing to have the data. It's another thing to interpret that data. I interpret data. He interprets data way differently than the people who want to say, oh, it's all doom or trad cons or whatever else. Those are prescriptions. I don't deal in prescriptions. I deal in descriptions. And that's really what the red pill is. It's descriptions. It's a database. It's what Ryan Stone has called the Chilton manual of human nature. That's the red pill. Sound good Ice? Yeah. The best part is when I do something on my program where I have a guy who's like five feet tall and he's surrounded by women. It's the black pill guys who have the hardest time with it because one of the things that happens specifically on my social media and with my clients is we disprove black pill. Like there's no, you can't go through my client's Instagrams or hang out with me at immersion or come to a bikini competition with me and then believe black pill is real. There's no possible way. It's unassailable truth, looks, money, status do not equal everything. And so when you explain to a Muslim person that there is no Muhammad, or if you explain to a Christian, there is no Jesus. They don't shake your hand and say, thank you for the truth. They try to blow you up. They try to kill you. That's what happens. You try to explain to black pillars, looks, money, status is a partial description of female attraction, but not the whole thing. And then you prove it to them. They get very angry, extremely defensive, and they triple down. Michael pays for all these girls. Michael, it's easy because you're a club promoter, not a club promoter. Don't pay for these girls. It's very hard for them to deal with it. You know, whenever Michael, obviously, you know, they're only hanging out with you because you're rich. I'm rich? When did I become rich? Like they believe all this bullshit about you. And then that's the only excuse that they can have for your success. And then when you show your client success, then they don't have any excuse and they're just fucking fucked. And it's very similar to when I have clients who have lots of excuses or a victim mentality. And then I show them Nick Santo Nastaso, who was born without two legs and was born without his right arm. Or if I show them Zion Clark, who's a Paralympian, and he's actually going to become an Olympic wrestler, and he has no legs. When you see those guys and they strive and succeed, Black Pillers get, they go nuclear. They go nuclear. Because you've completely annihilated their safe. You know how they talk about some people want a safe space? You know, Black Pill is a safe space for people who are failures. It's a safe, it's a warm coat, it's a warm blanket of victimhood. And you take away their victimhood when you show them guys like Zion Clark, when you show them guys like Nick Santo Nastaso, who have been handicapped, and then absolutely don't even fucking slow down and become millionaires because of it. That's when you really- That's why they don't like, that's why they want to call me a PUA. I've never been a pickup artist in my life. Are you fucking kidding? Or an MRA, or they want convenient, predictable labels. They want to categorize you because it's easier for them to dismiss what you're saying that crushes their ego investments and what it is that they hope is going to be true for them. An ego investment is a belief in a particular thing. It could be religion, it could be politics, especially when it comes to like intersexual dynamics. Girls are this way, so I should act this way. And if I invest my ego into that belief, when somebody attacks that belief, they're not necessarily attacking the actual belief itself, they're attacking you because the personality is attached to that belief so intimately that they can't distinguish the two. So if you believe that the sky is purple and I say, no, the sky is blue, here it is, empirical evidence, it's irrefutable, here it is right there. What that is, it's not an attack on the sky being blue, it's an attack on me personally because who my identity is, is intimately linked with the sky being purple. So therefore when they see me or they see Mike, or like, I get this from both ends, man. I get this from like guys who are trad cons and I get this from guys who are like black pill doomers. It's like, I can't be red pill because I'm married or I can't be married because I'm red pill or you're anti-marriage. No, I'm not anti-marriage, I'm anti the way that we do it. Now, I have to explain this over and over and over again. And the reason I've figured this out finally is the reason why I'm always explaining it over and over again is because it's a new person for whom when I say certain things or when Mike shows irrefutable evidence of a five foot five guy with girls like, or around him, here it is, what do you have to, you can do this too. No, I can't, no, I can't, no, I can't, right? And the reason, so that no, I can't part is I got to figure out a way why he's wrong or he's fucking me or he is tricking me because I know what he's showing me can't possibly be true because if it is true, then my belief is not only false but I'm false too because my identity is linked with that belief that all a five foot five guy couldn't get what he's got right there. That's why they're so violent. That's why they're so, they wanna create six hour podcasts and call me a dickhead or him a dickhead or whatever. You buy those girls, there must be, there's gotta be some outside reason that can't be what I believe. No, you're just wrong and you just need to readjust your belief set, man. Yeah, speaking of money, Michael, I understand that you have become a millionaire and lost everything and built it up over again, perhaps a few times, I'm not so sure. What's the story behind this and how did you manage to make a comeback and not wither away into some kind of depression or some kind of has been? You got zeroed out. I'm gonna bug out and I'm gonna let you, I'm gonna let you answer this one. That's cool, so. All right, brother. All right, man, I'll see you guys. I'll talk to you on, I'll see you Thursday. Thursday, bye. All right, cool. So I was a triple lever to the upside during the COVID crash and I lost a lot of money, a significant amount of money. And I was still a good trader. I knew I could come back eventually, but that's when I decided to start MOA and that was it. Like, I mean, it was significant and then came almost all the way, well, now I'm all the way back now from building this business and from trading. That's the short answer. Oh, okay. I was also gonna say, crazy statistic that so many people may not know. 90 out of 10 lottery winners end up dead in jail or broke. Yeah, for sure. Seven out of 10. You bought lottery tickets, that's, but that select, people who buy lottery tickets, lottery tickets select for that type of individual. Yeah. The reason why, like, if I won the lottery, I would be, I would have doubled my money in 20 years is because I don't have the predilection to buy lottery tickets. Does that make sense? If I excessively drink, have a very low IQ and see very little prospects for my future, what am I gonna buy? Lottery tickets. That's the reason why nine out of 10 people would end up that way, for sure. Hmm. Just a seven out of 10 of those alone end up broke, of course. How can this be prevented aside from this applying to a lot of people who are not really working on themselves? What can anyone do in general to prevent this from happening by fucking up their own finances when they get a little bit of success with money? It's a function of gratitude for what you have. I live in a world where I can eat good food and it doesn't have to be super expensive, right? I can live a very happy lifestyle in Des Moines, Iowa with your wife and your two kids and have a farm. There's a bunch of ways to live your life as long as you appreciate it. When you stop appreciating it and you start going out because you think the grass is always greener, then you're gonna end up in a situation like that where you need to keep giving people money. The other thing I'm gonna tell you is rule number six. If I won the lottery, I would wear a goddamn mask. None of you would fucking know about it. There's no fucking way I'd tell anyone I won the lottery and I would just sit there and chill and be like, oh, that's cool. And then my homie's law degree would get paid off and he doesn't know where it came from. Shit like that would happen. Does that make sense? I would not try to manipulate the world with the money I have or try to buy people's love or affection with the money that I have. Make sense? That's the difference. That's essentially what I would do, but it's a function of gratitude. It's just gratitude. I'm gonna jump around a little bit here. The term alpha male has thrown around a lot these days. I noticed that many of the guys seeing it are the same guys that are the complete opposite of what they are trying to describe. I've seen you comment before on something like this. Can you tell us what an alpha male actually means? Yeah, so it's like a puff of smoke, right? It's like when you play king of the hill, you're on top of the hill while you're playing the game and while no one's knocked you off the hill. So an alpha male would be a contextual idea. If I take my friends out to dinner and they're all listening to me and I give a toast, for that moment, I am the alpha male to an extent that a girl who doesn't know me might actually be a little bit more attracted to me because everyone's facing me and listening to me while I'm doing stuff. And then we all get up and we walk into a room. This has actually happened to me. Then we all get up and we walk into the room and Tai Lopez is giving a speech. Now Tai Lopez becomes the alpha male. It's like trying to hold onto a puff of smoke. The alpha male thing is you're constantly having to reprove it over and over again. You guys will be an alpha male, then he's 70 years old. And then he's like, you know, he can't go out there and whip ass like he used to be able to. The thing about it is it's not really important. I think what's more important is like you have alpha tendencies that lead you in one direction. And then you have beta tendencies that lead you in another. And that's the only thing you really have to worry about. Like you will never ever hear me call myself an alpha male. That is not something that I'll do. Now, will I do things where if I was, if my 20 year old self was looking at me today, would he say, man, that guy seems like an alpha male? Probably, but I'm not gonna ever call myself those words because that is not a function about alpha male. Like Tywin Lannister said, no man who has to call himself king is actually a king. If you're an actual king, you're not gonna have to call yourself that. So that would be, now, when a guy lies, like for instance, when they come on my, when they come on YouTube and they start saying things about me that are like abject lies, that is clearly beta behavior. That is not, I can say that you are being a beta when you do things like that. When you lie for no reason, when you make excuses, that is beta behavior. Passive aggressive behavior is beta behavior. That's absolutely, making excuses is beta behavior. Snitching on your homeboy is beta behavior. Those things are, those things are actually beta behavior. Those things you can actually, you can call out. Now I will say, I feel like the men who stormed Normandy in 45 are alpha males. That's, but I can say that after the fact. And I can say that, but they can't say that. Does that make sense? Yeah. That's how I would, that's how I would say it. The ultimate alpha quality, the ultimate masculine quality is to willing to die. people in your tribe. That's what I would be. So anything that comes close to that service for other people is essentially like the ultimate masculine alpha qualities. Now you can have Machiavellian qualities that will lead you to making money and having sex with lots of women. I wouldn't consider those to be alpha or necessarily masculine, but they're adjacent. You need certain ones of those qualities. Like for instance, being super cocky and arrogant, but you can back it up because you're physically strong. You're like an MMA fighter and you're undefeated. That would, that would be considered masculine. That guy you would consider to be alpha, right? Those in those situations, that would be the case. And then you have like ultimate alpha situations where like you're on another guy's yacht. He's the alpha male, right? You're on his yacht. You go into a fight and another guy knocks you out. He is the alpha male. But if you watch a basketball game, you'll see superstars dunking on each other all the time. Who's the alpha male? Well, it's going back and forth, literally going back and forth, changing. It's contextual depending on what, what quarter you're in. Who's the alpha male? You see what I'm saying? Yeah, that's it. So like, if I were to say, you know, in 1977, the fucking Washington Bullets won an NBA championship. Those guys were alpha males and none of you know who they are. Give a fuck. And no one thinks they're alpha males anymore. It's all what, what have you done for me lately? I'll like holding onto alphaness is like holding onto a puff of smoke in your hands. You can have it for just a second, but you have to maintain certain things in order to maintain that alphaness. And you can, like, if you're super famous, like the rock, or, you know, then you can, you can maintain that for a long time. But if you really look at the rock system, extremely beta male shit, sometimes the reason why is because he's being controlled by people who are telling him what to what to say and how to say it. I don't know if you saw the rock told Logan Paul to take down pictures of him in the rock at one point, because Logan Paul had done the whole the suicide thing. Do you remember that? The Logan Paul to take down pictures of it. I mean, that's kind of beta male behavior. I'm sorry. It is. Right. I think what what what Logan did was stupid, but I'm not going to sell him out if I'm his homeboy. And now, like, we're getting to the point really quick where Logan's gonna be more famous than the rock. Better watch out. Better fucking watch out. Cool. All right, guys. How many more questions you got? Because I want to finish this off. We've been on for four hours. Oh, maybe just a few little ones. And then previously, you said that 45% of men of action is on fucking people's minds from PUA shit. What kind of PUA garbage do you have to undo? Hey, listen, I don't I don't want to do the straw man thing where I say it's all garbage. Not all of PUA stuff is garbage. They missed the boat in three main areas. Number one, social media, just absolute fucking disaster. They completely did not. They did not tell guys to get on social media. They may. I saw very clearly you can. All the PUA's can lie about it now, but I very clearly remember 2013, 2014 PUA's making fun of guys for getting on Instagram. Very, very clearly remember this. It was I remember getting off the phone with one instructor saying, you've got to stop telling these guys to get on social media. It makes them look weird. All this kind of stuff. Completely missed the boat on that. Secondarily, they completely missed the boat when it comes to logistics. They they were like, how do I get the girl to come back to my mom's basement instead of saying, how do I get out of my mom's basement? Logistics were always very, very much underutilized. Like very rarely did you watch one of these PUA videos where they were like, hey, got to move to a city with hotter girls. Never did they say that shit. They were always just like, here's how to pick up the playmates in Waco, Texas. You know what I'm saying? I said it was just stupid. And instead of because but because it's very easy to teach a course when you don't act when you don't have actionable change. Moving was very important. The most underrated part of self-help is logistics. Get up and fucking move. Okay. And then the third one, if you've ever been in the U.S. military or if you've ever been a coach's son, you understand this concept. You move to where the opportunity is. Okay. And then the third one was obviously the female friends. They were just like ultimate, just DEPCON one complete, unmitigated fucking disaster. In fact, if I was going to say one specific thing that sank that entire fucking industry is that they missed the boat on this one. Like having women introduce you to women complete and total utter miss the total mismatch on that one. They got it completely wrong. And I personally believe it destroyed their entire fucking industry from the inside out because the guys who did understand how to have female friends did so much better. The proof was so unassailable that I think eventually guys were like, why would I take your course when you don't know what the fuck you're doing? Why are you making fun of people in the club when you can't even get in bitch? That's the problem. That's essentially what was happening. So, so those are the three main things. And then other than that, then it was just like, you know, general Patton had a great quote. He said, the enemy gets a vote too. I don't consider women the enemy, but some of these tactics were done with the intent of here's a man. And you're just doing these tactics in a vacuum because a woman's brain is a vacuum. Instead of understanding a woman's brain is designed through evolution, exactly the same way that yours is designed through evolution. They did took no notice of this, had no understanding of it. There was no deep introspection into evolutionary studies, anthropology, evolutionary biology, or anything like that. None of it was scientific. Nothing in the PUA community was scientific whatsoever. And the last one is, I mean, I hate to say this, bro, cause I'm going to get a lot of trouble with this. I know Neil Strauss, most of the shit in that book didn't happen. Sorry. It didn't fucking happen. The dude hardly ever went out. He just stayed in his room the whole fucking time. I have multiple witnesses to tell me this. People are like based their entire life off that book. Most of the shit did not ever fucking happen. None of it, almost none of it happened. Owen was like a super cool guy. Like, you know, I know Owen and I know Neil. No dude. Most of that shit didn't happen. Sorry. No, I'm talking about the game. Neil Strauss has this really, really great ability to write these books where like, ho hum, I'm the lovable loser. And whoops, I accidentally fucked 16 girls. And, uh, and in the end I found happiness dot, dot, dot, dot, dot. And in the end, he's like the lovable loser who becomes the winner at the end. If you guys notice all of his books are like that, I wonder what that's all about. Hmm. He's writing nonfiction fiction. And I like Neil. He's a fantastic writer to be fair. The, the setup by Dan Bilzerian, the first edit of that book was done by Neil Strauss because, because, uh, can you move him because, uh, Dan wanted the book to read like the game and the game probably did motivate a lot of people to do a lot of stuff, but that's not what happened. It's, it's, it's an, it's an approximation of what happened, but it wasn't really what happened. He really spiced it up a lot. And a lot of people base their entire life, life livelihood on this idea that I'm just going to go out. And if the girl doesn't like me, it's because I didn't do game good enough. What game became is this, there was this Delta between having status and not. So you would go into a social situation with no status. There were all these ways of you creating status, but fuck that we're PUAs. We don't create status. We just use words. And then our game is going to make up for the fact that we have no status. And then we're going to go out there and we're going to make up for the fact that we have no is going to make up for the fact that we have no status. And then we're going to get the girl. And if you don't get the girl, it's because you didn't do game good enough. All of these things were false. All of these things were false. And that's where they screwed up. And it's, I'm going to say it's garbage. I understand that they were trying to improve themselves. I understand what they were trying to do. The initial wave of games, game stuff, wasn't like manosphere stuff was they were just, these guys had no chance whatsoever with women. And they just wanted like one girl, two girls. And then there were a couple of guys that like, okay, I want to bang like a couple of girls. That was it. There was no thought of how this affected the world sociologically. There was absolutely no consideration when it came to anthropology, sociology, or evolutionary psychology at all. None whatsoever. I know. And people are like, no, Michael, you're just talking shit. No, I went out with RSD every weekend for like four years. I fucking used to work for the Venution Arts. Don't tell me I don't know shit. And don't tell me I don't approach. I've approached more than most of the people you've ever met in your entire fucking life. You have no idea what you're talking about. I'm telling you this because I've seen both sides of it. And it's very clear to me that the side that creates win-win situations for other people, networking is an evolutionary adaptation. Remember that? That is the side that wins 99 times out of a hundred, regardless of what that fat loser in Brazil says. I'm right. And he's wrong. He pays fucking, he pays prostitutes to sleep with his clients and I don't. So believe whatever the fuck you want. It was all a dream. Oh, by the way, I have someone's asking you, I have thoughts on mystery method. The mystery method is a good book. It is a very good foundation. Love drop is terrific at what he wrote. However, that's not what mystery does. You hang out with mystery. It's not, he doesn't do the shit that's in the book. He just, it was a really great way to package what he did. I used to sit around mystery all the time and listen to him. He couldn't make himself cry in front of women. I've never seen anything like it guys. Fucking incredible. If you're asking whether or not mystery is good, he was good. Mystery was fucking incredible. That was not, that part was not fake. That part of that Newton that Neil wrote about was not fake. Cool. Any other questions? Oh yeah. Um, the average human lifespan is almost 28,000 days. How do you keep yourself productive and on track towards your goals on a daily basis? How do I do to keep my, I don't worry about the 28,000 days just today. I just do tomorrow today to the next day today to the day after that today. And I have a checklist and I have, um, I have checklists and I have, uh, alarms that are always set on my phone and I use those in order to, to maintain discipline on what I'm doing. That's it. Uh, every day this week I'm picking one particular guest and I'm studying him for two, two hours at double speed. So four hours because I have one, two, three, four, five, I have eight guests this week, so I can't do eight hours on each person. I just don't have enough time. So every day in the gym, I'm picking one person. I did David Goggins. I read both of his books. So I may have, I may have an interview with him on Wednesday. Uh, and then I've got, um, fucking Baron Davis. I got to do an hour on Baron Davis, two hours of Baron Davis tonight. And then I got Phil Ivy and then I have, um, uh, Zion Clark. Those are my four guests coming up. Nice. I mean, that's, but that's the focus comes from check. It's very boring answer. It comes from the one thing by Gary Keller and it comes from checklists and alarms. That's it. Similar to what I do, but just without the alarms. Yep. Uh, I'll give it one more question. Um, what would your advice be for someone who spends money on escorts for social proof who wants to transition away from that and stop using escorts and just not use escorts? Yeah, that's interesting. You asked that John, I'm sorry. Wait, I'm sorry. Did I say that? Sorry. My bad. I apologize. My bad. Sorry. Um, it's hard, dude. That's, that's, that's coming from a really hard place, man. When guys use escorts, those are some of the toughest clients that I have to work with because every time I put them in a situation where they're talking to women in a normal situation, the girls aren't as hot and they aren't as receptive. And the guys get very bored and then very frustrated very quickly, very quickly. And so it's hard. The other part is a lot of these guys would talk a girl into having sex with them and the girl would be like two grand and they'd sleep with them for like 1200 bucks or something. And they thought they had game because they talked to prostitute into sleeping with them for less money. They thought they had game. And when you tell them, dude, you don't have game. You're actually just a weirdo who pays women for sex. They don't want to hear that. And it's very, it's very hard for them to hear that. Does that make sense? Ice? Yeah. It's like, it's like playing NFL football, just loaded on roids. And then the next time you're like, Hey man, we're going to do some testing. Don't take your steroids. And like, you come to come to the realize you won't even be able to like play high school football without steroids. That's what it's like hiring hookers. Like you just, you're it's such a fucking advantage when it comes to getting girls. It's such an incredible advantage that, and by the way, if you're wealthy enough, it's not really that big of a hit on you financially, but what it does is it destroys your ability to communicate with humans. It makes sense. And then here's the other thing. When the woman then takes your money and then leaves your resentment for her, then carries over to every woman you see. And you just, you just become further and further away from having a normal relationship with a woman. That's the problem with it. Make sense. Yeah. I dude, I, I, I fucking envy those people who like just average people who live in an average city and have no social media can just like, just be madly in love with each other and just think this is the best thing ever. I'm sorry that, but none of those people exist anymore. They don't, they don't. And if I'm right, if I'm wrong, then explain, you know, why 2 billion people are on Instagram. Okay. We're going to Arkansas tomorrow. I've made up my mind. I'm away, Arkansas, Arkansas immersion starting next month. Get ready. We're hunting alligators and we are getting, we're getting in a hot tub with our cousin. All right. Is that any other questions? Oh, one more, one more. And then that's it. This is about the voice. I grew up with difficulty speaking. Um, I was a very quiet person and I always had a weak voice probably on me right now because it's early hours of the morning. Um, as there is someone doing podcasts for hours each week, um, including doing this call right now for however many hours this has been going, hosting events and projecting your voice story. Well, what could you recommend someone who wants to improve their vocals and the strength of their voice in general? Yeah. Same thing I said before immersion. So it's going to be come on to shows like this frequently. Ask me quite, I tell one of the, one of the modules in MOA is watching yourself on camera. Get used to seeing yourself. Everyone should have a set and maybe not quite like mine, but everyone should have a decent lit setup with a microphone in their house somewhere for business. Everyone should have this someday. You may be doing sales calls. You may be doing a podcast. Someday you may be doing sales calls. Someday you may apply for a job. Everyone needs this thing somewhere in your fucking house. And if you do this long enough, you're going to hear what you sound like. You'd be like, Oh fuck. Okay. Now I understand. I do sound like a whiny little bitch. Wait, my voice. Is that what my voice really sounds like? I need to go get my fucking testosterone levels check. That's actually what I sound like. Many of you, I know you need TRT. When I listened to your fucking voice, that's where it comes from. You're fucking six, three weight, two 70. You're fat as shit. You're built like a marshmallow. And you're like, Michael, I don't know why girls don't like me. I don't know what the problem is. Why is it that they don't like me? Michael was like, I know what the problem is. Look, did you go to the TRD doctor? Yeah, I'm going to do it next week. Okay, Sam. I'm sorry. My bad. I didn't mean to do that. Anyway. So, so that that's the whole thing. It's just immersion. It's the boring answer. You're going to keep getting the boring answers for me. This again, I'm never going to be as popular is like Pearl. I'm never gonna be as popular as Myron. I'm never gonna be there as popular as them. The reason why is because I don't go for the red meat. I tell you the easy, obvious one standard, the normal distribution, 68.27%, middle standard deviation, plus minus one sigma answer. The middle fucking boring answer. The middle way, like Buddha says, it is the boring fucking answer. There is only try harder. It's like Alex Ramosi said. There is only try harder. There is only work harder. There is only that. People get into MOA. First thing they ask me, Michael, what's the way that I can get the most information from MOA in the shortest amount of time? And I stop them and I say, you're looking for the shortcut in MOA. MOA is the shortcut. There is no shortcut in MOA. There's only work harder. There's only try more. There's only stay up late. There's only finish the assignment. That's all there is. That's all there ever is. It's so fucking boring to hear that. But that's the answer. I want to get better at something. Immersion is almost always the answer because immersion follows under rule number three, which is what? Abundance is almost always the answer. Got it? Yep. Oh God, I can't even speak there. Yeah. All right, man. Any other questions? No. That's it. I'm good to go. I love it, man. All right, last two questions. Then I got to go, guys. Awesome, brother. Here we go. Last two questions. Then I got to go. What's going on? Faraz, what's your question? Yo, Mike. Can you hear me? Yep. Awesome. Okay. So a couple of questions regarding photo shoots. So we're doing the first one on the 21st of Jan. And the location was the hardest part to get. So we basically cold called realtors. And a lot of them said no, and that's weird and fuck off. But one person said yes. It's kind of a house. It's kind of a house. It's like a $3.3 million house. Nothing too crazy. My question is, moving forward, how can we make that, like, did we, it was like 100 cold calls or something. So it was kind of a grind. But I'm sure there's an easier way to do things. Faraz, what city were you in? I'm in Toronto. Okay. And you talked to the other guys in MOA that had been to Toronto, and they had an issue with this? None of the guys are in the program, or at least graduated from it. Got it. Okay. So the answer to your question is, well, anyway, somebody want to unmute themselves. In MOA, who knows the answer to where would I find these locations easier? What would I do? What is the secret sauce to that? Anybody? Go on Zillow, find them. Find some of our friends, introduce you to our guys. What's the other resource you have, guys? When I want to find a place to shoot, I have one other resource. What is my other resource? Oh, PeerSpace or one of those sites. What's my other resource, Luke? Instagram. Email friends. Goddamn, are you guys serious? Yeah, email friends. Who do I ask? Who do I ask whenever I'm looking for a place to shoot? I ask girls, dude. Right, yeah, they know I'm a rich guy. Yeah. Faraz, you never thought of this? I did not think about that, no. Yeah, dude, it's so obvious when you think about it. Yes, they all know about Creepy John with a fucking $8 billion mansion that lives off on the East side and wants people to do photo shoots. All of them do. Every one of these girls know about it. They're getting creeped on their DMs all the time. I ask girls, dude. Guess where I get my sponsors from for my events, Faraz? I ask girls. Faraz, I was in a nightclub and two of my female friends had come down to Miami because their restaurant owner that we know is opening up a restaurant. So if I go down there and I network with the guy, then that gets me to other places. Three of my friends just get you places. Just don't be weird and be a normal dude and be nice to them and they'll invite you places. It's pretty easy. Makes sense. Dope, okay. Awesome. That's the answer, man. Yeah, I appreciate that. Yeah, that sounds like that'll be a lot easier than what we did. My next question is, so during the first one, building my list is kind of slow. So we're aiming for like, I don't know, three, 400 invites and see just how many we get. Cause we don't know how many yeses we're going to get and flakes we're going to get. So just to be safe, we're just going to go all out. Building that list is kind of slow cause I don't know, going on Instagram, just like trying to search for models. It's just one for one. You don't search for models for us? Have you done the program? Or are you just going off somebody else? I have not, no. I'm just going through the Monday calls and there's one guy. Yeah, you're way off, bro. You're missing like 90% of stuff. Yeah, man, you're way off. Yeah, you find a girl, then you look at all the people she follows. So you don't, it's not just randomly going through lists. No. How do you do that? You just go to follow. Who does she follow? What do you mean? How do you do that? You just go to the girl. Just look at tags, look at geotag mine, look at the best clubs and restaurants in the area. And you'll find like a bunch of girls that tagged in it. And you go to their tagged photos. They're suggested. Then you can just go down a little hole. Like you'll find a hundred girls in like an hour. Are you, you see on my screen, dude? You see Amber Emery? Yeah. You'll never believe what city she lives in, bro. Guess, you want to guess what city she lives in? She lives in Toronto. She lives in Toronto. What is this? Following? She's following people? What the fuck? You mean I can see all the people she's following for us? For us. I'm not trying to say this. I'm not saying this unironically. You definitely need to join the program. I know. It's kind of silly that you're going to go this far and message hundreds of people cold calling when we could have fixed this problem in two seconds. It seems a little silly you haven't joined the program. It feels like you've done more work, more hours of work than what it would be worth to buy the program. I also have several guys in Toronto and MOA who would have given you their list. Okay, dope. I'll see you in February. All right, brother. Awesome. Next question. What's going on, man? Hey, Mike. Yeah, I've got some questions. I'm struggling to figure out my why. I've been just doing a bit of putting everything out and in the new year, making some new plans. And I think the thing that's restricting me from getting like a much razor sharp vision is my why. And I'm just wondering if you have any thoughts on if that's essential to chasing goals and pursuing dreams. You've already read the book, obviously, right? Which book? Start with why. No, I'm familiar with Simon Sinek's work. I just wanted it. I want a lot of weird reactions in the chat. How have you not read the book? Like, it's really obvious when guys come on and they're not an MOA. There's no joy. Let me tell you something. I don't care if you read the book. I'm sure you'll read the book. There is no way you would make it through my course with that answer. Everyone in the course would have fucking grilled you. How dare you not take action? How dare you join MOA and not take action? The book is called Start With Why, Joey. And you're saying you don't know how to find your why. How to find your why is not a correct grammatical statement. The reason why we say find your why is because of the book, Start With Why. That's where that term came from. You gotta read the book, okay? There's also a bunch of other things that come along with that book that you can read. There's a bunch of compendiums that come along with it that can help you as well, okay? As far as starting to find your why, this is something that happens with experience. So what I would do is become a subject matter expertise. I would explore a bunch of different things and then find the ones that help you. So classes on Coursera, videos on YouTube, and fucking audio books. Audio books, audio books, audio books. That's how you find your why. Got it, Joey? Yeah, I got it. You gotta read that book, man. Joey, also on the Discord server is 28 other books you should probably read. Joey, I'll bet you if you read half those books, you would not have this question. Okay. I'll bet you anything. If you read half the books on that list, you would not have this question. Yeah, I guess tying into the context of that, like I'm creative, I've done a lot of writing, filmmaking, music, and photography. And I keep getting to this like same point with everything. Because you're not in a hard science, dude. You're in a, you go into these fields that are based in like art, but they're based in like, I promise you, bro, maybe, I know this is gonna sound crazy, but if you joined the Marine Corps and learned how to do a fucking L-shaped ambush and got in the best fucking shape of your life, you'd find out, wait a second, maybe it's not all the painting and piano work and art history that I thought it was. Maybe I actually want to accomplish some shit. Maybe that's what my why is. Do you understand what I'm saying? Just something, for me, I know that's, my why is not playing the piano. I know that for a fact, okay? So I would try, I would get as far away from that kind of art history type of major as I could get for a while. And just try to learn some other things, okay? Yeah, gotcha. Play some chess. Yeah, yeah. Something a little bit more analytical and stay away from the artsy stuff. Because honestly, dude, I just, I appreciate the fact that there is art and I appreciate the fact there are artists and some of them are incredible for me. When the fucking zombies show up, we don't fucking need them. When we got to build the building, when you got to fix the dam, we have to fight the war and when we have to put out the fire, thank you for the artists, we don't fucking need you right now. We need men who accomplish shit. I'm not trying to downplay art. I'm not. I'm just saying, there's a reason why your ancestors probably weren't creating art, they were out killing me. Something to think about. You know what I'm saying? This is the life I live and I have no fucking question about what my life is. Yeah, go ahead. Yeah, I guess, can I ask another- Toxic masculinity for your Monday there. Can I ask another question that I've been relating with the manosphere? Like a lot of guys talk about- Oh, sorry. A lot of guys are like really big on getting in the gym and getting in shape, which is what I do and what I'm about. But I'm trying to square it with like, as opposed to boxing, like looking like you're a bodybuilder versus being skinny and wormy, but you can beat the shit out of someone. Which to focus and how to prioritize those two things as a man. We're reading the book Mate right now by Jeffrey Wilson and they talk about this. Also, you'll see Greg O'Gallor talks about this. There's the warrior physique and then there's like the superhero physique. There's the Greek warrior physique, the Greek God physique and the superhero physique. And the reality is, man, while the warrior physique is very attracted to a lot of women, you can't really see it when you have a T-shirt on. The superhero physique, you can see it while you have a T-shirt on. It just depends on what you want, dude. I will tell you this, Joey. Here's the ultimate. This will get me canceled in two seconds, but I'm just going to tell you. Ready? When someone looks at you, do you look like the dude who's going to be somebody's bitch in jail? If you do, let's get in the gym more. That's it. That's it, dude. Like in terms of being successful and living in America and stuff, like guys like Steve Jobs, Steve Aoki, David Bowie, they're all fucking skinny worms, but they're majorly successful and girls want to have sex with them. Steve Aoki is in shape. He's not that skinny. He just, Steve Aoki has like the fucking warrior fitness thing. He's always walking around with his shirt on. He has no fat on his body. He's in pretty good shape. He works out a lot. I guess it's just like going to the gym four times a week is like fucking boring compared to going to boxing class four times a week, learning the Krav Maga and stuff. There's nothing. No one said you don't have to, you can't go to boxing class. It's fine. Yeah, okay. That's fine. There's nothing wrong with that. Build your testosterone. There's nothing wrong with that. Joey, how old are you? 34. Cool. I would get my levels checked. Yeah. That's ultimately a reason why you might not be that focused or find a why. Because your pre-test may be in the 200s. I don't know what it is and I can't tell you to take TRT, but I can tell you, go get your stuff checked. Makes sense. Yeah. Love it. All right guys, four hours and 25 minutes. Thank you guys all for coming on. This is a great time. I'm glad. I'm really proud of all the guys here that are in MOA. It's really fucking cool that so many of you guys came out. We have an incredible year of packed stuff for you. One more time, if you're not in men of action, put a one in the chat. If you're not in men of action, God damn dude, you guys made it four hours and 26 minutes. Put a one in the chat. Okay. At this point, like for fuck's sake, click the link. You just spent four hours and 25 minutes listening to me. I think you're ready for the goddamn program. I think you're ready to do some things to change your life. That it is a life or death situation. And by the way, there's a ton of guys on this program. If you're in MOA, put a two in the chat. If you are currently in men of action, put a two in the chat, put it in there right now. Guys, hit up some of these guys that are in MOA right now. Hit them up and just ask them whether or not this is a thing you should do. Cause I promise you, if money is the issue in the beginning, when you join the program, none of them say money is an issue anymore. We'll help you with all of it. This is a team. This is a family. We try to teach you networking as an evolutionary adaptation. Everything is evidence-based. Almost none of this comes from my opinion. And absolutely none of this program comes from my feelings. All of this program comes from tested, tested techniques and tested ideas. Love it. Cool. Hey, someone asked how much does it cost? It costs this much. It costs you to click that link. That's how much it costs. You gotta click that link. You have to go through the process because I don't care if you have $10 billion. I'm not taking your fucking money if you're not ready for this course. And we're gonna ask you some questions to see if you're ready for this course. We don't just take your fucking money in MOA. There are certain things we need from. We deny people all the time when they're bad fits. All the time. We had somebody the other day, he was saying some kind of very, I'm gonna just say it. He said some borderline antisemitic shit. He was not a good fit for this program. He wasn't a good fit for this program. Okay. People that are just like, they wanted to pay me and then just like bring women to them in their life. We said, no, thank you. We'll tell you, no, thank you. If you're not willing to work, this program is not for you. good for you. Click that link. I will see you guys. I'm about to die here. It's four hours and 28 minutes. Thank you. All right. So a couple of things are going to happen on Tuesday. I'm doing the call with the MOA guys. I'll see you tomorrow on Tuesday. For those of you who didn't ask any questions from MOA, thank you for helping this out tomorrow. It's all about you guys. Okay. Wednesday, I'm, I mean, like I said, I have some huge interviews, at least four of them on Wednesday. On Thursday, I'm going to, who am I doing an interview with? I'm doing an interview with, I forgot what her name is. I've got an hour and 15 minute block where I'm doing an interview at the AVN Awards. On Friday at 11 a.m., we're doing Bridget B's podcast, me and Rollo are. Friday night at 7 p.m., we're doing Access Vegas. Saturday at one something, or three something, I'm doing another interview. I'm not sure with who. And then Saturday night, I drive to Los Angeles. And then Sunday is Babes and Ballers. Okay. You're going to see all that stuff. If you guys want to come out to Babes and Ballers, just go to Babes and Ballers Instagram. You guys can buy a ticket there. And I read a lot of the books on the booklet. Good. Awesome.
