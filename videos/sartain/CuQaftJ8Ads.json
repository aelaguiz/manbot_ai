All the other stuff, the advanced stuff, like break and rapport, the comedy stuff, that comes later. But the main thing that, like, keeps you in the game all the time is when people will talk about themselves vociferously. If you ever watch Lex Friedman or you ever watch Joe Rogan, you'll find there's, like, this actual curiosity.
