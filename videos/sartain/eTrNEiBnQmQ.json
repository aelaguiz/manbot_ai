I mean So it's the difference between like being sort of a doormat and then sort of being like just somebody who's likes I don't know agreeable or or a high level of agreeableness I suppose my the next thing but it's like I think we use the term nice guy and jerk like in in binary extremes Whereas I whenever you ask somebody about this little well, you know, I'm really you know more assertive But I'm not as you know, I'm not really a doormat kind of thing But when we say nice guy when women say nice guy, it means something different when the guy says well I'm really a nice guy So a good person that has no boundaries would be a pushover a good person that has boundaries remember yesterday You were talking about the difference between Captain America and Iron Man and Iron Man Iron Man is a bit of a scoundrel So he's not a good guy and he has boundaries Where's Captain America has boundaries and he's a good person a good person who has boundaries that could be attracted But a good person who doesn't have any boundaries. He's actually isn't a book good person He's just kissing up to you because he wants vagina. So he's actually being deceitful and that's that's where women walk over those guys Well said all right Where do we are here? Okay, I met this beautiful woman in passport fellas dating app a month ago should I take her serious probably not Millionaire Question ladies, would you do it if you caught your son's girlfriend or wife cheating on him? What would you do? Okay, what would you do if you caught your son's girlfriend or wife cheating on him? That's a good one So let's make it simple your son's wife cheating on him. What would you do? We'll start right here miss Venezuela What would you do? I mean, of course we told my son That's it. You just tell her tell him of course. I would tell him and tell him to break the relationship That respect him so so I actually had something similar happen in one of my friend's family and I'm curious if he Didn't break up with her You wouldn't even know That's really interesting. Yeah, no way very similar. It was near. Yeah, I saw something and the family Confronted the boy the guy and and he he took her back the second time. So yeah, I was really interesting Okay, what about you? What would you do if you caught your? son's wife Cheating cheating. I would definitely confront her. I mean it could be circumstantial and I wouldn't know what was going on Like let me know. How would you confront her? I'd pull her aside and be like, hey girl. Um, I know what you're doing and I would want to know all the details and everything like that. And if not, then you wanna know the details you pervert Yeah, what about you what would you also you would actually hear it what if she told you yeah, he just sucks at sex What would you do? I mean, I don't have a son so I can't really relate I don't know Yeah, okay, what if it was your brother? What about you what would you do if you found out that your son's daughter? Sorry son's wife was banging other dudes What'd you do? The first thing you would have to do is make sure you have all the evidence together because that's kind of hard So you got a concrete you saw I would tell them and it would be up to them to do what they want to Would you tell first though? How would you go about this? I'm gonna tell him. Okay in private However, I need to tell him in front of her. I mean, she's not gonna do nothing be like, what are you talking about? So like I would just tell him I Know that you've been cheating on him. No, I would tell him and then I'm his mommy. I mean, I'm not in front of his girl. I mean you got some balls, huh? No, I didn't know I didn't say I would tell him from his girl I would just tell it like if something like that is not something you want to just expose somebody and I'll put them in a vulnerable situation so Yeah, so he can figure out what he would you tell him specifically I would just tell him what I know Okay, let's say you saw you know that she had sex then what would you say I would just tell him what I know and Then I would pretend. I'm your son. I would tell him And I would say, you know Do you know what you deserve? Yeah, and do you feel like this is what you deserve from this person? I love her mom She's my world Okay, so then bitch and then and then I'm gonna say is okay and you can choose to take that route But if anything happens negatively, you know what you continue to deal with at that point mom you cheated on dad What are you doing I would be very disappointed on him. Oh, it's his fault. Hmm I don't think it's his fault, but I would just be like what Wow I'm disappointed in you because you chose a person that would do that a whore. Obviously, I would be mad at her Obviously, but I would you say anything to her? Of course. Okay. How would you go about it? Would you tell him first? Would you go tell her first? I will tell him first and then put them two together to have the conversation. Oh shit All right, and be there myself Okay. Yeah, what if he hits or what the fuck in? I Would If I talk to him like alone, I would want like I expect my son to be raised well because I do come from a very Nice family and taught me a lot of good things. So I would be disappointed in me, too So I'd be like I taught you well, like why did you choose a bring shame upon this family? What are you doing? I think I know what she's doing Yeah, okay, I have I have two sons so I would definitely allow her to Have that conversation with him first. So you go for her first. Yes. How'd you go about it? I would I will I will record it or something. Oh shit. I'll let her know like hey, okay I'm like, I don't know what the hell you got going on Okay, so you're not gonna be too nice about it. No, you got me not with her Would you let's say she talks back crazy. Are you fist finer? No, no, I don't get physical. No, you're not beat her. No I Talk to her husband about it, but I'm gonna let her know what I'm gonna let my son know She doesn't have that conversation. Thank you. Make her what she says. Thank you make no bitch You ain't cuz I'm about to fuck you up. What are you gonna do? No Okay, all right, so what the fuck you want is what you would say, all right fantastic Roscoe, I'm writing it down What about you Venezuela? What would you do? I'll be like you should have tell me you should have tell me I would have covered up I Don't get it wait, so you would help Cheat on him Yeah, why? bro, cuz he's like You're married for so long. He's like you got a feel for a woman. You know, it's like My son will be fine He's probably cheating too I Catch your sons waiting cheating on him What are you doing? So him who's him your son is getting cheated on by his wife. Yeah, what are you doing? Is the mom you find out what you do? With whom first, yeah, who would you talk to first? Okay What'd you say I mean, I don't know Honestly, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. It's your son. Yo, okay, you know what listen to it You just tell him. Hey, son. I don't want you to tell you I don't know Child she gave him AIDS Okay Now let's not say AIDS cuz that was a little Let's say Smashed another guy and potentially might get chlamydia in the future. Hmm. What are you doing? There's nothing I can do because that's that's totally on him. So he'd have to figure it out cuz I mean, it's his decision Would you at least tell him? Tell him what if you knew that his wife was cheating Yeah, I would tell him. Okay, so you wouldn't say I don't know nigga you would tell him something Okay, how would you go about it? Man she gonna have her son talking like Mario wine No, we didn't attempt Simpsons Mario wine is in the bathtub fully clothed crying Brother 2000 Crazy oh god, that is crazy. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. We got it. Wait, we're still on Twitch Yeah, we should have been off twitch. Yo, this one has been as well talked about some crazy shit with her rap music, man You should have been I do want to hear Michael and and Rollo's answer on this though. What'd you do? If it's your son? Oh, I don't know No, of course the first thing you'd be saying is like hey look this is what's up Yeah, I mean you got to be full disclosure at that point, right? as Knowledge is power right? I mean, that's that's a that's that's number one and it's like at that point It's not just a betrayal of like the guy It's also betrayal of the family because when like when would a man and a woman get together and they get married It's not just the man and the woman getting married It's two families getting together right and if there's kids involved in that then they're also affected by that, too So there's a lot more to it than just like oh, what would you you're the father? What would you say? Like or you're the mother. What would you say? It's it's a lot more than just that there's there I mean, it's it's it's it it is Exponentially like effects family friends, and then you know future friends and future family, too the issue Initially would be the cheating and obviously we'd have a conversation But like if that if it continued and he took her back my first question would be as a father What have I done wrong? To to not express to you that you have enough abundance as a man to not accept this type of behavior The only exception obviously would be if there's children involved which I say well It's gonna make things a little bit more complicated But the other thing is I have I have I have 35 cousins the idea like some of them go off the reservation They have beliefs that don't align with mine, but I don't like I don't Excommunicate them as family members, so I try to be as Accommodating as possible because you realize somebody just got cheated on and accepted being cheated on so you Screaming at them probably isn't gonna. It's what they need, but they're probably not gonna be able to handle it They're just not in a good headspace, so you try to help like my thing is I would try to help him I know we can all talk about pull up and scream at the girl or whatever But like this is that you know this is his life, so hopefully I would tell him hey This is a terrible terrible decision.
