Yeah, but I think and I'll say I think every girl to some degree feels that way. I don't think every girl thinks I think every girl thinks that other women are attractive But when it comes to actual sexual intercourse with another girl with a without even a guy being involved I don't think there's levels. I think I think there's fewer than 10% of the population like that Even let's say drunk, right? I don't consider a girl who's drunk who can hook up with a girl. That's not bisexual, correct But like if you're drunk, you're not gonna say or I want to hook up with Dan, right? So here's the thing. So we talked about this before Dan you and I our heterosexuality is tied to our masculinity This is not saying a homosexual man can't be masculine, but generally masculinity is tied to our heterosexuality Femininity is not tied to heterosexuality. Do you understand what I'm saying? Yeah, so what we have is we'll have different layers and we've had different girls on here like Jesse Preston's bisexual She talked about this. Also, we get to a situation where it's um, if you We have a girl who's like she'll take Molly every once in a while or the camera will come out and she'll make out with Some other girl that's not bisexual. No, that is not bisexual curious, right? Correct I'm talking about a woman who would like go on a date with another woman, right? And then if a guy wasn't there or in a situation where I've been with most of girls I've been with recently if I told them you can't see women anymore. They'd be like, well, fuck you I'm not gonna see you anymore, right that that is a completely different thing and that's less than 10% of the population and so that's why I'm saying like One of the problems that I've had especially with a lot of men is that they believe that all women are bisexual and that's just Not true. That's just definitely not I'll say right now Marissa Everhart. I had a conversation with her and she said I absolutely will never kiss Another woman I am only interested in men nothing else and there was another girl in the car who I was talking to and she's like No, I love women all the time. I love women. I love men. It's just not it's just very fluid So different people are different. That's the thing, right? and so the Understanding for me that was the thing that that I learned and I didn't understand that before until I got serious with somebody who was Who was she mentioned before she went seven years and wasn't with a single guy. Does that make sense? yeah, no makes it I think in my experience with women, I I Feel like I feel like to some degree like again, there's levels to it. I mean men don't ever Experiment with other men unless they truly are questioning their sexuality, right? Right, right where women will yeah, and that doesn't mean they're necessarily bisexual. I mean, there's by curious There's I'm by curious what I'm drunk. I mean, there's so many variables to him, but I think women are a lot more Fluid in their sexuality. Yeah, I think some but I think some are just like actually really comfortable with both and some of them It's like again you guys have probably seen this before I have friends It's like once a year for my birthday is like the guy's like, oh, please have a threesome with me for my birthday We'll just see it We'll drink some wine and we'll just see what happens and then I have then there have been women that I've dated and was like Who are we bringing home tonight? I'm like, whoa. I was I wanted to watch Rick and Morty like no We're bringing a girl home tonight for real. It's like yeah, we're fucking don't be a bitch There should be sure look at me like don't be a bitch. I'm like, all right, whatever whatever you want This is two different things right and I've seen the experience of both and so, um I just what really interesting because when I've had some people on here and they're like I absolutely for instance when I had Coffee and cleavage on here. They're not there's none of that at all Yeah period and then some some other girls I talked to they're like, that's absolutely fantastic That's what I want. And then there's someone like I take it or leave it some relations Well, I think the biggest message of all this and whether we're talking about Polyamory swinging. Yeah throuples, whatever you want to call it. What works for one couple hell yeah, yeah may work great for another or absolutely be detrimental and Suicide. Mm-hmm. And that's what I think people don't understand about anything. It's not considered conventional There's so many things working for so many different people and most conventional and I'm talking conventional white picket fence Marriages that I know. Mm-hmm are miserable Yeah, so let's talk about that 53% of marriages in this country and in divorce and 78% of those divorces are initiated by guess who Cheating women. Oh, they're initiated by females So so it is one of these situations where something is broken in it and what I've talked about before is it's not the cheating It's the lying the lying is the problem, right? And the first thing you guys said is this is who I am and you will accept it and then that's what made it That's what made it work for the two of you, right? Well, and I think that was probably one of our keys Yeah and it goes past like I mean even just little things like you know, this is how I am in an argument like I'm not A person that Closes up their emotions. I want to talk. I want to talk about it to death She wasn't like that, but she understood I was so we could come to a common ground Very early on was that work? So that was an issue. So did you ever do you not like confrontation? Um, I Wasn't taught to communicate very well. Okay, I My parents are Polish, I mean I adore my parents, but I think the European culture in general We just don't discuss things. Yeah, like if you feel a certain way, okay, you feel it Like you don't go home to your parents and you say this happened at school today. This is what I feel This is how I was made felt None of that like none of that. So to me if like if I was anxious, it was like you'll be fine You know if I was heartbroken, it's okay, you know, but you never kept score, right? Okay, so that's that's the main issue that I see all the times with couples where you'll have people they're like There's an issue right now. I'm not gonna bring it up But a month later when we get into an argument, I'm gonna bring you guys never do that Okay, I mean if anything she must be again. Can we stop talking about this? Like right it's done Yeah, but you but you don't keep score and that's what's important No, so that's that's that's kind of one of the the tenets of passive aggressive communication \", \"segments\": [{\"id\": 0, \"seek\": 0, \"start\": 0.0, \"end\": 2.0, \"text\": \" I only date girls who like girls.\", \"tokens\": [50364, 286, 787, 4002, 4519, 567, 411, 4519, 13, 50464], \"temperature\": 0.0, \"avg_logprob\": -0.3380890488624573, \"compression_ratio\": 1.9158878326416016, \"no_speech_prob\": 0.022974031046032906}, {\"id\": 1, \"seek\": 0, \"start\": 2.0, \"end\": 6.559999942779541, \"text\": \" Yeah, but I think and I'll say I think every girl to some degree feels that way.\", \"tokens\": [50464, 865, 11, 457, 286, 519, 293, 286, 603, 584, 286, 519, 633, 2013, 281, 512, 4314, 3417, 300, 636, 13, 50692], \"temperature\": 0.0, \"avg_logprob\": -0.3380890488624573, \"compression_ratio\": 1.9158878326416016, \"no_speech_prob\": 0.022974031046032906}, {\"id\": 2, \"seek\": 0, \"start\": 6.559999942779541, \"end\": 10.0, \"text\": \" I don't think every girl thinks I think every girl thinks that other women are attractive\", \"tokens\": [50692, 286, 500, 380, 519, 633, 2013, 7309, 286, 519, 633, 2013, 7309, 300, 661, 2266, 366, 12609, 50864], \"temperature\": 0.0, \"avg_logprob\": -0.3380890488624573, \"compression_ratio\": 1.9158878326416016, \"no_speech_prob\": 0.022974031046032906}, {\"id\": 3, \"seek\": 0, \"start\": 10.0, \"end\": 14.640000343322754, \"text\": \" But when it comes to actual sexual intercourse with another girl with a without even a guy being involved\", \"tokens\": [50864, 583, 562, 309, 1487, 281, 3539, 6701, 728, 31913, 365, 1071, 2013, 365, 257, 1553, 754, 257, 2146, 885, 3288, 51096], \"temperature\": 0.0, \"avg_logprob\": -0.3380890488624573, \"compression_ratio\": 1.9158878326416016, \"no_speech_prob\": 0.022974031046032906}, {\"id\": 4, \"seek\": 0, \"start\": 14.640000343322754, \"end\": 18.440000534057617, \"text\": \" I don't think there's levels.
