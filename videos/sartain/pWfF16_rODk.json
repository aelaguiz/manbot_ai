I'm really excited. We've got a terrific guest today, somebody I've been waiting to have on for a long time, also a Las Vegas logo. She is a model, fantastic model. She's a real estate investor. She's a content creator. She's in the top .07% of all creators on OF. She has an incredibly, incredibly interesting story, and I'm really excited to have her on today. It's Brandy Andrews. How are you doing today, Brandy? I'm doing great. Yes, I'm really excited. So yesterday, I was asking you for like a bio, and then you started sending me all these things that had happened. And I knew some of the stories. I knew about the brain aneurysm. I knew about one of your exes being killed. I did not know about the kidnapping. I didn't know about all the other stuff that we've talked about. And the thing is, Brandy, you understand, I'm sure you've probably had a situation where you've told the stories about your life, and people are like, that's not true. No, it's all fucking documented. All the stuff that you talked about, which was mind-blowing when I went through all the stuff that happened. So there's a lot here to unpack. If you guys are watching, trust me, you are not going to want to miss this one. So let's go over this. You were born in San Pablo, California, and then you guys, why did you relocate to Mississippi? What happened there? My dad was involved with a lot of people in California. He wasn't very well liked. And I was, he got me in a lot of situations, and it got to a point where they just kind of stepped in, pulled our family inside, and was like, you guys just need to get her out of here for her own safety. So we relocated to Mississippi for nine months, and then to Texas. This was a function where your dad was involved with like some criminal organizations and had to get away from them? Correct. This is in Northern California? Yes. Okay. And so you go out there, and then your upbringing there, something happened where your father, okay, you were kidnapped and your father killed people in front of you? Is this what happened? Well, for, yeah, not in that order, but yeah. So what happened? Can you describe it? Okay, so let me start from the beginning. So my mom had my sister when she was about 16 years old. So obviously she was in high school. My grandparents knew about it. They took custody of her, you know, then four years later when she was 20, she had dropped out of high school. She was homeless, doing drugs. My dad was a big time drug dealer out there, so he had got her kind of hooked, whatever. And she was living on the streets. When she was 20, she had me, but she didn't tell anyone in my family because they'd already taken my sister, and she was like, I don't want the hassle. So I was living on the streets with my mom until I was about two years old. That's not legal. So when it was discovered, you know, they came, got me, gave me to my grandparents. They also took custody of me when I was two. And then my dad said, no, no, like I want to take her. So he got me after that. I was with him till I was about four and he used to take me on drug deals with them all the time. My dad's side of the family is Mexican, so it's not weird for him to be like, we're going to go see your cousin, your cousin, your cousin. Like I thought everybody was my cousin. So he takes me on this drug deal kind of gone wrong with him. I'd been on a million with him before. So we walked into the house. I go, I'm sitting on the guy's couch and he had a boxer. I was a little kid, you know, playing with his dog. And I remember he looked at me and said, if you're really good and you stay on the couch and you know, you behave, then you can have him when you leave. And as a four year old, I'm like, Oh fuck. Yeah, I'm about to get this dog, you know? So I'm sitting on the couch and I'm sitting here, the kitchen's in front of me and they go down this hallway to the right into a back room to do whatever it is they're doing. And within a few minutes, I just heard some gunshots go off. There was four guys total in the house. So at this point I have no idea what happened. I don't know if my dad's dead or if my dad's the one who shot somebody or you know what. So I'm sitting on the couch, I get off the couch, I kind of pull it away from the wall and I crawl behind it and I just laid there for, I, I have no idea how much time went by. And then eventually I felt someone pull the couch away from the wall. And when I looked up, there was a bunch of cops and everything there. So, um, they took me, put me in the back of the cop car. I'm just sitting there just staring at the house waiting to see who comes out. Um, my dad and another man come out in handcuffs and then I see a body bag and I don't know what happened to the fourth person. And then, uh, they took me away. So then, um, my mom had lost custody of me at two. My dad loses custody at four and then my grandparents finally get charged with murder at this point. Um, I don't know what he was that my family kept his criminal background, a huge secret from me for the most part. I don't know what he was officially charged with. I don't know what he went to prison for, but he did go to prison after that. Um, and then when he was out on bond, I saw him a few more times and it was just all traumatic experiences. At the time it wasn't traumatic because I didn't know any different. So I thought like this is normal, but you know, he'd get us on the weekends. And at that point me and my sister were going and seeing him together and I became very, very close to my sister. She was four years older than me. And, um, she was kind of the only comfort and safety I had in my family. So when we would go visit him and he had to go on drug deals at that point, he learned his lesson not to take us. So he would, he would zip tie us. Um, and again, I, I didn't know how fucked up this was until later in life when I'm like telling my friends and they're like, bro, that's really fucked up. And I was like, my mind, like I wasn't being hurt, you know? So he, he'd zip tie our wrists and ankles and, and just put some cartoons on and leave us in the living room. So go do what he had to do and then come back and snip us loose. That's incredible, man. I did the zip tie thing. I did not know about that. Yeah. I actually learned how to break out of zip ties because yeah. Yeah. Turn them. So you got to put like where the zip tie actually connects, you got to put it at the top of your wrist, hold your hands together, push apart, lift it over your head and crack it over your knee. It doesn't matter how strong you are, but you can, you can break it. All right. Well, there we go. First, first, uh, first practical piece of information we got here. And then we would read zip tie ourselves where he got home. So he didn't know that we knew how to get out. Oh my God, man. That's incredible. Uh, all right. So now in this situation, uh, man, I'm, there's so much stuff here. So you, obviously in this situation, this is not a tenable family situation. When does CPS get involved and you end up, you're not living with your father anymore? When, when the shooting happened. So when, when I was going and visiting him, when he was out on bond after that, he was, I was visiting him. He would live with his mom and dad. So I was visiting my other grandparents, but it was, it was his way of seeing me. Okay. Got it. And then that's when you moved to Texas to, or with your aunt? No, no, no. Or your grandma, my grandmother. So, um, after that I was, I want to, I don't know a timeframe. I was so young and like my mind's really messed up with memory. Um, but after that I was, I was playing in my grandparents' front yard and these guys came by and snatched me out of the front yard and, um, threw me in a van, went to some house and just threw me in the living room. I was watching cartoons and I knew I had been kidnapped, but like, it's not like in the movies, like nothing bad happened. I was just sitting in a living room watching cartoons, but I knew that I wasn't somewhere I was supposed to be. And I knew I was in trouble. I knew my grandma didn't know where I had gone. I knew I'd been kidnapped. And so, um, I was in the living room and I remember them making some phone calls to my dad and they let him know that they had me, I guess he had owed them some money, something along the lines of that. And I'll never forget. Um, he, when they were on the phone, they told me, had me and told him they needed the money, like whatever. He just said, you know, he said, do what you got to do. And at that point I, I hated my dad because I knew he wasn't coming. Yeah. Did you, you didn't think he was bluffing? You thought he did that before? I knew he wasn't. Okay. You thought that's where, and then after like, you know, throughout my life, I, I, he did more things that made me realize he wasn't bluffing, but, um, yeah, no. And so my mom at the time was dating this guy. He was part of hell's angels. Those are, I think she's still with them. Um, and she caught wind of what was going on. She never really got involved in any of my dad's stuff and she never got involved in my life at all. When she found out what happened, I was sitting there and it was same day. I'd only been there for a couple hours and they came fucking blowing through the front door. Um, they walked to the living room table and they put a sticky note on the table with an address. I'm assuming I'm pretty sure it was my dad's address and they hand, they handled the guys. They came, they grabbed me, threw me on the back of one of the, well, not the back, but like held me on the front of one of the bikes. And I guess it wasn't that far from my house. And they drove me straight back to my grandparents house, dropped me off and just left. Never saw him again. Wow. Okay. That's, that's, that's crazy. And then you also had a situation where when you went to go live with your grandparents, it wasn't that much better. No. So then at that point, I think that was when they had, there was a lot of like officials at our house all the time. I don't know. During this time. All right. So maybe you're four or five years old. Are there any sort of developmental issues that you're having at this point? Like it was school or anything like that? Because I mean, this is an unbelievable amount of trauma to deal with at that age. Not that I'm aware of, but where I grew up, so I was born in San Pablo, but I was raised in Richmond. So where I grew up, I was minority. And, um, there was, there was a lot of way crazier stuff going on around me at school with my other friends. So like, in my mind, like you, you can't miss what you never had. Like, I thought this was normal, not normal, but I didn't think it was that crazy. Um, and then it got to a point where, like I said, the officials came to our house and was basically like, Hey, like she's not okay. Like she's, she's in danger just being here. Like you guys need to consider relocating. My grandpa had a job offer in Texas. We relocated to Mississippi for nine months and then relocated to Houston, Texas, which is where I grew up. And I was in third or fourth grade once we got there. Okay. And then the situation with your grandparents. So my grandma was really hesitant to leave California because my mom's sister, my aunt, um, she was schizophrenic and she was in the house. She, I was also raised around that. And I had no idea what that was. No one really did back then. And, um, she wouldn't take her medications, thing like that. So my grandma thought, you know, when we leave something bad, it's going to happen to her. I can't leave her. I can't leave her. Well, she basically had to make a decision between me and her. So she left, left my aunt there with, you know, my mom and her boyfriend and they started like, she's safe. We got her, we got her. And I think we had been, we were still in Mississippi. So it only had been a few months after we left and she ended up killing herself. So, um, my grandma immediately blamed me for that. You know, she, she had to get on antidepressants. Um, on top of that, she was a big wino. So that those two mixtures wasn't good. And then she became really, really just like your grandmother who's an adult is blaming you for someone else committing suicide. I think she just had a hard time accepting what happened. She knew that she had to make a decision for my safety. She moved for my safety. And then when she did, yeah, she was, she already had a bad feeling leaving her daughter. And when she did something bad happened. And I think that was just her way of dealing with it. And I don't blame her for that, but she, yeah, she, she was very upset and was just, and she, she looked at me the second she got the phone call and it happened. She said, you know, this is your fault. Right. And I'll never, I was eight years old and, um, no, maybe I was sick. It was my timeframe. It's so messed up. I was young, but I'll never forget it. And I just, I felt terrible. And, um, yeah, she got back on the, or yeah, back on her antidepressants started drinking. And then when she came back, it was just, she really let out a lot of her anger and problems on me. Is this, uh, this grandma related to your father or your mother? Okay. Uh, yeah. I mean, the reason why I'm asking is because it feels like that is, uh, maybe it's a symptom of grief or PTSD, but it also sounds like somebody who's a narcissist, you know, saying something like that to a child that that is like, so out of bounds for normal psychological behavior to blame a six-year-old child for someone to commit suicide. And I'm not saying I'm, she meant, she meant like, she knew if she left her daughter, that something bad was probably going to happen. And she meant we had to leave because of me. So she was saying like, this is, it doesn't matter. Like for, her to put that on you is like incredibly irresponsible, you know? And that's why I'm saying it's like, sometimes the reason why I bring this up, this is a podcast about human evolution and genetics. And like, sometimes a lot of people don't realize that, you know, Marilyn Monroe suffered from schizophrenia and certain medical disorders and psychosis. And then her father, her mother did, and her grandmother did also. And, you know, we didn't understand what those things meant back then, or we didn't understand that they were genetic. Like for instance, people understand that eye color, height and hair color are genetic. They have no question about that. You have two Hispanic people, have a child and child's going to come out looking Hispanic. But what people have a hard time believing in like mental illness or the idea that intelligence is heritable. They don't, they have a hard time with that. They'd be like, no, no, my baby's going to go to this preschool and he's going to be a genius. And I was like, no, because you and your husband aren't geniuses. That's probably not going to happen. So it's one of these things where we, you know, we talk about genetics. And the reason why I asked that is because you've mentioned multiple family members that are like displaying type B personality disorders. And right. And that's why I'm asking, because you seem well adjusted. I remember the first time, just how you and I met, we were sitting on the bus coming from, uh, uh, Sanctuary Air Force or Sanctuary, uh, airport in, in Montego Bay. And we were driving all the way to Negril and I sat next to you and I, and, and you reminded me of some of my, your personality is very similar to some of my closest friends like CJ Sparks and kindly and stuff like that. So we got along very like immediately. And, um, listening to you talk, you're definitely an empathetic person. You're not obviously not a psychopath. I could tell immediately from talking to you. And so that's why I'm asking this question. Cause you do seem well for what you've gone through, girl, you are incredibly well adjusted. You are like, like it's unbelievable. So that's why, that's why I was asking the question because man, that's a lot to, you know, unpack. And you said you've worked on this in therapy, right? Not in therapy. I've done therapy, but it, that's not what helped me. No, no, I don't believe in for me personally. I mean, anybody else that's working for good for them, but no, I've, I've learned that it's meditation. What is it? Yeah. 100%. So it's crazy. I actually started getting into Dr. Joe Dispenza. And, um, I, the more I was learning and he's talking about thoughts and emotions, you know, creating a reality and all this stuff. And then it's like, when I was going into therapy, I was thinking and feeling all of my past traumas and I was leaving there feeling like shit and I was feeling worse. And then, and so I'm like, okay, if thoughts and emotions are what attracts something to you, why am I going to therapy and thinking and feeling these things every single fucking week? Like it was killing me. And then at the end of last year, I got extremely suicidal and I've never been like that in my entire life. And I was, I was not okay. Yeah. So then this year, uh, around February, I started reading his books and then I actually went to his retreat in June. I mean, like as soon as I read his book, I steamroll through five of them in like weeks. And then I, in his books, he talks about his, his students and things like that. And I was like, I want to be a student. And I got on one of his retreats like immediately. And I just started working on myself and yeah, the meditations a hundred percent is what helped me. Have you read the power of now? No, I haven't. No, that was a book. My father was killed by a drunk driver. And like the same year, my girlfriend leaves me when I'm, I'm deployed over the Middle East. It's not her fault. Like, I don't blame her. I was really upset at the time, but like, I was deployed to the Middle East. I get. You know what I'm saying? And that happened all around the same time. And I know this is not nearly as big of a deal, but it's the same week that the Mavericks end up losing in the NBA finals to the Heat. And I'm just like, I'm just like looking at like, you know, like right after my dad dies, right? My favorite basketball team loses in the NBA finals. It was just like, it just seemed like the world was coming down on me. And that was the first time I can say I was suffering from depression. And, you know, I was a first lieutenant in the Air Force. And I found that book and it changed my life. And then later on a book called The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck by Mark Manson, which is- I've read that. You've read that? Yeah, about we get to choose what we care about, right? So that's like the most important thing because I have a feeling, and I don't know this personally, but I have a feeling that like, there are things that other influencers you deal with can't handle that you can handle pretty easily because of previous tribulations you've gone through. Yeah, I would agree with that. I mean, I would not change my past if I had the opportunity, not one bit. I came out a way better person because of it. And I can handle like, nothing's a big deal anymore. Right. And I like that though, because now my life is kosher. Like it's so, like my house could be on fire, everything could be falling apart and I'm just sitting there, I'll laugh about it and I'll be like, it's okay. Yeah. Well, talking about this, so you do have, you have two children, your first baby's daddy, you meet him at this point, like when you're in Texas? Yeah, so again, I was raised in Houston. Growing up, I would say between the ages of eight and 14, I experienced horrific abuse, mentally, verbally, physically, all kinds of ways for my grandmother. She really resented me for what happened to her daughter. And then, you know, when I was in high school, I think it was like right when I turned 14, my grandpa got a job offer in China. And he was probably like the only person in my family I felt even semi safe or comfortable around. And then he had to move to China. And now it was just me and my grandmother in this house. My sister at this point, she had been, you know, experiencing her own stuff with my grandmother as well. And she had bailed out of house when she was 16, went to go live with her friends that were older. And so she was gone. It was just me and my grandma and it was the worst time of my fucking life. And so I was just always gone. I was always at my friend's house. I was never home. I was trying to just never be there as much as I could. And then, yeah, when I was about 14, my sister hit me up because the abuse I was experiencing at home got public. It got to the point where my school was getting involved, things like that, because I was coming to school really messed up. I was missing events and they knew why. Cops were getting called to my house all the time. So my sister caught wind of it. And I hadn't seen her since she left when she was 16. And she came back around and she had left a note in my mailbox. And she said, you know, like I've got a place, me and my boyfriend live together. If you need to get out, like come stay with me. Just pack your shit and come stay. And I was kind of hesitating because I was bitter that she left me and I hadn't seen her in four years. So I was just kind of gypsing my way around. So I had a lot of like best friends growing up in high school. And I went and lived with a friend Cody for a while. I was living with Mike for a while. Chris, Marcus, I was living with a lot of my guy friends that I grew up with. And you got to think in high school, like there's no sleepovers on school nights and well-rounded families had these rules. So when I could go stay at one of my guy friends' houses for months and like basically live with them and their parents didn't care, I was probably not in a much better environment or situation than I was already in. So I was kind of leaving one toxic environment for another, but it was okay because it wasn't happening to me. So I was experiencing, and I thought that again, I'm like around all these people in these dysfunctional houses and I'm like, this is normal. So then eventually I go live with my sister. I'm in the, she worked in the bar. So I was in the bar industry at a very young age. I started bouncing around with friends. I'm living with this guy, Chris, and he was best friends with my first baby daddy. So that's how we met. And at this point, fast forward to like, I'm 20, 20, 2021. So you've known this guy for five years at this point? No, no, no, no, no, no. This is like me living with different friends, living with my sister. Now I'm living with this guy and I meet him. I meet him when I'm like 2021. And we're, it was spring break in South Padre. Guys, if you guys don't know about that, if you grew up in Texas, man, we would go to South Padre Island, bro. If you ever seen this old, ratchet as shit, bro. Girls Gone Wild, like Destin, Florida has nothing on the disgusting nature of South Padre Island, bro. There are still, their disease is still floating in the fucking water. I didn't know you knew about that, man. Girl, I'm from East Dallas. Of course, I am a Texas Longhorn. Of course I know about South Padre Island. Go ahead. So yeah, that's where we met. Yeah, you guys met. So much more embarrassing that you know about it. And we were hanging out, you know, it was whatever. And we get back at this point, like I had never done or touched drugs in my life. I was a huge weed smoker and that was about it. I didn't do anything. So we go there and I'd start, you know, dobbling with coke and other things. And then I just. Wait, so just so we can understand, from the time you're 15 to the time you're 20, you're just living with friends. Yes, and my sister. Did you finish high school? Did you get a GED or something? Okay. No, I finished high school. You finished high school. What high school did you go to? Klein Collins. Okay, in Houston. Spring, Texas. Okay, got it, okay. And so you come out of there, and then this is two years after you graduate from high school, still hanging out with friends. This is when you meet your dude. Yeah. Yeah, okay. And then you guys are partying in South Padre and like you do. Yeah, yeah. And then like I said, I had never touched drugs before, and I started dabbling in and out there. And I went from zero to 100 real quick. I was doing everything, and he was my main source. Enabler. Yeah. Yeah. Like no other. Like I remember in our relationship, I would be sleeping and he would wake me up with like a fucking line of coke, couple pills, Red Bull, and some peanut M&M's. And that was my fucking meal for the day. So a lot of people don't understand contextually. So from probably, you know, early 90s to like 2010, even to this point now, this is South Texas. So you guys know what's south of South Texas? Mexico. Like you guys think other cities have drug problems. You have no idea what it's like. People, like it is so easy to procure drugs when you like live in Miami, Houston, or you know, Phoenix, or even San Diego, because those cities, that's where they're getting, the stuff's getting sent through. There was a crack epidemic in like Baton Rouge, New Orleans, Dallas, Houston. Oh, well when I was in high school, that was when the hurricane hit Louisiana and everybody from New Orleans came to our high school. So a lot of people also don't understand this. When Katrina happens in 03, I believe it is, is that right? So what happens is Baton Rouge becomes the murder capital of the United States because there's so many people who moved from New Orleans to Baton Rouge. And Houston. And Houston, and Oklahoma City, and Shreveport, and Dallas. And so you started seeing like an uptick in gang violence because these guys who had blocks in New Orleans were coming to Dallas, or San Antonio, or Houston. And you saw a massive uptick in crime during that period in 03. All my friends were getting murdered. But you gotta think, I came from Richmond, California to Houston, Texas. Again, this is all I know. So like I don't know that this is not normal. And yeah, I mean all my friends were being murdered, raved, like it was very common. Yeah, yeah. This is kind of like the Paul Wall, DJ Screw. Grew up with him. Slim Thug. Yeah, Slim Thug, UGK. Zero. Era of Houston rap music. And that's part of where that whole culture came from. All right, so now this happens, and you meet this dude, and then you're 20, this guy's enabling you. Our relationship lasted five months. It was just, he was a stripper. He was a stripper, and I worked at an after hours spot at the time, and so he would come in and see me. And like I said, he was friends with my group of friends, and no one thought anything of it. We were just hooking up at the time. And then it became like a little more serious dating, if that's what you even want to call it. And my friends were always like telling me too. They were like, dude, like this guy keeps you on drugs. Like if you were not on drugs, you would not even be messing with him. Like what are you doing? Do you recognize that now when you see it in other people? Yes. Because that was a problem for me growing up in Texas during that time. And I know three, I'm managing a strip club at that point. And I see the same thing where there are girls that are like, these guys are so far beneath these women, but these girls are like strung out. And it's a common thing that I saw happen over and over. I've never tried cocaine. I've never smoked marijuana. I've never been drunk. So like for me, it was just a very different reality, but I saw it all the time, and you can see it in other people. Yeah, I mean, you had a clear perspective though. I did not. I was like, I said, if I started, and I can see it now too, because when I would start to sober up, I would lose interest, and I would kind of start to distance myself from him. And that's when he would come in and like load me up again. And then I was all about him. I kind of think I saw it at the time too. I just didn't care. And so I was just, in my mind, I'm 21. This is what 21 year olds do. I'm having fun. Like, it's not a big deal. I didn't realize I had a problem. And I mean, I wasn't just doing a line of blow or something in the bathroom when I was drunk. I was waking up doing blow. I was painkillers. I was taking, oh my God. When I went to the hospital, so he gets arrested. We had an incident in a hotel. Like I said, five months thing. We had an incident in a hotel where the cops were called. He beating the shit out of me and was trying to like strangle me with the phone cord. It was like this whole thing. The lady at the front desk, I guess, had seen our altercation in the lobby before we got to our room and had already called the cops. So thankfully she did that because they got to the room like right when things were getting pretty bad. They got me out of there. I was so, I don't even really remember that night. I just remember waking up. My friend had came and got me and he was in jail. And so when he finally went to jail, I was like, I'm getting sober. Like I'm done partying. I'm gonna get back on my shit. You know, only my bills were paid. I was fine. I didn't think I had a problem. So I'll never forget. I went to bed that night and I, you know, where you fall asleep in the middle of the day and you wake up, it's dark outside and you don't know what happened. I had been asleep for 16 hours. And I woke up sweating like so bad. I was drenched. I was like, what the hell? Wash the bed sheets, take a shower, go to sleep. Same thing again, next day. And then each time I was waking up, I was feeling weaker and weaker. And I was like, oh my God, I have the flu. And I could barely drive myself to the hospital. So I finally get to the hospital. I tell him, I think I have the flu. They run these tests on me. And the doctor comes in with a clipboard. He says, I need you to circle every drug that you've done in the last 30 days. And so I'm circling everything. I'm writing things on there. They didn't even have all this stuff. And he comes back and he says, no. And he's tapping, he says, I think you forgot one. I'm like, bro, I've circled everything on there. What do you mean? He's tapping on heroin. I said, I've never done heroin a day in my life. I don't even know what it looks like. I didn't do it. Did you try MDMA and maybe it was cut with heroin? Nope. So he says, okay, well, you wrote on here that you're taking prescription painkillers. Like, how many are you taking a day? I said, 20, 30 if I want to get fucked up. God damn. And he just, his jaw drops the entire stat. Everyone's looking at me like, and I didn't think anything of it, you know? And he says, okay, well, you have so many opiates in your system that you are failing for heroin. Like, they had to put me on Suboxone to get me off. Like, it was crazy. And again, I didn't think I had a problem. I was like, I'm just partying, I'm 21. You guys want to know something crazy? Do you know, I don't know if you know this, George. Do you know where we get a lot of opium, like illegal heroin in this country? Do you know where we get it from? Illegal heroin? Illegal heroin. Do you know where a lot of it's grown? I do not. Illegal poppy fields in Afghanistan. Do you know where we get the opioids for the painkillers that we sell in this country? Anybody want to guess? Afghanistan. The poppy fields in Afghanistan. It's exact, it is the same. It's the same poppy fields. That is the number one export out of that country. And a lot of people don't realize, it's that they think that there's this massive difference when they get Oxycontin or when they're taking heroin. No, we're just a couple molecules off. This is the reason why some of these pharmaceutical companies were sued for billions of dollars. Well, what people don't realize nowadays too is back then, and especially in Houston, there used to be strip malls with these stores and it would say pain and back doctor. And you'd walk in and say, my back hurts and they'd write you a script and then you'd go a street over and say, hey, my back hurts and they'd write you a script and it was always for painkillers and they'd always combine it with like stomas. And you could literally just hit up five a day and they had no idea, nor did they care. Nowadays, you can't get painkillers if your life needed it. But like, it was so accessible. Got that purple drink. Got that purple drink with the pomethazine in it. So yeah, that's the thing. When you said that, my first thought was, so what happens is your body normally produces painkillers, opioids, your body normally does that. Just like if you continually take steroids, your body stops producing testosterone. If you start taking exogenous steroids, your body stops producing testosterone. If you start taking opioids internally, exogenous opioids, your body will stop producing opioids. When you come off of the heroin or the painkillers, your body doesn't know what to do, right? It's just like if you ever seen a guy get off roids, he gets very weak after a while because his body's not producing testosterone normally and it takes a while for his body to catch up. But it's not that painful. What you went through would have been incredibly painful because your body had no ability to fight its own individual pains. Does that make sense? Yeah, and now, I mean, they have it all on record. When I go to the doctor now, I'm not allowed to be prescribed painkillers because of it. So I, again, and the doctor explained to me, he said, if you wouldn't have came into the hospital, eventually you would just went to sleep and not woken up with what you were experiencing. And then that's when I realized, maybe I had a little bit of a problem. And so then I'm just like, all right, well, I'm done. I'm done. The Suboxone's gonna get me clean, I'm good. And I literally just made the decision to get sober and I didn't go to rehab, I did nothing. And so fast forward, like four months, this is crazy because I didn't know this was possible, but four months goes along, weird signs are happening. Some girl made a comment about you're probably pregnant. So I stopped at Walgreens. I got two boxes of pregnancy tests. I didn't know there's three in each, so I had like six. So you're still seeing this dude after you get clean? No, no, he's in jail and he gets out and we just are not talking to each other. So this is the end of the five months period, you get pregnant by him and then find out about it afterwards. This is four months after now. So we hadn't spoken or been cool with each other for a few months. And yeah, she made a comment about me being pregnant. I'm like, that's impossible, because I'm not having sex, can't get pregnant. And I hadn't been with anybody. And so I just grabbed a vitamin water, two packs of six pregnancy tests. And I go home and I streamline piss on all of them, like just knocking them out. Because I remember she was like, get the ones that say pregnant or not pregnant, not the ones with the lines. So I get them and it's just pregnant, pregnant, pregnant. One said error. And I was like, oh, error. I was in such denial, I was in such denial. Drive myself immediately to Planned Parenthood. And I'm like, hey, like I, you know, I call my best friend, Chris, and I'm huge stoner, huge stoner. He's like, oh, I was watching the show on National Geographics. And I've heard like, you can eat something and it'll say you're pregnant when you're not pregnant. You probably just ate something bad. So I'm like, yeah, that's it. So I go to Planned Parenthood, I get there and they're like, no, never take the electronic ones, always do the ones with two lines. So they pregnancy test me and she's like, oh yeah, you're real pregnant. I said, what do you mean real pregnant? She's like, the faster the lines show up, the more further along you are. Did not know that. And so I'm like, no, and I told her, I said, I watched this thing on National Geographics, I think I ate. something bad. She's looking at me, like shaking her head. And then I'm like, can you draw my blood? And she's like, why? And then she's rolling her eyes. She's getting upset with me. She walks out and she comes back in with a packet I'll never forget. And it's got this stork on the front. It's carrying a baby. It says congratulations, you're a mom. And then I flipped the next page and it's a list of abortion clinics. She didn't say anything to me. She just saw how in denial I was, threw that at me and told me, have a nice day. And she said you need to figure out real quick cause you're, you're about four months along. And I was like, Oh my God, the state of Texas at that time, you third trimester, you cannot have an abortion. I had friends that were having abortions at eight months. Wow. Okay. Yeah. And so I'm just like, I'm in shock at this point. Right. Okay. So I, I, I don't know what I'm going to do. I'm calling all my friends. And it was, it was just the worst experience ever. Like I'm calling my friends, like, Oh my God, I'm pregnant. And it, and obviously no one's going to congratulate me, but just like the depressing like tones on the other end of them being like, Oh my God, what are you going to do? Well, like, if you need to get abortion, I'm here for you. Like I'll go with you to the clinic. Like this is that I'm like, fuck man. So I hadn't seen my grandma in forever. And I don't even know why. I guess it's because it was the only family I had. I drive to her house and you know, she's sitting there and I walk into her office. I haven't seen her in forever. I'll never forget. She's sitting in her chair on the computer. Doesn't even turn around to say hi to me. And I was like, Hey, I have to tell you something. And she says, let me guess you're pregnant. And I said, yeah. And she said, well, was it an accident? And I said, yeah. And she goes, then treat it like one. And that was all she said. And I just got up and walked out of her house. I was like, man, fuck this. And you know, I had friends who got pregnant in high school at 15, 16 and they were doing good. And I was like, if they can do it, like I can do it. You know what I mean? Like I'm not, and I'm not, you know, you know, anybody who's had an abortion, it's not nothing against them. But I was just like, it's not for me. And like, I can do this. Yeah. So I had the kid, I immediately hit up the dad, Phillip. And I was said, you know, Hey. And I told him and he basically said either get an abortion or never talked to me again. I was like, well, I wasn't planning on talking to you ever again. Anyways, it was just being nice, letting you know. Yeah. So there was the end of that. Um, my best friend, Lexi, who I grew up with since I was like 14, her mom did a lot of raising me as well as her. And, um, I hit her mom actually ran into me at Planned Parenthood. She'd just gotten out of rehab and she's like, what are you doing here? Like come live with me. I'm sober now. Like this will be great. I'll help you out. It was the only help I had. So I go and I start living with my best friend's mom from high school. She's helping me with the kid. Um, you know, I have him, he's beautiful, healthy. Thank God he was healthy. Cause I had been doing all those drugs when I was pregnant with him. I didn't even know. And, um, healthy, beautiful baby comes out. And her mom's helping me. I was working at Hooters at the time. And it was right down the street. So her mom would watch him for me while I go to work. I had her and Lexi helping me. And I don't know what I would have done without them. I'm at work one day and someone sends me a text message and says, Oh my God, I'm so glad Philip decided to step up and be a dad. And I'm like, what are you talking about? And they sent me a picture of him holding my son. And I was like, this has like this Photoshop, like what the fuck happened? So I call Lexi cause she's my only friend at the time. And I'm like, Oh my God, like, did you see this photo? Like this picture, what happened? Like, you know, I'm asking her cause I'm dumbfounded. And she thinks I caught on. And she says, I'm so sorry. Like I didn't, I didn't know how to tell you, but we've been dating for three months. Oh my God. So the whole time I was going to work. Oh my God. He was going to my mom and best friend's house to see the kid. Cause they had been dating. And I'm like, I wasn't even expecting that answer. I was expecting her to be like, Oh my God, girl, that's crazy. But they were, they were dating. And so I'm like the fuck, you know? And I get off work. I'm kind of shocked. Like I'm going to the house to try to figure out how I'm going to deal with this. All my shits in the front yard, all my shits in the front yard. Cause she was so terrified, I guess of how I was going to react. And I'm like the most level headed. I'm the most understanding person ever. Like I, I don't even think it would have ended that badly, but then they threw my shit out, all this stuff. And I'm just like call my only other friend I have. I'm like, Hey, like never guess what's going to happen. Like, listen, whoever's dating my ex right now, have lay have good luck to you. Godspeed. I don't, I wouldn't be mad at them. Or were you mad at this girl? No. And that's the thing. I wasn't mad. She was dating him. I'm mad that she didn't have the like respect enough to tell me and ask me. And it's not even the dating. It's the fact that you took something from me that I'll never get back. And you introduced my son to his dad for the very first time in his life. They had pictures under a fucking Christmas tree together, like a little family. Like she did all this. She took that from me. That's what I was mad about. And it wasn't something I couldn't have talked out with her, but then her reaction of like avoiding me and throwing my shit out. Like she was terrified of me. And, um, just the way she handled it after the fact, like there, there was a lot of things I was mad about that had nothing to do with dating. I don't give a fuck if you want to date. I'm like ruin your life too. I don't care. You know what I mean? Like whatever. But, um, I don't even think I would have been mad about that. I was mad that she took my son around him. They were sharing all these experiences and things together. And she took that from me. Plot twist. Yeah. I'd never heard this story. That's mind bent, mind blowing. It gets even more mind blowing. So for those of you who don't know who Philip is, her baby's daddy, it is the same individual who was caught and charged with a misdemeanor for having sex in the high roller. If you guys remember the story about the couple that had sex inside of the high roller, that guy had actually broken up with his girlfriend. No, he didn't. He didn't. Well, he, he got a fight. He didn't break up with her, but he got in a fight with her. They were there to get married actually. Right. They were there to get married. But then he went and had sex with some other girl that he met from New York. Uh, they had sex and the security could see it, told him to stop. They didn't stop, came down. He was then charged with a misdemeanor. And then it became like a, a, a huge news story. Uh, and that was the same Philip that you had the kid with. And then, and then, and then what happens after that? So he was actually there. He, he went, he had gone, he was going to do a shotgun wedding with this new girl he was dating. Yeah. And, um, they're there, they get in a fight in a hotel. He does, you know, what you described. Um, so then he gets back home, me and him, love him to death. I mean, we had our shit, but, you know, uh, he gets back home. And I, I think what really bothered her the most was the interviews after the fact, like he had no shame that he did it. He was not remorseful. I saw the interviews. Yeah. That's the kind of guy he was though. And you know, I mean, you just got to accept him for who he is. And she did not like that. She worked at a strip club and he also had a pretty bad man is as much as I was like, when I had this kid, he's not going to live the life I live now that I'm, I'm talking about it. Like his dad put him in a situation like my dad did. And history repeat itself as much as I tried for it not to. Um, so he, he's doing these interviews. Yeah. You did see the interviews. Yeah. Okay. Um, so he was not remorseful. This was kind of like getting under her skin and she was not a stable person. She was probably a psychopath. He was kind of proud of it. Yeah. Watching the interviews. He didn't care about anybody but himself and he, he was getting clout from it and he was excited, you know? So, um, he's, he's boasting, bragging about it. She gets upset. She obviously is plotting some stuff on him. Um, she was a stripper at a club in Houston and she had some guys that worked there. He also had a lot, a lot of bad blood around the city. He had done some things I probably can't talk about, but he had screwed over a lot of people, owed people money, dealt people, bad drugs, put people in really terrible. You think she set him up? I know she did. Oh God. She's admitted it to this point finally. But it was, it was a whole, it wasn't just her, it was her upset and then other people that he had wronged reaching out to each other being like, you know what, fuck this guy. And, um, it, there was a, it was a group effort. Uh, but at the time I had no idea that any of this was going on. And so, uh, the, the two guys that killed him was the shoe shiner in the bar back at the strip club she worked at. So she calls him, I guess he had done an interview and gotten like a check for like four grand, which again, we grew up real, that's a lot of money to us back then. So, um, he's trying to find drugs, hits up his girl. She's like, yeah, I got these two guys. They're going to take us to a hotel and we're going to go get the drugs, bring all the cash you have on you. Cause she couldn't pay them for this hit. So he pulls up in her car, she gets in the passenger seat. The two guys get in the back seat. They're headed to go get these drugs. Supposedly, uh, the guy behind him just pulls out his gun and shoots him in the face. I think seven times, uh, gets out of the car, dumps his body, tells her to get out, take her car, drive it to Dallas. And they got caught in Dallas. That's crazy. So you, the, the girl that, that the, the fiance, the same fiance that he cheats on in the high roller is the one who sets him up to get murdered three years later in Houston. Correct. She, like I said, it took a while, but she later, she went crazy apparently after, and she was just going around telling people she was that she did. She played a part in it. Did you have a close relationship with him at that? Did you guys ever try to get back together or anything like that that happened during, during, during your, uh, during your, your, uh, son's life? Um, no. So he, I cleaned up my life after that. I, when I had my kid, he's, he's what kept me sober. I got sober on my own. My son kept me. So that kid saved my life because if it was not for my son, I would have relapsed and I probably would have been running around with his dad doing the same shit. I would have been in that car. You know what I mean? Like there's so many other ways it could have played out. But, um, he had, he had these episodes like every drug addict does where he's like, I want to clean my life. I want to get sober. I want to see my kid. I want to be part of your family. Like, you know, whatever, like I want us all together. And I said, you can see him, but I have no interest in getting back with you. And he'd always give me these ultimatums. Like, well, I'm not going to see my kid unless you get back with me and we're all together. And I was like, well, I guess you're not seeing your kid cause I'm not going to put him through that. So yeah. And then he proposed to me actually in my friend's driveway, the one that he got with when he was little, I ended up moving back in with her mom at some point. And, um, he like proposed to me in the driveway while his girlfriend's calling him on his phone. It was really chaotic. I was just like, no, but I kept in touch with him and I did talk to him right before this happened. And, um, yeah. So when it happened, I was living in Scottsdale at the time dating a different guy though. And, um, I remember when I first heard about it, I was actually on my way to work and someone called me, I don't know if I was in shock or I just wasn't surprised. Um, but I was just on my way to work. My friend called and she's like, Oh my God, you hear what happened to Philip? And I was like, no. And when I was doing my makeup, getting ready for work, someone sent me a text. It was from like a Google number. And it was like, congratulations, you got what you wanted. Philip, Philip was murdered. And I was like, this can't be real. So get in my car, drive to work. Then my phone starts blowing up. And I'm just like, everyone's like, yeah, Philip's dead. And I was like, Oh my God. And I was like, well, I'm not really surprised. And I go to work. And then, um, I had a lot of, I didn't know what happened. So then all of a sudden I thought it was like, not my problem. Then fast forward two days later, I'm getting sent all of these articles. I'm getting blown up. There's like news people, paparazzi, like all these people outside of my job trying to talk to me. And I'm like, what is going on? And I had to hire an attorney and stuff. They had leaked. No one knew he was the baby daddy. His name's not on the birth certificate. He wasn't there. My son has my last name. I completely dissociate ourselves with him. Um, we get there and the news is reaching out to me saying, you know, we want to talk to you about Philip's death. This is that I'm like, huh. And I go home and there's all these articles now all over the news with my face blasted. My son's face was on some of them, which is illegal. And then some blurred them out. My first and last legal name, which I don't use all this information. And I got, I call an attorney. I got it all taken down thankfully. Um, but they, I guess one of his ex-girlfriends won her 15 minutes of fame for the whole murder. And at this point, we still don't know why he was murdered. And I'm like, like what fucking point do you guys think this is a good idea that my son's dad was just murdered and now you're blasting our faces and our names all over the internet. Like, what are you thinking? Like, we don't know if we're in danger. Like, you know what I mean? Then, uh, Houston's a close community and I know some shady people out there. So I made some phone calls and then they're like, no, you're good. It was over this, this, that. And I was like, oh, okay. Makes sense. Like we're all good. Um, the guys that did it, I think the guy who actually shot him served three months. Um, the other guy in the car served nothing. And because they said it was self-defense or something like that. That's what he, his attorney said that it was self-defense. I read, I read the court documents. They said they didn't feel safe in the car and they didn't know where they were going. No, this was a whole, like, this is all, like I said, I don't know how the court stuff worked out because I was not involved in that. And all I just know, like from the community that I know in Houston, what I was told was that she and some of people that he had wronged had set it up. I can comfortably say she did it because she admits to it now. Um, and then, you know, the, the guy that shot him served three months, the guy in the car with him served no time and she served no time. Was he armed? Maybe daddy. Yeah. Okay. That is a crazy, crazy turn of events. If he was not armed and he served three months, we're shooting a guy in the face six times. That's crazy. Uh, yeah, but yeah, I mean, you can look all this stuff up. I mean, this is the part where like a lot of people are like, Oh no, Brandy, you're making this up. No guys, feel free. You can look at all these articles up. They are all quite, uh, quite public. Uh, but like, here's the thing. So afterwards you go to, uh, to Scottsdale, right. To get, to get away. Here's the thing. We don't have to relive all this if you don't want to. But my, my, my question is this, like, do you see patterns at this point? Right. Like, like Brandy, you're my, you're my friend. Like when I, when I hear this stuff, like I, and when I hear about a dude hitting you, I want to hit him back. Like that's my, my initial reaction to that. Does that make sense? Yeah. But like the scene, the thing is, then there's also the questions like, is there something in your past that would make you want to be around somebody like this? Is this a question you ever ask yourself? Yeah. So, and this is something I actually learned through, um, this was through therapy. So I guess there are some pros. Um, you know, she told me I had to stop associating, um, violence with love. Yes. This 100% plays a part in how I was raised. My dad was very physically abusive. My grandmother was very physically abusive. Um, a lot of people in my life were very physically abusive. And, and I, in a lot of relationships, including the one I think you're leading up to that was physically abusive, there's this mind fuck that they tell you. And I've heard it so many times growing up and they're like, well, if I wouldn't do it, if I didn't care, the fact that you can get this reaction from me means I love you that much or I care that much. And I honestly believed that for the longest time. So yeah, I mean, I 100% associated violence with love. Like I, I thought if you weren't doing stuff like that, then you didn't care about me. I have a, I have a friend, she was consistent, consistent, consistently cheated on by her boyfriend and she confused her wires got crossed where she started to confuse him cheating on her with him being a high value male. And I've seen the same thing where a woman, woman is like, Oh, he hits me because he loves me. Right. They get, they get confused. And for someone who's never experienced this, it sounds so obvious and so crazy. And they're like, how did, how did you not see it? How like nobody understands unless they've experienced it, the mental rewiring and just psychology behind somebody who has been with somebody who's physically. Narcissist, like it is a mindfuck and that's the only word I can think of to describe it and you you don't know a difference. Let me give you an example of an endemic example of what she's talking about. So during the OJ Simpson trial Marsha Clark, what happened was they actually did some mock trials in Phoenix, ironically, and they were to survey, they were surveying African American women and they were asking them what do you think the probability or how many of you feel that it's appropriate to have some physical violence in a marriage and 65 percent of the African American women said that some spousal abuse or physical violence was acceptable and then they put nine African American women on the jury and then tried to paint OJ Simpson as a wife beater and it didn't work. He was acquitted specifically because that reason. There are certain communities where people believe that eventually at some point someone's gonna hit someone else and if you go back to the 1940s and 1950s it was pretty common and if you go back and read legal statutes in some southern states there's no penalty for hitting your wife. So this idea of like whereas now you know hopefully most of us are understanding, I would imagine most of us are understanding you know as US military officer if I hit a woman for any reason I'm getting an article 15. It doesn't matter if she's enlisted an officer or for any reason if I hit a woman I'm getting I'm getting a felony conviction for that, right? And so this is a one of these situations where like there are certain societies where people still think that this is acceptable your girl gets out of line so I need to smack her. No, that that is not acceptable and so one of the things that happens is like you get into these situations where people are like oh man I can't believe anyone would stick around for that. Well if that's the type of love you know like you said before like you know confusing violence with love. Here's the other thing, just a completely side point, when people say words are violence that's this to me I have a big problem with that. Words are not violence. Violence is violence. I think it's demeaning whenever people who are progressive start saying that words, I think it's demeaning to people who have suffered from sexual trauma or physical abuse who anyone who's been mugged or fought in a war and suffering from PTSD violence is violence. Words are not violence and so when you see stuff like this this is a completely different situation and one that like you have to be, man it's incredible what humans can get used to. Well you start to find comfort in chaos. Yes. If there isn't that violence, if there isn't that chaos you're almost like well they don't care and then you you start trying to get a reaction out of them and you almost start initiating things like that on yourself in healthy relationships because you're not getting what you're used to and it's making you not feel loved. I think you may be alluding to this but I've been in relationships with, well not relationships, I've dated girls before that have been used to that type of violence and then they start to try to provoke something with me and I just walk away. They don't realize they're doing it though I hope you know that. I didn't even realize this until probably last year that I was like oh my god I was in healthy relationships that didn't last because there was not that chaos, there was not that violence, there was not any of those things and I wasn't feeling loved. You're skipping ahead because that's exactly the next thing I was gonna get to you after we talked about David. So you're in Scottsdale or you're in Phoenix and you meet someone else and can you describe that? Oh this was actually before. Okay go ahead, what happened there? David was right after baby daddy. Okay. Immediately after. What happened there? The individual got his throat slit. Yeah. Okay so what happened in that situation? I don't know if I get, okay, I'm trying to think about how to like what I'm allowed to say because this situation was not handled legally, properly. So I met David online. He was living in Austin, I was living in Houston. He moved to Houston with me for a few months. I ended up moving to Austin with him. I was ready to get away from Houston. So I moved to Austin. It's so close enough where like I got my comfort zone. Yeah I'm from Austin. Okay yeah so it's like a two and a half hour drive and all of like my brothers, not blood, but guys that raised me you know and they taught me really well. They're very very protective over me. Sure. And so I was close enough if I ever needed them, they were there but I was also far enough away to where like I'm gonna start a new life with my kid and this guy now. He was an avid IV meth user. I was unaware because he was so good at it. He, if you looked at him you would have no idea this dude was on meth. He looked super healthy, worked out like you know fit, tall, eight slept normal like I had, there was no signs of it. Yeah. And then there are little things looking back now like I remember there was like bent spoons I was finding in the drawers when I was watching him and that like did it like it didn't register in my head like why my spoon was bent like you wouldn't think that. And then there was DVD cases I kept in my house and my son used to like always pop them open and play with the disc and he popped one open there was a needle in it one time. Yeah. I knew he'd done steroids so I didn't think anything of it but I was like why is it in there? And then there was these towels you know I pulled one down, loaded. So then that's when I realized because it was still loaded and I was like that's not steroids and that's not the kind of needle he uses. Yeah I used to manage a strip club and sometimes we'd have to take what's it called bolt cutters and unlock the bolts because and we'd find it would be like I remember opening up Finding Nemo one time the DVD and there's a bunch of cocaine in there. Yeah so he would hide it he would stash in places and what he was doing was he was waiting till I fell asleep. He was pretending to be asleep and then I would fall asleep and then he'd get up and just go sit in the bathroom. He would take like 50 baths a day I don't know if that has anything to do with it but he would take 50 baths a day and he would just go in the bathroom lock himself in there and I think he's just taking a bath and he's just getting loaded and doing his thing in there and so I had no idea and he was a very jealous, possessive, which I again at the time being damaged thought these were all like great qualities. I'm like oh he's possessive he's controlling like it like a little jealousy like you like that you it makes you feel wanted. Yeah and so I worked at this bar downtown and I was seeing my friend Morgan at work she was my best friend at the time she knew she was one of I guess everyone kind of knew but she was knew the most that I had a very abusive relationship so she was always concerned about me. We went to go see her at work she's bartending by herself it was just her he and I at the bar and it was empty bar and you know those punching bag games yeah that you hit and the numbers go up so we're sitting there and we're just hanging out drinking in the middle of the day it was evening and these guys walk in and they're hitting the bag and playing the game and I'm sitting in the bar and I'm just watching them because there's nothing else going on in the fucking place and Austin Texas and I'm watching and you know he starts to get jealous and he like looks at me oh you think that's hot I was like what he's like oh you think that's hot cuz I'm watching these guys hit the bag I'm like out of a row totally hot like I was being sarcastic he's he I could sense him starting to get at that level of angry that like we need to go so I looked at Morgan I said hey like close this out we're gonna leave like I'm not gonna I don't I don't fight in public that's one thing I don't do I will not argue with you I will not fight with you in public it's not my thing so I could see him getting that point I'm like hey we better go so I looked at her we leave and she's like hey and she saw him sorry to get riled up she's like hey be careful she's very like conscious of all that stuff okay so we leave we get in the car he's driving I'm in the passenger seat where I lived in Austin is out by Lake Travis and on 620 and 22 22 to get there from downtown there is this long road you go down and it is this winding road and there's no gas stations there's no streetlights there's no guardrails if you go left you're falling off a cliff like completely sketchy dirt road yeah and so we're driving home he's driving I'm in the passenger seat I got my feet up on the dashboard of my phone and Morgan texts me and she says are you okay like is everything okay I'm just checking on you yeah and I'm texting her back and he immediately says who is that and I guess I didn't respond fast enough to him and he just punches my phone and my phone falls in between my legs in the dashboard I reach down to get it and he just grabs the back of my head and just slams it into the dashboard I am dazed I'm like whoa and so I I have no country still has me by the back of head he's driving with one hand and then he pulls me across the like center part and he's got my face in his stomach and he has me like by my hair by the back of my head he's just pushing my face into his stomach and he's driving so at this point I'm like I can't throw hands with this dude I can't wrestle him if if he gets hit or anything while he's driving cars going off the cliff and we're both dying yeah so I'm just taking it and he is just holding it and I get to a point where like I can't breathe and so I'm I'm starting to blackout I realize I'm suffocating at this point and so I'm just like fuck it and the only thing I could do was like to bite him so I bit his stomach he leans forward I showed you that picture I don't know if you can see the teeth marks on my face he leans forward and bites me back on my face oh so I thought he had punched you that's bleeding from him biting he did also punch okay this is like the first move that was made okay so he bites me and I just remember hearing like the crunch and the noise and it was so gruesome and then he pulls my face off and immediately blood just like rushing in my eyes everywhere I can't see and he just starts like uppercutting me he's beating the shit out of me and then he pulls over drags me out of the car and just lets me have it dude he beat the living shit out of me I get to a point where like I thought I was gonna die like I was losing consciousness I was bleeding everywhere my face feels ten times the size it actually was like I'm getting weak and I just I'm on the verge of passing out but I don't quite pass out he thinks that I did pass out of it I think he thought it was dead and so he drags me out off the side of the road and just dumps my body basically and I can hear him walking back to the car and I remember thinking like fuck does he have a gun on like is he gonna come like finish me off like I didn't know if he was leaving or what was gonna happen cuz he sat in the car for a while and I was too afraid to open my eyes or sit up or let him know I was still alive yeah and then he just drives off and I have nothing on me at this point I'm like what do I do so I get up and I was like I'm just gonna walk back to the bar so I'm walking back to the bar and I'll never forget these guys in a jeep like you know I'm in like wedge sneakers shorts and a tank top and I have my head down and I'm walking and these guys and it's nighttime out and these guys in a jeep pull up and they're like hey and like do you need a ride and like I look up and he's like oh shit go go go and they like peel off and drive off I'm like oh my god my face looks that bad so I get all the way back to the bar and thankfully he's like right when they're closing whatever and I opened the doors it was like 2 a.m. some of the doors were locked and let me in and I opened the doors and Morgan's standing behind the bar and she looks at me and I guess a couple of my other friends that came by it was like all like the security and the managers and everybody I knew and I worked with cuz I worked there too and they're like all the girls just start crying and I'm just like oh I must look bad you know and so I was like no no it's okay guys like it looks worse than it feels like I'm trying to like calm everyone else down you know what I mean and so yeah and then I just I went and I stayed with her and my son was at the house and I was really he would he never would hurt him and I know that and this sounds probably terrible and I was like what do I do cuz I can't call the cops cuz I'll lose my kid they were already on to me like I they had had other domestic reports called on me and stuff and I knew if they got called I'd lose my kid so I was like I've got to figure something out so I called my friend Lexi and the one who's the date might be daddy I said you need to get to Austin you need to get here now and you need to go get drugs so she drove straight out in the middle of the night went got him from David David gladly give you know all this stuff and she came and met up with me my son was asleep I didn't want to see my face I there's no way I could like if other people are crying and thinking that like imagine your kid seeing you of course so I said you need to take him to Houston you know tell him that you guys are doing like a little vacation whatever gave her some money and was like just I'll call you when my face is better and I'll call you when this David situation is handled you cannot tell anybody about this and I specifically told her do not tell my brother about this okay first thing she did was tell my brother so she got back and then yeah so and he's very calculated but he forget I said that and then it's not your biological brother and then this I don't have a biological brother this has this has your hinting you're intimating towards what happened to correct so she went she told a lot of people she told him and it word spread and yeah a lot long story short he was sitting at a bar out in Austin and somebody walked in grabbed a knife slit his throat and walked right out yeah some three six foot he said six foot eight 400 pound man came in and slit his throat he's probably embarrassed that the guy was smaller than him yeah no slit his throat and then he he posted like gratitude thing on Facebook about how grateful he is yeah so it was it was like definitely like a vengeful thing yeah so now he walked in slit his throat in the middle of a bar so all these people were there and I guess helped save his life and he went to a hospital he got stitches and throw I've heard he can't talk very well and things like that but he lived you never spoke to him again no okay no I mean I did immediately after because I had I had to play my part right this was probably like two weeks later yeah but I had to go back home and be like hey it's okay like I'm not pressing charges you're fine I'm fine like this is cool because we lived together and he was a very like I had tried leaving him other times and he was a very like if I can't have you no one will like he was gonna kill me if I tried to leave him hands down no questions asked yeah so I was trying to be smart about it and he was going he went to like hair school or some shit and he would like run errands during the day and I just had to like I had to lock him out at that point and he I mean leading up to it he was getting like beat up a lot he was getting like I said my friends from Houston don't play around so they were they found out and there was there was a lot of like vengeful things that happened to him before that happened but leading up to it and I just had to play dumb and you know handle it and then when that happened I was I was able to leave is you mentioned before also and listen I know we're going down a crazy path here but you also mentioned before you had guys that would steal money from you and you said one of them made a bunch of money from that is that it was this David no he's not smart enough to do that yeah So after that, after, I think that was probably my last business. For the most part, that was my last like physically abusive relationship. After that, it became more mental abuse. And as someone who has been extremely mentally abused and extremely physically abused, I can hands down say, I would much rather get my ass beat any day of the week than to be mentally abused. And so after all this physical trauma, I jumped right into the most mentally abusive relationship I've ever been in in my life. What was this also in Texas or is this, yeah, I met him in Austin, Texas. I don't want to name drop this one, but, um, I met him in Austin, Texas. We moved to Scottsdale together and it just, uh, He like, he cheated on me every single weekend, every single time he went out and I would threaten to leave him. And then it got to a point after three years, three and a half years, he was like, oh no, like, don't leave me. Like, oh, we'll go to therapy together, which was huge for him to like, say he wanted to do. And we went to therapy. This was before I hate using the word narcissist because it's so overly used now. But it means something also. So we did, I don't know if I showed you the episode. So we've had, uh, uh, we've had a therapist on here, Jamie Lynn, and she comes on and we talk about narcissism as a cluster B personality disorder and the, the, the tenants of narcissism as opposed to sociopaths. Right. And I, but I just feel like nowadays it's so overused and everybody calls their ex a narcissist. So I don't like to use it, but we went to therapy and we went to counseling and all these things. And, uh, we did a lot of like together sessions and then our fourth session, uh, she had us do separate sessions. And when I went in, she said, I hate to tell you this. She said, but I I've diagnosed him as a narcissist. Uh, he has narcissistic personality disorder. And she said, my only advice to you is get out. Well, I don't know if she can. So it's weird. So in order for him to have a narcissistic personality disorder, there has to be a problem. So I guess the problem was your relationship. So I guess that's true. There's a difference between a narcissist and somebody with NPD and a narcissist is somebody who doesn't think they have a problem. If someone with NPD, somehow they got went to jail or something bad happened. And so now you have a diagnosis, like for instance, antisocial personality disorder is a diagnosis. Sociopathy is not, there's no, you can't diagnose somebody as a sociopath. You can't after the fact say, well, this person has sociopathic tendencies. Like we can look back at Adolf Hitler or Pol Pot, or we can look back at Benito Mussolini or, you know, Ted Bundy and say, Oh, clearly this person was a psychopath. We can tell, but during the time it's, it's, it's kind of a weird situation. Anyway, the point I'm trying to make is you're right. There's a lot of people that throw that word out there and there's so much information on it. You should learn because there's different tent. There's a lot of times you think someone's a narcissist when they have borderline personality disorder. And sometimes you think someone's a narcissist when they're actually a psychopath and you don't, oh, by the way, all psychopaths are narcissists. Uh, you, you, you don't understand these things when you understand them and then you understand them in the terms of evolution, like Dr. David Buss talks about, then it makes a lot more sense. Oh, it's not that this person wasn't loved or didn't love me. This person is not capable of love in any form for anyone. That's right. So, but the thing is, so there's no treatment. There's a treatment for narcissism. There is a treatment somewhat for borderline personality disorder. You can give them like, uh, um, a mood stabilizers or whatever for sociopaths. There is no treatment at all, period, nothing, not electroshock therapy. There's just the carrot and the stick. That's the only way you deal with a psychopath. And so a lot of people, they have this situation where like, no, deep down, he's a good person. And I have to explain to the girl. I'm like, no, this thing that you're talking about where deep down, he's a good person. All of it was fake a, whereas you and I would see a crying child on the road, be like, what's wrong here. Let's fix this because we would have this internal feeling that we got from our ancestors. Correct. It ancestral empathy. An art or a psychopath would look at that same, uh, uh, child crying on the side of the road and be like, who's watching what, what empathetic, uh, mask do I need to put on now? So that was him. A hundred percent. Because the issues he had with me was also the same issues he had with his family and other people, like it, it was, you know, anyways, he, and that was, uh, that was how that went down. But yeah, no. So he was the one I told you I was dating in Scottsdale when my son's dad was murdered. So when my son's dad was murdered, he had never paid child support. So the government cut me a $10,000 check for all the back pay. Um, and again, at this time I'm living paycheck to paycheck. This is like the most money I've ever had at one time in my life. And I was like, Holy shit. Like, what do I do? Um, and he was also this guy that like every other week he had this like grand plan ideas of like, I'm going to start this business. I'm going to do this and I'm going to do that. And he always had different ideas. Was he on drugs? No. Okay. So he was an alcoholic. So grandiose nature, grandiosity is a, a symptom of, of narcissism. Let me, let me just say one more thing that narcissists there, again, we don't know 100% how this works, but you can take identical twins and split them. And you find that if one of them is a psychopath, the other one tends to be a psychopath. So we generally think if you read Martha Stout's book about psychopaths, generally we believe cycle psychopathy is genetic and narcissism could be genetic, but it also could be environmental. And so one of the problems is like, for instance, if you don't have an arm, some of your arm is amputated. And I said, and I'm like, grow an arm. You're like, I can't grow an arm. This is the same thing with psychopathy. Psychopaths are born with no empathy, meaning the neurochemical pathways to feel empathy. It's not that they're underdeveloped. They don't fucking exist. So when you try to heal a psychopath, I've, I've literally seen people get into psychology thinking that they're going to cure this disorder. You're trying to put something in there that never existed. It's almost like me saying, I'm going to give you therapy to turn your brown eyes blue. It doesn't, there's no such way to do it because it's genetic. And so there's a lot of misunderstanding. So when people throw the word narcissist, borderline or psychopath out there, they need to understand what those words mean, because if you don't understand what those words mean, you get caught in these weird situations where you think you can heal someone or help someone that cannot be helped. And that's me. I'm, I'm so empathetic. I was like, I can fix them. I can fix them. And like, even though a therapist is telling me there's nothing you can do, I'm like, no, but I can, you know? And so he, again, he had all these ideas every week. It was like some new business he was going to start. And this was probably like his fourth idea since we had been together that I'd like dumped everything I had into. And so I gave him a, I gave him the check. I gave him the $10,000 to start this company. And I, he finally hit, he finally hit. What was the company? You don't have to tell me. That's fine. Everyone would know who it was if I said that. Oh, really? Yeah. That's crazy. Everyone would know who it was if I said that. So I don't want to put out there, but yeah, I gave him the 10 grand. And it was so funny because he had all these rich friends too. And he was like, you know, no one believes me enough to loan me this money. Like, I know this is going to hit like blah, blah, blah. And like, I gave it to him. I got zero credit for any of it. And he was like, I'm going to cut the same deal with you. That was going to cut with them. Like if it hits, you get 20% of the company for a $10,000 investment. I was like, cool. I didn't think I needed to sign any paperwork or do any of this bullshit because we've been together for three, almost four years. Like, you know what I mean? I was, I was stupid. I was stupid. There's no other way to put it. Um, and so, yeah, and it hit and then we broke up and he took off. Can I ask you, um, so this is helpful for somebody who's watching this and there, they might be going through something similar, what are the things you see and miss and what are the feelings you have internally when you meet these men who initially seem normal and turn out to have these problems? Do you understand what I'm asking you? Kind of. Okay. So like, there's obviously red flags you're missing. Probably you, you look back now, you'd be like, oh, this is obvious. These are the things. They're not, I'm not missing them. I think I intentionally overlook them because, um, up until last year, like I, I have a hard time being alone. I used to go from relationship to relationship to relationship and. I feel like I can handle anything. So I almost don't care when I see the red flag. Got it. And then the other thing I'm gonna ask you is there had probably you're really attractive. I'm sure there were normal, normally adjusted men who also were interested in And did you feel, uh, like, like not interested? No, it's what I told you though. I told you I had experienced healthy relationships and been around healthy people, but I found comfort in chaos and there was no chaos. So I was not comfortable in those relationships. Can you describe that feeling not comfortable? Or you just like, aren't sexually stimulated by this guy that you know would never hit you or this guy, you know, who would never abuse you? Because I've actually had a girl say that to me. She's like, I couldn't be with this guy because I knew he would never, like he would never leave me. I couldn't be with this guy because I knew he would never say the horrible things that my ex said. No, the verbal and mental abuse, like absolutely not. The physical abuse is what I was more addicted to. Okay. Um, but now I realized you can be, you can be in a healthy relationship and get choked and stuff. Yes. It's great in bed as long as, yeah, in your normal life. It's, and it's not an abusive way. Like I obviously do think that plays a huge role in like what I want in my sexual life. Yeah. Um, yeah, I, I like to be manhandled, but, uh, what was the question again? Listen, I've had the same situation where, where behind closed doors, I've had girls ask me to do things and I'm like, you're sure. Yeah. And then I, and I'll do them because I'm accommodating human being. But then afterwards I want to ask them like what, what happened before? And they'll tell me it's like, uh, it's almost like I'm, I'm methadone. Like I'm helping them get away from the, like something that, that they were used to that was really abusive. I don't know if that's the situation for you, but you're, um, uh, I don't know, it's, it's, it's hard for me to identify and relate. Cause I can't even explain to you the amount of self-healing I've done over the past year. It's in particularly last three months. Like it's been astronomical. Like what has happened in such a small amount of time. But I think if I'm thinking back on it, um, just again, like if there's not that chaos, I just feel like I'm not loved. I feel like they don't care. I get very insecure. I have hell of abandonment issues. Um, I almost always liked being like, you've seen my track record personally. I date guys that have nothing going for them. Like, I don't even think I've had a guy that's maybe one or two guys I've ever dated in my life even had a job because I like to be in controlled relationship because I feel like I can't be left. You know what I mean? There you go. You said the thing that I was trying to get you to say. Yes, that's exactly because I've seen I'm very self-aware now. Good. That's what I was trying to get you to say, because what I've seen before, again, I went on a date with a girl recently and she told me about the abusive things that her exes would do. None of it was physical. It was all mentally abusive. And I remember after the date, just being like, you know, I can never do those things for you. Like, I'm never going to kick you out of my car. I'm never going to call you a whore in front of my friends, no matter what. No, that kind of shit. Yeah. I never would put up with ever, ever. Mine was, like I said, like the physical abuse is it's the jealousy, the controlling behavior. Um, and you would confuse that for love. Yeah. And now you don't correct. Okay. Correct. And that's another thing. Like I tell them, like, like I'm, I'm never going to go through your phone. I'm just going to fuck you better. Like, I'm never going to, there's never going to be a point where I'm going to hit you. Uh, there's never going to be a point like, and I tell them straight up. I'm like, if this is the level of abuse you're used to, you don't want to date me, we have a problem. We're going to talk it out. Or, and if you hit me, I'm going to leave the room. I'm not going to hit you back ever. And I tell them that in the beginning, because I'm like, I see sign, I see red flag. I'm 45 years old. I see red flags. And I immediately tell them, I'm like, I know this may be what you're used to. And you may have confused these things you've experienced in previous relationships with healthy behavior. You're not ever dragging me into that. I need to tell you this right now. There's no, there's nothing you can do to make, I mean, unless you had like the threatened my family member, I'm never going to hit you. Right. And so then a lot of times they're like, Oh, they just have this like epiphany like, Oh no, no, that's not what I really want. And then you, I see them a month later and that's what they're back to doing because it's really hard for a human being to break these patterns. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, no, I, I can say with absolute confidence that now I, before, like if I was jealous or controlling or whatever, I was kind of like, Ooh. And like, if I date a guy and he wasn't jealous at all, I'd be like, you don't care about me then, you know what I mean? Um, but now if I were to date a guy that was even like borderline jealous about anything, I'm like, no, you got to go. Cause this, this is my life. This is what I want to do. And if you're not going to change my mind. Okay. So now let's get to this. You, you started having the, when the first thing you ever told me about when we were in that bus in Jamaica, you had brain aneurysms, aneurysms, correct. You had brain. So what was the, what do you think there was trauma that brought this on? Or is this genetic or is this just random? And then, you know what? I didn't even think about that. Cause we, me and my doctor sat there, he was scratching his head. You know, he's like the main cause of this. Usually you see actually one in 50 people have one. They just don't know it. Um, he's like, usually, you know, it's, it's cigarette smokers. I don't smoke cigarettes. I don't vape. I never really have. Um, the second one was genetics. I don't really know my family that well, but as far as I know, no one had it. And he's just like, I don't know what's causing these, but now that you're talking about it, it really probably could have been the stress and the trauma that my body was going through. Um, I don't know. We don't know what caused it. You also went through some pretty significant head trauma, like you described previously. Yeah. I've had a lot of concussions too, but he said if it was due to like head trauma, that he would see like a fracture or something on there. And he didn't see one. Okay. Okay. So, so you, you have a brain aneurysm and what is that? What is that? That is the number one question I get about this is people like, how did you know? How did you know? So I was having normal symptoms. I was getting headaches. I never have had a headache in my life, by the way, the last two years I was getting them like crazy. So I was getting headaches. Um, I was getting that thing where, you know, when you stand up and you kind of see black spots and you feel like you stood up too fast or you're going to faint, that was a huge one for me, uh, ringing in my ears, but like crazy ringing, like to where, like, I wouldn't be able to hear you for a couple of seconds when you were talking, things like that. So my husband's like, oh, you're probably just dehydrated, like vitamin deficiency, whatever. So taking vitamins, drinking water, I was ruling things out. I went to like four different ENTs. The first two were like, oh, you have tinnitus. Here's the medicine. Oh, you have vertigo. Here's the medicine. Didn't run a single test on me. So the fourth one was like, you know, what's really common is middle ear tumors and, and people don't realize they haven't, we take it out and you're good, so let's get you a CT scan. So I got a CT scan. Uh, I was leaving the office and before I could even make it home, he called me, he said, I need you to turn around and go back, you need another CT scan with contrast. So I go back and then he calls me again and he says, you need to see a neurologist like yesterday. He goes, I don't like what I see, but I can't diagnose it. So I go, it was an aneurysm. Uh, they rushed me into a meet is December of 2020. And they're rushing me to like emergency surgery, which is when COVID was huge. And it was like round December. Emergency surgery was four weeks out. So I go in, uh, they place a stent in me. I was thinking like, I'm getting my head cut open, all this stuff. It actually is like a little tiny dot on my wrist. You can't even see it right there. Uh, they went in and ran a catheter, dropped the stent off, pulled it out. I was at ICU. So they went in through your, of your, through carotid artery. Yeah, they went in through my wrist and I don't even know if you can show this or whatever, but that's my other scar right there. It came out, out your, through your pelvis. Got it. No, no, no. Went in through, I'd have had two, four surgeries, but yeah. So they went, they went in through a vein or an artery. They went in through my artery. Um, so place the scent in there and said it should go down, put me on blood thinners, aspirin, whatever. Um, I had a lot of restrictions and it's killing me because fitness has been like my life for everyone who knows. Oh, okay. So the, because your blood pressure, you can't, did you ever have a seizure? Did, were there any seizures involved with this? Um, not from this. Okay. From drugs. Yes. From drugs. Okay. Got it. Um, but, uh, yeah, so they, they treated it, but this one had just popped up. This was like new. I've been sober at like eight years at this point, so it wasn't related. Um, so yeah, they placed it in there, pull it out, come. It's in six months, went in six months, got another, they still consider it a surgery, but they're running a catheter. The same one they do with the STEM. They just put a camera on it instead. It's called angiogram. Yeah. Run it in there, but it's still a surgery. Run it in there. It's like, yeah, it's going down. You're good. Come back another six months and we'll see if you're good enough to come off the blood thinners. Third surgery. I go in, they run it up there and they're like, so your first one's gone down a lot. It's great. But now you have a second one. And I'm just like, are you fucking kidding me? Like I had been doing everything right. And I was really excited to come off and be done with all this stuff. Do they give you heparin to, in order for the blood thinner, in order for you to not bleed through this aneurysm? What do you mean? Heparin. It's a blood thinner. Oh, you don't know what they're doing. I'm on clopidogrel. Okay. Got it. Got it. Okay. No. Uh, well, the reason I was asking is do you, to this day, they still don't know why you're getting multiple aneurysms. Okay. Got it. No. And when that, when they found the second one on my third surgery, that's when he came and scratched my head and he's like, what are you doing? And I'm like, I've been sober. I don't even drink alcohol anymore. And so, and I think the, the other last thing we had to roll out was the gym and it was my blood pressure getting high and it wasn't even the gym. It it's my whole life. I'm skinny. I it's so hard for me to gain weight. And I was, you know, when I did ODP, it's the Olympic development program for soccer, and I was involved in a lot of sports and stuff growing up. I was trained that you have to lift heavy to gain weight. And I was, I was pushed on this program that I've been on my whole life now because of, and they're telling me you can't lift heavy because you can't strain that hard. If you strain that hard, you know what I mean? You see people doing the deadlifts and stuff and they're throwing up and passing out, like you can't lift heavy. And I'm just like, fuck. So that's, that's been a huge challenge for me the last couple of years. So you still can't lift heavy. Yeah. Jay Cutler came on here. He talks about doing squats until his nose bleeds. Yeah. You should probably get checked out. That's interesting. So, so now we have this situation cause you brought it up before. What, what is the, the prognosis for the, the aneurysms you stuff you still have to deal with now you just can't lift heavy. You're on medication. I'm on blood thinners, which I bruise. So I'm always covered in bruises. It's so hard taking content. Um, yeah, so I bruise easily. Um, being on blood thinners is where most of my restrictions come in. It's not even the aneurysms it's being on blood thinners. You can't do this, that, whatever. Um, and yeah, not being able to lift heavy in the gym is killing me, but I'm, I'm, you know, I've had to start over every six months I get this surgery and then I can't work out for, you know, a couple of weeks and I have to start over. I have to start over, but I just keep starting over cause I'm not going to stop, but I have another surgery in September. Uh, wow. Okay. So this is still ongoing. Yep. Okay. I have another surgery in September and they're going to let me know if, because now they've treated the second one, if they're gone and if I can come off or, you know, that's well, it's not going, would definitely. Uh, so you did talk about this, your husband. So how did you meet your husband after David? How did you end up meeting him? Was this in Scottsdale? Uh, no. I, yeah. So after I, after David was the money guy and then after him, I moved to Dallas and that's when I met my husband. Okay. Cause he, we had such a toxic relationship. Like the, the money guy. Yeah. The money guy, the narcissist that really messed my head. Like I was like, I got to get out of the city. I think you're three for three with narcissists, by the way. Yeah. I don't think it's just the last guy was a narcissist. I think. Oh, 100%. I don't think he was also. Yeah. I don't, I don't. I think you're, you're batting a thousand on that one. What's wrong with me? Well, we'll talk about it. Like that's the other thing we'll discuss. Keep going. So, so now you have a husband. I'm going to get diagnosed after this. Okay. Um, so I moved to Dallas. Um, he, every time I've last several people I've met have been through Instagram now, cause I don't leave my house. I'm so traumatized. I don't even know my fucking house. Um, so he, I was in the bar industry. He was in the bar industry. He had seen me out through some mutual friends. He hit me up on Instagram. Uh, we started talking. And it was so funny. Cause my friend was like, you just need to be single. Like, you're always someone who has to be in a relationship. She's like, be single, feel yourself out. I'm gonna force you to be single. She's like, find a guy that is good in bed and you have great sex with, and you also have a really good time when you go out with, but you would never date. I go, I got the perfect guy. And I, you know, my husband, I was like, we had amazing sex. We had so much fun when we went out together, but he, he was no, he had just never, you know, he's never had a girlfriend a day in his life. He had a girlfriend in high school. And that was the only girlfriend he's ever had. He was infamous for not dating girls. I can't imagine something like that. And I was like, this is the perfect guy. Because even if I fall in love and want to date him, he won't date me. Like, this is great. I feel attacked right now. And so I'm like, this is, this is amazing. Like perfect guy. Um, we got engaged in six months, married in a year. Yeah. That's usually how it happens. One of my friends, she lives in Austin and she started working at a bar with a guy who I would consider to be the biggest male whore I'd ever met in Austin. This guy, every guy did has been the biggest male whore. And then, and then she would tell me these jokes. She'd be like, oh yeah, I was hanging out with so-and-so. And she, he tells me these jokes about all these girls. He's fucking and we would laugh. And then she's married to him like a couple of months later because he was willing to settle down. It's so funny when I hear guys that are like, no, Michael, I don't want that perception on social media because if I come off like that, then I won't get a good girl. Most of the good girls that I know are ended up marrying guys who've been with like hundreds of women. Yeah. And that doesn't, I mean, we're adults. I don't think that really matters how many women a guy has been with. Doesn't bother me, but it's how you are when you're with me, you know what I mean? But you know, yeah, he had, he had been with everybody. He was single his whole life. Like I can only imagine. I mean, I, I do know most of it and we're, we're, we're like best friends though. Like he could sit there and talk to me about that stuff. And we would laugh at his horror stories. And like, we would laugh at just all, like we were best friends. It was so perfect. And then we got engaged and married and it just like, it was the most healthiest, like he was so supportive. There was no jealousy. It didn't bother me that there was no jealousy. He encouraged me to go on trips, do things like, I think, did you meet him or no? You did. Okay. Yeah. We were making fun of each other at Tucci's house one time. Oh yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. I forgot about that. Okay. Yeah. He was, he was awesome. He was amazing. No, I got him immediately when I met, when I met him, I got it. Like I understood. And I was very happy for you, but remember, I didn't realize the previous relationships that you'd been in. Uh, cause the guy was sarcastic and I was like, okay, I can definitely relate to that. Uh, so you're, you're with, you're with this guy for a while and you, this is your second kid you have with him. Yeah. So when we got married, uh, we're talking about like, does he want a kid of his own? Cause if not, like I'm ready to be done. He was like, honestly, like, I'm not worried about it. Like we, you know, my son's dad passed away and he considers this Andrew to be his dad. Yeah, for sure. And so, uh, like we were, we were just happy with what we had and, and like a week before I was going to go in and get my tubes removed, I was pregnant. Yeah. That's how it happens. Right? That is how it happens. Um, especially when you're Mexican. I can say that I'm Colombian. I can say that. Uh, so, so here's the thing. So now you're, you're in this happy relationship and I remember, and so the thing is like hearing this, um, again, it just like blows my mind. Cause I want to point this out one more time. You were friends with the guy and then you guys started dating. We, from the very first time we ever hooked up, we never spent a single day apart after that. Yeah. It was crazy. Yeah. Okay. We were, we were, I wouldn't say we're, I don't fuck my friends. That's like, everyone knows me like for that. Yeah. It's like, if I'm like, Hey, this is my friend. You can automatically rule out the fact that we fucked. Yeah. So this is one thing I do think that that is interesting because you talked about the protected, protective men in your life previously. So you never slept with them, but right. But you would end up sleeping with men who were like, not protective of you. What's funny though? No, no, no, no, no. Because the men that raised me were such, I love them to death by the way, before I say this, were such pieces of shit to their girlfriends that it was like, Hey, like, this is how we view girls. This is why we view them this way. And this is how we treat them. Like, don't be like this and don't date guys like us. So like all my guy friends I've grown up with are the best friends I could ever ask for. They're so loving, so supportive, treat me like princesses, but they don't treat their girls like that. Okay. They have a different relationship with me. And if I were to sleep with one of them, they would lose all respect for me. And I go to be treating like shit by them too. Probably. This is an incredible, you are very self-aware and you were saying that before. I agree with you about that. That is, that is a very astute observation there. All right. So here we go. Uh, now you meet David, you, you didn't expect it to happen. Uh, I'm sorry, not David, uh, your, your husband, Andrew. And Andrew, and then, uh, you know, you go through that. You guys have a baby. I meet you while you guys are married. And then what, what is, what is the, what happens after that? Also does OnlyFans come about this point at this point? Uh, I started OnlyFans in like 2019, like a year before COVID. Okay. He, he is the one encouraging that too, though. Like I was, he was supportive of even you doing that. Yeah, it was his idea. So he was like, dude, have you seen these girls doing like premium snap? Like, what is that? You remember like when premium snap was a thing? I was like, yeah, we were like trying to backend all of our own stuff. Like he was taking my pictures for me, videos. Uh, but at this time I wasn't doing any like boy girl content. I was only doing like nudity. Um, and so he's taking my photos for me and he was writing down people's names and who paid and who didn't. And it became overwhelming because I couldn't wrap my head around like getting 20% OnlyFans. But then I was like, now I see why they take 20%. They deal with all this stuff for you. So I switched over and yeah, it was great. No, our divorce had. Zero to do with OnlyFans. Yeah. Yeah. You don't want to talk about it. No, no, we can't. I mean, it was honestly like, it was so petty. It was, we were best friends by the way. Like me and my head today. Oh yeah. I actually was talking to him on the way over here. Like me and my ex-husband are best, best friends. Okay. Um, and we laugh about it all the time. We're like, how fucking dumb was that? Because it was literally, I'm trying, if I could summarize it, it basically got to the point where this dude loved me so much and so hard that he, he gave his life up for me. Like he quit working, he quit doing everything. He was a stay at home dad. It's not what he wanted. Um, you know, and, and I was, you, you saw me the whole time I was married. Like when, when was I with him? I was, he was like, Hey, you know, you Jamaica, you should go on that trip. That's a great, you know, content collaboration for you. Like it was, it was so encouraging and so supportive and so loving. Like you should go, you should go. Like, and I'm like, what about the, you know, like I have responsibilities. I got it. I got it. Just go, go, go. And he would take care of all my responsibilities for me. And then, you know, like my friends would have a trip. Oh, you should go. You should go. And like, I mean, there were times I was in bed and I'm like, I don't want to go on this trip. And he's like, I got you. He's like packing my suitcase for me. And he was, and it wasn't like in a toxic way. It was like, he saw opportunities and he knew this stuff. Wasn't going to last very long or, you know, it could end any moment. And he saw the money that's coming in. He saw the investments we were making. We had an end game inside. It was like, I'm going to deal with this for two to five years max. And then we're going to be done and we're going to have our time and we're going to live a great life. But within those two to five years, I don't think he thought about, and I didn't think about, he got depressed. He got really depressed. I mean, he was sitting at home by himself, raising a newborn and my son. And, and I mean, I don't get me wrong. I very, I was hands-on. I was home all the time with my kids, but I was never, I wasn't there mentally. I was there, but I was always on my phone. I was always editing photos. I was always working. I was always doing stuff. I was not involved as a wife. I was not involved as a mother. Like I'm very aware of like my mistakes and the role I played and all that. Um, and I tried to have conversations with him about it and he was so worried about me and my feelings that he wasn't being upfront and honest with how he was feeling. And I'm not even sure he was fully aware of how he was feeling and why. And, um, yeah, I mean, it was, it was just so petty. It all could have been avoided by us just sitting down and having an honest conversation with one another about how we were feeling and where we were at with our lives and we never did that. And it was such a selfless move on his part, but it was too much. And it was such a selfish move on my part. And it was too much. What ended up ending the relationship? Um, I guess it got to a point where I was completely, what's the word? Neglecting him. Neglecting him. Yeah. I was neglecting him physically, emotionally. Um, and he, he was okay with that, but he was so depressed that it started, like he started to have spurts of anger that I was so out of character for him. And, and, uh, it, it wasn't, he wasn't himself anymore. Do you feel like his behavior, and it's not, I'm not blaming him, but his behavior was a little bit passive aggressive because he didn't, he wasn't used to dealing with this type of anger before and was so, cause this is the thing, like I have family members that are so concerned about my feelings growing up that like later on they would like hold grudges against me. It's like, oh, I did all this for you. It was, it's something like that. He never held any grudges or he didn't bottle up any anger or anything like that. I'm sure he did. And if he did, I, like I said, I was never aware of it. And he never, like this all, like I said, this all could have been avoided by us just sitting down and having an honest conversation with each other. But, um, the way we handled it and the way we went about it was so wrong. And we didn't realize it till probably six months after our divorce. And then we finally called each other and we were like, almost kind of laughing. We're like, like, what the fuck did we do? Like, this was kind of like, why? So, so let me ask you, just follow me along here with the logic. Cause I don't know if this is the case, but I'm just asking. So you've had a pattern of where you were with some really unhealthy guys and now you have a healthy guy and you start neglecting him. Do you think that these things are connected in any way? Maybe I don't, I've never really thought of it like that. I think like, oh, here's my question. After you're dating this guy, the next guy, is he healthy? Absolutely not. Okay. So do you, I went right back. Okay. So do you, do you understand where I'm coming from here? Yeah. Do you remember the conversation I told you, like I had with one of my female friends or where I was like, we'd slept together and afterwards I was like, you understand the abuse you told me about before. I can never give that to you. You understand that. Right. You're going to, I told, cause I, I told her, I was like, you're going to lose interest in me. I'm just telling you upfront, like everything, every time we have a problem, lose interest in him though. Okay. I'd never lost interest in him. I was, I was so preoccupied with like, now I have everything I want. I have like, I have a guy, I have this, I have that, but I can also do whatever the fuck I want. Like I, I had, I had it made, I had the best life ever. All my friends were always like, dude, you're so lucky. You're so lucky with the best marriage ever. Now they're still even like, you have the best divorce ever. Like what are the odds? Like, um, I w no, I think I just got greedy. I got selfish with my time and what I was doing. And I was, I was trying to have the best of both worlds. I got a great loving family at home. I can also travel with all my friends and live my life. I could do whatever the fuck I wanted to do. And I was, I was, I was just trying to like, I guess do too much. But, um, no, I, the breaking point was we were, we never fought ever. And we were fighting about little petty, stupid shit. Like, and, and we were, he, I, I knew he was depressed. I said, you know what? Like, I'm always traveling. I'm like, why don't you go to Dallas? Why don't you go hang out with your friends? And like, you have fun for once. So I blew him Dallas. I'm staying at home with the kids. Like we're reverse roles, you know what I mean? And he went out there and I think it was, it was too late. It was too late. And it was the wrong move to do. But, um, yeah, he went out there. We got in a stupid little petty fight while he was out there. And he was like, you should just, just call and get a divorce kind of thing. And he had thrown it out there a couple of times and it got to a point where like, it was just wrong place, wrong time. And I was like, don't threaten me with this shit. And he was like, no, do it. Call, call a divorce attorney. So I did. And I was, I was, I was kind of like. I was like, oh, it's this much money. He's like, you got the money, like, let's do it. And I said, okay. And so I served in the papers while he was still out there. And we have the fastest divorce in the state of Nevada, by the way. Yeah. I don't know if anyone knows that. You mean in Nevada in general, the two of you? What do you mean? The two of you had the fastest divorce in the state of Nevada? My attorney told me we have the fastest divorce in the state of Nevada. We both were like, all right, done, done. Sign the papers. So it was a no contest divorce. Got it. Yeah. Yeah, I got it. The guy, just out of curiosity. So now you go on, now you're single again. Did you immediately jump into another relationship? Two months after. Okay. We got divorced, it was like Memorial weekend. So the end of May, beginning of June, we got divorced. But your relationship was over before you got divorced, right? Not really. Internally, you weren't seeing anyone else? You just waited until, okay. No, no, no. Yeah. Okay. And then, yeah, so we were end of May, beginning of June, we got divorced and then end of July, I met somebody and by beginning of August, we were dating. Okay. And then, what was the problem there? Was it the same issues that you had before? Yeah. Yeah? Very controlling, very aggressive, very, he wasn't physically abusive. Can I ask you, what are the feelings that you have? Like, I'm trying to remember, as a homo sapien man, I can't, I'm trying to understand this, right? If some dude beats me, I beat him back. He didn't beat me. No, no, I know, I know, but let's go back previously. Okay. And I'm not judging you for your feelings. I'm trying, I'm legitimately trying to empathetically understand this feeling. There's a feeling you're getting now, there's this new guy who's jealous. Is it like butterflies in your stomach? He wasn't jealous, see, that's the thing. No, I'm very shallow. Okay. If you are tatted and muscular and, you know my type. Yes, I'm aware. I'm saying, by the way, I'm saying less than I know. I know, I know. I appreciate that. Yes. Yeah, no, I, he was 6'2\\\", muscular, tatted up, had, you know, the face tats, everything that I like. And he was extremely attractive and that's all I cared about. Got it. But when we got together, no, he was super cool, supportive. Like he had like my ex-husband's personality, but in a body that I was wanting. And then like a month into it, the jealousy and stuff started to come out. And for the first time in my life, you know, my best friends are all guys and I have, my best friend's Mickey Macy lives with me when he's in Vegas and he didn't like that. And he was starting to show like the jealousy in a way of like, I don't like your guy friends. I don't want them around. Well, like that's one thing I'll never tell. My guy friends are my family, they're my life. And so when he, that's what was my breaking point. He said, I don't like him. I don't want, and I said, then this isn't going to work. But he was never physically abusive. He was jealous, but I didn't care. It was like, I, it was like a mixture of the two because he was jealous about the things I was doing. But instead of catering to it, like I would have in the past, I was just kind of like, okay, well, this is what I'm going to do. If you don't like it, then you can leave. But I knew he wouldn't leave because I had all the control of the relationship. Like I told you, I made all the money. He moved in with me. I paid for everything. He didn't have a job. And that's how I wanted it though. Yeah. Yeah, no, I've seen Tucci do the same thing, right? I've seen a couple other girls do the same thing. Everyone always compares us with situations, yeah. She's coming on here. You have no idea what she's, she gave, she's doing a documentary. I don't know if she's told you. I'll tell you off there. It's insanity what she's about to do. Good for her. Yeah, and I'm going to interview her. So here's the thing. So now you're in this situation where you're with this new guy. I don't need the gory details. I'm not trying to be lascivious here, but I ask every, I ask Nara this, I ask everyone this. There's a transition where you go from doing nudity to boy girl on OF. This is that, this is that point, right? This was that toxic statement he said that gave me butterflies. So it is butterflies? No, not literally. I'm trying to think of what, maybe. Maybe, I don't know. I don't know what it was, but. Like I know what I feel internally when I see a new girl. The tattoo thing and everything too. Oh, by the way, what's the 444 for? Oh, angel numbers. Okay, got it. Cliche as fuck, I know. Got it. He had them tattooed on his face too. 444? Yeah, it was ironic. But yeah, so first it started with like the crazy, I think we had been dating for like two weeks and we got each other's names tattooed on us. His was big as fuck across his stomach. Mine's pretty big, just like right above there. And again, I think this was like a feeling, like I don't know. I like my men obsessed with me. To this day, I might be healed, but like my guy has to be like obsessed with me because I get equally as obsessed. And it's not like a, you know what I mean? Like, oh, they have to be obsessed. I'm equally as obsessed with my dudes. So it's like, when I'm in a relationship, it's all or nothing. Like I'm either giving you 110% or you ain't getting shit. But so about a month in, you know, he's like, well, what are you doing? And he got very, you know Sarita? Yeah. Okay, so he asked me if I did girl, girl, like what kind of content I did on my OnlyFans. And this is something I never took into consideration. You're talking about Married Sarita? Yeah. From France? Yeah, no, no, no, from Florida, Alabama. Wait, you talking about, oh, I was about to say a real name. Okay, yes, Sarita Natividad. Yes. Okay, I was like, hold on. Okay, so anyways, he was like, do you do girl, girl? Do you like, what's your OnlyFans like? And I was like, I thought it was pretty like clear what I did, but I guess not. So like, I only did Strictly Nudity. So I fly him out. He moves in with me. I take him on a trip to Tulum. Fly him out where? To Vegas. To here, like I flew, he was from Utah. So I flew him from Utah out to Vegas. He moves in with me immediately. I took him on a trip to Tulum where it was me, Serena, and Tiana, and Tygard. We were doing a content house, but I brought him with me. So again, this dude, you saw what he looked like. I thought he was very like, he doesn't look like, he looks fresh out of prison. Like he's been through some shit and not phased. So I thought this was all good. So I'm in my room getting ready in Tulum. He goes downstairs to get a cup of coffee. He comes running upstairs like he saw a ghost. And he's like, I have to tell you something. Sit down, sit down. And I'm just like, okay. I sit down and he's like, I went downstairs to get a cup of coffee. And I saw Tiana and Serena naked. They're just walking around. I didn't know they were like that. Like, and I'm like, okay. I'm waiting for him to finish his story. And that's it. That's the whole story. And I was like, I'm just like, oh no. And I'm like, okay. Like we have a lot to talk about. And he's like, is this how these trips normally go? Like a bunch of girls walking around. Then he starts like freaking out on me. Like, are you gay? Like, are you bi? Like, are you this? And I was like, no, but what? And I'm like, you ever been in a locker room? Like, I don't know if I can say this without like offending people. I'll blink it out if you can't. Okay, so this was the first concern I had. I said, no, you know, like I can shoot with other girls and not sexualize them. He was projecting a lot of like homophobic things at me. And I said, and I'm only quoting out, I don't like this term, but I'm quoting what he said. I said, have you ever been in a locker room with other men and you see him walk around naked but you're not sexualizing them? They're just naked guys. I said, it's the same thing. And he said, no, actually, I've never been in a locker room with other naked men because my dad told me that ball sports are for. Wow. And I said, oh, that explains a lot. That's where this is coming from. So he's like, well, do you do girl, girl? And in my opinion, girl, girl is porn, like girl on girl. And I said, no. So a week later, I go to Content House in Palm Springs with Sarita. She's so PG. She doesn't even, she shows nothing. And she's hilarious. She's the sweetest, most unthreatening. Sarita Natividad is one of the five funniest women I've ever met in my entire life. I love her. And we did a photo shoot on a pool table and she's like, I don't show anything. I said, that's fine, get behind me. She's guarding herself, you know, and then she has her hands and she's covering my breasts for the photo. And he, this, okay, fast forward. Now I come home, all this stuff, and he's just like losing it. Like the whole time he's like, I don't know what's going on out there. Like he's been cheated on a lot. He has like trauma and he's just like losing it. And I'm trying to be sensitive and I'm catering to him and I'm explaining things. I'm being very patient. I'm, you know, and these are all things I don't take into consideration. He's like, we have a male photographer. Like, why are you naked in front of another guy? And I'm like, this is their profession. Like, it's not like that, dude. Like I went from overly supportive husband. It's like, go, go, go to this guy. That's like, look, I can't take your photos. And this is that. And I was just, I was catering to it though. I stopped doing photo shoots. I hadn't done a photo shoot in like a year almost at this point. Can I ask if you had, if you had proposed to have a threesome with this dude, he would have freaked out? A hundred percent. 100% he would have rejected me. Me and George are like looking at each other like, what? Accused me of being gay and lost it because we got a lot of fights where he was just like, admit it, you're gay. Like, I know you're gay. Like he thought I was gay because I was shooting with other girls. And so I'm like, I'm like, okay. So then I just start doing solo content. I'm not shooting with other girls. I'm not having male photographers. I'm only having female photographers. He was uncomfortable with female photographers. So then I just started doing like, like self-boyfriend content, you know, like Snapchat style on my phone, which actually like ended up working out because it blew up and it does way better. So the boyfriend experience is where you hold the camera? The boyfriend experience is if a guy asks, like if you send the content as if it was your boyfriend and he's like, hey, what are you doing right now? Where are you at? What are you wearing? Blah, blah, blah. I'm in bed filming myself and I send it. And that, that content is so much better now than professional content that I just switched over and it wasn't a big deal. I, he was happy. I was happy. It's almost like a POV boyfriend experience through your phone. And cause I did, I wasn't aware of this. I'm messaging guys. I'm sorry, the girlfriend experience. I think Nara told me about it. The girlfriend experience is what they, they provide on there. So instead of me having a whole blown photo shoot and I'm sending you photos of that and it looks like you're flipping through a magazine. I'm like, hey, Michael, like da, da, da. I'm like sending you like a little video of myself. So yeah, and it ended up working out. So he was happy. I was happy. Not a big deal. Then other things started coming out and he said, well, I want everyone to know you're mine. That was the statement. That was the statement. He said, I want everyone to know you're mine. And I said, well, your name's tattooed above my pussy. I think it's kind of obvious. And I never posted guys on my Instagram. You saw how much I posted him. I was trying to, I don't even know. You were trying to validate his insecurity. I was trying to be sensitive to how he was feeling and I was trying to incorporate it into a healthy way and I wasn't doing it right. So at the time, do you feel like this is insecurity or do you feel like he's just being, like you love the fact- I know it's insecurity, but I'm trying to, and again, he got into the mentally manipulative stuff with me because if I didn't cater to him, he's like, well, you're selfish. You're only doing what you want. You're not taking my feelings into consideration. I'm like, oh, he's right. I'm not taking his feelings into consideration or I would be like, we could negotiate on things. And he's like, you never negotiate. It's always like, I'm not going to do this. It's my way or the highway. And I was like that. And so I was, he was convincing me that that was the wrong way to go about it. And so I was trying to, you know, cater to him more. And then that's when I said, okay, well then why don't you and I film together? And he was like, perfect. He was excited about it. He wanted it, but then any, and then once in a while a fight would arise and he was like, well, I wasn't even going to do this. I only did this because of you. And I'm just like, it became so much, it was so much. And so, yeah. And then the fight started, the insecurity started. And then I became very depressed and unhappy the way my husband had. And I got to a point where it was end of last year and it hit me out of nowhere. And I'm not sure if it was like all my past stuff coming back up or my divorce hitting me late or this new guy just being such a dark cloud over my head that like I got severely, severely depressed and I became extremely suicidal. I've been depressed before in the past. I've never experienced suicidal thoughts and I was extremely suicidal and I had nothing to be depressed about. I was like, my life is great. I'm making money. I've got a healthy, happy family. You know, my kids are good, everything. And I got really, really depressed. And I was, the suicidal thoughts were so overwhelming and it was crazy because there wasn't, I started going, I was doing everything I could. I was so desperate to feel better. I was scared of myself. I was so scared of myself. I thought I was gonna- Like drugs and alcohol feel better? No, no, no, no, no. Like, I'm a hundred percent sober. I've never relapsed. No, I was like, okay, therapy. Okay, someone told me to do acupuncture, spiritual things. Like I was trying, you could have told me stand on one leg and bang your head in the wall 10 times and you'll feel better. I would have done it. I was so desperate to feel better because this suicidal feeling was so overwhelming. I didn't know where it was coming from which was making it even more scary. Like, you know, you could- Your hair's bunched up underneath there. Sorry. Go ahead. It's fine. Yeah, I didn't know where the feeling was coming from which made it even more scary because I- Did you ever wake up and not be able to breathe? Did you ever wake up in a panic during this period? No, I went to, I would go to sleep with them. In a panic, okay. The very first time it ever started I was having the worst panic attack of my life. And I was like, I'm gonna go to sleep and wake up and this will be gone. And then I woke up the next day and that was my first day of depression. And it just got worse from there. There were days that like, it was, I wasn't sad. Like I wasn't sad, I wasn't crying. I wasn't like, oh, my life sucks. Like I had a great life and I knew I did. It was a very overwhelming feeling in my chest and in my head. And it was just like, I like, I cannot stand to feel like this anymore. Like if I wake up and I have one more day of this, I like, I just rather not be here. And I was having like really intrusive thoughts and urges to kill myself. And I couldn't get rid of it because I didn't know where it was coming from. And so I was doing therapy, I was doing everything. I was doing therapy, I was doing everything. I was doing spiritual healing. I was doing acupuncture. I was everything I could possibly do because medication was the last thing I wanted to do. And then I finally got to a point where it was like, it got really bad and it was right around Christmas. And I called my ex-husband and I was crying. I said, you got to come get the kids because I'm not going to make it. And I flew them out to him. I couldn't even get on the plane and I flew them out to him and I came home and I was this close to doing it. And then, sorry. Do you want anything, darling? No, I'm okay. You're okay? Let me take a break. Okay. You need like a tissue or something? Yeah, for sure. You got one, George? Okay. Oh, God. Ooh, I was not expecting that. Yeah, no, what a story, what a life. Yeah. I empathize with you a lot, but I'm very grateful that you have the confidence. to share the way that you've shared today. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, no, I've been trying to find a way because I get asked all the time to do a YouTube video on all of this and I don't have the time to start a YouTube channel and do all this, so I've been wanting to, but this is a lot of stuff I've never talked about, so I'm like. And you need a guide, to guide the person. Yeah, I couldn't just sit there and steamroll this stuff out. Okay. All right, Brandy, no, it's totally fine. By the way, you always have permission to cry here, right? I've never cried in front of anybody, so. It's all good. Hey, listen, that was a genuine moment and I didn't know the story about that. No one does, that's why. I gotta be honest with you, okay, so I'm not gonna be too descriptive, but you remember from my situation, when I meet you, you're married and you've got two kids, right? And then all of a sudden, you're just not married, okay? And I know some of the dudes you're hanging out with and I'm like, oh, okay, wow. And I, but I can't talk to you about it. You can talk to me about it. I can talk to you about it now. We'll talk off air. But I saw it happen and it seemed like a very traumatic change from being married to not being married. And then I didn't realize that you were dealing with this level of depression. What do you attribute the depression to? Do you know now? No, and that's, like I said, it terrifies me because, like I said, I tried therapy, I tried everything. It wasn't related to my divorce. It wasn't related to any stuff from my past. It was, I, to this day, don't know what caused it. And like I said, that's what scares me the most is because then I feel like if I don't know what it is, I can't heal from it, I can't attack it, and it could come back at any time. So that's always like a scary thought. So that's when I was like, I need help. So I went to a psychologist and I got prescribed some medications. I was undiagnosed bipolar two disorder, which I thought was weird because I didn't know anything about being bipolar two. You think bipolar two is like, you have spouts of anger. You know what I mean? Did you feel manic? So I didn't know what manic was, but yeah, I realized that, because I was like, this has never happened to me before. Like, how does this happen? She's, well, sometimes people experience a traumatic event or even going through a divorce and that can trigger it. And it did, it started right after my divorce. Like that whole summer I was manic. I was, I was, I remember my friends telling me like, wow, you're handling this divorce like a little too well. Like I was happy, I was traveling. I was like doing the most, I was, I was too content with it. I was like, this is fine, everything's fine. And I didn't know what manic was. And I was manic that entire summer, unaware of it. And then when wintertime hits, I get depressed. And I, then when she starts telling me this, I realized like, oh my God, this is a pattern. I thought everyone was like that. It's summertime, like weather's good. I feel nice. Like I'm going to go out, have fun. Like I didn't think that was being manic. I thought that was like, summertime comes around, everyone loves it. Holidays are gloomy and down for everybody. I thought it was normal. And then I realized, okay, I would like, again, I related bipolar too with, with having anger issues. And it wasn't being bipolar too. How it was explained to me was you go through periods where you're manic, which is really high highs. You're, you're happy. You'll spend a lot of money. You'll do compulsive things. You're spontaneous. And then you go to in depressive episodes that hit you. And it's, it's what I was experiencing. You're depressed and you're sometimes suicidal and things like that. And so that, that's what I was experiencing. And so I got on medication and I'm still currently on it. And I was, I told her, I said, I'm terrified to get on medicine. I don't want to become dependent on anything. I don't want to feel different, you know? She says, but you do, cause you don't want to feel like this. And I was like, yeah. I imagine these are not addictive medications. No, I take oxcarbazepine. It's actually prescribed to children even, cause it's such a, like, I don't know, like not addictive and it can also help with like seizures and things like that. So this is like a neurochemical. Yeah. So I, and I made it very clear with her. If you're going to put me on medication, like this is what I want. This is what I need. And I wasn't aware they actually have like a test now where they can swab the inside of your mouth and tell how your body will react to certain drugs without having to use you as a Guinea pig. So I did that as well. And it, it's working great for me. I'm on a very, very low dose. So I can still sense like manic and depressive episodes happening, but they're just not as intense. And I just want to like gain control over it so I don't need to be on medicine. So this is something that we had Jamie Lynn on, the therapist on it. We talked about the difference between these two things because a lot of people get confused by this, right? So cluster B, if you guys look up the DSM-5, cluster B personality disorders, cluster A, it goes mad, bad and sad. The mad ones are cluster A. Cluster B is bad. Cluster C is sad. But as far as the cluster B, it's antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder and histrionic personality disorder. There are no cures for personality disorders. There's sort of treatments that you can do. No, you have a mood disorder. That's why I was going to get to the second part. You have a mood disorder. There are no treatments for personality disorders. Bipolar is a mood disorder. So the thing is, even if you're bipolar, there are periods of normal mood. Does that make sense? Like even a broken clock is going to be right twice a day. At some point, a manic depressive person is going to have, like it's hotter than shit in Texas and it gets cold in the winter. There's a few weeks there in the spring where it's like the weather's nice. You know what I'm saying? So it's like that even with a mood disorder, but you can actually, because mood disorders are neurochemical, you can actually take medication for them. So this is- Well, I also got in an argument with my psychologist because I, and I didn't know what I was talking about, but I didn't want to be on medication either. And I told her, I said, I'm not bipolar. I said, I'm depressed. I'm feeling suicidal. Like I am depressed. And she says, no. She said, if you were depressed, you would be depressed 24 seven. She said depressed people kill for those manic moods you have because they never feel that. She's like, you're not depressed. She was such a good psychologist. And so when she explained everything to me, she made me feel comfortable. And I said, okay. And I willingly got on the medicine and I'm still learning. Was she able to prescribe the medication for you? Yeah. So she was a psychologist and an MD. Yes. Okay, got it. She was like the medicine doctor. Like she's like, what do they call it? Medicine management. Okay, got it. So because I have to go every month and they have to make sure like I'm okay. But yeah, it was intense to say the least. So that's when I got that bad around Christmas and to the point where I had to get rid of my kids because I was scared of myself. And I couldn't check myself into a mental hospital. It's so twisted because then I would be risking losing my kids as well. For sure. So it's, oh man, it's so. And I'd never think about stuff like that. Like there's people out there that really, really need help. And if you get the help you need, then you can like lose your kids. But you need it for your kids. So it's just, it's crazy. Yeah, it's also, you bring that up. It's also some of the reasons why people, you mentioned before, they don't report spousal abuse. They don't report domestic abuse for the same reason. It's like, well now. And that was my situation with David. Now I'm admitting that I'm in a broken home. And then it gets even worse because now, I was reading a study just like how underreported rape is. It's unbelievable how, especially in first world countries, how underreported rape is. Sexual assault where a girl just like. I had that incident too. And then the other thing is, the men who prey on. God, man, we're getting really deep. And I don't mean to go this far in it. But the men who prey on girls who are sex workers or girls who do OnlyFans or girls who strip because they think that their complaint will not be taken seriously. I actually, I was raped when I was on my 21st birthday by my boyfriend's manager. And he told me that if I said anything, he would leave me because he was afraid to lose his job. Wow, wow. So, and I had gone to the hospital, gotten the rape kit and everything. And they, when you get a rape kit done, they call the police in and you have to report it. And he was standing right there next to me. He said, if you report this right now, like I'm going to leave you. So I didn't report it because I didn't want to get left. Wow. Yeah. There's a lot of different instances people don't think about. Yeah, rape is one of these things where like, if you, after the fact, say it was consensual, then they can't charge you, right? So it is one of these really, really odd things. But yeah, it is massively underreported because like, again, the incredible chaos that you bring into your life, as soon as you say someone raped you, and I've seen it here, one of the saddest things about living in Las Vegas, I love living here. But one of the saddest things about this is whenever I talk to a girl who anything, like she's a bartender at a nightclub or she works in bottle service and she's been sexually assaulted. And she's like- And they say you're asking for it because of the way you dress. She knows the cops are not going to take her seriously. And to be fair, like, I think Instagram did the same thing to a lot of girls. Well, in my case, I was drunk when it happened and I was hit with the, well, are you sure you just didn't make a bad decision? Yeah. You mean like you weren't in your right mind, so who's to say they raped you? And I feel like some girls are convinced of that after the fact. They're like, oh, well, yeah, I guess, this is just how it goes. And I've actually seen girls where they're like consistently drunk and then they end up like having sex with somebody that they're not interested in over and over again. And they just think it's normal. I feel like everyone's had that experience where you got drunk and you slept with somebody you wouldn't have normally slept with or you made a bad decision, whatever. Like when you're raped, it's a totally, it's a totally different feeling when you wake up. It's not like, oh, regret. It's like, I was raped. Yeah. So yeah, it's different, but you get discredited by everybody based on what you do or how you're dressed or if you were drunk, like anything. With the guy before where you felt depressed, did you end the relationship at that point? Yeah, so I was ending the relationship and it got to a point where it was like, I don't even know why you wanna be around me because I can't even stand to be around myself. Like this feeling, it was like, I just wanted to crawl out of my own skin. It was the worst feeling I've ever felt in my entire life, hands down, by a landslide. I wouldn't wish that feeling on anybody. So yeah, so I couldn't even, I couldn't shower. I couldn't get dressed. I got to a point where I couldn't even get out of bed. The kids would just be running around destroying the house and I couldn't even get up. They can't be here right now. I was afraid of myself and so that's when I called my husband, he's like, I can't come out there and get them, you have to get on a plane and get them out here. And I was like, I can't get on a plane. And I remember I was literally at one point crawling through the fucking airport. I was crying, I didn't know how I was gonna do it and I did it and I got them out there and then that's when he was like, you're not leaving. And so he had his parents watch them and he stayed with me for about two or three days and I was like, I have to go home and be in my own space and deal with this. And he was definitely helped me tremendously through it. I got back home. Thankfully Mickey was living with me at the time. He knew what I was going through, but I don't think he knew to the extent that I was going through it. And there were days where he literally I mean, I was in my room in bed like melting and he would come in and be like, come do this with us, come do that with us. And I'm like, no, you don't understand. I can't even get out of bed. And at one point he literally came in my room and grabbed my shoes and put them on my feet. And I said, I have not showered in like a week. And he goes, I don't care. And he like picked me up, threw me over his shoulders, took me out to a hockey game. And for the first time I was like, oh my God, like I feel a little bit better. We went to dinner after that. And then he just, he kept up with it and he maintained it. And he, I know he was doing it cause he was aware of it, but he never like really made it seem that way. So he played a huge role in like saving my life essentially. And then I had other friends that started doing the same thing when people were starting to notice. And I went out shooting with Xander and Cody one day and then Cody kind of had like a heart's heart with me in the car. And he told me about Dr. Joe Dispenza. And I was like, oh yeah, I follow him. Like I've been looking to his stuff. And he's like, no, no, no. Like you need to read this book, like go read this book. And it took me a couple of weeks and I went and I got the book and I read the book. And I like, I can't explain how much better I felt. All of the stuff I was trying to use to feel better. It was Dr. Joe Dispenza, Becoming Supernatural was the book. And I was, every time I turned a page, I was just like, oh my God, oh my God. And I was just, I was feeling better. And so like I became addicted to reading because it was making me feel better. It was, I didn't care what it was, you know? And then I like, I went and got all his books and I read through all of them in a couple of weeks. And then in his books, he talks heavily about meditations and he has a few guided ones online you can buy. So I started buying those. I didn't know what I was doing. I'd never meditated a day in my life. I thought meditating was sitting outside and just clearing your mind. I didn't realize that it's like really concentrating on like quantum physics and things like that. And then I started steamrolling. I was like quantum physics, neuroscience, epigenetics. Like I just started becoming like a huge nerd and getting obsessed with all this stuff. And I was buying all these books and I was geeking out till 4 a.m. going on YouTube videos down rabbit hole. Like the real quantum physics? Like yes, quantum physics. Have you seen my, we did a part, I had a theoretical physicist here. We discussed, my degree, my minor's in astronomy. Yeah, I knew that. Or astrophysics. And so we had the theoretical physicist on here. We discussed it for three hours. And then I had a flat earth debate with the physicist on. And we debated for three hours and 48 minutes whether or not the earth is flat. I'm sorry. It was pretty amazing. Pretty amazing experience seeing that. But I didn't know you were interested in quantum mechanics. Well, I didn't get into it till this was in February of this year. And so I just started nerding out and just going deep into all this stuff. And I never felt better. And so now I'm at this place where I'm almost like, well, fuck, I don't even know if I wanna date anybody because I need this in my life now. And there's so few people who are into it or really understand it. And then I don't hang out with my friends as much. And everyone's like, oh, are you going back into depression? I'm like, no, dude, I've never felt better. And it's like, I've always been that person who has to be in relationships, I have to be surrounded by 20 people all the time. You've seen my house. There's like 20 people living with me at all times. I'm like, everybody get the fuck out. Like I need to read, I need to go meditate. And I crave being alone. Well, I would like to officially welcome you to our club. The Likes to Be Alone Nerd Read Books All Day Club. I've been a member for 25 years. Welcome to the club. You're welcome to join us. I'm a newbie. Huh? I'm a newbie. I got some book recommendations for you. Send them my way. All right, awesome. So let's talk about a couple of things. So now at this point, you guys broke up and you haven't seen any, you haven't seriously seen anybody since? The depressed guy? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, no, nope. Since I, as I'm saying, that's February. And then when I was reading Dr. Dos Vendas' books, he's always talking about his retreats and his students. His students, and they talk about like people they've cured of like cancer and all this crazy stuff. And I was like, well, maybe this will help with my aneurysms. Maybe I can cure my depression and not be on my medication. So I like, I'm not kidding you. They do these retreats in like a drop. Like you gotta be on at 10 a.m. and get it, or it's sold out. And it's like two grand. And there was one in San Diego and I missed it. And then I got the one in Cancun, which ended up being a million times better. And I just went to that at the end of June. So it's only been a month since I feel so much better. And I know I haven't dated anyone because I don't I Haven't found anyone that I don't think I want to fuck. Yeah girl. Welcome to the streets We'd like to officially welcome you back to the streets. No, the streets aren't for me I want to go home. I love being in relationships like I'm a relationship person, but like I just I my standards are so high and I'm like Not the same person I was and I just haven't found anyone. I don't want anyone to as your friend I don't want anyone to abuse you that makes me very fucking angry that somebody would do that to you, right? And the other reason why it makes me angry is because you're also Brandy fucking Andrews like you can have anyone you want So that makes me additionally angry that someone would abuse you, right? So, I mean that that's that's a that's part of the issue. There's another thing I want to ask you So what happens now so you break this guy wanted you to film boy girl Do you keep doing it after you guys break up? Like what what do you what is the decision to do after that? I've never really filmed with anybody. I I had like one video of me and my husband right before that that had gotten out there But no, I've never even in relationships before only fans was a thing I was never one to like film for pleasure of like no, no Like I would never let guys film me So so you brought up something in a previous interview that I saw that was really interesting and I've been asking a lot of Girls, I saw I asked you as well and I already know what your answer is You're in a monogamous relationship with a guy. Would you film with someone else having no feelings involved? Well, it literally Swedish Bella was on here saying that she would or saying that a woman should Would you ever film with someone outside of your relationship strictly with no emotions being in a monogamous relationship? Do you understand what I'm asking? No, I if I'm like, I'm like I said, I am all or nothing if I'm with the guy You're my guy and we're in a monogamous relationship There's no such thing as having sex with somebody with no emotions that like that's not monogamous then No, I if I'm with somebody like I'm with you you're mine. I'm yours like the end. I feel the same way I am shocked at how many women feel the opposite way and you actually brought it up on your only fan There's not an excuse to go like there's ways to roleplay with your own man or do things like and I have no no urge I'm not like a lot of people see me on Instagram and I know I come off in a certain way because that's my job That's my brand but like I am the least Sluttiest girl you've ever met like I I really don't I'm not Promiscuous in any way and I'm sure like I've had situations where like when I hooked up with a guy it would probably seem too Easier to whatever and it's just cuz like I know what I want if I want to get it But like don't think that I'm like this with everybody and don't think you did that You know what? I mean? But like I'm really picky. I'm really shallow But like I don't know I don't sleep around and I and if I'm in a relationship Like so I'm saying I want to be in a relationship because I don't I'm not for the streets you guys like this was not It's not for me. So my streets are a different street. This is Sesame Street where I live We read we read books and we go to the gym. That's what that's my yeah I seriously they like even yesterday. I woke up eight went to the gym fell asleep all day Woke up just went to the gym again So I didn't know what to do with myself and like they're trying to talk to guys these days You know, you want to see a text I got? Yeah, tell me what tell me what you got Show me this guy's messaging me. I don't even know if you want to like show it or say I'm not gonna show it But you can paraphrase what it is that he's saying This this is what I deal with But by the way, shout out to the men of the men of action group who would never do shit like this This is you're gonna like this this is my reason I'm showing you Okay, this is what I deal with You He said how do you communicate What if I that that's the most unattractive statement you can say to a girl is it don't ask don't ever ask girl She has snapchat by it If the second a guy says do you have snap block? I'm done. You say how do you communicate? You should have said in English. That's what I would have said. Yeah, and then when I said I don't I that was text Do you have snap I said no and he's like, well, how do you communicate how do you get if you don't use snap? That's hilarious. So I'm done. I'm done. All right, so a couple of things I want to oh, so no The reason why I was asking the question before is because you said in that previous interview I thought was interesting. You're like every time you meet a guy your first thought is what he filmed with me No, I didn't say that's my first thought I said But I do have that thought like if I'm dating a guy because like I said, this is all new to me I was not filming boy girl before I filmed with my boyfriend one because I was really comfortable with him So sure I got with another guy. I don't maybe I don't have that kind of comfort with him. I don't know no, it's It's not an immediate thought but like yeah, if I'm if I'm with a guy it's like hey I wonder if he'd film with me and if he's down cool if he's not down cool I'll just keep doing solo content. So the reason why I'm asking this is because this is something I Frequently have my female friends tell me that they have the same question whenever they're dating So you can't it every girl says she doesn't she's lying Like if you film that kind of stuff and you're dating guy You're obviously gonna wonder if he's down for it like and it it's not a requirement It's just a curiosity thought and then but you and I both know people where it is a requirement. Oh Absolutely. I'm saying for me It's not a requirement because I wasn't doing boy girl before and if I don't ever do boy girl again, I don't care Yeah, those videos will just sell for way more. Yeah, for sure. Definitely. Cool. That was awesome Alright, so here's the thing you so you can't lift heavy weights now. How often do you work out every day twice a day now? Yeah, yeah, I've been doing two days because I have no life. You're just normally like an ectomorph like you're just normally really skinny Yeah, yeah growing up in high school. I was bullied so bad people would be like, she's bulimic. She's anorexic eat a cheeseburger I'm like, I just ate 12 Like I'm just always and I played sports my whole life soccer mostly and I'm just cardio the whole time when you when you Got that all the tests and you ever have your testosterone or estrogen checked. Yeah, I have high testosterone levels That's what I was getting at. Yeah, I mean cuz like, you know, generally it's good It's but you end up with a high sex drive, but you have a really nice skin women Usually have really nice skin going, you know, I don't want to get it fixed. There you go. I like having high testosterone Beautiful also, you're a gamer. So you were trying to you play what do you play? Do you play GTA? No, so, you know what when kovat hit I felt really bad My son had nothing he could really do and he wasn't a big gamer. We were always like outdoors people, you know Yeah, and so kovat hit he wanted, you know, I got him PlayStation. I hadn't played video games I used to be a huge gamer growing up. Uh-huh, and then Halo came out That's the one and I couldn't grasp the car I was just like the double-oh-seven with the n64 and then I couldn't grasp the concept of having two Joysticks like I couldn't move and look at the same time and it pissed me off so bad Because I'm so competitive that I just stopped gaming when really about yeah, I couldn't I couldn't pick it up Mm-hmm pick it up So I gave up and then my son was into fortnight all the kids were in fortnight And so he's playing and you know, I felt left out like me and him are so close and that's like my best friend We do everything together and he's just they're playing video games all day and I'm like, man, like I want to play with you You know, I mean, so I was like, okay so I learned how to play video games all over again for him so I had something to do with him and Then I got a PS and I'd be in my room and he'd be in the living room We'd be playing fortnight together or night. You play Red Dead Redemption or GTA 5 or anything like that? No, I played a Call of Duty black ops and that was a thing. The new Call of Duty is the zombies one You'll play zombies with your with your son Yeah I mean I played those ones that I wanted to get on like the real Call of Duty that like everyone plays but like People are talking about war to my war zone. Yeah, people are like way too good on there Well the thing I will say this about war zone. I know I did not expect us to get into this topic They're starting to do really really they're doing a much better job of skill matching So if you're not well, actually, um, the best skill matching I've ever seen is is fortnight The reason why for tonight so popular the levels Yeah if you're Terrible at the game the game very quickly can tell that you're terrible and put you in a lobby with terrible people and then you're having Fun getting kills actually like missing shots, but it's still fun. It keeps you playing Cod was bad so I'm a competitor I was a competitive Madden player and so once you get to the top levels like every game is a sweat like You're playing against guys who do nothing but cheat I haven't had a you don't you don't have any fun games once you get to the top and it's the same thing for Call Of Duty those guys are fucking murderers. Well, no, cuz when you get that good though Yeah, like if Call of Duty is starting to do that, then they'll take off because that's why I went back to fortnight I was like fuck this. Yeah, but yeah, and like dude, there's kids are like cussing at me and stuff and like Build and no build and there's like The things people these kids say to each other over over You know, like inner means like bitch, but I'm like this kids ain't like I gotta cool it but Yeah, and I don't know. I like like the build no build. I like the colors like I don't know It's like fortnight. It's like more fun. No build fortnight. Got it. No build. Yeah, okay So now here's the other thing I want to ask you about so the evolution of a laugh, right? so you you talked about before making six figures a month on only fans, there's been a you said you started in 2019 and Nara came in here and she talked about how much she would sell a video for and then now it's like $20 Like the the industry is getting saturated Do you get that vibe or do you feel like you've mentioned before you have a very loyal? Group of fans has everything stayed the same for you I'm not one to ever like boast about myself, but I'm like my biggest flex is my fans I have the most loyal fans. Yeah, and I've had collab with other girls I've had agencies look at my stuff and they're like even they're like, oh my god. You have the most loyal fan So no, I'm not experiencing any that I can sell whatever for whatever and they just want to see me They my fans love me and even if I sold it for cheaper, they'd still throw me tips on top of it Like do you have an agency? Yes. Okay. Okay, and what made you choose this agency over other ones? The girls that they're with so like one of the the main things of an agency that they provide for you is they have these content houses that they provide and you travel and then they bring all the girls, you know that are within the agency for you to collab with each other and The girls that they had signed were all girls I would have loved to work with and all girls I know are super successful and it's just like, you know Nor who you surround yourself with I'm not do you want to say who it is the agency? Yeah They're called creators Inc They're not like they don't really earn aren't known by their name, but the the owner of its Andy Okay, and so if anyone's ever talked to Andy, he's amazing. Love him Yeah, he's he's a really good good owner manager. Like he gets us on good trips. He gets us good content collabs going He has amazing girls signed to him. He will go up to bat for you. He's just like he's amazing You have also noticed I've said it on this program several times. Nobody hates women more than Instagram Instagram built their entire does well. Yeah, tick-tock. That is a good point Instagram built their entire platform off attractive women. I used to joke Instagram is basically women in the Western Hemisphere posting pictures being viewed by men in the Eastern Hemisphere like That's the majority of their of their content and then what happened was as they wanted to be taken seriously as a platform then they started changing it and it was like it's Like there's nothing I'm gonna say this now if someone from Instagram is listening There's nothing lascivious about a woman standing in a fucking bikini Nothing. There's nothing that needs to be reported Look at your page though Because when I was doing fitness modeling like a hundred percent wasn't in the sex industry whatsoever and I was doing fitness modeling I could sit there and post myself in a near naked bikini and I'm flexing I'm showing my body off because I just do it I mean, I didn't compete or anything, but I mean like you're doing a competition or you just are using these supplements Whatever and I can show my body off and it's okay. But then when I'm I have a page that's Related to sexual content. I'm in the same bikini doing the same post because I'm proud of my body and I'm showing it off now It's not okay. Yeah, because they see that you're related to the sex industry. Yeah, it's so hypocritical We so part of the bikini competition I'm hosting for playboy at at wet Republic One of the things we were doing was this online port portion portion and I told the organizers I was like just so you know, some of the biggest influencers are gonna come they're gonna lose their Instagram This summer and I was telling him beforehand I'm just like a good 20% of the girls that we're gonna have in this competition We'll have lost their Instagram at least once during the summer girls have lost five six seven Instagrams And then tick-tock is I'm on a you're and I'm on tick-tock. I'm on account number 11 Yeah, so just for tick-tock it's even but the tick-tock was always this way basically tracking IP addresses. Yes. Yeah Yeah, tick-tock is one of these things where Kylie's but straight-up told me she's like if you show a a Straight-on image of a girl's butt and if there's any like girth to it if it's round you will immediately get banned afterwards I didn't understand because I had more followers than her at one point and I was like, how's this happening? You know She's like I keep getting my account taken down Because all the other thing is male influencers tend to get like way more leeway than female. There's dudes Off in their dick around in their sweatpants and it's okay, but then you walk out of bikini and you're deleted Yeah, I've not seen the same I've not seen gay content being cut down quite at the same level that the reason why I know this is because I have a Female friend of mine and she's lost several Instagrams and she's dating a guy and he's a heterosexual guy But he makes contents clearly for gay men and but who's to say that's who it's for right? But well, what right maybe you're right Well, I think tick-tock puts it in that category and the things that he does are just as lascivious as what she does But he never listens to stuff and I said it's for women though. Yeah, so now it's okay Yeah, I think and then the other the other thing with tick-tock Which is obviously extremely disturbing is that if you are a twelve-year-old girl and you're dancing in in, you know Barely wearing anything that never gets banned That's that's also something that's like really really creepy on that platform Yeah, well your algorithm isn't you don't watch my so you're gonna see it But that's something a lot of people complain about is that they have these little girls doing these dances wearing barely anything They never get banned but like a girl with any kind of curves like I it's all political at the end of the day It's all political because I know people at Instagram. I know people that work for Metta I know people that you know that are have plugs at tick-tock and it's all political because there are girls that I know That I could name-drop right now that are their pages are so obviously Geared towards only fans and they haven't been deleted and they have a blue check mark Yeah, and I'm like I have I'm trying to start new pages I could have 20 followers and I'm already deleted for a tick-tock. I'm wearing a hoodie. Yeah, so it's it's political and same thing with Instagram Yeah, there's girls that kids literally post the exact same video and one's gonna get deleted and the others not yeah, it's pretty amazing Oh, no I think I can't remember who it was but I Experimented where I posted the same video on my my tick-tock and she posted it on hers Hers got taken down and mine didn't because I was a male influencer and tick-tock does things a little different The thing is I was trained from tick-tock is that like simply having breast implants is offensive on tick-tock Like the very fact that you even have them will get you suspended I know people think I'm exaggerating if you think I'm exaggerating go try it and see what happens There's a lady who is supporting the Ukraine when all that stuff happened, and she's holding a sign completely topless. And she's on TikTok and she's fine, because it was related to the Ukraine stuff. There's women who are breastfeeding and you can see their entire nipple and it's okay cuz they're breastfeeding. It's just like. Yeah, it is kind of, and the thing is, it wasn't like this before. If you go back to 2014, 2015, you weren't seeing girls getting suspended at this rate. Like what's happened in the last year. It's cuz OnlyFans has been such a big thing since COVID. But the funny thing is, when you were mentioning Instagram not even be related with sex workers, OnlyFans doesn't even want to either. In October of last year, if you remember, they were threatening to kick all the sex workers off. And you had to have talent to be on there. And that was it. And then they realized, they make us all our money, we can't do this. Yeah, I think what happened was when, cuz they were gonna go public. I think what happened was the bank- Yeah, but we make them all their money. Yeah, but they didn't. Again, you understand, you know that, cuz you're one of the people working for OnlyFans. The multi-billion dollar bank that's underwriting it, they don't look on OnlyFans. They're just listening to what they're told. And probably when they made the announcement, hey, there's no publicly traded company that does pornography, so we're not gonna allow you to do this. They probably went in there and then got estimations like, well, you're gonna lose $2 billion a year if you do this. And they were like, 2 billion? Okay, let's go ahead and go back to the original. I think that's essentially what happened. And I get asked all the time, why don't you work with more brands? Or why aren't you reaching out to brands? You have such a huge platform. And I really don't think people understand how many companies and people do not want to be associated with a sex worker. If you're gonna do sex work, that's all you're doing cuz no one else wants to fuck with you. Wow, okay. Have you found that problem? I know you said you're single now, but with dating, have you found OF to be an issue? Yeah, not directly, but here's the thing. If a guy didn't want to date a girl cuz she had an OnlyFans, and I'm sure it's happened a million times, I wouldn't know because they just wouldn't hit me up. They would go to my page, immediately see that I do OnlyFans, and steer away. And it's probably happened so many times I don't even know about it. And then the other thing is, a guy's like, yeah, I would date an OnlyFans girl. And they act like they wanna date you, but really they think you're like, because you're an OnlyFans girl, you're just gonna put out, you know what I mean? And they try to play that card, then really they just wanna fuck. So they're not gonna take you seriously, but whatever. Do you, after this whole, all the things that you've learned, do you believe that monogamy is a natural state for people in general? And you specifically, do you ever question whether or not monogamy works in general, or do you, is this still the thing that you want? Honestly, and I never thought I would say that, yeah. Since being in this industry, I don't question whether it's a natural state. I still believe it's a natural state. I'm questioning if it's, with this day and age, if it's realistic anymore. Because I've found myself thinking I'd be willing to compromise things I never would have compromised before. I don't think it has anything to do with being in the OnlyFans industry, though. I think it's starting to be that way for everybody. Like, even if you don't have an OnlyFans, like I know so many people that are in open relationships now. And neither one of them were ever in the sex industry or whatever. I think it's just like, and I, no, I don't agree with it. Like, I will die single before I will be in a non-monogamous relationship. So monogamy is right for you. Monogamy is what I want. Yes. Yes, and if I can't have it, then I just won't date. So I'm not gonna be in a relationship and agree to something I'm not really okay with, and pretend to be okay with it. Here's what the science sort of leads to, is the idea that monogamy is a thing two people have to work at. It's not actually the natural state. It's anything, anything you have to work at. Well, so do you understand, I've said this before, Cinderella has fucked up more relationships than probably any single movie that's ever come out. Because Cinderella makes you think you deserve to be happy, and that there's a soulmate that you deserve. You don't deserve shit. You work for it. You find someone who's amazing. It works. Deserve is the wrong word, but I think everyone's worthy of it. Well, sure, worthy. But you still, I'm worthy of a million dollars, but I still gotta work for it. I still gotta work for it. It's not gonna manifest, right? In Cinderella, there's a soulmate, a Prince Charming, who just shows up, and then all of a sudden, everyone else is waiting for their Prince Charming. And I'm like, you gotta go to the gym, too. I don't think that's necessarily realistic, per se, but I think, I think whatever you honestly believe and think that you want, you can get. But you gotta work for it. Do you? Yeah, I think you do. I fundamentally believe that- In any sort of way. Like I said, since I've been heavy into meditating and stuff like that. You're working for your happiness. I would say, meditations work. So yeah, in a way- You have to work for it. No one's manifesting a billion dollars for you because you're a Sagittarius. It doesn't work like that. No, not like that, but I'm saying- People believe that, though, Brandy. That's my point. The point is people legitimately believe that I'm just gonna sit at home, I'm gonna keep getting fatter, and then God's gonna send me a soulmate. No, it is not how the world works. That's the point I'm trying to make. Okay, yeah, to that extreme, I understand what you're saying. Well, my whole point is monogamy, there's no science that shows that monogamy is the natural state for humans. We didn't even have marriage until 11,000 years ago, and our species is 300,000 years old, and hominids are 3 million years old. There's 5,000 species of mammals on this planet, and 3% of them have any kind of pair bonding. We're the only ones that go 50 years. There's no other mammals that do, but there might be some kind of bird or some shit, but for the most part, they don't do this. And so, no, I think there are some elephants that do this. But for the most part, this type of pair bonding, it's not that it's wrong or right. Evolutionary psychology, which is what that book is about, is not about wrong or right. It's about what is and isn't, right? And so the idea that our natural state is monogamy, there's no science behind that. But if you want monogamy, you have to work for it. If you wanna work for it, it's awesome. Go ahead, if you see a bodybuilder and he's big and really swole, it's because he works for it. If he stops taking supplements and stops working out, it goes away. Right, right, right, I get what you're saying, I get what you're saying. And if both people don't work for it. Again, Brandy, 56% of the marriages in this country end in divorce. Like, it's not because, wait, I thought we were all soulmates. I thought we said shit at the wedding. That doesn't necessarily always have to do with monogamy, though. Like, you have to work at everything. You have to work at marriage. You have to work at emotional states, too, not just physical. But, I mean, like I said, I've caught myself lately just questioning what I would allow, what I'm comfortable with in relationships now. Because now I have been, like I said, I'm a relationship person. A lot of my relationships have been around four years. And when you get that long or like even longer, I've lost sexual attraction to men while I'm still like in love with them, though, in relationships. I've lost the intimacy, like I've experienced that. And now because I've experienced that, you know, and yeah, you do have to work at it. I question, like, there's these phases in relationships. Like when you first get together, you got that honeymoon puppy love phase and you're obsessed with each other. So like, you could never think about your partner being with somebody else. Then you get a couple of years down the road and you get to that point where like, where is he at? Like, I don't fucking know. You know what I mean? Like, I don't even know what he's doing anymore, but I love him, you know what I mean? But the sexual chemistry maybe has died down a little bit. And then it gets to a point where I haven't made it past that point. But I'm like, maybe if I got to that point where I was losing the physical attraction, the sexual chemistry was dying down a little bit, but I still love this man and I want to be with him for the rest of his life. Maybe I would let him have like a hall pass here and there. But I'm such an emotional person that it would have to be like out of sight, out of mind. Like, hey, like I know you're going out with Tom this week and do whatever you want to do. I don't want to see about it. I don't want to hear about it. And like, you're not getting, there can be no emotional attachment there. Like it is going to be a fuck and that's all it's going to be. And yeah, like a hall pass. But nowadays everyone's so emotionally involved in things. I don't necessarily know that I could trust the guy to go hook up with a girl and there not be any emotions attached to it because the girl and the guy almost need that to have good sex. I don't know that the guy needs that. So men don't need comfort. Men absolutely positively do not. If any man tells you this, he's a fucking liar. Men do not need comfort to have sex. If the most beautiful woman you've ever seen wants to come up and have sex with you behind a fucking dumpster, you ask what time? Are you going to enjoy it as much as you enjoy it? As far as men, yes. We don't give a shit. If you didn't know that. You don't have better sex with girls when you have an emotional connection with them? We don't give a shit. I know you think that that's the case. I know you don't give a shit, but I'm saying like when you. No, some of the best sex guys will tell you they ever had was in a fucking unisex bathroom with someone they don't even know their name. I know for women, it's like that. And I'm not saying that they're there. There's a difference is it's completely compartmentalized. You've never had like extreme passionate sex with somebody that you couldn't have had with like somebody you didn't know? No, but different types of enjoyment, but they were both great. They were both 10 out of 10, but they were different. Whereas for a woman, a lot of times sex without the love component, it will never be incredible, right? I've talked to women before. It was like, they would rather have average sex with their boyfriend they're in love with than go cheat and they met some other guy, went on a date and they had like more orgasms they've ever had in their life. They'd still go rather go back to their boyfriend because they're in love with him. No, no, I don't agree with that. I just feel like it's hard for me to achieve an orgasm if I'm not like super emotionally connected. Okay, so you know a lot of women are not like you. You know that, right? Oh, no. Yeah, so you should, ready? First book, it's called Why Women Have Sex by David Buss and Cindy Messon of the University of Texas at Austin. And they talk about this. I can have casual sex if I want to, but I'm not going to achieve an orgasm or really be like, oh my God, that was so good without the like emotional touch. I know some women that cannot achieve an orgasm with their committed partner and when they go outside of the relationship cannot stop having orgasms. I know some women that literally, that you should read the book because it's 17,000 women. Let's just narrow down my dating pool even more. Why? What do you mean? I don't know. It doesn't like, your dating pool is massive. You're Brandi fucking Andrews. Everybody wants to date you. You have nothing to worry about. You being selective is something you should worry about, for sure. Having some friends around you who genuinely care about you and then asking them, hey, does this seem like a red flag? That's a great fucking idea. You're grown up enough to do that. But like for real, like I wouldn't, you have nothing to worry about, girl. Come on. Seriously? Yeah, I do because I, nevermind. Girl, you're amazing. You have nothing to worry about, seriously. But the thing I want to explain to you is this, because a lot of women don't understand this. If my free testosterone is 1,100 and yours is 90, do you understand how big of a difference that is? Yeah. Women do not understand what it, like if you listen to a woman who takes anabolic steroids, she's like, oh my God, all I could think about was sex. I was going crazy. I have high testosterone. And it's like, no, but for you, high testosterone is 140. For me, high testosterone is 1,300. There's a completely big, you having high testosterone, you still can't bench 375. Like there's a big difference between your high testosterone and my high testosterone. Right? So that's the thing. So when you understand that, men can completely, here, I'll give you an example. With men, when men cheat, I brought this up 50 times in the program. When men cheat, men who cheat, men who don't cheat, they report the exact same sexual, the exact same satisfaction in the marriage. When women cheat, and women who don't cheat, the women who do cheat, 80% of the time they report lower satisfaction in the marriage. When men cheat, it is not to end the relationship. When women cheat, it is generally to end the relationship. And so when you see that, like you understand for men, they can completely compartmentalize it. This idea that the sex is better because I'm in love, I've been in love and had sex. Not necessarily in love, but like even just have like an emotional connection. Like I said, like it's like. I'm not telling you it's not great. I'm telling you having an emotional connection is great and sex is great. And they don't necessarily have anything to do with each other. As a man, they don't. I'm not saying they always don't, but I'm telling you right now, dudes have been in Cancun and had the best sex of their life with some like a threesome with two girls they've never met before, because we're men. We don't need, this is the thing. If a woman did not, if a woman would have sex in a cardboard box, a man would not buy a house. We do not need comfort at all. Men do not need any comfort in order to have sex. They don't. Women do. Women have a seduction process that they go through. It's like, well, I need to know these things. I need to feel comfortable. I need to feel safe. I need to be fucking attracted to them. Men just need one thing. They need to be attracted. This changes everything. No, it doesn't change everything. You knew this. No, well, I have guy friends and we've talked about stuff and I've had guy friends tell me different. What did they tell you? I've had guy friends, like not all of them, but I mean, I have had them say like, it's way better with my girlfriend because you're more comfortable and so you're doing more. But you're doing more. That's what makes it better. It's not just because I have an intimate relationship. If I find a woman- It's like if you have a one night stand with some chick, it's gonna be pretty basic sex, but when you've had sex with a chick for the 20th time, you're doing crazier shit. I have found both things to be true. I have found both. I agree with everything you're saying, but I'm just saying I have guy friends who have said- I've met women that on the first date, it was like everything was true. I was doing things that I didn't do with the girl I was with for two years. The thing is- I can see that. I've been there. Okay, so here's the thing, right? What women are attracted to, this is the great thing about this book. What men are attracted to is very simple. Like no girl, no dude does not find you attractive. Every dude. I don't consider, they may be lying to you. Every dude's gonna find you attractive. For women, not every woman finds every guy attractive. Some of the guys you described with the tattoos on the face covered in ink, some women don't find that attractive. There are women who think I'm incredibly attractive because I rescue animals, and there's some women who think I'm fucking disgusting because I rescue animals. For women, it is completely different. For men, it's like we just see Jessica- What's her face? Who's the girl? Margot Robbie. Okay, here we go. Margot Robbie in fucking Wolf of Wall Street. Every dude is like, yeah, she's hot. Even guys who are like- Every girl thought she was hot, and I'm gonna be like, you can't deny that. So do you understand how the distribution is massive for that? Every girl thinks she's hot. Or every guy thinks she's hot. But for dudes, there's no universal- Even if you were like, does every girl in here think that Brad Pitt is handsome? They'd all say yes. How many of you guys would have sex with him tonight? About half of them would be like no. Or three-fourths of them would be like no. If you're like, hey, how many of you guys wanna have sex with Jessica? Like 22-year-old Jessica Alba. 100% of the guys would say yes. Do you understand? That's the difference I'm trying to make you. We don't need comfort. We just, if we see an attractive woman, we just don't need comfort. Is it better if you're in love with someone? Of course it's better. But my point is, being in love with someone is what makes it awesome. And having sex is awesome. But they don't have to be the same thing. Because you can have, as a man, have an incredible threesome with some girls that you meet in fucking Jamaica. And then that's also awesome. That's an incredible experience. You're getting really specific. Tulum. Sorry. Am I telling on myself? I don't have sex. I don't know. I'm different street. I'm on Sesame Street. I'm not on the same street. All right, cool. So yeah, I wanted to ask you about monogamy. And then the other thing is, I thought it was really interesting about you is that girls who do, so you talked about the professional videos. And then you talked about doing with your iPhone. And then I see a lot of girls, my best friend is CJ Sparks. And she does a lot of photos with no makeup. And they do better. Because they have no makeup. I talked about that too. Yes, that's why I said, like, my fans are so loyal, I think, because they know they're getting the real me. If I take a video and I have a pimple like I do right now, I have a pimple on my face or I'm like walking around and I trip and I fall in the middle of video and I'm laughing. I'm like, send it. I don't care what the more stuff that is chaos like in your video, like send it, send it, send it, because the better it's going to turn out. It seems so genuine. It's so authentic. Rather than like the like guys don't want to feel like they're flipping through a Playboy magazine. So you don't want to be too perfect. It's boring. It is. So managing a strip club, that's one of the things I noticed. I always thought the prettiest girls would make the most money. And it was the girls that were the most relatable. Yeah, they ended up making the most. And you ever like and girls say it to me all the time. They're like, well, I want to start Nelly Pants. This is that and like, show me some girls like she's not even that cute. I don't know how many times I've heard that statement come out of other girls. Well, she's not even that cute. I'm like, I promise you, she's got other shit she's offering. Yeah, like she you might not think she's that cute, but she did something and that just made her ten times hotter. Yeah. Like you said, the girlfriend experience, that's something like I get that compliment on my page all the time, too. They're like, I think your personality makes you so much more attractive. So much more is your personality. It's because I don't give a fuck. Yes. Well, that's one thing I noticed about you on that bus ride in Jamaica. You definitely do not give a fuck. Yeah, I think I have it tattooed on me. Yeah. So it says, oh, there you go. There. Nice, nice. OK, what do you have coming up in the future? Do you have anything planned? You want to start? You said you want to start a YouTube. What do you plan on doing? Yeah, I just like I'm because Instagram and TikTok are like limiting us so hardcore right now. I'm trying to reach out to other avenues to have more traffic pushed. And I think I'm I'm kind of over the not over it. But like with Instagram, like there's no personality there. I don't know how many times people meet me in person. They're like, you're way cooler in person than I thought you were. You're so much nicer. Like, I thought you were a bitch. I thought you were this. And I was like, I can't get my personality across my pictures on Instagram. So I try to story a lot. But like YouTube, I feel like I could get a whole personality across. And plus, my life is ten times crazier than people even know about. Oh, no, they know now. They don't know. But it still is. But like all positive stuff now. And I would love for people to see that. I would love to just like have those memories documented. So I was trying to do YouTube. I'm getting into real estate investing. I'm getting heavy. I'm actually buying a house this week in Scottsdale. I'm really excited about. Yeah. And just I don't know, I just I want to start doing other stuff like OnlyFans is pumping up a lot of like opportunities I wouldn't have had otherwise. But I'm kind of ready to switch over and be done. Nice. Nice. That's awesome, man. No, you you're going to get a bunch of clips from this. That's what a lot of girls like. A lot of times why I do have girls that are that work on OnlyFans come on this podcast is because they get to you get to learn things that obviously they wouldn't know, because like you said about Instagram, this content, though, the 15 second clips or the 90 second clips of a podcast. For whatever reason, Instagram and Tick-Tock love the shit out of these. Anytime it's a pot, they see the microphone, the algorithms. Oh, it's micro. It's a podcast. They promote the shit out of it. That's why no jumper can get away with shit, that saying stuff, saying shit that you can't that these other girls can't do because they see the microphone. So it's a different algorithm that they're going by. I noticed that as soon as I changed my Tick-Tock to podcast, no problems ever. No. And it's the same girls saying the same shit. And some of them are even dressed in a different environment. Yeah. And it just it just changes everything. So that's the way it works. So do take take as many clips out of this Swedish Bella coffee and cleavage. They actually took the episode, put it up on their left. OK, yeah, I took the whole episode and put it out there. Yeah, it's pretty everywhere. Yeah, for sure. My first YouTube video. Listen, I'm awesome. This will be your first YouTube video. Hey, listen, we're really happy to have her. Listen, guys, this is you know what? One of the reasons I want to do this episode is because I knew how cool Brandy was. And if you just like she said, she said the last point she made. If you look on her Instagram, one top one of the problems is like we just sexualize or it is and it's not even it's not the girl's fault. It's nobody's fault. But like you just see how pretty they are and you don't see anything else or know that there's anything else. One of the reasons why I want to have this podcast is because of the intellectual curiosity. And I also wanted people to give their side of the story about all kinds of different stuff. You know, I'm having some very controversial individuals come on in the next couple of weeks, and I want to hear their side of the story. And with some of these only fans, girls or girls that do modeling in general, whatever, like I want you to see that there's a full flesh 360 degree personality that's in there. And a lot of times we lose that. We lose that ability to see that. And when we do that, when we start sexualizing people or just seeing them as objects and we lose empathy for them, empathy for the fact that they may be dealing with depression or other things that are going on in their life that we we we may be able to associate with. So I'm really happy. This is awesome. This could not have possibly gone better. I'm glad that we had Brandy on here, guys. We have so many more interviews coming your way. Where can we find you, Brandy? Everywhere. Brandy the Andrews on Instagram and then just go to my bio. All my links are on there. There you go. All your links for things that you can't even say on Instagram anymore. Instagram is like the abusive boyfriend. If you don't want to make money with me and you can't. That's why I love it so much. You can't make money. You can't make money anywhere else. All right, guys. Thank you guys so much for joining us. And we will see you next week. \", \"segments\": [{\"id\": 0, \"seek\": 0, \"start\": 0.0, \"end\": 21.239999771118164, \"text\": \" Welcome back, guys. I'm really excited.
