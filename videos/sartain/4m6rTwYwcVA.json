And it's the Bill Burr quote, women are surrounded by this tornado of misinformation and nobody corrects them because we all want to fuck them. Because I coach mostly men, one of the things that I noticed is that there's no safety net for men. So like, for instance, if they keep getting fatter, women stop sleeping with them and the world gives them a very real dose of reality. If they don't make enough money, they can't afford certain things and the world gives, unless they're living in their mom's basement or their welfare. What I'm saying is, we call this in the U.S. military self-critiquing. So for instance, if you go land the plane and you forget to put the gear down, it's self-critiquing. You can only do it once and then you'd never make that mistake again, right? Certain things are self, like when I leave the apartment without my keys or my glasses, as soon as I walk out, I'm like, okay, now I realize self-critiquing. For men, most of our mistakes and our shortcomings are self-critiquing. If we do this thing, we go up and try to steal a guy's girlfriend and he's bigger than us, then he beats the shit out of us. Like these kinds of things. For women, there seems to be the safety net that they have because of their physical attractiveness and even past their level of physical attractiveness, there's still a good number of men that will sleep with them. There's a safety net for them. And because of that, in addition to the emotionality, you talk about telling women anything constructive and how it just doesn't seem to work when you tell them something constructive as opposed to men. And I don't think it's because men are smarter than women. I think it is seriously because when we do things wrong, there's a punishment for us. The world is constantly telling us no. And so you've found this, because again, most of my friends right now are female. And when I talk to them about things, I'm like, hey, so here's what's going to happen with you and this guy. You're going to tell me you're not going to fuck this dude again. You're going to get drunk around Thursday, Friday. You're going to text him. He's going to fuck you. You're going to feel terrible about it. You're going to hit me up. I'm not going to judge you, but then you're going to go back and you're going to have sex with him again. So even though I'm going to tell you everything's wrong with this dude, you're going to go fuck him anyway. So, you know, there's really no point. Have you found it? I have. That's why I don't consult women generally. They have to be, they're pretty desperate and destitute. I don't mean in a bad way. They've hit rock bottom. And when they're coming to me and some women are sincere about it, but I have found that most of my efforts to constructively criticize women, like just simply getting my, my book worthless is over 12 years old. The women of today would not have their financial troubles if they read that book and did what was in the book, not majoring in dumb stuff. Uh, I have found women are just impervious to constructive criticism unless they're in a true state of crisis. And it's the bill Burr quote, uh, women are surrounded by this tornado of misinformation and, uh, nobody corrects them because we all want to fuck them. Yeah. And they, that there's always a captain save a ho men are always shielding women from reality, even if it is the consequences of their own mistakes. And so you can't beat that. And what inevitably, I don't know, you ever hear of the perfect mental state? No. Okay. It's, I had to come up with this concept as to why you can't get a girl to major in engineering, why you can't get a girl to hit the gym and slim down to find the guy. And what I realized is that women's primary goal is to maintain this thing. Why I call the perfect mental state. It is more important that they have this perfect mental state where there's nothing wrong and there's no obligation and there's no responsibility, there's no liability, there's no chore, there is no pain than it is to actually be successful and have progress in the real world. And so I like, and I have like a gold dream. The goal of every woman is to get Ryan Gosling. The dream is to do it without any effort. Like he just shows up and likes her, you know, did you hear that one girl talking to a Mac and Murphy saying Ryan Gosling was average? Yeah. Yeah. And like even ride Gosling's not enough. So I want to point out anyway, so because there's always a bit, they've never had death consequent because a guy will usually come in and like, okay, well you didn't change your oil. The car broke down. I'll pick you up and drive you. So, but whatever, when you try to say, look, if you do these things, you will have progress in the real world because those things require work, sacrifice, or ultimately changing the real world perception forever. Like, oh my gosh, I have to do this. Like I have to change oil every 5,000 miles. Oh, they will immediately go back to the perfect mental state and simply ignore it. Yes. And then, then you could say, then the next stage is when you try to introduce some kind of rehab for their own benefit. Like if I, okay, let me, let me see if you can guess this handful of times I've talked to girls about their degree choices. The girl says, I'm going to major in journalism. I say that as a stupid major, you're going to be poor. You're going to be financially destitute. Look at your millennial elder sisters. What's their reaction? Like, I'm going to do it anyway. Or like, that's not me. I, whenever I bring up statistics to women, they're like, those statistics don't count for me. My favorite one is statistics don't cover everyone. And I'm like, yes, they do. That's why they're called statistics. They cover everyone. I wish it was that nice. I'm immediately misogynist. What are you killing my dreams? Like I'm the bad guy. And I only got so much time in my life. I am not going to waste it trying to convince women to do the right thing. And so having this, this concept of the perfect mental state, it's like, look, they're not going to listen. They're, they aren't, they really aren't. And you could be the most well-intended person. Like, look, you really ought to do this. And it goes back to, look, you're going to fuck this guy. You know, you could say, don't fuck this guy, but that ruins the, she wants to fuck the guy. You're going to keep sleeping with him. He's never going to commit. You're going to end up hurt. And everything I just said, while I do appreciate saying it and I'm playing Madden, like I don't even like, and, but you're going to go fuck him in a probably 48 hours. All you heard, all she heard was you're going to go fuck him. And then she filled in the rest and then he's going to finally commit to me. Yeah. That's, and, and you can make Oprah made billions off of it. Sure. She made billions off of that. Like, oh yeah, you could be a pain in the ass woman and even be married to whoever was hot back in the eighties. I don't know. Uh, yeah. Mel Gibson. But yeah, that's, that is kind of where, and I'm, it's not that I don't want to help women. If you come to my consulting thing and you, you know, I'm like, okay, here's, you got to do this and you got to do that. But once I'm paid, I don't care if you follow my advice anymore. It is really interesting how I, I don't mind women recognizing that they get certain advantages for being hot. I don't mind that. What I have a problem with is when they don't realize that's why they're getting those advantages. I remember when I used to work at the strip club, this one girl came to me and was like, Hey, John has a boat and all of the girls, we all go on the boat on the weekends. You should come out with us. And I was like, John doesn't want me to come on his fucking boat. Are you done? Like, do you really? It was like, no, no, no. He's so nice. I'm like, of course he's nice to you. He's trying to fuck you. Like, do you really not? What they don't do? My favorite was, so my girlfriend was a bartender. And so we were, when we first met, she didn't, she lived in Houston. I lived in Vegas and she would call me from her work while she's bartending, put the phone on FaceTime and just sit there or her whole shift and just FaceTime with me while it was doing stuff. And we would get into debates about stuff. And she'd be like, well, all the guys at the bar agree with me, Michael, all the guys. Oh, let me get the hot 21 year old with big fake boobs and blue eyes is sitting there having a debate with her boyfriend. And all the guys at the bar agree with you, babe. It must be because you know what the Nobel prize it's yours. Clearly you figured out something. And it's like crazy when she does this whole thing. And I, and I tried to explain her cause my girlfriend's smart. I tried to explain to her like you're smart, but a lot of people agreed with the shit. The other day she goes, I went to fit club LV and everyone was so nice to me. Get the fuck out of here. Everyone was nice to you. All these dudes with hyper levels of testosterone were nice to you. Stop it. I can't believe this, babe. That's crazy. They were nice. You should come with me. Everyone there's nice. They're not gonna be nice to me. They're not going to be nice to me anyway. So, uh, the funny thing is like from her standpoint, she's smart, but the problem is I think she's still at this point hasn't come to the realization how many times she wasn't told no because of how physically attractive she was. And she, she like kind of grasp it, but she doesn't understand. It was like, even when she was right, she wasn't being told she was right. Cause she was right. She was being told she was right because she was hot and she still doesn't grasp this. And so that goes back to what you were saying before. Well, have we convinced one woman in America that we don't give a shit about your degree? You haven't, you haven't convinced. There's not one woman that's been convinced because he has, what do you, what is, what's your, um, you know, why should a guy date you? Well, I have a master's degree. It's like, oh my God, they, the perfect mental state. They want you to like them for their master's degree. Yes. And you could tell them no, it's cause he got a nice landing strip that you sent me one time. And I want to plow that. No, it's cause they have whatever the degree, their office. And, and you have fun trying to change that. I'm done banging my head against the table and I'm going to go have a cigar instead. She she'll go to like some store, like some weed, but they gave me free weed. Shut the fuck up. They gave you free weed, Connie. I can't believe it. It's a miracle. We go to, he goes, yeah, we went to this bar. They're so nice to me that they gave you a free drinks. No way. They gave you free drinks. I can't believe it. I tell you at the strip club, the gal who's giving me a lap. Dad said, she really liked me. Oh, that's what happened. There must've been, it must've been no ulterior. \", \"segments\": [{\"id\": 0, \"seek\": 0, \"start\": 0.0, \"end\": 4.159999847412109, \"text\": \" I have found women are just impervious to constructive criticism unless they're in a\", \"tokens\": [50364, 286, 362, 1352, 2266, 366, 445, 10100, 1502, 281, 30223, 15835, 5969, 436, 434, 294, 257, 50572], \"temperature\": 0.0, \"avg_logprob\": -0.24224914610385895, \"compression_ratio\": 1.6850649118423462, \"no_speech_prob\": 0.001284196274355054}, {\"id\": 1, \"seek\": 0, \"start\": 4.159999847412109, \"end\": 8.960000038146973, \"text\": \" true state of crisis.
