You want to check that's not violent if she sucks with money, you know, you want a woman That's great with money, you know sort of thing. Yeah, it's really interesting. Have you read the millionaire next door? Terrible the most common Car owned by millionaires was actually like a Ford f-150 most millionaires had never bought a suit more than $500 But one of the things they talked about that was very common amongst millionaires is they were on their first marriage and their wife was actually More stingy with money than they were it was very common common practice that happened You wanna hear something funny about the Ford what Ford f-150 there was a there's a survey done once on What kind of cars women like the most, you know for guys to drive and it was a black Ford f-150 That's funny was top. It was not Larry's. It wasn't it wasn't a BMW wasn't a Benz It was a black Ford f-150. I think fear Ford had done such a great job, especially I grew up in North, Texas in in Aligning their car with masculine behavior if that makes any sense, right? I feel like absolutely about being a car that a workman would do or somebody who could solve a problem would have a Ford-f-150 with a gun rack in the back, you know, I'm saying and maybe a winch or something to that effect The controversial statement. I don't know if you saw so Rolo and I we do a show every other Friday called access Vegas And so every week we've asked the girls the question about whether or not they believe in one of the statements that you have one of my favorite quotes from you is Women don't care about your struggles. They wait at the finish line and they fuck the winners Can you talk about where you came up with that idea? And I'd love for your reaction because I've we've had seven girls on before just come with the reaction Almost all of them agreed with that actually it was really interesting. Where did you come up with that quote? Yeah, I mean like women don't have a lot of patience for guys struggles Then you always hear the arguments Well, you know I've been with my husband for 10 15 years and he had this struggle and that struggle and I never left him and I stuck With him. I'm like, okay great, right? But what do you look like? What does he look like? You know, did you have options? You know, did he fix a problem like there's a lot of Outside factors that can contribute that that may that may make that variable non-existent but on a balance of probabilities again You know women just don't have time for guys that aren't doing something with their life, right? You know, my boss was mean to me today Like I remember talking to this like I used to talk to women often, you know on dates about why their husband would You know like why they would split up with their husband because when I got out of my divorce I mean I did what every other dork does and starts dating, you know women their own age Which are mostly divorce and a lot of the stories I heard was well, you know He just you know, he couldn't keep a job down or he couldn't provide or he wasn't You know, this guy was we grew apart all the time. We yeah, we grew apart is my favorite one It's like no he lost his job, but we grew apart. Yeah. Yeah, there's yeah, there's lots of those stories But I mean the truth of matter is that all boils down to that simple phase, you know Women don't care about your struggles. They do hang out at the finish line of the pick the winner I mean, that's what they want pick them fuck them. Whatever you want to call it That's generally what their modus operandi is let's go for the guy that has what I want So what I think is really interesting So I used to work in well, I still I still work in the financial community mostly in stock options So we deal with normal distributions and when you say a lot of the stuff, you know Especially with the 20 with the 20 red flags There probably are some single mothers that you could be with you talk about this before but in the normal distribution the middle 68.27% what you're saying is correct as far as what you're saying about women don't care about your struggles. That's not 68.27% That's ninety nine point nine percent. I have found very because I this is the example I used. Let's go to Walmart Let's look at the guys stocking the shelves at Walmart He's struggling way fucking more than me and none of you care And when we had some girls in there and they were like, well, I would care about my partner struggles And I'm like, yes, but he's your partner That means he had to have at least enough attractiveness and enough you build enough comfort hat you had enough value He had enough value in your eyes for him to become your partner in order for that to happen You did not go through all the work. He did to get his master's degree Start a set first business go through bankruptcy second business go through the divorce, you know so whatever horrible injury had whatever thing that happened like that you didn't care about that you were dating a finished product and it's funny because We had all these girls come on and we enroll and I were kind of expecting them to disagree and haunt none of them did Man, none of them did it was really interesting. Not very many women will disagree with that I mean, they might look they might try to try to preserve like an image about themselves because they don't want to seem to be That way but you know when you peel back the layers and women become honest almost all women will agree with that statement It's a very difficult one to fight. Yeah men compete women choose. I also like this one as well I mean, it's really interesting like what we got into a discussion and the reason why I talk about evolutionary psychology so much is because I like an evidence-based explanation of why men and women are different. It doesn't mean that we're not equal I mean under the eyes of law, we're equal, but Actually, we'll get into the idea about family law But when we talk about this this concept of us being different for some people they have a serious problem with it with evolutionary psychology One of the things that I also found with dr Buss and Gadsad and Steven Pinker or whoever is the reason why I feel is the most testable model of psychology and it doesn't really Blow up is because people on the right don't like the concept of evolution people on the left don't like the concept of gender roles And so we end up in this like middle ground where it's almost like Galileo telling the Pope that the the earth goes around the Sun so they put him on house arrest. It feels a little bit like that This is and it's almost like a red pill truth that a lot of people even conservative people don't want to hear \", \"segments\": [{\"id\": 0, \"seek\": 0, \"start\": 0.0, \"end\": 5.119999885559082, \"text\": \" She's a violent person.
