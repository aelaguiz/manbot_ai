Rolo Tomasi welcome guys to access Vegas Rolo how you doing good good good straight off of the the MOA's talk today and let me tell you something man you sprung that on me because I walked in there you're like oh yeah it's just a meetup it's like 20 guys I walk in there's like a hundred dude I was surprised to do I live next door and so today was the first summit for my program in of action and I didn't expect like a hundred dudes to show up that was pretty amazing and thanks for coming out by the way everybody who did that was that was amazing yeah yeah that was pretty cool good talk yeah I feel like this is an extension of it what was your impression of the first episode we did I thought it was very good it was a good start it like anything else I think a podcast a show it goes through an evolution right it goes through a maturation process let's say before you sort of start hitting on things but we I mean last last show we had Jimmy Villamore we had Isabella we had Amber Amber Lee and Brie and Brie and we had CJ Sparks yeah was on here with us so you know the the idea behind this show is we want to sort of at least elevate like sort of the conversation that we you know Manosphere red pill whatever intersexual dynamics conversation that's going on right now and the I guess the mission charter for this show would be like we want to actually have a dedicated show where we can have these conversations and it's not just it's not just this you know back and forth and the red meat all the time it's actually something that's that people can get value out of awesome Jamie can you describe to people what you do what do you do well I'm a licensed marriage family therapist so I have my own private practice and I work with I work with clients I work with couples I work with a lot of women I specialize in you know narcissistic abuse recovery but I do it all anxiety depression personality disorders you name it I do it so yeah beautiful Steph can you describe what you do what do you do gosh guys I have to follow this I've been modeling since I was 16 and then I've waitressed it at all the clubs in Vegas I've worked for a top-ranked boxing for seven years and just kind of all over the place but mainly modeling acting beautiful boxing Tiana what a good question we hate this question like on days like so what do you do you hate this question do you realize what it's like for me what do you say I have I still haven't figured it out oh yeah I have a podcast and I work at a fund and someone asked me yesterday so what's new what are you up to like okay well yes probably along the same lines as Steph been modeling for 10 plus years professionally I'm trying to transition into from modeling to more personality TV film work so that's kind of where I'm at now I hate to say all of my experiences we hate to say model wise I don't I don't why do you hate to say what do you feel like it's a cringe term um yeah the perception of it has like changed over the past couple years and now everybody's a model everyone is yeah so I don't really like I'm just in there I'm at the point where I'm so I'm still trying to figure out what I actually fully want to like pursue that's okay does there's no age limit on what like you have to decide what what you are you know but still figuring it out but the goal is just to make money and live Caesar in the live chat yes this is truly live we actually yes we are live for real yeah that's absolutely fantastic so there's some of the things that we wanted to talk about um I was just cuz I was curious to sort of dig into Tiana's pageant history here because as a lot of people already know some people know this about me but my daughter was a pageant girl right and so I'm very familiar with the pageant system I think it's interesting like what you were saying here before is like to say that you are a model is it's almost like yeah it's like standard and so I think that that there is a and particularly for women I think there is a not so much a stigma but like this this expectation I think that that's what you're going to be doing or that's especially on in the Instagram age right now so it's no longer Instagram is not unless you look at my my Instagram but it's no longer for like cute dog pictures and stuff it's like it's a it's a as my good friend Jason Hartman has described it Instagram has become a funnel marketing system for women and so it's you're curating your look and you're curating your brand your personal brand that's on there all the time and I know that that kind of dovetails into the whole pageant thing because I think that too many people think that the pageant systems like when when I think of pageants or when people you know say oh it's Miss America right it's always some some ditzy girl on there trying to answer some question about like you know should we have what's the capital of Nevada yes exactly and what's the capital of Nevada I remember when it happened I remember when like I love Neosages but I remember what it happened she didn't know the capital of Nevada her first runner-up so I I think that I mean statistically speaking and just like the things that you know trending things that happen right now more women are getting into college the college enrollment for women is I've last I checked with like 60 or 65 percent women the and by the way the graduation where it was a graduation graduate you got to remember enrollment is not yes yeah enrollment is not graduation so I had to really kind of like make a distinction between those two but I know that you are very well educated so is that something that's like sort of a disadvantage to you do you think do you think that an education is a disadvantage for women on the in the sexual marketplace right now no not at all no not at all I think it gives you leverage and it decreases your dependency so it actually increases your ability to pick so I mean as far as your selection is concerned but like as far as I'm guys or like what cuz one of the most I hear maybe this is a really good question for all of you here one of the most common questions that I'm given by by women particularly amongst your demographic is I'm 33 years old I'm 40 years old I'm whatever years old and I can't find a man where do I find a good dude I you know I did everything I was supposed to do I went to college I got a career I'm I'm in modeling I'm making money right now and I can't find a guy who is my equal and the equal being like he's got to be as educated he's got to make the more more well statistically more money than I do and are you finding that that's like that's why I say is it a limitation like education I think they I think they measure it wrong I think a lot of women measure wrong and a lot of men measure it wrong because you're it's not about equality actually and I know that that might sound unpopular but it's really not what you really want to check for is balance because look if I have it if I have a situation like this right if I have a woman that makes let's say she's a bread woman she makes 80 grand okay and then I got a dude and they're in a relationship and he makes 30 and they want to go 50-50 on the bills like that's not gonna be equal it won't be equal that that 50-50 split that's gonna be coming more out of his pocket that's gonna hit him harder that's not equal what you want to look for is balance and look there's different ways to add value to a relationship that work within that relationship and that's really what you kind of want to look for it's not a 50-50 split mm-hmm yeah would you guys I would agree with that I would align with that and I think I was talking about that yesterday with you Michael I forgot what we were specifically talking about but she's so much more eloquent and how she she explains it you're so sweet no you are like it you know cuz we can we only know the experience you have like the words to put to the experience it's definitely I think more of like for me it's made it easier to date when I understand that's you know the role yeah well the value value yeah the value of you know each individual and what they bring to the table and every situation is different so yeah I agree with that because I'm one of the I guess the popular schools of thought here is that when women get into this sort of career path and I would just had this conversation well it's conversation but I had this sort of back and forth with Jedediah Bila recently and she used to be on The View so she's now at Valuetainment but we we have a let's say we have a correspondence right now and one of the things she was talking about is that you know we kind of devalue motherhood and we kind of devalue we have been really I would argue since really the sexual revolution since right 1965 ish around there but it's sort of you know coming to a head right now and so it's almost like to be a mother to be a wife to follow that path rather than the path that I think all of you have already followed here is in some way less desirable less attractive a life path for women and I don't know if any of you have children I don't think any of you have children well I mean so that counts so there's this so there's this I don't say stigma but there's this this expectation I think of you know if you are a mother if you are following that path and you in some way have like not lived up to your potential and so what Jedediah was saying is like we shouldn't we shouldn't demonize you know women for choosing that path but yet here she is at 40 some odd years old and she's actually the product of that path she you know graduated from Ivy League schools she was in broadcast communication for a while she was on The View for a while got married at I believe 39 years old and had her first child at 40 and it's like well you have done both of those so I'm not saying that I'm not trying to say you're a hypocrite maybe it's just like where you're at right now in your life but I think it's interesting that we want to we want to have a conversation between sort of this is we're demonizing this but why are we also glorifying the other you know it's so interesting with that in pageants the USA system the Miss Universe's organization just opened up their rules to allowing married women pregnant women having been married before so divorced women and we're getting some pushback some are you know thank you like you know I'm 26 and I decided to get married I get to live my dream and still you know progress in my career where it would have ended just because they got married and they made that decision and chose that pattern age too and I don't think that that was but to being a mother and being married and you know that we have pushback and then there's some you know the other half is like glorifying it so it's kind of the same thing and this is all from women also doing this because I also have my own thoughts about it but I can't what you can't hear number one number two new horizon my boy the guy who's running your your your hair yeah let him talk shit we don't care yeah yeah please let him go yeah don't censor him number number three wanted blue pill and plug there's the quote here ready like a woman making 80k would even look at a guy making 30k for anything other than bedroom fun if he was good-looking that was a mouthful so they're saying so what this person is saying is is that a woman wouldn't yeah wouldn't do that unless he was like like just like a woman making 80k would even look at a guy making 30k for anything other than bedroom fun if he was good-looking no no that happens all the time I'm I see it all the time now I understand that that's not going to be widely accepted but that actually happens all the time see somebody's gonna look at that and you're that's a very superficial way to view something it's a very superficial way to view a man or a woman to say like oh I'm only interested in you for like your money yeah that's fucking bullshit I'm sorry because you're beautiful it's look like is there that yeah Absolutely, but that is actually the minority, not the majority. So both so I both things are true, right? There's a normal distribution. There's a lot of women who want tall. I'm not saying that it doesn't happen. Of course. I mean, we live in we live in a city like you guys know girls that are just totally transactional, like 100 percent. Like I am dating a man because he's rich. Let's like not like that doesn't happen sugar, baby, obviously. But by the way, I am actually doing an interview about I don't know if you guys saw Kelsey Turner. She murdered her sugar daddy and the also the Courtney Taylor thing where Courtney Taylor murdered her boyfriend, the OnlyFans model. Yeah, I'm doing I'm doing interviews on both of those subjects. And you know, the thing is, like one of the problems is it's black pill, right? That's the one where it's just LMS doom pill. Yeah, like nihilism. OK. So the so the reality of the situation is in the best explanation of this is Dr. David Buss's book with Cindy Massing called Why Women Have Sex. There's 237 reasons why women have sex. I've absolutely met women who are sapiosexuals. They are not the majority. They are not the majority. Let me say this one more time. They are not the majority of women are not attracted to me just because I'm smart. They like the fact that I might be smart, but that's not the main reason. There are a lot of women that prefer good looking men versus not good looking men, tall men versus short men, but not all of them. And there are some women who are specifically like I have a friend of mine. She specifically looks for men that are not attractive because she doesn't want to compete with other women for them. What I'm saying is it is a normal distribution. If you don't remember what that is, go back to your statistics class and you'll see inside of one standard deviation you are going to find a lot of women think Chris Hemsworth is attractive, but occasionally you're going to find women that find other things attractive. That's why Blackpill is not in and of itself correct. It can be correct for one standard deviation, but it's not correct for everyone. Well, you know, Blackpill is just sort of like the the dregs of the MGTOW movement really is is what it is. It's like that most extreme and that bottom end of MGTOW. And really, it's guys who are commiserating about their their situation. So nothing is nothing I can bring on. I mean, we have some very intelligent, very beautiful women on this show. Right now, people kept saying, oh, you guys need to get, you know, I thought we weren't going to have like, you know, ratchet girls on here. And like and I'm like, OK, well, well, we want to like they were saying we need to bring we we need to bring girls from like Tulsa, Oklahoma. We need somebody from the Midwest. We need just average, you know, I'm like, well, first of all, that first of all, that this is access Vegas, first of all. Steph, where are you from originally? Rockford, Illinois. Yeah. And then where are you from? You're from Reno. No, I'm from Cali. From Cali. Yeah. You're from originally. I was born in Kansas, Kansas. Look at that. We ticked all those boxes, guys. And I'm black. Look at that. You are black. So, I mean, you can get I love it when the when guys tell me like, oh, well, I want a girl I can carry on a conversation with. I want and then, OK, I deliver that for you. And it's like, well, they're they have big fake tits. But here's you know, what do you want? And that's what we're talking about. The the patent system, again, I think it's it goes back to this expectation that girls who go into the patent system are just all it is is about. It's a beauty contest. It's superficial, right? It's all it's nothing but physicality, maybe a little bit of, you know, being able to answer some, you know, ditzy question. And that's what makes the six o'clock news. But there's so much more to it than just that. You have to have a platform. You have to have like sort of social issues, got to be educated. It helps if you survive cancer or something like that as well along the way. I mean, there's I saved a dog. Yeah. I mean, and again, yes, I mean, you we've had a prior to the show. We had the conversation about how, you know, we and I'll I'll say it if you want, most patent systems are scams. So but the but they still revolve around, but they still revolve around the idea that we want to make little girls confident and we want to sort of lift them. That's the message I have taken away from years and years of pageants is that the over overarching message is what we want them to feel good about themselves and build up their self-esteem. And we want them to feel like they can do anything they want to do. And it doesn't matter whether they, you know, placed or if they didn't place at all. It's just that it's the experience of it. It makes them feel better about themselves. That's what we tell them if they don't win. Yeah, of course. So for me, I do pageant consulting. So slash coaching. And when I'm building the bios for some of these, for some of my clients, it's it is definitely more than just the superficial reasonings of why you would make a good candidate or like why you would impress the judges. So then it becomes like, how are you answering them? Because how are you rearranging the words? Are you like, is it landing correctly where the energy feels right? So it kind of can be applied to dating or whatever else, you know, outside of the pageant realm if you're trying to impress someone. So it's really just about how you make a judge feel. I that's what at least that's what I tell my clients, like make them feel something when you're talking to them. Yeah. So they remember you out of all the rest of the girls that they're meeting. I think another thing is sort of this undiscovered secret to the pageant system is if you get into the competitive side of the pageant system, it is cutthroat. It is like eye of the tiger. I mean, you have to have a coach. And it's like like if you're really going to compete, you you're going to follow all of the people that you know are going to be your competitors in the next in the next time. The best ones, it's kind of, it's kind of crazy. The best ones up there, when you see them walking on stage, they rehearse and choreograph when they're going to smile, when they're going to drop their smile, when they flip their hair. Yeah. When did they look at which judge and which I, all of it. So it's very calculated, very calculated. I don't think people really pick up on that. I wonder if you go through life the same way. Like, I guess with any of your clients, patients, what are you? People being calculated? Well, like how you can kind of, I guess, encourage them to step up their game when it comes to, you know, interacting with. Um, you know, I just. Yeah, a little bit, right, because there's like coaching involved with with what I do, absolutely. So you're kind of like looking at things like what works, what doesn't work. And then you want to make like shifts. What I do is a bit more. It's more of like mine and, you know, change. I mean, changing thought patterns and, you know, behaviors and there's yeah, there's there's, you know, more. Yeah, yeah, there's more. There's that there's that aspect of it. You had that aspect in it. Yeah. Well, you know, you you look at things objectively, right? And you can you know, I you know, I can feel a person's energy when they walk in the room. So I'm sure that you can as well. So that that resonates with me when you said that, you know, you can kind of get a sense for what somebody's issues are already. I remember how to. Oh, shit. What are our issues? I remember I had a client just just through the email. I was like, I'm not going to fucking take them. Like, I'm not going to take them immediately. No, really. I was like, I'm not going to I'm not going to take this person. And they popped on the call and I was like, I'm not taking you. I ended up taking them because I love a challenge. But, you know, it ended up being very productive. But, you know, but one of the things that I said to them, like immediately, I was like, you had a bad attitude. And I was like, you're not that much fun to be around, are you? You know, and I just I just went right in because, you know, I don't have to take you. I don't have to work with you. Are you going at me like that? I thought you couldn't talk shit about. I'm just kidding. But yes, I going back to what you were saying as you do, you do pick up on energy energies and, you know, I do observe things that don't work. I always, you know, there's, you know, take it to that psychological perspective as well, you know, and incorporate that. It's a big part of what I do. Here we go, guys. Hold on, Mr. Love at 82. Needing men to make over 30 K matches well with vain Vegas beauty. God, we're still fake hair, fake boobs, fakes, personality matches. Needing a man to make over 30 K. Rollo, right. Rollo's right. That mentality makes sense in Vegas, making over 30 K. Again, it's not low weight. We just we just said, where are you all from? Yeah, but but also like what's wrong with that? Like, why are you putting a judgment on that? Like, really? Like, why is that a bad thing? Well, because when you can't compete, you you you hate, right? You try. Exactly. And that's the that's the point I think that's important to me because I hate the person that there is not there's no shame in making over 30 K and there's no shame in making 30 K or below. Do you guys know what the average income is for the American? Just the average American? Is it like 40? I don't even know. I believe it's 46 or 46 or 47. Look at me with the stats. For couples, it was like for couples. It's like 56,000. We I mean, I've done this before on Freshman Fit. I do it on my own show. We have that you sort of the female delusion calculator. I we had CJ Sparks. We had CJ Sparks in here talking about how she needed a man. And if you didn't make five million dollars, don't even like don't even give me the call kind of thing. And well, I wish I would have brought this up then. But like when you bring up whenever I hear women say, oh, that's superficial. That's that's even guys right here. The guys in the chat are saying, well, it's superficial. It's fake. It's a it's not for real. What is real? What is like who look? I will tell you what's genuine. I will tell you how to view it. I will tell you how to view it when somebody is really fucking interested in you. It really doesn't matter. Okay, it only matters. So if you were at if you were at so the the guy who's making your sandwich at Subway, he as long as he's interesting, you're good with what we like. Let me let me add this as well. Okay, because I have to add a caveat to this. Now, I'm going to say attraction. I'm going to use that word and that word specifically an attraction is not connected to how somebody physically looks. Okay. Now, it's a big part of it. I'm not going to say that that's not important. Everybody wants to date a hot guy hot girl. You want to be sexually attracted to your partner. Nothing wrong with that. Go ahead. However, that's not the only thing that matters. Now, let's say you typically date somebody that's, you know, that is works outfit like whatever, right? And then you meet somebody and let's say they have more of like a dad, but but you're attracted to them. You're sexually attracted to them, but it's it's out of what you would typically, you know, date or or or or sleep with it that matters and you're you're likely to veer or make the exception because the attractions there this does happen. However, okay, when you when you tend to see people only going for like, I'm only going to date somebody that has this. I'm only going to date somebody that has this that is because there's a lack of interest. That's because you're not really that into that person when you're really into somebody. It's not that all those things go out the window and that you want somebody to be careless or you want you want somebody that doesn't manage their money. Well, but you're more likely to make those exceptions for somebody that you really really like you're more likely to work with them. So you think it's all about the emotional investment. No, I don't think it's all of it. Well, I think it's about a connection and that can be that can be a lot of things. Connection is instant. It is something otherworldly. I think it's something that that's that's spiritual. And I think that we're going there already. I well look this is this are we doing that now? We don't have to are you making you guys uncomfortable? Keep going. I like to do that. Keep it up. My question is this like and like like men like you're getting way off track. Maybe back in men and women will do exactly the same thing. They'll say like, well, that's superficial. Like, oh, they're fakes and so therefore I wouldn't want to have anything. It's like sour grapes, right? It's like I wouldn't want to have anything to do with them. I have more respect for myself than to approach a woman like a girl like that or she only does that because she's damaged or she has daddy issues or there's something else that's wrong with her. So it's very easy to sort of nitpick and find things, you know, that that prevent you from that. But my my question to to to women as well as as men. It's like when we talk about like superficiality, what is superficial? What is authentic and what is superficial? And really it's sort of like on a but I think it's personal. Yeah, what makes you authentic? You know, go ahead. No, you go ahead. Okay, so I think it's completely different for each gender. Yeah, I am. I am the same again. We are equal but we are different neurologically and biologically. We are different for that simple fact to start with. I have 17 times as much testosterone as you do that for starting from that. We already know. Right. Is that a 500 or something? Rush on mail. Available on Amazon. Test, test, test, test. My test is at 500. Not me specifically, but if my test is at 500, I'd be in deep shit. All right. So here's the thing. I do. No, what I'm saying before, though, is we are we are different. So what we find to be superficial is going to be different. Men are going to look at looks more and sooner than women are. Some women, you've met women before that are just into looks. I know some girls are basically six, five tattoos, fucking tattoo sleeve and six pack abs. They'll go home with any any dude I've seen and I know some girls that are not like that at all. They actually are interested in in a connection. What one thing that really does bother me, though, is the dad bod myth. I believe that women are attracted to men because they have athletic physiques. If there's a dad bod, the dad bod builds comfort. It does not build attraction. I do not believe the dad bod bills. I do not and I will we can argue about this all you want. I do not believe women are attracted to a dad bod. What I do, what I think is women see an attractive man with a dad bod and they're like, this is a guy who will stay at home and help me with the kids. That's what he looks like. He looks like a dude who will take out the trash looks are congruent. And here's the reason. Let's not this. I'm not. Let's bring science into this. What happens when a when tell me when your when your wife was pregnant. Tell me this happened to you. What happens to men when women get pregnant? Does anybody know from a scientific standpoint? They get fat. They get fat. Well, why they start their body. So doesn't their estrogen like increase? Correct. Their estrogen levels go up and their prolactin levels go up. Men start put. I don't know why I'm pulling out these. Men start putting men start putting on more body fat because the evolutionary explanations of theory is that they there's going to be a lot of sleepless nights with the new baby, right? And so they have to put on more calories, more body fat women who again, there's a different we've talked about this for men need attraction to have sex. Women need attraction and comfort to have sex when men do not need comfort. When a woman sees a man who has a dad bod, she is recognizing especially when it's when it's like the dad bod is like a movie star because he already has the attraction. He's famous. Can I clarify something about just just briefly here? Because I think they're and I put this this is in I believe it's in my second book. There's a difference between arousal and attraction. Okay. So when we say what are you attracted to? Well, see that's what I was saying earlier. I asked if I like they constantly do this and I know and I God bless you. I love you fresh. But the first question out of the on freshman fit is always what do you look for in a guy? Women will always say what they're attracted to in the long term for for that guy. They don't go. Yeah, he's got to have, you know, 26 inch guns. He's got to have a nice ass. He's got to have a V taper. He's got to have a six-pack abs. He's got to look like, you know, a Chippendales. Well, they're not going to say that it's all. He's gotta be nice, he's gotta like puppy dogs, he's gotta love his mom, he's gotta want kids, he's gotta like Disneyland, he's gotta, you know, all that other crap. Anything that's sort of this, that promotes the idea of long-term security is usually what I have defined as attraction, whereas then there's arousal. So what about a guy gets your blood flowing? That's a different question than what is attractive in a guy. We love a good, big deck. Confidence. There it is. Hold on, Ms. Nabata, what the fuck? Hold on, Ms. Nabata. Hold on, Ms. Nabata. Wait a minute. Hold on, Ms. Nabata. Wait, what? Mark that. What? Mom, if you're watching, please, I mean, just turn it off right now. I just think like confidence and romance, I mean, like it's sort of like to go on dates and feel special. I mean, for me, it starts with conversation. I think there's more than just the physical arousal, but I think it starts at the physical. It does. It does. It starts at the physical. Look, like, but it's the same with guys as well. You don't know if a person's going to create security or, you know, have good conversation or give you that. Have a good date. Right. You don't know. You're not going to know right away. But the first thing that you are going to see is, hey, I'm attracted to this person. I would possibly sleep with them. You're going to see that. I think there's a stat that says, you know, women know if they're going to sleep with somebody within the first three seconds of meeting them. So, you know. I have an addendum to that. I think it's too many. Do you? I don't think it's. I think if she knows that she's not, well, he's going to say it. Look, again. She's not going to sleep with him. Women know that within the first five minutes that they're not going to sleep with a guy. Okay. Fair enough. I'm not going to. That sounds pretty accurate to me. You know, so a physical attraction, it does play a big role, but that's, that's just, that's just the leg in the door. That's just it. Like that, that doesn't sustain any kind of relationship or any kind of permanency. You know, it's just. You don't get to that. You don't get to that relationship without having the attraction or the arousal prior to. Well. You know what? I think you ladies can get by the fact that you may not find a girl, not all women. Some women can get by the fact you don't find him perfectly physically attractive. I don't think men can. I think men have to be physically, sexually. Women can either. Now I think, look, I know I don't, I do not think that they can. What I see women do all the time is they make an exception for security. The guy's got money. Okay. They make an exception for this, but they're not. But she's not attracted. They're not satisfied. She's tolerating it. She's tolerating. Yes. I feel like I hear that all the time, actually. Yes. I agree. Excuse me. I grew up around a huge Mormon community and I feel like I've seen it. You can just sense it that, you know, we're marrying just to get married because that's the religion. That's what we're supposed to do. But I know for a fact he doesn't, you know, that's not who he would choose if he could have his own individual choice. So I'm just starting to be a little visceral here. If this is the point of physical attraction to where your penis gets hard, at least she's above that. It's a boner test. That's the boner test. Yeah. That's what I'm saying. The boner test? Yes. I feel like it doesn't take much for guys though, right? I was going to say, all you have to do is think of the next door neighbor. I'm not, I'm not disagreeing. All you have to do is think of the next door neighbor. I'm not disagreeing. By the way, we didn't come up with that term. That's an old school term. Can we, can we also say like for the three of you, you guys are outside of two standard deviations of like physical attractiveness for the average American woman. So that, that it's also a little different. Like you could be. Fuck you guys. Tiana, you could be significantly less attractive and still pass the boner test is what I'm saying. Oh, thank you. That is so kind. I mean, it's, it's obvious. I mean like, yes. She's going to put that in her bio now. She's got a one in 10 on the 7.5, pass the boner test. But you do not, but you don't get in the door. Like again, like when you're asking women, what are you looking for in a guy? It's always longterm security. So really that's, and we brought this up a million times. That's what hypergamy really is, right? I'm sick to death of people saying, it's just about like, oh, you got to have money and you got to have security and you got to protect her and provide and be parentally invested. No, there's another side to hypergamy. It's called the alpha fuck side. He's got to look hot. He's got to be the hot guy in the foam cannon party. He's got to be the guy that you want to have sex with that gets your blood pumping. Otherwise, the other side of this is kind of meaningless and it becomes more of a transactional nature as opposed to a validational nature with a guy who is hot enough that you want to, that you want to be with. I think that's so important, but I think that a lot of women don't actually follow that path. It's a need that goes neglected and unmet a lot of the time for women because women will make exceptions more than men will when it comes to physical attraction because what they're looking because again, her love need of safety. Well, maybe, maybe, I think, I think, I think for the men we encounter here, you're correct. I think for the 28% of men that have had zero sexual partners in the last year, they will make some serious fucking exceptions for physical attractiveness. Otherwise, trailer parks wouldn't exist. Women have a higher standard for male, physical standard for male beauty than men have for women right now. If you don't believe me, just go look at all the niches of porn on Pornhub right now. So let's talk about this. Women need a more attractive man. Women have a more static, permanent standard for men. I haven't really, I didn't discuss this with you guys before. This is kind of what I was trying to get to with the Las Vegas dating thing. So 63% of men on Tinder, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, 10% of men on Tinder are getting 63% of the right swipes. 10% of men on Tinder, the 10% best looking men on Tinder are getting 63% of the right swipes. The top 20% of men on Tinder are getting something like 85% of the right swipes. Women are saying on Tinder, they find 80% of the men on Tinder to be unattractive below a five. They're saying that they find them to be. Now here's the thing for women, it's like the top 10% of, uh, I can't, it's like the top four and a half, four and a half, 43% of women are getting 63% of the right swipe. So it was like, wait, men's standard for what a woman is attractive, meaning pass the boner test. There's a lot more women that fit in that category for women, physical attractiveness for men. It's very narrow. Now here's, let's go back to the dad. That's Tinder. Clearly on there. Okay. Cupid. It's all the same. I'm not going on there to like find out this guy's personality. You're going to, you're seeing their face first choice. I'm with you. I'm with you. But my point is, my point is there's still saying 80% of the men on there are unattractive, right? That's all the good looking guys are getting all the swipes. Yeah. I mean, but there's few good looking guys is the point I'm trying to say. Whereas with women, that same number is 40% of women. You see what I'm saying? I can use, I can use, well, actually it's a Dr. David bus as a matter of fact. Um, and uh, I'm trying, I want to say it's Rob Henderson or maybe with Steve Stewart Williams. Both were saying like, cause they're drawn from the same research as that when it comes to online dating, which is the way we do dating right now, by the way, it's the number one way that men and women right now, it's the most successful way of dating right now. I want to do speed dating. How about that? Yeah. Well, yeah. Good luck. You get what you get and you don't throw a fit. But so, I mean, if there's no arguing that online dating, whether it's Tindle, Tinder, Hinge, Bumble, whatever it is, even seeking arrangements, um, they, the, the idea is this is that 80% of guys on those on online platforms are, are classified as unattractive. These are the guys that are never going to, they're the, they're the invisibles. I call them the 80 percenters, right? When people give me this, this bullshit about like, oh, here's the 80 20 rule in, uh, in my, in the manosphere in, in, in ripple, it's not, it's not about 80% of guy or 20% of guys banging 80% of women like get this straight, please. It's 100% of women want the top 20% of guys. And so what happens is those 80% of guys are sort of the undesirables or the invisibles that 20% of guys are not necessarily attractive. They're just not unattractive. So they might do of that 20% only four and a half percent of them are hot enough, interesting enough, good looking enough for them to initiate some sort of contact with that guy, four and a half percent. So when we, when we talk about the, uh, the 80 20 rule, I really, I really trying to stress for accuracy on these days, but when it comes to physical arousal, as I was saying before, it's that, I mean, those are the, that's the, the, the, the, not the statistical break right there. So for a guy to be hot for a Justin Waller or whatever, you know, I got a, a, a, a, you know, a Mike Sartain for that matter, it's to get that right. So I have to actually be interested enough to initiate contact. He's got to be within the top 4% of the, at least the available guys that are in, that are on Tinder at that, at that time. The other 20%, those are the guys who kind of have to like figure it out. Like they got it. They got to get themselves in shape. They got to have some more value added to put them into a, to become accepted. So let's just ask some questions just so you guys understand what the, the number of men that you think that have had zero sexual partners in the last year, what, what would you guys guess? The number of men who have a percentage, a percentage of men that are, well, this is a trick question. I want to say 72%. Oh, it's low. Isn't it? Oh, I want to say 70%. 70% of men have had zero sexual partners. I thought you said this year. In the, in the last year, what percentage of men in the United States have had zero sexual partners? Oh, 70%. What do you think? Everybody in the chat already knows it. I love it. I guess. What do you think, Jamie? I don't know the stats. I know it's low. I don't know the stats though. It's not a lot. No, it's about 30%. It's not a lot. It's not a lot. It's not a lot. It's not a lot. It's not a lot. It's not a lot. It's not a lot. It's about 35% of men. It's coming up on a third of men have had zero sexual partners in the last year. And here's the thing. From your experience of living here in Las Vegas, does it feel like that or does it feel like you are surrounded by dudes who have like 500 body count? Yeah. Only because it's not like, you know, they have someone on the side or they always, you know, how that go to phone call. It's really just because the outreach is there for them. So my, my, my point is. Vegas is unique. Kind of pulled a pick from. It is. While you may be correct in some instances, what I'm saying is that most men don't have that at all. It doesn't matter where they live. And the real reason is a lot of you don't notice them. A lot of you. When I say what percentage of men have had zero sexual partners in the last year, um, you didn't notice the cashier at Walmart and you didn't notice the guy who gave you your, your food at, at Raising Cane's in the drive-thru. You didn't in your mind, he doesn't even count. So that's why you were just like, well, it must be a low number. But what you're used to is the host who walked you into Zouk, right? What you're used to is the incredibly good looking dude, you know, who, who's the bartender. I don't know. I wouldn't have noticed those people if they, if I was attracted to them, I would have noticed them if I had been attracted to them physically. Now, if I'm not physically attracted to them, no, I'm not going to notice them. And it's the same for a girl. Yes. Same thing. Um, so I'm curious, what do you guys think the average height of a, an American man is? Five eight. Five eight. What do you think? Close. I'm dated. Five nine. Five nine. What do you think it is? I think it's five nine, right? It is five nine. It's interesting. Cause Jamie Billmore came on here and said sixteen. He's the number one height setting filter on dating apps right now. Six, seven. Exactly. So, so it actually, it actually drops, it actually drops off past six, six. So it goes, uh, it's really funny. So it'll, it'll be kind of, once you get above six, two, it goes up. That's a six, two, six, three is the peak. And then, uh, and then it goes down at six, four, down to six, five and down at six, six. And then it goes down the other way. When you get to six feet tall, when you get to five 11, it just plummets from six feet to five 11. Women just do not select for five 11. Now you don't have this problem in Europe where they do it in centimeters. This is just. I'm already having an issue with the percentages because I can't do it in centimeters. I don't know. This math is hard. I don't know. What percentage of men do you think are over six feet tall? Well, 10%. No, 20. 17. What do you think? I don't know the percents. I know it's low. It's 14%. It's about 14 and a half percent. What apps are allowing you to choose? Uh, height? I think they all. There's some dating apps out there. I think they all do. I've heard that you have to pay a premium to choose, like make it very specific. Oh yeah. Yeah. It's ranking. It's tournament ranking on them. Yeah. So like if you get a choice, I understand why that percentage of the hotties on there are the ones getting chosen. Um, but I don't think in person. I usually just don't want anyone shorter than me. That's it. Yeah. I would notice someone. That's generally what the most common answer is. I just don't want someone shorter than me. That's what we would say. I'm not saying it could not happen. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, how tall are you? So I'm five three. Would you consider a man who's five 11 short? Um, I wouldn't say that they're short. No, I wouldn't say that they're short. Would it be my preference? Like, well, that's a different thing. Look, I was going to say a lot of my girlfriends who are, cause I'm five seven. So a lot of my girlfriends who are like, you know, five feet to five, four, I'm like, oh my God, I have a friend for you, but he's like, you know, how tall are they? They're like five 10. No, that's too short for me. But I'm like, if you were your highest heels, you will still be short. You know, like that's kind of going like, that's, you know, this is kind of one of those things where it's like, you can, like, I've, I've always preferred dating, um, very tall men. Okay. That's always been like a thing that I've had personally, but I have dated outside of that because I have been attracted to them, just genuinely attracted to them. Tall personality. Uh huh. Yeah. You know what, you gave me, you gave me, you gave me a germ of an idea here because like, height is like one of the things that everybody fixates on right now, um, because that's usual. I mean, from an evolutionary perspective, that's universally what women select for is a guy that is taller than them, you know, bigger, stronger, whatever. But the height is always one of the, the unifying factors when it comes to attraction or arousal for that matter. Now let me ask you this. You just, you just said, Hey, I, uh, you're five foot three and you would not consider a guy who's five a little, maybe not consider, but what I'm saying is that I would actually, you would. Okay. Yeah. So, but what I've, what I tell guys is this like that way. We just said it. The average height of the American males is five, nine right now. Tom Cruise is like what, five, seven, five, nine, something like that. Just to, you know, still, you know, found a way around it, found an end run around that, that height thing. Now, is it the fact that he's taller than you or is it the fact that he is not as tall as a guy who's six foot tall? So is it, is it, is it like, Oh, I want to look up to him because he's taller than me. It makes me feel safe. Is it, is the non attraction or like the, the hesitation anyways, is it because he standing amongst other guys who are taller than him, you're going to go, damn, I could have got a guy who's six foot tall. You know, that's a really good question actually, you know, that's a good question. I haven't actually thought, I haven't actually thought of that for, for me, the way that I have always viewed it, at least for myself and the way that I would say probably most women view it is it's that safety thing. That's what it's kind of rooted in. It's that protection. It's that safety and that security. But that's a really interesting point about how they rank to other men, you know. I, look, that, that's just, that is just something that I think a lot of women are highly attracted to myself included, but this is one of those things where it's like, when you're really attracted to somebody, you'll make that exception. It's the same thing that I was saying with the $30,000 dude, like, and I have dated, like, even though that has been my preference or my history, I have also dated somebody that's, you know, five, seven, you know, and, and made that exception because there was that attraction there. Maybe I might, I might actually need to change my mind on something here because I, I tell guys, no, well, was it because of us? Oh my God. Well, okay. Now here's let, hear me out though, tooting my own horn, track with me here, track with me here. I talked to guys who are like, I've got friends and guys that I work with who are Filipino. Okay. And they don't tend to be the tallest guys, as you probably know. So they got a guy who was a Filipino and he's like five, seven and they go roll on doomed. I'm never going to fall. I'm never going to get laid. I'm never going to have a wife. I'm never going to have children. You know, because we, you know, all the, all the Filipino women want a guy who's like six foot tall. Right. And so my advice has always been look for a woman who's five, six, look for a woman who is five, four, look for the woman that you are, you know, you're a few, like you were saying before, even in heels, you're still, you know, two inches tall or whatever, but maybe that doesn't matter because it's not necessarily about the guy being taller than you. It's more about you being taller than the other dudes that are in the sort of available, you know, like in the global sexual marketplace. Well, look, I think that that can be an influence. I think that that could be a way to influence perception. I think it can be a way to influence how a woman picks, but that's a very temporary solution. As far as when, as soon as you take him out of that, out of that circle, you know, he'll be exposed. Selecting a guy based on height. Is that superficial? Yeah, it is. Well, okay. But look, it is superficial, but that doesn't mean it's bad and look like, look, yes, look, it's superficial. Whatever. I was feeling a way about myself. No, no, no, no. See, look, I get, I get people saying like this kind of shit all the time and it's like, you know what? There's nothing wrong in wanting what you want. Is it superficial? I put on makeup. Is that superficial? Yeah, whatever. It's not bad. A couple of things. I have a friend of mine. She was, uh, she was sexually assaulted and she told me afterwards, after that happened, she dates these fucking monsters for specifically for the reason she said. She said, I, because this happened to me when I was younger, she dates the like roided up monsters, like six, three to 65. She's like, that is the only kind of guy I'm attracted to someone. If someone put their hands on me, they would kill them. That's but again, that doesn't mean that's every single girl. Exactly. I know. I know. You could go date Uriah Faber. And how tall is he? I don't know. Uriah Faber. Any, any MMA fighter that's short. Yeah. And they're all little. And they'll kill you. Yeah. They're all little in our size. If anything, I'm bigger than most of the fighters. We had a guy in here talk about this. He was like, well, there's no correlation between survivability and height. Correct. But there's also no, like also men are attracted to women for hip to waist ratio and things that they see in cosmetic surgery or breast implants. It's not like we're fooling our evolutionary brains. I agree that they're really, really tough guys that are five foot eight. Women are still attracted to men who are taller on average because it's, it's a function of like your evolutionary cave woman brain that still sees the, has these signals. And the reality of the situation is most of you ladies are going to date men and 99% of the time, they're not going to have to kill anybody to protect you walking down the street. A hundred percent of the time. If you live here in Vegas, I never see fights here. And then that, and that's, that's generally that if we were back in East Dallas, we'd see fights every day. And I never see fights here in Vegas. So do you think environment and where you live? Of course. Of course. And that, so that was another thing I was saying. So going back to what we were saying before, whenever I talk to women who live in Las Vegas and I say things like, Oh, you know what, what do you guys, you know, said that around the correct, well, you said 70%. A lot of times women are like, well, uh, uh, you know, what's the average, the average North American male, how many sexual partners that they have in their entire life. And they're like, Oh, you know, like 40, 50, a hundred. And it's like, it's seven. And they're like, how the fuck is it seven? Like every Brock that I met, who's the host over at fucking Omnia in Manhattan, he's been with at least a thousand women. Not every Brock. Brock. Whatever, whatever. You know, Caden or whatever guy that you guys are talking to. It's so unique. And the thing is like, the thing is like, my point is like a lot of times you just don't notice these average men. And she's brought up an example even before I even had to say it. She was like, yeah, cause I'm not attracted to them. I don't see them cause I'm not attracted to them. And so that actually makes sense. So the problem is, and we haven't gotten to this point yet, but the problem is there's these big group of men that just like are being ignored by pretty women. Do you guys understand? Yeah. But it's the same. It's the same for women. The thing is, it's not because there's no, because if it was the same for women, then the number of women that have had zero sexual partners in the last year would not be 12% to the 30% of men are attracted to, you know, women are way more selective. Okay. And what actually makes them attractive? Okay. So there's a smaller pool for them to pick from. Whereas guys, you know, they'll get hard over anything, you know? So like they're like larger pool for them to pick from. Okay. So it's not a balanced, it's not a balanced, it's just not balanced, you know? So of course you're going to see that difference in influx. Of course it's going to influence the stats and like what that, how, how you actually measure that and how that reads, you know? But you're, we're both picking from the same place. The guy isn't going to see a girl that he's not attracted to either. The difference is, is that guys are just attracted to more women. But what would you tell the guys that are not the invisible men who are not being seen? What do you tell them? Step up your game. What do you do? It's incredible that she finally got to the point. There we go. You basically just like, you unlocked the question to like a billion dollar industry. Achievement unlocked. Yes. So what's the answer? So he'll give his answer out of your mind. So he wrote a book, the book that is the New York Times bestseller, the bestselling book that he wrote is based on exactly the question that you just asked. My program, Men of Action, is based on exactly the question you just asked. There have to be, there is some outlet. These men still matter. Even if they are five foot seven in Filipino, they still matter, right? So that's the question. And here's the thing. What I found is there are ways and we see it like men who become extremely charismatic or generate a ton of high status or the one that I try to use the most or try to teach them in the most is preselection, which is meaning having a lot of women around you makes other women interested in you. There's scientific proof behind that one. Things like that are other ways to get around the fact that other ways to get around the idea that, well, I'm just short and therefore I don't have any chance. So the idea, well, according to Blackpill, what I'm saying can't possibly be true. And then I show them my clients and I have clients that are five foot three and they're surrounded by beautiful women and they're like, there must be something wrong here. No, this has got to be fake and it's not fake. It is true. That's the thing. There are other ways that men, and by the way, this is a massive advantage that men have is that because there's 237 reasons why women have sex with men, there are all these different avenues, whether it be being incredibly funny, incredibly charismatic or incredibly rich or incredibly famous or incredibly talented or incredibly muscular or any of these other outlaw outstanding outliers that you have. And the reason one of the things I always try to bring up is like Kobe and Shaq. They both scored a fucking ton of points and they did it in two different ways. There is a way for a guy who's five foot seven to turn his sliders, his attributes up, just like on Madden, how you add awareness, speed, acceleration, all these different sliders. Maxing your stats. Maxing your stats. Again, there's some stats, like for instance, I know there's, I've seen dudes like pretty blue eyes. Girls are like, oh my God, he's so like, or some women who just like blonde hair, blue eyed dudes. And I'll be in a room with them and like the girls don't even notice I'm there. They're just like, okay, all right, well he, in this genetic stat, he has beaten me and there's nothing. I will never be as tall as Shaq and I will never look like this dude. Okay. I understand that. But that doesn't mean I give up. I still go and I work on these other attributes that I can do, whether it be like I try to read somewhere between 25 and 60 books a year and I try to build my business and I try to rescue animals and try to show level, some level of agreeableness and empathy towards my friends. And I happen, I'd say for me personally, I'm nothing special, but the biggest advantage I have, the biggest advantage I have without a doubt, absolutely without a doubt is the fact that I'm around so many other women that women are attracted to. How tall are you? I'm 6'1\\\". Huh? You're 6'1\\\"? Yeah, I'm 6'1\\\". Yeah. I'm around so many other women that... Let's see if you got lips. I don't have lips. Take your shoes off. I was going to say, I was going to say is like a lot of the guys that I, it was really great. I missed the super chat here, but there's a really great chat here just a minute ago. How height and attraction, like women want to be with a guy that other men want to be and other women want to have sex with. Other find attractive as well. There's a sort of an ego association with the type of guy. You're the kind of girl that can get that kind of guy, right? So it also comes back to respectability. So I am in a business right now. I mean, I'm in the manosphere and I'm dealing with guys who are 6'1\\\". I'm dealing with guys like Justin Waller is like 6'2\\\", or 6'3\\\", something like that. Myron Gaines has got to be 6'2\\\", something. Robert Kiyosaki is like 6'1\\\", at the very least. So when I'm 5'11\\\", and I'm still above average for the average height of guys, but then there's this sort of like, is there a respectability sense that goes along with a guy who is like much taller? It seems to me that a lot of guys who are like sort of like the movers and the shakers in this industry tend to be 6' and above. And so I'm wondering if there's like, if those guys have a real frame of reference to understand what these guys are going through. Now, more to your point here is, what do you tell these guys? It's not just, and by the way, yeah, of course, this is not just a sales pitch for men of action. Okay. What this is, is money, muscles, and game. Those are the three areas of men's lives that most of them are deficient in one way. Okay. So if it's muscles, if it's like physique, it's, you know, get in the gym, get your fitness on point. Most guys, that's where they start because 75% of the United States population is overweight. 35% of men are morbidly obese. That's probably number one. That's probably where you're going to probably start to begin with. Then you've got muscle or money, muscles, and game. So then you've got, you get your money on point, your career on point so that you're making more than $30,000 a year, but maybe not $5 million a year, CJ Sparks. The top 1% of wage earners in the United States. What number do you think that is? If you guys want to take a guess. Wage what? Like income that you take home. To get in the top 1%, what is that number? What do you think it is? 7 million? 7 million to be in the top 1%. What do you think? I don't know. I can't guess. I have no idea. It's about 540,000. Fucking shit. I knew I was going to be lower than that. So that puts you in the top 1%. That's why when women are like, Oh my God, I want to do this guy that makes multiple millions a year. I'm like, yeah. I mean, if he lives in Bel Air and he, you know, he happens to, again, one of the things that happens is that when you, when the three of us, the four of us are on stage at EDC and the Marquee Skydeck, we are surrounded by dudes who do make two or $3 million a year. And you start getting confused that that is the world and that is not the world. That's called the apex fallacy. Yeah. That is like one of the problems is when, when I, again, when next time I do the Maxim party, I'm going to invite you guys and we're going to be on, we're going to be in the VIP and in the VIP at the Maxim party, all of those dudes do make $5 million a year. You're going to be sitting around a bunch of fucking NBA small forwards and guys who own publicly traded companies and you start thinking that that is the world and that is not the world. But then you have all the women surrounding you and all the hot girls and then that's what they idealize and that I want that. This is what I need. So this is, has this ever affected you? You're part of the problem. Have you ever seen that happen? No. Have you, has that ever affected you? Yes. You've seen a guy who had a bunch of girls around him. Yes. Or even people I've dated, they date me just to attract the other women that are hot. What was the feeling that you had? You saw a dude and he was around a bunch of other women and you, what was there? I mean, it kind of just sometimes messes with you. I catch myself when that happens. You go to those events or whatever and you see all the good looking men that have the money and the hot girls around them and you're like, Hmm, you think about it, but I mean, I'm not one to fall for that, but I'm just saying it can, it can mess with certain people that aren't experienced. If anything, that's like what I'm not attracted to. I might be in a minority, maybe because we're from here that I know the guys who are around a lot of women are the ones I'm just not going to be interested in. It's like, yeah, I need all the attention, I guess. We are trash. You are a pageant girl. We are. Big fucking red flag. You are a pageant girl. No, no, totally not. I'm a brat. Full disclosure. I'm a brat. Tiana, will you move closer to her? Cause you're moving a little bit off screen. There you go. Thank you, Michael. There you go. Beautiful. Move closer. Speak up. I have a close guy friend that specifically asks me to hang out, to go with him and we'll like go downtown or whatever and just walk and he's bringing me just to look for her. Hold on. And has it worked? He's gotten girls, but people then maybe later on message him or whatever and they're like, oh, how are you friends with Stephanie cook? But he, I mean, he usually he gets girls not saying it could be the right way that he gets girls, but people ask him and inquire about it or like he could take photos with me or whatever and yes, that does work. Do you charge him for it? No. You need to charge a fee. He's one of my best friends for years, but I mean, I'm like, all right, whatever. Like I'll go with you. Shut up. Even with people I've dated in the past, I've, and they're not good people, but, um, them dating me and bringing me around and then you see the type of other girls he's clearly has his sights set on and he's just using me to look, yeah, he's using me as bait. And then you find out later, like he's dating one of those girls and just to that. Are you in a relationship right now? Oh, sorry. Go ahead. Are you presently single or are you in a relationship? Go ahead girl. I don't know what I should say, but no, I would say no. Say whatever you want. You can say it's complicated. It's complicated. It's very complicated. I would, I would, I wanted to go around the table here and ask like, wow, like what, on a scale of one to 10 priority wise, how important is like, uh, getting married, finding a guy and, uh, settling down into some sort of domesticity, I guess, like being a wife, being a mother. That's kind of literally what I was just about to ask because I'm like, do you think like certain men or women, maybe specifically women think they can get the $5 million, you know, income man. They have that opportunity to do that. At what point do they stop going for that? And they're settling for the guy who wants to just take you to downtown Las Vegas and walk around with you and be, you know, a friend to you first. Is it because you're ready to settle down and become a wife and, you know, do all the domestic things or is that, you know what I mean? I'm going to settle for happiness. I want a soulmate and a partner. And if not,  But I mean, it's just everything is like feeling and connection and she said connection and you want to fall you want to fall in love yes, but I mean and I want someone that's my best friend and I want safety and trust and loyalty because I could have had a dog dog someone that wants kids but I could have had a billionaire if I was like that I would have been married a long time ago and but you didn't know and I why didn't why did and I've also dated Bussers, they didn't was that guy not going to deliver on what you Are bringing up something really interesting in the chat that I bring up often is when I hear a woman say I don't like those type of guys who have a big social media following or surrounded by a lot of women it indicates to us that at some point maybe You did and the other thing is when I write here women say whatever say women I make guys wait this many dates to go out to before I have sex with them It indicates to us that at some point you didn't on the first day You did not make one of those guys day and when I asked women about this, honestly, they tend to say yes That is the case. I know you're telling me you would never attracted to any guy like that, right? I wasn't attracted to anybody with like a high social media No, not social media, but you you but previously have you ever been attracted to a guy who I'm sure we could we could come up With a bunch of different. Well nowadays the influencers and stuff that are but again, you're saying nowadays Do you see what I'm saying? You're saying nowadays back in the day you were more attracted to the life of the party and like that guy who's you know The center of attention It's kind of just like confidence though. You're attracted to seeing whatever you're perceiving for sure confidence, but A hundred percent say yes, cuz one time I made a guy wait 90 days and that still didn't work So I'm like, okay back to what I was doing before And or just reevaluating actually, what am I? prioritizing and What like works for me? Which I am I've never been solely about looks like I've I believe you very few women are solely about looks I'm just thinking of someone I dated like years ago, and I was really into MMA and I dated an MMA fighter Extremely good-looking, but as soon as I hung out with him a couple times He was so cocky and so like you could tell there's like some sort of void rage going on I was like, I want nothing to do with you ever again, but he was extremely hot and in the UFC at the time I cut it off. Thank God. I did cuz he's in prison You told me the story and criminalities I Got Chrissy Mackie Chrissy, man Many many many years ago, but like I thought he was extremely good-looking But I could I could pick up on it immediately and I was like, there's something wrong with this guy Do you understand how women earlier though? Maybe can't pick up on him? Can't can't pick up I think women do pick up on it actually pretty immediately, but I think that they excuse minimize and justify bad behavior Okay, there you go Jimmy cuz I'm like, how can you say that women? Do they do pick up on it, but we don't listen to our guy a lot of time To it I think women know right away like she had that gut feeling you got that right away you listen to it You know a lot of women don't they don't do that They excuse and minimize and they justify bad behavior for a lot of reason. They can't resist the tingles That's what they just said the job Maybe I didn't develop a close connection. So I was immediately like out of there for sure To and you and I've made exceptions for people's bad behavior because I already had a connection with them and I was like I love this person. So exactly then because of those things you'll excuse overlook minimize justify bad behavior because of again many reasons Why women do that if you have an emotional attachment if you've slept with them Those are all reasons why you excuse minimize and justify bad behavior. That's why I'm all about like women's women's concept of love is Opportunistic it's he's got to meet all these criteria. Sometimes that criteria changes the older you get so a woman who's 23 years old is going to have a diff like the Subjects the things on the list don't change that just the order of them changes as you from you know Ten years from 23 to 33, let's say so, I mean in my book. I'm known for this It's it's there's the whole phase right? There's the 18 to 28 year old Version of you who dates the MMA fighter, right? They said the the guy the hot guy in the foam cannon party the guy who's the fun, you know the fun as Sheryl Sandberg said the bad boys the bad for you guys the you know, the the hustlers and and Tinder swindler date that guy, right? But then when you get to be right around 29 30 31 That's what I peg is the epiphany phase and that's when women say, okay I'm done with my journey of self-discovery and now I want to settle down and find a guy who I'm really who really you know Is with me for the long term and I want to fall in love and I want to be happy to have all in those Criteria, maybe it's not looks first looks is like second or third, but he's got to be dependable. He's got to be loyal He's got a like he's got like dogs. What actually what is a hoe phase? What qualified because I know a lot of women that that that are in very monogamous relationships never had a hoe phase What actually is a hoe phase 18 to 28 years old, but what qualifies it as a hoe face because it's it's let's be promiscuous So, what does that actually look like like what's the body count on that? Does that mean she sleeps with somebody on the first day? Does that mean like more than more than six a year or like six? So well, okay, so I've done these shows with my friends. I'm just curious And with the same rules apply to a guy Stop in your tracks right now. I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna call out something And you've been doing this entire this entire conversation every time we bring out a point about like a hoe face for women Yeah, it's like well, what about guys? Okay Stop, you need to dissociate yourself from like, okay men and women are different So the idea that what's good for the goose is good for the gander if there's like, you know If it's good for guys, it must be good good for women throw that out of your mind right now because men and women are biologically physiologically Psychologically different from one another so there is this constant like well, what about guys, right? Okay. Well, that's not what we're talking about right now We're talking about women at this James Jimmy if you're asking is it a double standard? Yeah, there is and if you're asking if it's fair it isn't yeah, cuz I'm gonna cuz I'm gonna bring up this right right now I I'll ask a question first and then I'll bring up my well, I just really wanted to get back. So, okay So, okay, we'll focus on we'll focus on just the girls. Got it Do you care how many guys There's a question. We're gonna ask for do you care how many girls a guy has slept with when you date them? I used to Me I know you and I know the answer this do you really care how many girls a guy has slept with I mean, yeah Yeah, so what's the number that's too high? Yeah, I've never really thought about it. But like No, no, look like I haven't thought about it, but look just because I haven't thought about it doesn't mean it doesn't matter Okay, like it matters like I'm answering your question. Honestly, if I didn't give a fuck I would tell you okay So yes, does it matter? Yeah, is it super important to me? No, it's not super important to me But like do I want somebody to like have multiple sexual partners? So I want to be at it like a party and know that he's fucked you you you know, I don't want I don't want to I Don't want to deal with that Someone I don't want to you know for the rest of my life have to go out into the world and know you've because I Met you when you're around 30 other women I kind of can foreshadow what may or may not happen and just with my own so it's an embarrassment thing But it's not an actual number. That's about it But what the guy lived in New York and now you live in Vegas his body count is high But none of the girls live in Vegas with that problem be a problem for you. I don't think so Would it be a problem for you? Here in Vegas, yeah I'm gonna ask the same status in a social aspect of a hypothetical question I have three dudes here and then I asked them. Do you think body count matters for a woman? What do you think? They're gonna say? Yeah. Yeah, okay, so Don't tell me it is a double standard and it isn't fair. Yeah fair enough Well, I want to go back to the whole thing though Because I'm genuinely curious about it. Okay, because I hear that term a lot But like how do you actually define that like what what qualifies as a hoe phase? Like I think because I hear that all women have like you're making a generalization saying that hey 18 to this All women basically go through that. I didn't do that. I think you know, that's a generalization that just it's just a Generalization doesn't count your peak sexual market value years are gonna be right around 23. Sure. Yes Yes, but just based on your definition of what a hoe phase is. Well, I don't apply He didn't come up with the term hoe phase and neither did I I called it party Okay, you guys use the term hoe phase I asked him how to find it. So that's what I'm referencing for sure For sure. It's just a colloquialism. I think party phase is probably a better Because I know some girls that like they don't sleep with a bunch of dudes but man they like a fucking ton of attention and they'll go through this this phase in their life where they're like they have a Boyfriend and they're driving him crazy by making this dude jealous and this dude I've seen that happen also, but but at the same time There are a few girls who like we didn't come up with the wrong face is what I'm no No, we didn't know but I was gonna say is like the the Span to ten-year span. This is how I classify it So this is just my bonehead version of this 18 to 28 years old 23 is the age at which most men Across the board find women at their most attractive is between like 21 and 24 years old right in there So I pegged it right about 23 That is the prime age at which a woman has the her peak sexual agency whether or not she is Experiencing a ho phase or go, you know happening living it up in Cancun or or you know Haven't I got you know in the hookup culture in her college or something like that is immaterial to the the phase itself being like this is when you're going to be at your Your peak potential now, we just went through kovat, right? so what women are saying is like well here I am in the prime of my life and I just missed two years of My you know I couldn't dating when we were locked down and they're like women have said this on like many a podcast right now saying I feel like I got gypped out of you know my youth because I Could have had potential to go out and meet meet guys because that's right when they're in their most Marketable as far as the sexual market value is concerned. That's when they're at their peak potential and so within that 10-year phase Whether or not they are, you know sleeping with a hundred guys We're you know up in their body count or whatever or they are Promiscuous the fact still remains that that is that that 10-year span right there is when women have their peak potential to lock down a guy Who has the potential for the for long-term security? By the way, by the way when he's saying what we saying There's a book called dataclism where it goes over when most girls get their most right swipes and it is between 23 and 25 It's not our opinion. Yeah between the age like men between the ages of 15 and like 90 They all rate women between the ages of like 21 to 20 24 believe right around there as the most attractive for men. It's like 38 Well for women for women when they rate men who was being more attractive It's always anywhere between 3 to 7 years older than they are at that particular time So if a woman is 30, she's looking at a guy who's like anywhere between 33 and 37 something like that So it's always staggers up because I think on some level of consciousness women realize that it takes longer for the man to develop and mature into His peak potential to have the most so he can be the full package, right so he can still be good-looking He's got his money on point. He's got his physique on point. He's got his game on point It's a better judge of character He has some sort of status and affluence at that point And so therefore I think on some level like when most women when they're looking for a guy as a long-term You know like a marriage or something like that They're looking for a guy who's old at the very least three to seven years older than he is So when we talking about the ho phase ho phase is like that's again I didn't make up the word, but it's the 18 to 28 year old span where women are at their peak potential to maximize and you That's where they can maximize their potential So how they go about doing that you can have some very religious girl Who's never had like a quote-unquote ho phase and she might have like maybe you know A two or three body count and then you got the other girls on fresh and fit who at like 19 Have something like 15 or 20 body count already at what could you buy with your body cat? Yeah, exactly. It was like I could buy a fucking Birkin Throw in variables as well because Most women like remember as I just said, you know 75% of the population is overweight so that doesn't mean that every single woman is having the same kind of ho phase as somebody who is like Yes, that's why I wanted that textual. That's why I wanted that fine That's why I wanted that definition because I think look generally speaking When I hear ho phase or when most women here ho phase It's it's in reference to that that separation is it's not something that I think most people would commonly Define that as okay Most people when they hear ho phase are gonna be like, oh, she's she's a ho she fucks everybody and it's just like 10-plus I would say so let me ask you a question. So I think this is the real discernment men will then judge a woman by how many Men she slept with I think so. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So really that's the only point. Yeah, okay That's the only It's you know It was just being explained, you know You were you were talking about your book and and how like the developmental periods in and so that was what I wanted Understanding and clarity on is what that actually looks like how you're defining that, you know, well your part your priority That's again like you're saying before your priorities Like say when you're 18, you're like, I just want a hot guy. I want the MMA fighter I want I want to get with the hot dude that that is gonna give me like a really good orgasm I want to be with a guy who is hot and it's gonna be the experience is gonna be good And then so looks is always gonna be at the you know close to the top of the list But as women's sexual market value decays and it is perishable when women get to 29 30 31 years old That's perishable. That's what well more than a pet again I'm using that contextually because people want to say, oh, are you talking about the wall rollo and I'm like, no I'm not saying the wall starts here for women. I would love to doesn't start here. It doesn't start here for women So I would love to so after after put it this way your your 33 year old self could not compete in the six sexual marketplace to the same degree that your 23 year old self could That's where the wall starts. It's not there's very very beautiful women who are like, you know in their late third I mean Jamie of Lamar. Yeah, it's a great awesome. I mean physically she's absolutely stunning So what he's talking about is so a lot of women this is what I'm speaking in just generalizations right here a lot of women Let's just go all the way back to like the 1850s There's going to be a significant difference between their level of attractiveness how men find them attractive when they're 23 as opposed to when they're 35 now what happens is because of Weight training because of nutrition because of plastic surgery Fillers stuff like that. You can have women go into their late 30s and they never experience this This was when Kevin Samuels told CJ Sparks. You're in pretty prison That's what that's what I took it as and so what happens is there's this normal Inclination for a woman when she gets in her late 30s again, I'm speaking in a generalization here She gets in her late 30s and she comes to the realization when she sees those 21 22 year old women It's like oh I need to get married pretty soon And because this girl is still in magazines on the cover of magazines when she's 35 36 because of plastic surgery That thing never happens and the next thing, you know, you're 40 That's you understand what I'm saying? Now that is a thing that happens in Developed countries Dealing with plastic surgery women who have good nutrition and spend like all day in the fucking gym, which trust me. I love it I there's one of the reasons why I right now I'm seeing someone in their early 20s, but usually when I when I'm seeing someone I do not care about age But the factors this was really great because the book you recommended for me Which was the ape that understood the universe when they talk about men who are attracted to women who are in their 30s It doesn't disprove the rule The reason why you're attracted to those women in their 30s is because they show signs of youth. Does that make sense? Right, they're showing their show like I said before we're not talking about you three You three are two standard deviations above the normal level of attractiveness when you guys are all 50 years old You'll still be attractive. I personally I'm think you can come at me on the fucking chat. I don't care I think you guys are all very very pretty But that's the thing that'll that'll happen is that for a lot of what for in general again a woman who grew up in Oklahoma In 1855 she's going to receive like once she gets to be like 29 There's going to be this immense pressure for her to get married and have kids and for a lot of people It just doesn't happen. Let me get some of these super chest. Let's do it really good. Sorry I didn't get to that first one. I know though. What was he talking about the ring? I can't remember that I'll come back No, I'm in no diamond. Yeah, essentially. It's a that's a good question I want to come back to that because it's like our women the gatekeepers of sex and men are the gatekeepers of Commitment because because Steven Crowder you get this wrong as well So we'll come back to that that one that was a good super chat Adam says men don't need looks in the same way women do Men don't need looks in the same way women do meaning that they This was a good one thing and thanks for this adventuresome brada brada Is the body count double standard really unfair if a high body count? Truly ruins women in for an LTR a long-term relationship is the body count double standard really unfair Sorry, I had vodka Oh, so he's saying that if a woman a woman is Negatively impacted like physically if she has a high body count is he's saying like there are studies that would show that that this by The way same for men and women the higher the body count you are the the less likely you are to maintain a monogamous Relationship or a long-term relationship. I don't think that's true What you don't if they have a high body count it's less like we Reel that back in hold on. I just went forward a little bit Okay, I can see how that could be true actually yeah, should should a woman's sexual past matter to a guy Should it matter why would it matter? Yeah? Oh it for exactly what we just said Should a hoe face that we were never told you Right so I mean ever do Porn stars are getting married, so I mean okay, but so these are specific men that that have decided to look past that number Okay, I don't think so. I don't matter. I don't think so now. I don't think that it should matter I think that like I think you want to Like because like behavior can change sure and so you wouldn't want to You wouldn't want to completely disqualify somebody if perhaps They've like been a certain way in the past and then like made it made a change. You know that can happen Here we go Yes, sorry This is kind of the point here as well It's like the boner test does not necessarily guarantee a pass at the ring test again coming back to Our women the gatekeepers of sex our men the gatekeepers of commitment. That's that We've I think we've had that conversation before but it it it coincides what we're talking about now I have this I've had this conversation so many different times, but it's it's coming back it to come back in cycles So when we talk about to promiscuity when I talk about women's sexual past when you talk about the the the hoe phase I think one of the things that women aren't really Maybe conveniently unaware of is the fact that if a woman has a high body count men tend to be Revulsed by their revulsion to that there's their sense to be like at least a hesitation for a woman who has a high body Can we can we can we in general? Because let's go back to the I think that the guys who are in the the 30% of men who have had zero sexual partners I don't think they do and because like she said before I know several porn stars that are getting married big-ass ring Oh, yeah, and but like Andrew Tate said at the best 99% of men are simps like that that I Okay, so when it comes to like I think high status men. I agree with you I just think and from like for me personally I remember reading Woods a rich Cooper's book where you talked about those 21 red flags. I was like these don't seem that big or basics Yeah, and I remember afterwards being like oh, that's right because I don't want to be in a relationship That's why I don't think any of these are red flags. They are red flags so I took I do understand what you're saying the reason why the reason why promiscuity is important on for for women but clearly not for men because each one of you said it wouldn't matter as long as I'm not in the same city as he is in And all the other bitches that he's had in his past as long as there I'm not living in that city Then it's actually better that he has actually had more experience because clearly he is the type of man other men want to be and other women want to have sex with and His skills in the bedroom and his big dick prove the fact that he is actually some he's in high demand He's a high-value guy, so that's one side of the equation the other side of it is that the more The more partners the more sexual you the greater your sexual past The more difficult it is for women to maintain a happy marriage the more difficult It is for like women tend to be more suffer from depression as a result of that they typically Like I said to higher incidence of divorce The thing where you look question. There's a book. There's a movie you need to watch It's called after porn ends, and you should watch it And it's at the end of them just you can skip to the end It's not very well done But at the very end they show all these porn stars at the very end all the men they ask the women like well You know what what did porn do to your life? They're crying like I can't believe I did this and it ruined my life And they're like and they leave and they get addicted to drugs and then they like I turn my life over to God and then they go right back to doing porn the men are like They're just playing golf Sterling Cooper, I started a law firm. I'm happy you see that you see they're fucking kids 1500 when I'm good. Yeah, that's good. Yeah, it's very different It is there is a psychological effect that does not exist for men at all Yeah, if you've ever like I think we were talking about that yesterday. Yes, we were and so that that's one of the things Well, that's like men can men can separate the emotional side of Sex from the actual actively separated and that and again, that's biological too because men in our ancestral past We had to hit it and quit it right jack ejaculate and evacuate. So here's the thing to your to your thing Evolutionary psychology. It's not about what ought Didn't disagree. Yeah, but so here's the reason why just from an evolutionary standpoint, let's go back to your plasticine and ancestor You always know the identity of your child You always know the child is yours. We don't I'm not saying that that it's necessary because we have paternity tests now obviously we have contraceptives but your caveman ancestor was jealous of your and Very aware of your body count because we need to know the child is our kid. Does that make sense? That's where it comes from. I'm not saying it's right or wrong What I'm telling you is that's from an evolutionary standpoint. That's where it comes from that's also why single mothers are not as attractive as women who do not have Children because it's already proven that the kid that she's with it's definitely not your kid So that's where that that kind of like hesitation that revulsion comes from that of course culturally and socially we want to condition guys to To you know, hey, don't be the stepdad be the dad who stepped up, right? So but but the hesitation the hesitation is there for exactly that same reason is that we want to ensure that our DNA goes off on into posterity as a result, so women with higher body counts tend to be less desirable at least in the psychological sense because They're not a good investment or not a good bet for the future that that kids that come out of this woman are going to actually Be yours. So when a woman has when a woman is in a monogamous relationship and she cheats on that guy Men men and women Relate to jealousy and and and you know, well men in in this case, maybe even violence They're fixated on two different things when a woman cheats the guy wants to know where did you fuck her? Was it in the bathroom wasn't in the bed was in the kitchen. How was he how big was his dick? How you know, how was it for you, you know, they want details of what of what happened for women It's are you in love with her? Am I losing out on my resources? Am I losing out on my you know, your investment in me in the long term because again Women need that long-term security longer than they have their whole face for I've never said that though If you guys cheated, why did you do this to me? Did you love me? Yeah, but you but you did that never Oh my god, I'm gonna lose my money my security. No, no, no. No, I know But I just invested all this time exactly your investment Your investment still that's that's just because you invested in his potential and that potential is the truth I why and then I'm like where where'd you do it? Maybe afterwards? Yeah. Okay, so so here's the thing Dr. Buss in the book right here behind me talks about what you just said when men cheat women asked Do you love her when women cheat women asked or men asked? Did you did you fuck him, right? Yeah stuff like that So those are the questions, but here's the thing This is not cultural and the reason why there's a couple reason why we know it's not cultural and one of them is gay men Ask did you fuck him lesbian women ask do you love her? It's not a function of sexual preference It is a function of men or men or men women or women or women and that's that's the reason why because what goes back? To me asking did you fuck him goes back to is the child mine? And again your you guys understand your neocortex has no concept of contraceptives It does not your body the one of the you guys understand you ever you guys ever felt some level of Resistance the first time you had sex with a guy He's like I'm not really sure if I want to do this or have you ever been drunk the first time you had sex with Yeah, never you never The first time the first Each each guy Individual guys, okay, right. So the thing is men don't need that. We don't need to get drunk We don't we don't have that which I know some men do but like they don't wake up that way Nobody's ugly after 2 a.m. There is another study for that have you seen the beer goggles study Basically as you as you get closer to 2 a.m. I've seen my standards By which a man will have a sex with a woman become embarrassingly low the lights are coming on at the club It looks like this if you were to take the men and women of the same like stature You'll see the men will point down for what they want and the women will point up It's really it's really interesting what happens you guys if you guys wanted a short-term sexual partner You guys could get an incredibly good-looking man for a short-term sexual partner But a dude who's like a like a lieutenant at Hope Air or like, you know, what's it called Fort Hood? You know I'm saying well, there's like 27 dudes to one girl He's gonna aim down and he's just gonna get whatever he wants So you guys ever seen a guy who cheats and she's uglier. Yeah, right That's that's part of the reason why that happens or they'll choose the girl Yeah, less attractive girl in the club if you say there he's talking to both of us and I'm not showing as much interest I'll take that because he's like men usually cheat down. Yeah, I think so. Usually. Yeah, I do know so I Don't know the stats, I don't know the numbers but I've experienced it It's kind of hard to make stats on someone's physical attractiveness. But yes anecdotally we can we think we general have you all been cheated on? at one point Do you think the invisible man cares about a hot girls body count I think the invisible man would do anything to go out with with with stuff So it's only kind of like these more like high-value guys where those kinds of the more desirable men I think it's a bad thing have the option to choose. Let's say let's say desirable not necessarily high value. Let's say desire Okay, the more desirable man. Yes, high value is subjective but desirable really is a function of supply and demand Well guys who are into sport fucking they don't really care, right? If they're looking for a long-term partner, then that kind then that's when it comes like well How do you vet for a wife? You know, like it's well, so now we don't ask that's how we have a different conversation at that point So and another thing is when if there were if promiscuity if women's promiscuity wasn't that big a deal women would not slut-shame other women as as often as they do because they that is a way of Intrasexual competition, which is it's a Gossip kind of thing, right? That's intrasexual combat is what that is and it is rooted in disqualifying a superior Opponent by saying she's not a good bet for your promise for your your paternity So don't get involved with only a slut wears that only a slut wears the you know The red cocktail dress, you know, are you really into that kind of thing? And what it is is it's sexual disqualification of like intrasexual combat men do it too, by the way But we have a different way of doing it. Yeah, we're like that guy's a slutty fuck Must be gay I'm sure he has a huge penis. You would never want that stay away from him. What a Fucking whore, stay, no, men do not do that. It's all about disqualifying that competitor from the marketplace. That doesn't work very well. And so where does, so where's the line? It's actually the opposite, isn't it? Like when women denigrate other women, guys might think about it, but when dudes hate on me, it is like an aphrodisiac. I love when dudes talk shit to girls I'm dating. It is, like literally, I cannot think of a single thing that turns women on more than when other dudes spend time out of their day to talk shit to women that I'm dating. I have never seen anything where a girl comes to me, I can't believe he said this, and then they always wanna come on with me. It is, seriously, I am not that special. There is nothing special about me. But when dudes would talk shit to the girls I was dating, I have never seen something turn a woman on more than that. Oh, it's a utility. Yes, absolutely. Yeah, please do. Guys, listen, go on my IG right now and message all those girls on my IG and just talk shit about me all day, please. Let me see, Jose says this. He says, I think girls that deny the ho phase, the 304 phase, is because they are currently in that phase, and delusion, right? And then, of course, I just read St. George here. I like the line of, do women, are they the gatekeepers of sex, and are guys the gatekeeper of commitment? And I will tell you right now, women are the gatekeepers of both today. Yeah, yeah, I agree. Because high status, because I think lower status dudes are not the gatekeepers of either. I agree with you. Well, we say even porn stars are getting married right now. The 80% of our guys, the invisibles, do they care about a woman's sexual past? Generally, no, because they're in such a state of deficit and such a state of scarcity that they're going to, what do you say, overlook those things, overlook, push past their innate natural hesitations. Excuse, minimize, justify behavior. Wait, I would say they don't care about it if they're just looking to bang. They'll overlook. Well, I mean, guys will marry single mothers because that's their only shot at reproduction at that point. It's an adaptive mating strategy. Well, I can't get with a hot single girl, but this girl really needs what I have, my resources and my security. And I'm gonna step up to the plate and take care of another man's child. And by doing so, then maybe I can have my own child too with this woman. So it's sort of overlooking. It's like making your necessity a virtue. Is that something men nowadays think about? Or like are looking to women to date them, to meet them because they want to reproduce? Because anytime someone's asked me, do you want kids? Do you want, well, do you want children? Do you want to get married? The answer is yes. And they're like, yeah, I don't know if I want that. I don't know. And I'm like. We ain't gonna make it. What do you want? Evolutionarily, you don't need to want to have. Eventually. Evolutionarily, you don't want to have, you don't need to want to have kids to have kids. You just need to want to have sex. And so that's. I got, I got continue, but I got one for you. But like that, that's the Steve Stewart Williams in his book talks about that. You just need to want to have sex. So like, cause it made no sense to evolutionary psychologists for a while. It's like, there's all these people who don't want to have kids. And it's like, they don't need to want to have kids. They just need to want to have sex because their ancestors did not have contraceptives. That's the reason why you're, by the way, I skipped this point when we're talking about being drunk before the first time you have sex, your body does not know physical, your limbic system, your amygdala does not recognize that you are about to have sexual intercourse with a dude and not make a baby. Do you guys understand? Your body had to be through evolution program to feel like every single time I have sexual intercourse with this guy, there is a, the potential of a child. Does it, do you guys understand? Even when you are fully cognitively aware of the fact that you are on the pill and he's wearing a condom or maybe even has a vasectomy, even those things, your, your subconscious, your cave woman brain is not aware of those things. I say this before, your subconscious has no concept of contraceptives. And so because of that, that's the reason why you still have these feelings of like anxiety the first time you have. Whenever I ask women this question, how many of you have had, the first time you have sex with a dude, how many? I think STDs are probably part of that anxiety. Yeah, but again, you're, well, I, I agree, I agree. You can, you can add anxiety to it, for sure, for sure. But what I'm saying is additionally, there's no, I don't think there's a way, whenever I ask women, the first time you have sex with a particular guy, how many of you are drunk? It's in the high 80s to 90% of the time they tell me they were drunk or on molly or did coke the first time they had sex with a dude. It's like to the point where it's like crazy, crazy high numbers. And so that's, that's one of the reasons why, why that happens. But you're talking about women in Vegas, Mike. You're not talking about women in the Amish, Dutch country of Pennsylvania. They don't drink as much. They don't drink that, no. I was going to say what, what your question actually is, is it's the difference between proximate, proximate cause and ultimate cause. So proximate cause is, man, she's a hot piece of ass. I really want to hit that. The ultimate cause, the ultimate function of that is I want to reproduce. I want to have babies. So there's a difference between you being in the moment in the club, right? They're like for instance, I use this example all the time. My proximate cause, when I first saw my wife, when we first met, I wasn't going, I want to have kids with her. And I think she'd be a great mother and everything. I'm just going, I'm looking, I'm going, man, I really want to tap that. That was the proximate, that was the proximate cause, right? The ultimate, the ultimate cause. Unless you're LeBar Ball, you remember? At what point, at what point did that shift for you though, where it became more than sex for you, where it became more than that? Oh, it's still just sex to me. Is it really? Well, sex is the, sex is the. Well, look, look, if that, if that's true, then why not, why be monogamous with her? Why, if that's actually. No, it is, it is more than that. But like, as far as like, here's the thing is again, the difference between men and women, men can separate the sex act from that emotional investment. Women cannot because they have a lot more invested in that. Right, but that's not what I'm talking about. What I think is really interesting is at some point, something did shift where you saw value in, in, in saying, oh, you know what? I don't need to open myself to any other sexual partner. So that, that means you're picking beyond the sex, right? So what about, at what point did that shift for you? Where you're like, you know what? This is a person that I actually do want to have a child with. This is a person that I actually do want to commit to and say, yeah, I'm removing, I'm taking myself off the market. Like, what was it about that that shifted for you? Oh yeah, I get, I get this all the time. Okay, so, so first and foremost, when sex is the glue that holds a relationship together, without that, you're just roommates. You have a platonic relationship at that point. So I, I love my brother. I love my daughter. I love my dogs. I love my wife, but I only have sex with my wife. That defines my relationship with my wife. And I, I don't know how to explain that in any other, like more primary ways, because a lot of people want to like add more meaning to it and everything. I'm like, no, no, no, no, no. I, I love all these people, but I own my, I express that. Why her above anybody else that you could have chosen? So, so here's, okay. So what is it, what was the value added that came along with that? Yeah, with her. So, so for instance, and everybody, and this is like public knowledge. I talk about this all the time. I was non-exclusive with my wife for about the first, like three or four months that we were dating. She was seeing other people. I was seeing other people. We were dating as adults date. Hey, do you want to get together? Yeah. Okay. Let's go. We're going to go here tonight. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I like being with you. We were dating non-exclusively up until the point where my wife says, you know what? I don't like the idea of you like being with other women. I want to be exclusive. And at that point I was like, yeah, I, I, you know, the, the, the rewards were really, really good. I had still to this day, enjoy having sex with my wife. So I was like, yeah, I, I think I can do that. You know, I put a, put off the, the other plates that I was spending at that time. I'm hard pressed to believe though, that it's just sex that made you like just a sex as well. It was at first. That's just the thing is like, as I said before, when we're talking about arousal, it gets you in the door. So for attraction, what is it that makes that person whether male or female, what makes them, qualifies them for the long, somebody that you wouldn't want to, okay. In marriage vows, it is, you know, forsaking all others. Okay. That's part of like to love, obey, forsake all others in sickness and in health for richer, for poor, you know, to death do us part. Okay. Those are actual, actually terms of an agreement. If you think about it. So the, the, the marriage vows are actually terms. So what is it about her that would make me want to forsake all others? Okay. Well, first of all, I, up to a point, I was like, I wouldn't, I didn't, wasn't sure I wanted to marry her until I got to the point where I'm looking at her interacting with her, her niece. And I saw her family and I saw, I was not married to my, I just got out of a relationship with a borderline personality disordered woman. So I'm like, wow, this is like a breath of fresh air. And so I, I fell in love with her family. I fell in love with, with her, her, her sister and her brother and her niece and everything else. And so I was like, I wanted to be part of that tribe, I guess. So there's, so there was value added beyond just the sexual, the sexual has to be there. It's the glue that holds the relationship together. Beyond that, what is value added? And that's why, actually, that was a question I wanted to ask you guys. It's on my list here. What makes a, what makes a woman a high value woman? Like we were talking about what makes a high value man. I hate the, I hate this question where like guys will say, well, what else do you bring to the table? That's the wrong question. What value added do you have? I think that's a way better, I think that's a wonderful question. Beyond your sexuality, because at that point, women stammer and stutter. They'll be like, oh, I have a, I have a business. I have a, I have a business. I make money. Just like what they do is they try to add their, their idea of adding value is being more like a man. You know what? You're so, you're so right about that. You're so right about that because that's, that's a projection. I mean, men generally, I mean, depending on, heterosexual men generally don't want to marry other men. Look, I'm a hundred percent in agreement with you. Cause I hear the same thing. They'll be like, well, I make this or I do that. Well, that is not necessarily what a man would actually look at being high value. That is what a woman would categorize as high value. So she's answering that from a place of projection. Now I tend to think, so I agree with you on that, but I think like how, how women can add value. Like, is that kind of the question? Yeah. What, what, what beyond the sexual do you, why, why would a guy want to forsake all other women? Well, that was kind of the question. If he's a high value guy, why, what is it about women? What is it about yourself? What is it about my wife? What is it about anybody in this room? What makes you value added to say, you know what? I would forsake all their, all of their sexual experience because you bring something to the table that I'm not finding in anyone else. Well, I mean, I think every woman is going to be individual as far as what they uniquely bring to the table and also how, what that man finds attractive, because what might be attracted to one might, another guy might be repulsed by that, but maybe you value differently. I think what a woman can, I think one of the biggest things a woman can do that can add value is to bring peace to a relationship. I think that that's a huge thing and because men really, men don't want drama, men don't want chaos. And so if you can create peace and a structure within the household, I think that's highly attractive and a wonderful skillset to have as a woman. I think it comes down to like getting in touch with your feminine. I was going to say, how do you feel about the, bringing your feminine energy? Because I feel like that's also sometimes a hot topic. I get this again, like the reason I asked you guys this question early on about like, you're educated, you have your business on point, you're making money as an influence or whatever, you as a marriage therapist, having all of that, I get this question all the time from the same people. It's like, Rolo, I have, I've got my business on point. I went to eight years of college. I did all this stuff. I'm 36 years old, where's my man? Where's the guy who's my equal? Because they believe that all of that should make them more attractive. And it's not, because what they've done is they've become the men that they wanted to marry. Not, and so what do I say? I say, well, girl, you're going to have to get in touch with your feminine side. Like we've been telling guys that since the 70s, you need to get in touch with your emotions and your feminine side. Now I am experiencing this where I'm saying, look, you have become the man that you wanted to marry because you can't, you don't trust men outright simply because we've socialized women to never, like men are untrustworthy or they're buffoons or idiots or they're borderline abusers. But when, but again, it's a, and it's a hot one, but it's a, it's a hard, it's hard to, it's hard to tell women you need to get in touch with your feminine side because of what they equate that with is I have to dumb myself down. Yeah. You know, I actually talked to women about this a lot in my private practice and I helped them manage their feminine energy because it's their superpower. However, that has a very negative connotation now. And so does mass. And so does being in your masculine energy. Those things are very judgy, they're hot topics. And there are things that a lot of people don't want to talk about because of the stigma attached to it. But I think that, I think that if you can, I think, you know, that was a wonderful point that you brought up about being in your feminine energy because it is a superpower if you know how to channel it. And, and I think that it is such a strength and there's, but it's very, but, but what takes so many, why so many women aren't functioning in their feminine energy is a completely different thing. And that's, and I work with them on that for many different reasons, you know. I think one of the highest compliments a man can give, especially a high value man can give to a woman is you'd make a good mother. Because that means that he is picking up on the fact that you have at least the potential to be nurturing, to want to, to actually be, you know, someone who's going to take care of the household. Somebody who's going to be in their feminine energy, whatever. I think feminine energy is just some, it's a name that we give to something that's actually more, a lot more tangible, a lot more empirical. It's just, we don't know, like we won't, you know. But we want to, like, if you look at nurturing, if you look at like conventionally feminine characteristics, a lot of guys say, oh, does she cook? It's not about cooking. It's about the act of cooking is a form of nurturement. It's, I want to keep you, I love you so much and I want to be with you so much that I want to cook for you to keep you, to keep you alive, you know. Like I ask guys, I'm like, I'm going to sell my, I'm going to sell my wife out here real quick. Like we're, when we're in the car and like, she's got like, you know, one at a time kind of food. Like she'll, she'll feed me while I'm in, while I'm in the car. Right. I can eat, I can eat my, feed myself, you know, but she, but that's the act of just sort of, and again, I think it's sort of like on a primal level. I, I care about you. I love you enough to do all this kind of stuff. I have this, a bond in this, you know, this connection with you to the point where my act of feeding you like chicken McNuggets is, is, is, is a form of nurturement. And I don't think we really pick up on, you know, it's like trusting a guy with your life as well. Kind of. Yeah. Well, a lot of women. They're in their masculine energy because it's a way that they have to protect themselves to secure. It's a, it is, you know, because like being in your feminine, um, that, that's something that has unfortunately been, um, exploited or a lot of women can't because their role just even domestically has changed where more women are working. And so they don't trust men. They don't trust them. They don't trust men to provide the security that they know that they're going to need later in life. Well, men, like if, if the saying is, you know, we have to bring peace, men have to make an environment of peace to even happen for peace to even happen and feel men need to have a frame into which they also have to have an intention behind it. Also, even if it's like, not going to last too long, it's still like, you know, because it is a feeling of safety is where we kind of have to have our Dukes up all the time. Um, so I think they also, it's like, yes, you got it, you know, bring your masculine energy, but at the same time there has to be, I guess a little hint of like, like, like step here, just like said a moment ago, I'm looking for a guy that I can fall in love with. I'm looking for a guy who's like got his shit on, got his shit together. And really the qualities you were telling me is like a guy who has the potential to provide long-term security for you. Yeah. But that's why I'm not, I'm, that's why I'm not married yet and that's why I won't settle because I mean, I'm taking care of my sister's kids, which she has four kids from three different men and she passed away, but none of those men take care of their children. And then my father didn't take care of me. So you're the responsible one. Yes. I mean, I just, I'm just very like, I, everything has to be there and it's not just looks, it's not just, the, your career, money, what you have to have all of it. You need the perfect story. And it is connection. Like it's kind of everything. And otherwise I could give myself all that. And that right there, that what she's just described is the frame that you were talking about. The guy has to have that frame that that woman wants to enter into. He has to have a world into which that woman wants to be in. Look, when I, when I was talking about peace earlier, it's just, it's just that is an isolated incident of being able to add value. And if a woman can add value, like that's a good way. Now here's what I will say to that. No, not everybody deserves that. Okay. And like, look, you, you, like I never want somebody to be able to take me out of my true state. Okay. If my true state is being in my feminine energy, I don't want my environment, a person, anybody else being able to have the power to take me and act out of pocket or act out of character or be inauthentic. Okay. So it's my job to manage that. Now, if I'm around somebody that, that, that I, you know, I don't really, I don't really feel safe about, I feel like I have to be more protectable. Guess what? You don't get me. That, well, I was going to say that too. I remember my mom, when I was dating my last serious boyfriend, you know, she, this was like the first guy actually had her give me some insight on, I opened up to her about this. And she's like, you just have to be his peace. And I was like, no, he's not doing the things I need to be peaceful. And then I realized, you have to kind of be, you know, as women, you do still have to be self-aware and it's half your responsibility to stay in or leave it. If it's not, if he's taking you outside of your natural state, because naturally I'm going to be feeding you your chicken nuggets, but if I feel like you don't deserve it and you're just, you know, not going to be appreciative of that. It has to be a genuine desire to want to do that. And I still feel like, okay, he's appreciative of this, like here. I got to keep you loud, baby. I don't want you. I don't want nothing bad to happen to you. Let me read some of these, the rest of these here. Uh, Jose S says, uh, Rolo doing God's work. Uh, 100 shout out to Mike. I remember him since the RSD days. Uh, two videos of those guys, Terrell, Terrell, Xavier, Dr. Xavier, uh, a girl sold her first time sex for three and a half million dollars. I remember that. Um, if you knew, I think I heard about, if you knew yours was worth that, would you still give it to the same man or would you sell it? Wait, what? No, I don't think you sell your virginity. Okay. Given what you like on your first time having sex, what if, if you said, okay, uh, would you have, you can have that experience or you can sell it to the highest bidder for three and a half million. No way. I love this question. That was awesome. Thank you. Thank you. It got quiet as a motherfucker. What happened? I'm thinking for sure. I'm with you at this point. Yeah. What I, with what I know now, or I mean like, no, everything, sex for me is literally connection now. I didn't know that back when I was younger. It wasn't connection for you before? Uh, I just, it was attraction. It was attraction and not knowing truly what was going to like be real for me, I guess at the time. Cause like a lot of the guys I slept with when I was younger, they couldn't make me come. Let's just be, I'll just say it outright. And then men would be like, why can't I work in it? And I figured out later on at my age now that it's because it's connection. And sure. Cause it was you. No, but I mean, no, I know, I know what you're saying. Do I want that amount of money? That was a very good question. Sean St. George says some men will accept, uh, low quality women for companionship and reproduction potential even if they know the risk of it. But that was on the promiscuity side. And then, uh, Sean St. George, once again, he says, uh, I love hearing, bring, uh, bringing peace into a relationship. This should be a, be a quality. I've had too many relationships where the woman was a source of conflict instead of peace. And let me tell you, I can relate because I was with that BPD girl for about three and a half years. And boy, you want to talk about chaos? That was, that was one of the transition. It was the pit of hell. Thank you very much. So, so can we go over this real quick? BPD we're talking about. Borderline personality disorder. Yeah. Yeah. So it's a cluster B personality disorder in the DSM five. There's mad, bad and sad. Cluster A is mad. Cluster B is bad. Cluster C is sad. Cluster B is going to be borderline histrionic antisocial personality disorder and history and, uh, and, and borderline personality disorder. So with BPD we're dealing with kind of a simple way to explain it is like, uh, it's an, uh, a disorder based around abandonment. So you didn't call me, you didn't call me back. So I fucked your brother. That kind of manner. That's an extreme example. And you, you know a lot about this. And I was just curious, like women, Dr Martha Stout has an opinion about this where men and women are misdiagnosed as far as sociopathy and BPD is concerned that men and women are about the same when it comes to BPD and sociopathy. But the way it is diagnosed as men are far more likely to be diagnosed as sociopaths and women are far more likely to be diagnosed as BPD. So what do you, for, for borderline personality disorder, what is something that a guy may be watching right now or a girl might be not notice as far as borderline personality disorder? Cause it's something you specialize in. Well, I don't necessarily specialize in BPD. I specialize more in narcissism, which is, you know, again, personality sort of stuff. But one of the things that you'll see a lot with BPD is, uh, all good or all bad, black and white thinking. That's something that happens all the time. So, and you're going to feel a lot of anxiety. You're going to feel like I can't ever say I can't ever do anything right. So there's always this kind of, uh, moving the goalpost. And then there's this huge looming fear of always leaving. So you're going to see a lot of attachment like in, and it's there in, and look, I don't want to villainize people with, with BPD because a lot of people with BPD, uh, it is a very manageable thing if you're willing to manage it. And a lot of them are aware that the behavior is, um, is unhelpful. And they actually have a desire to change. Most people with BPD, actually have that awareness and the desire to change it. So I will just say that, so I'm not villainizing anybody with BPD. However, it is a difficult personality to manage. It is a difficult personality to be in a relationship with. So, um, you will see like somebody puts you on the pedestal and then you say, you didn't put the dishes away. You're, well, you're the worst husband in the world. Okay. Um, you'll see a lot of, uh, really reactive behavior. And also, um, it can be kind of, um, I don't want to say manic cause manic is something else, but you'll see a lot of high risk behavior with BPD as well. So you can see a lot of self harm, uh, cutting typically gets associated a lot with BPD. That's more for women than it is for men. Um, but yeah, you, you know, you're, you're good, you're bad. Um, again, not being able to please walking on eggshells, a lot of tension building, a lot of anxiety. So those are some of the, I have to speak about it very generally, you know, I can give you maybe one example of how, how you might be able to see a BPD trait. Let's say I have, um, I'll just use guy, girl terminology. Don't kill me for it. You know, I'm going to be whatever. Let's just say, and I'll use traditional roles. So don't buy my head off for it. That's okay. Elon Musk on Twitter. Now you can say whatever the hell you want. Okay. So let's just say I have, let's just say I've got a, you know, I'm going to use the guy as a BPD trait. So let's just say I have a girl and she's been taking care of the kid all day and the house is a little disheveled guy comes home and he's just like, what have you been doing all day? Like you look, you look a mess. Like, you know, what are you doing? And so she's like, okay. So the next day she wants to have, when he comes home, she wants to have everything ready. She gets herself ready. And you know, the kid's taking care of the house is clean and she's fixed herself up and he comes home and he goes, now, who are you trying to look good for? So it's a Kobayashi Maru. You cannot win. No win situation. We call those situations double binds. Okay. And so that's the, that's the, all good, all bad. That's I, that's the difficult to please. It's, it's, uh, you know, like, why are you talking to that person? You know, it can feel very controlling and very constricted to be in a relationship with somebody with BPD and you'll see extreme moods, mood swings. So high, low, high, low, high, low, high, low, constantly triggers for each one of those. Absolutely. Triggers. But like this, you can do this all day, all day, all day, all day. Good, bad, right, wrong, black, white. Like there is no gray. There is not a level of like a compromise. Um, so, and, and those are just a very general way to kind of explain how that behavior presents. When I was in the BPD relationship, it was really, uh, insane levels of jealousy and possessiveness. And it got to the point where the, it was, and I didn't even know what the, I didn't, until I started reading the DSM, like when I was studying psychology, I didn't even realize there was a diagnosis for this until I got chills when I read this. So I was like, uh, it was, it was an insane level of jealousy. It was like crazy good porn star sex in bed, but like crazy out of bed too. So, um, you couldn't go walk down the street. You couldn't watch a movie. You couldn't do anything without like, Oh, does that girl look like one of the girls you fucked in the past? Ah, you know, like crazy levels of jealousy, crazy levels of possessiveness to the point where, uh, she would start isolating me from my family and my friends and the things that I was doing. It was just, there was only the relationship. There was only us. And again, you know, she was, she was hot enough. And the sex, the reward, the, the, uh, with the operant conditioning, right? The reward was you get crazy sex, but you have to put up with all this bullshit. Um, you know, day in and day out. And I can't imagine guys who were, um, who were, uh, like sort of blue, like blue pill guys who are really kind of the 80 percenters to get into a situation like that is it's almost a death sentence at that point, because at some point she ends up, you know, cuckolding that guy or at some point she ends up cheating on him because he's no longer a fun play thing anymore, I guess. And so what happens is, uh, due to that isolation, um, she ends up, uh, putting into your head, putting into guys, head gaslighting guys, I guess was probably the proper term for it, that he is actually the source of her like psychosis. And if he could just be better, if he just, you know, manned up, if he took more responsibility of it and it locks into the narrow, I think really today it's almost more dangerous than it was like back in the nineties, right? It locks into this narrative that you have to live up to her expectations. And if you're not, you're a failure. And the, uh, the litmus test of, uh, meeting those expectations is being the kind of man who doesn't, who isn't the source of her own psychosis. When in fact, you're just a convenient like, uh, host for the parasite at that point that tries to convince you that if you would change, you would be able to solve her problems for you. And it never works that way. You know, that, that does happen. It's actually more narcissistic than it is. Yeah. MPD and VPD go hand in hand. Are you born? I'm not too familiar of like how it, so 40% of 40% of people with borderline personality disorder have, uh, narcissism. 100% of psychopaths have narcissism. You are born a psychopath, narcissism and BPD. There is develop. And not every narcissist is a psychopath. So there, there is, there is different. Basically you would take monozygotic twins and you would see is one of them become BPD. The other one becomes BPD. And we find that that is not the case with psychopaths. We find that is the case. So that's the reason why it's psychopathy is a neurological disorder that has to do with the neural pathways in your brain, not forming for you to feel empathy or, uh, uh, empathy or a conscious or more conscious. This is why the reason why her and I were talking about this, uh, Amber Heard is, uh, is a narcissist, not a psychopath because there's no way she'd go to trial and get caught and get exposed like that. If she was a psychopath. Narcissists love to testify too. They love it. Exactly. Like that's when I'm meeting and interviewed about the girl who, who killed her sugar daddy, the, uh, Kelsey Turner, she's going, her, her boyfriend pled out. He's already pled out. He's not getting the death penalty. She wants to go to trial. She's going to go to trial in a trial where she clearly committed murder and she's, she's going to, well, that's what a narcissist would do. This is like the definition of narcissism, right? This is one of these things. You shit in a bed. You should not be going to trial for this. You want to hide. You shouldn't even have shown up for trial. You should go hide because you're a narcissist. That's what Megan Markle is a good combination of BPD and NPD. I see those traits and I see exactly what she does. And she's got Prince Harry in that relationship and he is, he is the epitome of the beta male trapped in that, like, I'm so glad that you brought that up because so many people don't see that. And I've, I've been, I've watched that from day one. Shine some light on it. What am I not seeing? Well, she's a victim narcissist, right? And so what she does is she, she, she feigns and then he has to care and illicit care responses. You'll see that a lot with BPD. Which kills me because Harry didn't used to be like that. He used to be a player. And then he got, he got in these streets in Las Vegas. Prince Harry used to be, he used to be a place to fly helicopters, man, you know, and now, and now look at him. I don't think that. Oh. And then another good example is, is Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith. Oh, I spoke, I mean, Michael and I talked about. That one and we had a whole thing on Amber Heard as well. We went and we went in. Well, Jada is a narcissist. Jason, yeah, very much. Well, Will is an empath. A hundred percent. He is an empath. Now Jada, in my opinion, presents with very strong narcissistic traits. Yeah. I mean, we talked about this a long time. Everything became about her. We did a whole podcast. It's one of these situations where like anyone else, anyone else you would be with, she'd be the more famous person in the couple. She's with this guy and she's not. So every, she, he turns everything. I talked about it. Turns everything back to him. Exactly. This is one of the situations. I've gone out, I've gone out with girls before and we'll go to a party and I know more people than her. And she's not used to that. She's used to being like the big, you know, cause she has a bunch, way more followers than me. And you can just see this reaction and all of a sudden everything has to turn back to her. So sometimes you'll see that happen. What's the difference between an attention seeker and someone like a Jada? Then. Well, she is an attention seeker. So, so you, so let's say there's a scale. We're talking about a legit, like legitimate personality disorder. So with a personality disorder like this, we're talking about, so with a narcissist, there is no conscious, there is no empathy. Does that make sense? Like a psychopath. There is, there's nothing. It's not a dark room. We're at zero. Exactly. Empty closet. We're at zero. Correct. Well, the thing, the thing that would separate like a narcissist from a psychopath, and when I say psychopath, I actually mean antisocial personality disorder, psychopath. This is like a colloquial term. It's not a diagnostic term. But the, when I would, when I say that with a psychopath, there is, you're right. There's nothing. It's basically somebody who's lost an arm and saying, go ahead and grow an arm. That's the equivalent of telling a psychopath to feel empathy. They're the neural pathways for empathy don't exist for a narcissist. They could have existed at one point, but what's happened is you've got a defense mechanism, you've got, you've got so fucked up that basically like as a narcissist, I'm like, why are you unhappy? You like, I do care about your feelings, but the way I make you happy is by allowing you to serve me, what make this all about me, they don't really care about your feelings though. No, they don't. Um, it's a very, it's very, they're so confused. Why are you mad at me? Um, well, they, they don't see any wrong ever. So that, that would be where any confusion would lie is because they're not wrong. They don't take any ownership or accountability, anything like they have not done anything. So why are you upset? So how do you maintain a relationship with someone who's like, well, you excuse, minimize and justify bad behavior. So they just probably don't deserve. I'm asking for you. No, for a narcissist. I would not to be in a relationship. I look like a lot of people say that and then find themselves in a relationship. And there are other things at bay a lot of times that keep you connected to somebody that is not good for you. Okay. Emotional investment attachment. Those are two big reasons why you might recognize that something is bad because a lot of women and a lot of men know, but you will excuse, minimize and justify behavior for a multitude of reasons. I think that's one of the key elements of like, I think Rich Cooper talks about this, you know, identifying red flags, but guys love to complicate their lives. They love, they love to complicate their lives because she's crazy in bed, but she's crazy out of bed. And they're like, what's the threshold? What's the breaking point? I'll tell you right now, it was three and a half years of that. I got to the point where it was like, I, I, I really, I relate the story quite a bit on my own show is I got to the point where I had this knockdown drag out fight. It's like the point where she's like digging her nails. I've never like, I've never been physically like, you know, yeah. And I'm like, she's like, she was like really, I'm just borderline having, you know, like a violent episode on me. And it wasn't so much like that. I'm just like, am I in this kind of hurt? Like you've heard about this before, but you abusive relationships. Am I now is, am I actually experiencing it? Yes. The answer is actually yes. So I can remember having this, this knockdown fight and I'm just like, this is not, this is not going to happen. And I was sitting in her dorm room and I looked, she blew out and she went into her bedroom, like stormed off and she went into her bedroom. So there's one door right here and then there's the other door to go out of her dorm and go out in the parking lot and get in my car and drive away. And I'm looking at those two, two doors. I'm like going, I have a choice here. I can go to that door. I literally have a choice. I can go in that door and try to make things right. Or I can get out of here and get on with my life. And I went out that door and I got on with my life. And that was after like three, like trying to, trying to make this bitch happy. That's all I was trying to do was trying to solve her problems. And I was, I was the, I believe that I was the source of the problem because it was all gaslighting. And yes, I just, let me get to this real quick. Sean St. George, again, he says, roller, did your BPD keep moving the goalposts? Yes. To the point where I got to that stage where I'm looking at two doors and I go, you know what? It's never, it's never going to end. Yeah. I have to end this. I have to be, if you get in discussion with all three, I don't, the histrionic, I don't know what to talk about, but the other three, uh, antisocial, uh, narcissistic BPD, they're all going to move the goalposts. They're not going to lose a conversation with you. It's never going to happen. It's always going to be your fault. You will never win. It's called the Ashi Maru, man. It's a no win situation. That's exactly right. I do. I do want to touch on something cause we, you know, I don't know how much longer we're going to go here, but you said something on stage today that I thought was terrific and it, because she's a marriage therapist is something I wanted to bring up and you talked about the real reason why marriages don't work. And they kept talking about, you remember all the other excuses you came up with? Can you bring up those real quick? Uh, I'm curious on what you said. Well, I mean, I'll, I could just cut to the chase here. It's like the real reason why marriages don't work is because there's a lack of desire. There's a lack of genuine. Yeah. But you brought up one other thing about something to do with that. What specifically did I say? You said, I say a lot of people, you said because people are overweight. Oh yeah. Yeah. Primarily. Well, that's yeah. Oh, I know. Okay. So it was a, no, it was, it was in relation to an art. It was serious. Is that what I did? It was in relation to an article that I was, that I had been reading and it was, uh, why, no, it was why, why men and women, why are there sexless marriages? Like right now, I think the stat was like 27% of marriages in the United States are sexless, meaning that they, the couple has sex, uh, 10 times or fewer in a year, so that's like less than once a month basically is what it comes. Do you think that that's because of the, because of the attraction has declined in the lack of genuine desire, but primarily like, so, so every damn article that has anything to say about this says the same thing. Oh, it's because of stress. Oh, it's because he doesn't do enough chores around the house. Oh, it's because of, uh, I mean, just insert the, the all ignoring the 800 pound, literally the 800 pound gorilla in the room, which is obesity rates are through the roof and nobody wants to have sex with people in this country. And that's why that's bio, that's a biological thing. Nobody wants to have, if you're not, if you don't get to the arousal thing, if the arousal like is, isn't there, of course you're, of course it's going to decline. So it's like staying in shape. I remember what you were saying before. I think it was on the show that you did with, with Mike. Um, uh, when, when couples come together, if they're, if they already are like gym rats already to begin with, like my wife is very, very thin, very slender, very good looking for her age, right? Because we have, it's not because we are like, we, we do it for each other. I go to the gym and everything is, I don't, I like sex too much to let myself get fat. Okay. So I'm, I'm, I'm like, I don't want, I don't want to see people on, on video on, on Pornhub who are fat having sex. And I don't want to see me as a fat guy having sex with an, so I'm, I'm like, that's my, my rationale right there. But the thing is, is like there it's, it's a genuine desire on her part. She's always been into physical fitness. She's always been, you know, very taken very good care of herself. And it comes down to like, well, I want to stay in shape for my husband. Cause I, you know, we, that's, it's the glue that keeps the relationship together. You know, I'm not going to disagree with you, but I will, I will piggyback or I'm going to, I'm going to say it doesn't start there though. I think a lot of, I don't think that that's the number one reason why marriage fails. I think that it's a big reason why marriage, why, why, why it doesn't work. I was talking about sexlessness. So, okay. And then sexlessness then leads to divorce. Well, I guess, I guess if you're just talking about why the sex declines, would that be probably a number one factor is yeah, I would, I would actually agree with you on that, you know, but I don't, you know, I don't think that that's why marriage fails though. Why do you think marriage is fair? I think people pick the wrong person. I think that that's, I think, yes, I think that a lot of people get into relationships where they weren't really like, like women, women pick partners a lot of times because of scarcity, a fear that their clock is ticking. Okay. And they will pick by what is available or security or whatever. And that gets them into a relationship a lot of times that they're not happy or satisfied. And then 30 years later, they're getting divorced. Okay. Or whatever, or, you know, so people and guys will do the same thing. So they'll, you know, they might, they, they might, you know, hook up with somebody that they're super sexually attracted to, but it doesn't have some of the other qualities that would maintain that relationship. And let's say the looks drop off. Well then that relationship drops off. Okay. So the aging affects what that relationship, you know, does long-term. So, you know, those, those, most people are not picking from a place of genuine connection or love. And, and I think you need, look, I think you need connection, attraction, all of these things for a successful relationship, you know, and a lot of people don't pick from that place. They pick from a place of fear. So that's the number one reason why I think relationships or marriages don't succeed. Okay. So first off a few stats here, the average age of first marriage in the United States for men is a 29 or 30 right now. And I believe it's 28 to 29 for women somewhere in the, in that range. In Western Europe, it's way later than that. It's, we're talking like in the, in 34, 36, in some cases, depending on the country right now, you know, the, the rate of marriage in the United States is 5.1 per 1000. It is the lowest it has ever been in record since they started recording it. So again, it's, is it settling or is it the idea that is it this unrealistic expectations, unrealistic goals, I guess, as far as like, I won't, I hear this all the time. I'm not going to settle for anyone less than perfect. I need like, I mean, Steph was just saying a minute ago. That's actually not what she's saying. She's saying that I want love and I want connection. Are you willing to, are you willing to compromise certain aspects of that to get to that? Cause there's plenty of guys in the chat right now who would love to wife you up. I guarantee it. Guys, put a one in the chat. If you would wife her up. A lot of people have wanted to marry, but I, I, there was other things lacking from it that I, I didn't want that. It's not like I can't. So why did, why did you turn them down? What was the most common thing? I want a stronger connection or I, I maybe wasn't attracted fully to where I wanted to be with them. I, I want desire. I want lust. I want romance. I want you to be loyal. I want to trust you. Like there's a million other things, but a lot of the things you guys are saying, it's like money, whatever. It's not usually, I want security and I want someone that's doing better than me cause I struggled my whole life. Does a guy have to have all of those criteria met for you to want to say, okay, I'll get with this guy and not feel like I'm settling, not feel like I'm compromising? No. One of the main things is though, how I feel with somebody and like the connection. That's the main thing. What goes into the connection though? Like what contributes to that for you? Uh, spending time together, their interest in my life, um, making me laugh, like spending time together is one of the main things in communication and the interest in me. Cause I've easily lost interest in people that had every other thing, but they just weren't communicating. And I, so I think the number one complaint that guys have right now is exactly what you're saying is that like women are too entitled. They have an overblown sense of self and an overblown ego. And they believe that they are entitled to a, a, a percentage of men again, who are the high value guys and nothing else will do. And if they would rather die alone and single than not get with Justin Waller or share that guy or share that guy either directly or indirectly. If you're not interested for whatever reason, it won't be a match anyway. Like you shouldn't settle or compromise your standards no matter what or settle because it just, it won't work longterm because you're never going to. Do you think that that is contributing to the, the, the rate of marriage right now? Um, like what is contributing to the rate of marriage? Well, like the idea that you will not settle for anything less than perfect. Um, well, I don't think anybody's saying that though. I, we're not saying I'm less than perfect. We're not saying, um, less than perfect. Like we're actually saying, well, you just said an ideal match. You said that that was one of the reasons why marriages don't work is because they selected the wrong person or they compromised or they settled on the. Yeah. But that's not, that's not perfection that that's not perfection. It's saying like, Hey, like you want, you want connection, you want attraction. And like with that, you know, we're all human. We're going to have, we're going to have things that work. We're going to have things that don't work, but like that doesn't make it not a match, you know, like nobody's going to be perfect. So, and nobody, we, we don't have, I don't, I'm not hearing any unrealistic standards from, from anybody. It's just like, Hey, this is what I like. And, and you know, this is what's important to me. That's not unrealistic. And I don't think that you ever have to lower your standards ever. And if you find yourself lowering your standards, you're not going to be a match for whoever that person is. You just won't be because it's something isn't there. There's not a connect. And so like you might not have to lower your standards, but you want to make sure that whatever you do want, you'll be a match for that. Do you believe that you also have to meet the man standards? Absolutely. That's what I was just saying. That's, that's, that's kind of what I meant by that is that whatever you want, whatever you want, you've got to make sure that you're going to be a match for that as well. That's you working on yourself. That's making sure that you're adding value to the relationship, right? It's not a free ride. It's a partnership, right? So you should both be adding, you should both be balancing each other out and adding value. So I don't, I don't tell any woman to rate, to lower their standards. I'm like, girl, go get it. You want what you want? Go get it. If you lower your standards, you're not going to be a match. Which is why when I tell women, you know, how do I find a man? I'm, I'm, I'm 36. I've done everything by the book. I've got my career. I've got everything on point. I need a guy who's my equal. And they find that the guys who are their match, their ideal match, don't want to have anything to do with them because now those guys are in a position of sexual selectivity and they're not selecting those women. They're selecting women who are far younger than, than, than those women are and are more in touch with their feminine, are more in touch with, are more nurturing, would make good mothers. And that's, that's, and so I'm dealing, and maybe you guys will see this as well at some point, dealing with a generation of women who, who, because if I say, you know, get in touch with your feminine. I just said it sounds like I'm saying dumb yourself down. It also sounds like I'm saying compromise. Go for the good enough guy. And right now, that's like the cardinal sin in girl world is to tell a woman that she needs to settle for less than what she\\u2014because hypergamy doesn't work that way. It's like it doesn't seek its own level. It's always looking for the bigger and better deal. So not only does it go against women's innate nature, it also goes against the cultural narrative, which is, you get what\\u2014you're a queen. Go get what you can get. You go, girl, kind of thing. Yeah. You go, girl. At least as far as my understanding. So here's my take on this, my observations on this, is that the reason why we have such a low divorce rate is because we have such a low marriage rate right now. And the reason why we have such a low marriage rate is not because men aren't taking responsibility. It's because we have these unrealistic ideas of what is going to be the ideal mate for us and what is not. And so when we have these, nothing better than Brad Pitt or Justin Waller will do. And so therefore, if I can't have that, what I'm going to do is I'm going to schedule my life and mold my life and create my life to the point where I am the man that I wanted to marry in the first place, because that guy's not forthcoming, but I still need long-term security. How am I going to get that? I'm either going to get that from the state, or I'm going to get that from outside influences, or I'm going to be able to do it myself, which means I got to start my own business. I got to have my Instagram on point. I got to\\u2014it's the funnel marketing kind of thing. And so the aspect of long-term security is no longer something that you go and look for in a partner. You look for it in yourself. And as a result, we see more and more women being not married. You're talking about dudes having their Instagram on point, right? Yeah. And for women, too. You look confused. No, actually, you don't have to have it. Neither of you do. So for a dude, again, remember when I talk about those guys you don't even notice? I notice everybody, number one. But you're talking about somebody that I'm interested in? As a guy, the scale, like the idea right now, the guys who are doing well on social media have such an un-fucking-believable advantage against the guys who aren't. It's 10 million to one. It is ridiculous. And I've seen it because I've been on both ends of it. And I've seen it because I've had 500 clients come through my program. And when they go from just being this guy who has these weird photos where they look like a fucking child molester with a flannel shirt on at a college football game, and it's\\u2014 I notice them, too. You're all about that? Swipe right, yeah? No, I'm talking about Instagram. But when you see those creepy profiles, for guys, I feel like absolutely right now, not for a guy to do well, to have any chance whatsoever, he has to have an online profile that makes him look viable, that makes him look relevant. I think it's way more important for men and extremely important for average men to be able to do that. And if they don't do that, they're just left behind. And I think it's going to get worse and worse and worse. It will escalate. It will escalate because the delta will escalate. So for instance, when I was growing up, I'd say when I was in college in the late 90s, if I had a decent car and a guy had a Lamborghini, he would have, let's just say, a 50% advantage over me. Well, now we put those two cars against each other on social media or my physique versus his physique or whatever. That advantage I have is now multiplied. It's exponential because of social media, because of the scalability of social media. And the other thing that happened was, and this was a big deal, was that girls, like you guys remember, you're from Illinois, you're from Kansas. The pretty girls, when they turn 18, they do not stay in Waco or Wichita anymore. They don't stay in Des Moines. They don't stay in Cheyenne anymore. They leave and they move to Chicago and Los Angeles. They move to Brickell. That's the thing that's happened. And the reason why they know they can move down there, why is it they end up at Tyga's fucking video shoot? It's because someone snuck in their DM. How did they end up at the Maxim party or in the Playboy mansion? How was it that they ended up at the Ignite party? It's because somebody literally snuck in their DM. That's the difference that's happened. And what's happened is like, I've said this before, men, high status men normally distribute, high status women do not. There is a top cardiologist in Waco, in Waco, Texas. There is a high end personal injury attorney that lives in Wichita, Kansas. There is a guy there in Des Moines, Iowa right now, who's an ophthalmologist who makes $300,000 a year. High status men normally distribute, high status women do not. They're going to go to places where it's going to be easier for them. They're going to go to Brickell. Like you said before, if I want to be a model, there's a reason you don't live in Secaucus, New Jersey right now. There's a reason you guys live in Las Vegas, or you want to be a model and you move to New York. There's a reason why you go to Swim Week in Miami, or you go to the Met Gala, or you go to Fashion Week. Those things, with really attractive women, they do not normally distribute. They go to certain spots, they go to certain places. And social media actually makes that difference, makes that delta even greater. Travis, can you put up that image of the soccer players that I gave you? Do you have that? There you go. Okay. I love this. Superimpose that. That's good. So these are soccer players. And forgive me, I'm not a big soccer fan. I can only recognize one of those. Ronaldo? Yeah. Is he on? Is Ronaldo on? I don't think Ronaldo's on. Cristiano. Cristiano. He's one I recognize. So on the left-hand side is the player's Instagram of the same vacation that their girl... I'm very attractive women that they're... I mean, these guys are the apex. They're at the top of their game right now. This is the difference between the player's Instagram and their girlfriend's Instagram. Well, you know why? Because if the girl started posting all of the relationship photos, it would be like, oh my God, she's only with him for money. Oh my God, she's only about her man. Oh my God, she doesn't do anything else but talk about whoever. That's why. I mean, I've seen Cristiano's wife's Instagram and she posts the family photos too. But I think they're trying to... He's honestly, since he married her, he's been trying to maximize her and blow her up to make her something bigger than what she was. Because he found her in a store. She was a sales girl in a store somewhere in Madrid. And that probably feeds into what I just said too. But I mean, she does post family. What I'm saying is that it's... But that's not what they noticed. I was going to say, there's a marked difference between them. Totally. So are you guys familiar with the concept... Are you familiar with the soft launch? You know what a soft launch is? No. Oh, like the hidden... Yes. So it's like when Instagram girls are on Instagram and they got a new boyfriend, they show the hand or the legs together. Oh, I love a soft launch. Let me tell you something. I'm the soft launch dude. When my homegirls, they're going through like some trouble, whatever. We'll go to Mastro's and just see my fucking hand. I'm the dude doing it. I am petty as a... My name is Petty White. I'm a petty motherfucker. I do that shit all the time. I love a soft launch. Yeah. Okay. I do. Why is that a thing? Why do women not want to show that dude on their Instagram right out the gate? I don't know the majority of what other people would say. Why is it even a thing? But for personal reasons, because... Oh, sorry. I don't know why I'm migrating. Bring it over. I have to pee. That's probably also why. I think for personal reasons, I wouldn't because I know... I'm so done with getting like, in my DMs, you know, woman to woman, I just want to let you know that your man and I, X, Y, and Z. I don't want to know. I saw your man out doing X, Y, and Z. Or, you know, people just know business and throw all of this info your way that you don't need. It's woman to woman if you're a woman. If you're a man, you're a snitch. Or that. But, you know, like, there's just always something. So I think privacy is my personal reason as to why I don't do it. I mean, y'all wouldn't have known I had like three boyfriends in the last few years. You know what I mean? You wouldn't know that. If I looked at your Instagram, would I... There's no soft launch on there. Is there any pictures of you with one of those boyfriends on there? Probably, yeah. Like an ex, maybe, because it was a sponsored post. It's so effective. Because it was a sponsored post. And it was a soft launch sponsored post. It's so effective. I know Jamie's with her boyfriend on hers quite a bit. She's proud of that. She's like, look at this dude. So badly, I once had. I mean, look, like I'm not like I'm very, I'm pretty open. And that's just... I am the same way. Yeah. Yeah. And like, and, you know, to each their own. I mean, I just obviously get I don't care. So I just I put whatever I want out there. In fact, I posted just recently, I lost like 100 followers for doing that. That's exactly what I was getting at. Yeah, I lost 100 followers just recently. The reason why women do soft launches is because they know that their brand will take a hit. If it's if they in any way present the idea that they are taken. So, you know what, let me tell you something. And you lose 100 followers. But I don't care. No, you don't care. Yeah, well, look at that dude you're with. Yeah, let me tell you something. So I was, you know, I dated the guys that people would assume I would date. You know, I was dating an NFL athlete and whoever else. Then I was over it. And I was like, you know what, maybe this is not working. I don't know why. Let me date someone, quote unquote, normal. I dated a teacher, dated a firefighter, posted him, brought him around, you know, my friends and people. He ended up being a groupie. So if anything, he was trying to feed off of what I was doing. Treat her like a celebrity and she'll treat you like a fan. Oh, and he was the one I posted on my social media. Well, you just got him laid. I'm telling you right now. I've been telling my homegirls this all the time. I just called you girl, Michael. I was like, girl. Yeah, you just it's one of these things where it's like, there's one girl I was seeing and there's one girl I was seeing. She had like more than like four million followers. And when I would post her on my shit, it was incredible. I would get girls hitting me up all the time when she would post me in her story. It was just fucking fire and hate. And just like, just how can you be with that guy? Well, mine was empty for the teacher. But for him, I'm sure it was flooded, whatever. You know, I like I kind of noticed something really interesting about like those pictures that it's like, OK, so these are like the top tier guys. He's like the apex. Oh, yeah. Right. And then here they are, like all wifed up, right? With their with their booze like that right there. It's like that to me says like, hey, commitment. Hey, like more than sex. Hey, like I'm giving up like all my access to like what I could have and all others. Yeah. And so that right there, that right there is like a really good like I feel like that's kind of a contradiction to some of the things that you guys know. It's no, it's making those men more attractive. I was going to say, OK, OK, OK. So hold on. So they're only so they're only doing that because this makes me look attractive because I'm with my hot wife. Negative. There is no downside for it. That's the point. I have a hot wife. Therefore, there is no doubt. Whenever whenever I post me with a super hot girl, there is no downside for me. Yeah, it does not. I mean, Instagram is not a funnel marketing system for any of those soccer players, for their wives or their girlfriends, for the soccer player, for the soccer player, for him. The soccer player, he'd like not only because because the women will still talk to a guy. So, OK, so what you guys are saying, just so I understand correctly, like so what you guys are saying that a guy can post a girl doesn't take a hit. None. And so that just helps me. I'm just friends with with Lindsay Palace. When Lindsay posts a picture with me and she's got her arm around me, I get a ton of followers. Yeah, it doesn't hurt me at all. Absolutely not. Like, yeah, definitely. I feel like I the way that I would look at that. And again, I'm not a guy. But the way that I would look at that is I would feel like that, like if I'm operating under that kind of evolutionary psychology mindset, I would feel like that would be a disadvantage if I use that theory that that would take your man or a woman. Remember, if I'm looking at it as a man, I'm saying if I use that theory, I would I would feel like that would take me off the market a little bit. Now, from my experience, you and our friends, from my experience, do you think that when I post videos or pictures with me with a girl, you remember my last relationship, do you think more girls messaged me to go out with me or fewer girls? Yeah, but you weren't in a commitment, though, or anything like that, even if I was in a commitment or not a commitment. Well, I think that those things factor in, at least in my opinion, they do to as far as a girl, whether or not she would. I agree. Some women are like, well, he's married, so I'm not going to. So I will tell you, I will tell you just as many women. It was like, I don't care that he's married or I like him more because he's married. But here's the main thing. Even the women who wouldn't go out with me if I was showing that I was married are still more attracted to me because they see me with an attractive woman. There is zero down. It's literally like having a baby in your arms or a puppy. They make it a reason to walk up to Michael and say, oh, my God, your girlfriend's so beautiful. Tell me more about her. And they're just like trying to be in his gaze. Trying to connect. You want to talk about another double standard? If you have like a single mother, is that a serious disadvantage in the sexual marketplace? A single father is at an advantage in the sexual marketplace because it's proof of concept. Somebody approved of him and he's got the baby and maybe he's a widower or maybe there's nothing better than a good father. There's a guy. Well, you want to know why I hate God, I hate to even use this analogy. You want to know why The Mandalorian was so freaking great a show? Why it was one of the best things that Disney has done? The baby. They don't want a strong, powerful like Jedi Rey female. They want baby Yoda. That's what they want. And so it's like that proof of it's like having that guy who is he. Oh, see, he's proven that he could be a good father. Oh, boy, man. You know, and he's hot and he's on his game. Yeah. OK. And he can wield a lightsaber. OK, fine. That's a perk. He's a protector. All of it. He has a deep voice and then he he cares for the baby. Everybody thought that that Pedro Pascal was so attractive after that shit. Of course, I'm sure. I'm sure it was. But as far as like the the soft launch thing is what I'm what I was getting at. And we can finish up after this. But like the the idea is this is that women will take a hit to their brand if they don't presume if they don't put forth the idea that they are single all the time. So when you have that's why they have a soft launch. That's why there is. Well, I'm going to ease my way into it, because I think on some level of consciousness, like women understand that they're going to take a hit to their every day woman. Sorry. Do everyday women do that as well? you see or is it more so for... Women that are... certainly women that are in... Okay, I've argued this and this is in my fifth book, Player's Handbook, is everything is brand management as Jason Hartman was saying. It's like Instagram is funnel marketing for women in the sexual marketplace which is an economy. So one of the reasons why women are so hesitant to put pictures of other guys on their Instagram is because they know that they will destroy the perception that of attainability. I might be able to get this girl. Or a low body count. They're literally saying the body count on the thing. Like for me, having a high body count does not disqualify me from... You saying some women. I don't... Introduce me to these women because I haven't met them. Or single mothers who don't show their children in their Instagram. For sure. Because they know that that is a disadvantage. I would say right now I know my ex literally never posted me once because it was going to mess up what he had going on. Because he didn't know what he was doing. Honestly, if he had posted... Is that the one that cheated on you? Yes. More women would have... Prosecution arrest, your honor. More women would have come after him had he done it. He just didn't know what he was doing. I've posted all my boyfriends and I don't do any soft launch. Let me ask you something. When you post your boyfriend... If I don't post them... When you post your boyfriends, do you notice any difference in your interaction when you do post your boyfriend? Oh, of course, yeah. It's bad. Nobody cares. Same as when I used to post my family and my dogs and food. Show us your tits. We don't care about your new car. Show me your tits. No one cares. What I was going to say is that especially in the global sexual marketplace and which, like I said, it is an economy, you lose brand capital. Women, anyways, lose brand capital the moment that they present the idea that they might not be single. And so like you got... I can also use the example of Aisha Curry, Steph Curry. She has been on the Red Table Talk with Jada Pinkett Smith talking about how she wants to keep her Instagram and how she wants to she wants to look hot and sexy for other guys and be cute and everything. You are with like a hall of fame, you know, NBA player. When she said that, I cringed a little, but I understood what she was trying to say. You know, she's just being honest. I did cringe a little bit. You just used, what is it, Ciara and Russell Wilson. The funniest shit ever. What's funny about it, you guys? Because, man, she's like, she had a baby with Future. She didn't have a baby with a rapper. She had a baby with like the fucking priest from the fucking, from the Church of Misogyny. Dude, are you kidding me? She had a baby with Future. Ruined. By the way, I'm not saying she's ruined. I'm saying she had to find a guy who's basically ASD to marry. Have you heard the shit that Russell Wilson's been doing? He does high knee exercises going up and down the aisle. Dude, the guy, his teammates do not like him because he comes off as incredibly disingenuous. And I'm just telling you, man, like she had to find a sucker. That's all I'm saying. I don't think he's a sucker at all. Dude, he's like a major football star. Like that guy's not a sucker. I don't think he's been that way since day one. He's a major football star? I don't know about that. That's like us dating, you know, some fuckboys and then getting our sense at the same time he was, you know, there and available. I don't think that she's like looking at him trying to level up. Every time I have been critical of guys who are like, I'm glad somebody got it. I'm glad somebody got it. I was like, oh yeah. Every time I'm critical of guys like say Russell, I've mentioned Russell Wilson on a few podcasts. Every time I'm critical of a guy who is clearly a quote unquote alpha male and I say he's blue pill alpha, look, look at what he's doing. He's definitely, you know, desire. I mean, he's a hall of fame quarterback. Don't get me wrong. Okay. Does that, well, okay. Look at Jeff Bezos, for example, the richest guy in the world. Okay. You could, you could say, well, he's got, he's got all this money, so therefore he must be, he must be alpha Tom Brady, right? Like he must be alpha. Uh, I don't, I'm not, I can't really make a call on Tom just yet, but I can on Russell Wilson because he's what I call a blue pill alpha. He's naturally innately an alpha guy because he's a football, you know what he does for a living. So for me to say, oh, uh, he's kind of, he's kind of blue pill. He's kind of a chump when it comes to, yeah, he's a simp for CR. People go, Hey, he's a quarterback. He's an MPB player, you know, or even Prince Harry is like, they're like, he flew helicopters. He's like emotionally connected and all about her. Like what, what makes him like, I just don't understand. I'll take a simp any day. Yeah. Prioritize, prioritize his family. I mean, I'm just saying the surest way to turn a woman off is to go beta and turn. I know that's right. Listen, if we have to play it, y'all have to play it. So you finesse it. All I'm saying is let's just watch when he gets cut from Denver in the next year. And then Ciara's is all of a sudden now she's dating fucking Gucci. She's dating. All right. So let's talk about this. Cause we, we got kind of got to wrap this up. So let's talk about the, uh, the, uh, elephant in the room, the 12 pound elephant in the room, Tom Brady, who they just, they officially, they officially, uh, filed for the reason why I just found out about that today. People call him skinny. And by the way, just for those of you don't know, when you take HGH, it makes you very skinny. It burns off all the fat on your body. And I will not listen to anyone. Tell me that Tom Brady is not on HGH because he is. Okay. I'm sorry. Oh, he can throw the ball. Oh, it must be. Cause he's vegan. Yeah. He's just chucking about 75 yards now. Cause he's yeah. Yeah. That's it. That must be what it is. All right. So, so here's the thing, um, with the Tom Brady situation. So we talked about this on the, on the last one, uh, Tom Brady is, uh, 60 days older than me. I want to work. I still want to go. I go to work every day. I like going to work. My, my, if my wife told me, Hey man, you know what you can't, you're only making $44 million a year. You got to stop working. Uh, you're, you're washed up. It's time for you to stop doing this. And then you go to work and then you end up winning a super bowl. I, my whole thing is, I think part of the reason they're getting, they're getting divorced or they got divorced. Oh, you got another one of those little rings again. I think the reason why they got divorced is because she doubted him and he, he went and won another super bowl. I think that actually made things worse in the relationship. I think, I think that's a big assumption. I think, I think, I think it made things worse. And then the next year she, she was like, you need to retire. He goes and retires. He comes back and then he leads the league in passing yards. I think what happened from her standpoint was she's like, you're done. You need to be done with this and come raise these kids. He's 44 years old at this point. He's like, you need to come raise these kids. And he's like, no, I want to go back and try this one more time. No, Tom, you're too old to be doing this. You're, you're done. And by the way, she's, she's Brazilian. She's probably used to football players who don't make it to 44 football, like football, soccer players. And then here, Tom Brady, who's playing at like at the high, he is by far the highest level person, like George Blanda, who, who was a good player in the hall of fame was not as good as Tom. Tom Brady's career, just since he's 40 would put him in the hall of fame, just since he turned 40 in the last five years. Why not go be a commentator? Why not go contribute some other way? She would leave him. If you want to be a commentator, she wants to take him and the kids to Central America. That's what, that's the whole thing that's going on here. So my point is this, like, he still wants to work and she's like, well, no, I don't want you to work anymore. I think this is crazy to me. This is absolutely bonkers that like, it is so unfair from my standpoint as a man thinking I'm not allowed to work and I'm not good at my job. Didn't he retire then go back and not tell her twice? No, no, no. He retired twice. That last time he retired, like what? Last week. And then he left for 11 days and talk to his wife about it. He certainly did tell her. And then she filed for divorce after he came back to the Tampa Bay. Right. So how many times do you have to go back on your word in a real way? How many, how many times do you have to give your word because your wife doesn't want you to do what you're great at? What if your son says, dad, I want you home. I want you at my soccer game. Now that's conjecture. And here's the other thing. How many 45 year old men work for a living and they work few, they work way more hours than he does playing quarterback for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. This is not, it's not an 80 hour a week. I think that there's, I think that there's a story here that we don't actually really know. We don't actually really know why they're getting divorced. We don't actually know what the conflict is. Like just a lot of assumptions. We do, we do know it has, we do know it has to do with, with him not retiring. Is that like, is that like kind of, cause I just found out about it today. Is that something that came out where like, she had like a complaint against that and it was like pretty public. She wanted him to retire at 43. He did not retire. She wanted him to retire at 44. By the way, in both cases, he did retire and then came out of retirement. And now at 45, he's come back. And then when he goes to a training camp, then there's an 11 day break where he leaves, gets into a huge fight with her, comes back. And that's when he has the famous, the famous saying that I posted, I got a lot of shit. I'm 45 years old. I got a lot of shit going on. That's what he said. And, uh, and the, and you know what he, he does that. And then all of a sudden she files for divorce after that. Uh, I think it was, you know, not even six months ago. I love how Gronk follows him everywhere he goes. It's like still the frat boy thing. It's pretty funny. The point is, the point is like, I believe that he has the right to continue to make a living at 45. He's not 65. There must be something we don't know. Yeah. I think it's competition. I think she wants all the power. I don't think it's that black and white. It's competition. They, uh, that's why Brady keeps playing. It's like, what else is he going to do? Maybe he doesn't want to be like, it's, there's a qualifiable difference between winning super bowl after super bowl in not just the patch Patriots, but also Tampa Bay as well. And going and doing commentary and talking about the game that you're, that you would rather be playing. No, I disagree. I think if he goes and does commentary, she still believes him. I think she still leaves him. I don't think it is a function of it. It's, it's, it's a, it's a clash of egos is what it is. Well, the number one supermodel highest paid supermodel in the world. She makes more money than he does. And then him. Yeah. As a commentator, she, she, he would probably pass her the deal. No, the deal they had offered him, he was going to make more money that not make more money, but over in total, I think her, her net worth is 600 million and he made 250 million playing football. She, he would eventually pass her that that's essentially what would happen. Like this is, this is pure American drama. No soccer player gets this kind of drama. They all are happily married with beautiful wives and kids. I don't know. And some mistresses, honey, don't we know it? I'm not so sure about that. He hasn't gone off and embarrassed her. Like he is incredibly good at what he does. And I got news for you guys. If Tom Brady 10 years from now runs for president, he'll win. That's the thing. That's who you're dating. That's who you have. You are dating Superman. So now you have, you have a decision to make. What about him? He's married to Gisele Bundchen. What about him? What about her career? What about all of that? I mean, I agree with him on this. I mean, I think he could still he's 45. If I married either one of you guys, please understand. I have a really, I have a really, no, no, I play football. I have a good job. I like my, I like my job. I like to work. I like to be productive. I like this business that I'm building. I like the fact that I'm taking people who work for me and get and getting them generational wealth. What does that normally mean? I think it was about him being his age and still playing football because it's a dangerous sport. Um, I, I honestly, I, I really don't know. I, I, I just literally learned about it today. Like if I actually like kind of digged out a little bit, I might have a better, like under, like, again, a lot of, a lot of skeptulation. Speculation. They both posted. What time is it right now? They both posted statements. If you guys, did you guys see their statements? How she was like, he, she never, well, she called him. Well, he was saying my wife, my wife, she was saying Tom for everything. Yeah. Yeah. That's a, yeah. Language is important. It is right. So let me make another prediction. When this is over, things are, things are going to go in one direction for Tom and a different direction for, for Gisele. I'm just going to make the, I got $20 super chat here. Technological cases. Uh, Tom Brady's wife eventually came to the, uh, came to terms that Tom's Tom Brady is just a hyper ambitious guy. She will never tame. Tom is doing what a man naturally, uh, is, uh, is doing, which is sticking to his guns and never quitting. Uh, you can't change a man. I think it's just a lot of projection, man. Like, like here, like, I keep hearing this narrative that like, like she didn't want him to play or that she's upset at that part. That part is true. That part is, that part is fine, fine. But like, this is not some negative, angry woman kind of like coming against him. Like she, she's been in this with him and supported him throughout, like, God knows how long has he done this. And okay. Okay, fine. And so now she, now let's just say like, she might be like, you know what? I really want to, I really want you to be home with us and the family. And, and, and, and they have probably talked about this and, and maybe he has moved the goal, but it sounds like he has moved the goalpost on her. We're not really giving that much attention. We're just kind of blaming her and being like, Oh, she's not being supportive and wants to, you know, put him down and put his career down. And it's like, well, like, how is he supporting her? Like, I mean, I know we're not supposed to compare or something like that, but I have to kind of like, look at something like that quarterback for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. She can still sell the makeup line. And I don't know, I think she has a, it's not about that. It's about the way she's being presented. It's about the way that she's being presented as unsupportive and negative and not happy for him. That's the part that I have a problem with. And that's the part that I think a lot of people are speculating on. I said it right that time. I don't think, I don't think they're speculating. I think it's pretty undeniable that she does not want him to play football. Look, I'm not saying that she doesn't want him to play. What I'm talking about is her attitude and the way she's being characterized. Not necessarily what, that's what I'm talking about. It's, it's that it's the fact that she's not being supportive. It's like, well, that's bullshit. She supported his career for God knows how long. Okay. So maybe now she doesn't want him to do it, but does that mean she's just like this kind of like angry, upset woman against his career? No, that's not like, and that is what I'm hearing from some of that commentary. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know about her being angry and upset. I do know that she wanted to divorce him. I knew that she wanted to divorce a 44, five-year-old man. It sounds like she's being framed in a way where she's not being supportive. And, and, and that to me is, I feel like that's unfair. I feel like that's a, that's a major assumption. I think that there are a lot of assumptions being made about her attitude and her role in it. When both of these, when, when both Tom and Giselle are making the kind of money they're making and have been for quite some time, what does supportive look like at that point? Well, I think, I think that. How much more support does he have to like? It's not about him supporting her. Like it's, it's not about that. It's about that she's being framed in a way where she's not being supportive of his career because he wants to go off and do this and she wants him to stay home. She's being framed as a way as her not being supportive. Do you think that the divorce has anything to do with him wanting to continue to play? I don't know enough about it. And that's why I'm not, that's why I'm not commenting on that part. That's irrefutable. Yes, that definitely does. Yeah. Fair enough. I don't really know enough about, like, I don't want to comment on it if I don't personally have the knowledge of it. Hey, what I what I am aware of is is what you what you got, you know, she is she is the one that filed. So let's just so fair enough. So she's not happy with some of these things. So fine. Whatever like that's not what I'm really trying to hit. I'm not saying she's holding like the frying pan in the air in the air like Tom come back here so I can hit you. That's not what he's saying. What I am saying is that I think it's very very like within extreme levels of reasonable behavior for a 45 year old man who makes 40 million dollars a year to continue to work. I'm not talking about him or what he's just what he decided to do. I'm not talking about that at all and she does not believe that's within reasonable behavior. So she has divorced him. How do you maybe because they talked about it and agreed upon something especially if this is a second time trying to retire and the second time he came back from retirement didn't really tell her. Yeah, and what if they had what if they had a commitment? What if he had committed her? I feel like what if he was like, you know what I'm going to stay home and then does that and then she finds out this way and she's like, oh fuck it. Okay, and then she works with him through that. And then he does it again. They're not the priority. His family and then she's just like, you know what? I'm not going to do this anymore. And then she's not supportive like get the fuck out of here. She's not the priority. Why would she be supportive any further? Legacy is the priority. That is true. It's true. But like my God it can end here, but it doesn't have to. She can continue. There's another dynamic at play that we're not hearing about. She can continue to chase her pursuits and he can't. That's what that's what's different. You cannot, but she hasn't in 13 years. What's the last project that Giselle has done in a big way? Giselle has makeup and clothing lines. She's just because she's not because that's what a stay-at-home mom does when you have that kind of money and fame. You know what I'm saying is it inherently is not the same thing when he does not stop her from pursuing her designs and he has stopped. She has stopped him. Here's the other thing when he is 65 years old. Guess what? He can't do. He cannot play quarterback for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, but he can do this today and he's not kind of good at now, obviously the last couple weeks. He's been terrible, but it like when the season started he is terrific at his job and that's the that's the only thing I'm saying for what their their decisions were about this thing. I just do. I do think it's a little bit unfair where she can check she can choose to chase her designs on life and he cannot choose to chase his and this he has a finite career and she can continue to sell clothing. She can continue to sell makeup and she can continue to model. He has not stepped in the way of her doing that at all. So Jamie, are they and they weren't an ideal match? Is that what that we're getting here? They pick the wrong girl. Is that what is that what happened inside? No, not necessarily like no, not necessarily like what I'm saying is is that that's why most relationships fail. Okay, like it is and I'm not I'm not like changing my opinion on that. Like I feel like most people do really pick the wrong person now sometimes in relationships. You might find an equal match, right? Let's say that let's say that they would be a pretty equal match, right? That doesn't necessarily mean it was the right person though. Doesn't necessarily mean it was the right person now objectively you could look at that and be like, yeah, like tick tick tick tick tick, but I don't know the inner workings of that relationship. I don't know what the insights were like a lot of women like still choose like it looks right and a lot of women marry right and men do the same thing, but it doesn't mean it is right like so yeah, like I'm still going to kind of go with what I was saying earlier, but there is this other thing that can happen as well and sometimes people do change in relationships. Okay, and that it that does change the course of of the outcome of that relationship and that's not something you're necessarily going to be able to see ahead of time. See here's what I think is happening because it's the same effect that it's a follow-on effect anyways of the thing that the same dynamic that happened with Amber Heard and Johnny Depp. Okay, when they first got I by the way, I've been was covering that since 2014 as like before they got married and I can remember a time where women were just demonizing Johnny Depp saying he's a monster. He's an asshole and when the divorce was going down that was our opinion that he couldn't get work. He couldn't be Jack Sparrow anymore. And then suddenly after we have the the civil suit and the defamation suit now it comes to light that well, actually he's really kind of a blue pill blue pill Alpha. He's a sort of a chump who happened to be, you know, happen to believe in a be very like emotionalist. Let's just say but we wanted to believe we wanted to take Amber Heard effects. Some people are still taking Amber Heard side. There was a court. There's a civil court in the UK that found in her favor and basically just stated that he he beat her with no evidence. They found him guilty. That was that's essentially what happened. It was incredible. I'll show you news articles like you from ABC Australia where they were like, I can't believe anyone would ever support whatever support. What's his name? What can I remember? Johnny Depp and then the trial comes out and he molly whops her. Turns out none of it was true. So I'm the reason I'm bringing this up is because we tend to look when we look at situations like this. We look at it from a female specific perspective at right away. That's the same thing that happened when Jeff Bezos and Mackenzie Bezos got divorced. The first thing out of any woman's mouth was well, she deserves that money. Whatever she's going to get. They didn't even know what the settlement was going to be at that time. It was 33 billion dollars. And of course Jeff Bezos like, hey, yeah, right. 33 billion with a B billion dollars and she is became the fifth richest woman in the world as a result of that divorce. The reason why women wanted to say, well, she deserves that because she was there from the beginning and she helped him get Amazon off the ground and blah blah. And I said, well, if she were to take all of her holdings and all the money that she has and all of the the equity that she had in Amazon and pulled it out of Amazon, it would in no way amount to 33 billion dollars. That is a divorce settlement. So the first thing we think of is, well, she deserves it. She went through hell. She, you know, it was there must have been some reason why she filed for divorce. 70 to 80% of divorces are filed by women. There is a reason for that. And of course, the first thing out of any woman's mouth is, well, the guy must have been a dick. There must have been something that was wrong with him. There must have been some abuse. There must be. He must not have held up his end of the bargain, whatever else. When in fact, statistically, most marriages don't last longer than five. If they're going to get divorced, it usually ends between five and nine years. And usually, as I said before, between the ages of like 29 and like, you know, it was average age of first marriage for men is like about 30 years old for women. It's about 28. Just enough time to squeeze out a squeeze out a baby and get back into the sexual market once again. And we see that across the board historically since 1960. It is always been that as a as a schema. Let's just say so when we look at when I bring this back to Tom and Giselle right now, there are yes. There are probably reasons behind all of this, but I think that there are a lot more visceral and have probably less to do with like emotions and less to do with like less to do with I think it's more logistical reasons. I think it's more pragmatic practical reasons on her part because she's at the point right now where he's probably going to retire. It's I don't know when when he's he might not make it through this whole year. He might not even be able to play. So now is the time to go. And if you go and you look at marriages in the NFL and in professional sports, usually when that guy retires, that's when they go through their first divorce right there. I listen. I'm saying what I'm saying is we're married and I cheat on you. You want to leave me? I understand if I hit you for sure, leave me if I do some other crazy shit, leave me if I if I if I end up going to jail, I get it. Leave me if I end up throwing 49 touchdowns and six interceptions. Just give me a shot. That's all I'm saying. Just let me let me let me throw some more touchdowns. That's all I'm saying. I was like Brett Favre kept trying to go back into like he couldn't give it up like and that I mean again, another Hall of Fame quarterback and probably should have retired in at Green Bay, but kept going back to it because he wanted that last ring. He wanted to get he doesn't know anything about football in his entire life. Yeah, that says it. Let me read these real quick and then we'll get out of here. Technological chaos is trying to change Tom or hyper ambitious persons to change core personality is like trying to convince a bear to change its pursuit to hunt lesson for all people. Let's stop trying to pursue on reengineering people. I that reminds me of a quote. I want to say it's like it's not Aristotle's Aristophanes or something. It's like the wisest of men will not have the wisest of men know not to teach a crab to try to keep teach a crab to walk straight. I don't know where that is. It always because that's that's the nature of the animal. Terrell says Leonardo DiCaprio is Giselle's Alpha not Brady. Very funny. Maybe I yeah, I doubt it. I mean you but just imagine what he is saying. He is single now. Tell me what do you what do you think it was like for Giselle when she wasn't that famous? I'm gonna have to wrap up. I'm so tired. Yeah. Yeah, we're gonna kill it. What do you think it was like for Giselle though for real like to imagine you're not that famous and you are dating Leonardo DiCaprio. I know we joke about it now, but it probably was a pretty big imprint on her life. I'm just saying, you know, I'm saying anyway, let's wrap. We're good. Where can we find more of you?
