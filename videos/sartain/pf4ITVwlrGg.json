That isn't where you met your balance boyfriend. Really? It wasn't through day game cold approach at the mall. It was through a common fucking friend mo a mentoring calm I have a question. This is always something that I wanted to know. So you just mentioned the current guy that you're dating now Jordan is it was introduced you to by a common friend. Yes, the previous boyfriend before that. How'd you meet him? Oh Oh God What gig was it Just through social media, so Instagram, yes. Okay. What'd you meet your last boyfriend last? Did you have somebody you said you were just out there hiking he's bumped into him damn Yeah, okay But no one introduced you there was no comment You had a conference did you have the person before that that you dated how'd you meet him? Before that Okay, well, okay, um, it was also through the same friend the same friend awesome stuff How'd you meet the guy you're with now? Um at what you guys work together? Yeah, so lots of common friends Yeah, yeah, and then the guy before that what you mean? Um, I threw a mutual friend and then he slid in through my DMS Yeah, cuz he was living in LA. So then we were just friends the whole time. I think I met him I think I'm in the previous guy to one time Yeah, and don't want the last guy the guy you're with or were with where'd you meet him? They're friends and then before that Okay, so so you're guys saying it wasn't through fucking day game cold approach at the mall That isn't where you met your balance boyfriend or tender. Really? It wasn't through day game cold approach at the mall It was through a common fucking friend mo a mentoring calm mo a mentoring Oh my god, bro, it's so crazy You guys wonder like what so the thing is That's what I'm known for is like I build social circles for people and they always wonder where I came up with this or like This is some ancillary thing and like no Every girl that I talked to that's beautiful tells me the exact same thing that you I knew what your answers were gonna be I knew it was all gonna be either one of you was gonna say Instagram and the rest of you were gonna say Fucking through a common friend and they all all these guys are like no, dude. I do hardcore cold approach a girl I just go up to random girls at the fucking mall Like it's just so crazy to me when I hear this shit and they sell products They literally sell fucking products trying to teach guys that this is how they're gonna meet women and I've been telling them for fucking 15 Years, this is utter nonsense. It doesn't work that your percentages are so fucking low I'm not saying you can't ever walk up to a girl My point is it's a lot better when your guys are at an event where you have common friends There's this like sort of like as men. We don't need comfort to have sex I'm not afraid if I had sex with anybody that they're gonna fucking hurt me Although I there's a few times what they did. They're like and I mean physically drain your bank account. Yeah I'm bigger than the women. I'm not worried for women You guys literally have comfort that you have that you feel need to feel a certain level of comfort Towards a man before you have sex with them part of you doing that the first time has to do with common friends letting You know, hey, he's not that big of a fucking weirdo You know I'm saying or he's dated other girls and guess what? They were also pretty which means he's capable of dating a pretty girl, which means it's probably gonna be normal Does that make sense right for you guys? It makes sense. It is so crazy. Even in 2022 I still have this argument with dudes. They still think that know what I teach is like nonsense No get all these girls just said The last eight of them seven of them said I was I met somebody through a common thing now I do want to bring this up. Oh, yeah, I got a point, but go ahead Oh, you want to bring this up? You were dating a co-worker and that's something we talked about frequently How did how does that work? Um, I mean so at the time I was actually with my ex Yeah, I you know when I'm with somebody I don't even look anybody So when you started at wet that first week when I saw you at what you were with your ex and then yeah And then what happened was we just kind of like had a common We both love music and that's pretty much like we would talk about the whole time it's like hey invite me to shows like as a friend and stuff like that and Then eventually when I got single we had we always had great conversations great chemistry And then finally I was like, you know Because I found out he liked me so and then that's pretty much what happened Well, you just went out with him as friends That's crazy. And he when you guys were going out as friends that he act like a friend or was he constantly hitting? No, he was very respectful Now what I want to point one thing out here though So each one of you have said the last like person that you've been with has been you met through friends That's like exceptionally rare right now Because when you look at the stats the number one way that that men and women meet of course is online through tinderhinge mumble that Kind of stuff what's what's been on the decline is meeting your your your next boyfriend Maybe your husband via the church through your family through your friends through school through work All that's been on the decline really since about 2010 and then the one thing that's been spiking of course has been online dating All right. So Here's hear me. I think that here's a here's a theory for you. Tell me if I'm wrong about this The the higher the level of attractiveness of the woman the more likely it is that she will meet that guy through Friends as opposed to like the more average woman is going to be the one that is going to be on tinder That's gonna be that's gonna make those hookups on there. Do you do you think that's more time? Do you think that's plausible? Well, so so more elite level women like let's just say very attractive women don't meet men through They may meet them through friends clearly exactly Rather than rather than the average woman who is Statistically meeting the guys that they're with through tinder. So I don't think the average one meets guys who tinder I really don't I still think It's through Average, I think the average girl meets guys through social media through the internet We were to count Facebook and Instagram together number one It's ten times more than it would be bumble hinder bumble tinder and hinge together I think Instagram alone would be ten times more just when you look at like the none of those three None of those three dating apps have a billion active users and Instagram has two billion I don't think so that so let me so let me clarify Why am I making this theory here is because what I think is a lot of guys see those stats and they see that The average woman is meeting the average guy online And so what I have found out is through like very attractive women say well He had the balls to come up and actually approach me He had the balls to actually say hey, well, let's go be friends. Go go see a show or something together Yeah, actually and that right now I think is like what's what's called playing to the meta, right? Everybody else is doing like tinder and hinge or mumble and it'd be so nice Look, I would just have that, you know getting a sack up and like, you know Ask me out on a date kind of thing it that becomes novel Yeah, you know most of the guys that I dated I told them to fuck off so many times, but they were consistent Oh, yeah persistent. So I liked that. I was like, okay. I've I've told you to fuck off. You're still around I'll give you a shot. Yeah, it's like good. I always say Mm-hmm when it comes to men, it's like if you want me come and get me right like make it known Yeah, that's some alpha shit. Yeah, you want me coming? That's I was gonna say that's the number one thing Are you saying that or he's saying that no Sure, you got it Yeah, but there is still a minimum level of like height physical attractiveness like a level of charisma that he has to me There's one thing because girls leave these fucking weird signals that really throw dudes off when they're like, yeah I just care that he treats me Well, it's okay if he has a dad bod and and then I look at who you date and I'm like no that linebacker You're dating doesn't have a dad bod It's really frustrating for you, it's really frustrating you understand how frustrating is \", \"segments\": [{\"id\": 0, \"seek\": 0, \"start\": 0.0, \"end\": 5.28000020980835, \"text\": \" Fucking day game cold approach at the mall.
