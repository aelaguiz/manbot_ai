For men, it's like four. David Buss and Sidney Meston write a book. They're both professors at UT Austin. They write a book called Why Women Have Sex. In the book, they survey, I think, I want to say 17,000 women. Just a small sample size, right? There are 17,000 women, right? And in doing so, they come up with, it's anonymous reporting, which actually, by the way, is more accurate. It's anonymous reporting. Of course. Because you're more likely to tell the truth if you're anonymous. The girls straight up were like, I'm a whore. I fucked all these dudes. They were very honest about it. In the book, they found 237 reasons why women claim that they had sex with men, which really means it's infinite reasons. For men, it's like four. They were joking. If we wrote a book called Why Women Have Sex. Big titties, fat ass. She's pretty pretty. I was drunk. That was it. Dr. Buss said if we wrote a book called Why Men Have Sex, it would be a pamphlet. We wrote a book called Why Women Have Sex. It's a 600-page book. Anyway, great book. I highly recommend people read it. So what were the common reasons of the 237? There's no common reasons. Here's the funny thing. It's because there weren't common reasons is the reason you can be short and balding and still date hot women because there's other reasons. And the thing is, for men, it's what's called negative kurtosis. I'm sorry. For women, it's called negative kurtosis, meaning there's more things under the standard deviation of reasons to be attracted. And for men, it's narrow. It's positive kurtosis. So it's just like Margot Robbie in Wolf of Wall Street. Everyone thought she was hot. Nobody was like, well, Margot Robbie is not that. She's not my type. Everyone thought Margot Robbie was hot in that movie. You know what? Women, straight women thought she was hot in that movie because we can objectively look and see signs of facial symmetry and signs of youth. Very clearly she was attracted. But if you were to say, is Post Malone hot? A lot of girls would be like, well, he acts very feminine and he has tattoos on his face. So no, I don't think Post Malone's hot at all. But then you'd ask, OK, what about Chris Hamesworth? And a lot of girls are like, oh my God, he's so hot. And then you talk to some other girls like, yeah, I don't like white guys. Or I don't like he's too big, too big. There's these weird things that happen where you and I would see a guy who's like a male stripper, like 6'3\\\", good looking Australian guy with an accent. And you'd be like, oh my God, this guy slays. But then you're going to see women that are like, yeah, I'm not into dudes who let that into their looks. Whereas we as men don't have that whole thing. So because there are so many different reasons, there's such a divergence of reasons why women are attracted. That means black pill isn't real. That means the whole concept behind isn't real. What happens is the middle of the standard deviation is looks, money, status. So yes, do most women prefer taller guys to shorter ones? Yes. Better looking guys to ugly guys? Yes. Richer guys to poor guys? Yes. Most. Not even most, but this middle part of the standard, plus and minus one sigma. Outside of that, though, I have consistently seen guys get girls. Again, the extreme examples would be like Jeff Bezos. But like other examples where guys become famous actors, guitarists, performers, they become incredible public speakers. I'll just tell you right now, Graham Stephan is not a tall guy. He lives here. Graham Stephan is dating a very, very attractive woman. This is not uncommon. I have another buddy of mine. He's a real estate agent here. He's a bit chunky, a bit overweight. And the dude is dating a 10. Why is it? And you'd say, well, is it because of money? He's like, no, I don't even take care of her. The reason why is because this man shows ambition and competency, which makes him attractive to women. That whole thing is so antithetical to black pill. I know nothing about black pill other than that. I mean, I know about it other than the fact that they're just like, woe is me. Women, I hate women because I don't get any pussy. And, you know, it's I should be feel entitled to whatever I want, but it's not it's unfair. It's I guess it's the essence of victim mentality. Yes. They're like, but the beautiful thing as a man and Tate talks about this when we did our interview is like you're born as a clean slate. Yes. And you can make whatever you want out of your life happen. That's the beauty of being a man who cares if you're short, if you're fat, if you're bald, whatever, it's like you can make money, you can go to the gym, you can learn, you can read, you can consume content, you can network, you can socialize. There's so many other things you can do to improve your status in life. And that should be encouraging for most men. This is essentially what you talk about in MOA. I watched an hour of your call yesterday. Yeah. Right. And I was like, all right. And me, I'm thinking, all right, cool. Like the one kid, he's kind of quiet. He should probably talk more. All right, cool. One kid, you're like, dude, you're like, you're at a 23, like go to a one, you know what I'm talking about? It's like way too nerdy, but like you can improve your stature and your status in life as a man. And you know, you're, I'm sure you're very familiar with this, the sexual market value charts that Rolo talks about, right? Not the chart where the age, but like the pie chart where, you know, women, what they look for in a man, essentially reaffirming what you were saying is that it's money, it's resources, and it's sort of an equal distribution of looks, status, personality, game, all that. Whereas what men look for in a woman, it's 80% beauty, 80%. And then there's 10% that is age and age is basically part of beauty. Body count. So like, that's one thing. So the 37 culture study that David Buss did, the first time he did it in 89, where they went through all these 37 cultures and they have nothing to do with each other. They like, some of them were, had no Western radio, television, film magazines, nothing, no connection to like, so you'd have one people that lived in the Amazon and another group of people lived in Papaya, New Guinea, nothing, nothing to do with each other. Void of any sort of. Communication whatsoever. Whatsoever, got it. Proving, proving, not cultural, proving this wasn't cultural. They said, all of them said women, men were more interested in casual sex than women. Obviously for a man, we're not confused by this. All of them said that men in every one of these cultures, men were more interested in a woman's body count than women being interested in a man's body count. And all of these, there were a few cultures, like for instance, like Norway, they didn't care at all about a woman's virginity in China. They did care, but they still, men still did care more than women cared. And in several of those cultures, when a man was a virgin in his mid twenties, that was an awkward, weird thing for That was actually a low status symbol for a man. That was the Steve Carell version of some Indian African tribe or whatever. That's exactly right. So the thing is, but what does that, what is that unassailable proof of? That these things are genetic. They are not cultural. The most singular, most offensive thing about that book behind me, evolutionary psychology, is the concept that there are these things that are genetic and not cultural, because what does that do? The people on the right don't like the idea of natural selection and the people on the left don't like the idea of gender roles, which is why this whole thing gets pushed into this narrow place. And you don't see other than Gad said, who's pretty, pretty far white ring. Most of these guys kind of stay in the middle as far as politics, politics are concerned. Satoshi Kanazawa, who's an evolutionary psychologist. He produced one study showing that African-American women have a harder time on dating apps than, than white women do. And it was just, he was just showing the numbers and was totally canceled, lost his tenure, was kicked out for saying something that was actually true. It was crazy. Where was his tenure? Oh, I forgot where he was before, but now he's in London. And I asked him to come on the podcast and he's like, dude, I love your podcast, but it's like, I can't come on. I was like, I'm going to get canceled. And it was canceled because of what? Because he posted a study basically saying that, that because of your, your, uh, basically the study basically showed that African-American men actually have it easiest on dating apps and African-American women have it the hardest. And by showing these numbers, it got him into a lot of trouble. Yeah. He's that's the exact opposite of what a DEI score is looking for these days. Yeah. Yeah. \", \"segments\": [{\"id\": 0, \"seek\": 0, \"start\": 0.0, \"end\": 5.519999980926514, \"text\": \" In the book, they found 237 reasons why women claim that they had sex with men, which really\", \"tokens\": [50364, 682, 264, 1446, 11, 436, 1352, 6673, 22, 4112, 983, 2266, 3932, 300, 436, 632, 3260, 365, 1706, 11, 597, 534, 50640], \"temperature\": 0.0, \"avg_logprob\": -0.29602915048599243, \"compression_ratio\": 1.6279863119125366, \"no_speech_prob\": 0.00037114304723218083}, {\"id\": 1, \"seek\": 0, \"start\": 5.519999980926514, \"end\": 10.319999694824219, \"text\": \" means it's infinite reasons.
