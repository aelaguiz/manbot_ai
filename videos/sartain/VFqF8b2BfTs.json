Let's talk about the jawline and the beard, right? So you've talked about, you know, your beard, beard transplants, the things you did before with the minoxidil, and there were other techniques that you had, and then there are exercises for your jaw. Yeah. So I never really did a lot of exercises specifically for my jawline. I think most people, if they decrease their body fat percentage enough, their jawline is going to show and it's going to look better. And of course the beard emphasizes the jaw, but I know guys that did the jawline thing and it worked for them. I personally never took it that far to do jawline exercises specifically. And I think you should first focus on decreasing the body fat percentage before even, you know, yeah. The body fat percentage is so important. Have you ever, I don't know if you've had this experience. I've had people that I know that have put on 50 pounds of fat, either, you know, some traumatic thing happened or childbirth or something. And then their, their neurology changes. Like they start thinking different. They start saying crazy shit. I just don't think people understand how being in shape actually makes you smarter. I know it sounds crazy to some people, but there's a great book by Daniel Perlmutter called Grain Brain, where it goes over excessive amounts of gluten, actually creating plaque on the brain and leading to early onset Alzheimer's. I'm just wondering if you've noticed anything like that too, like you actually can think better when you're in better shape. I've got a lot of people coming to me just because they wanted to lose body fat or they want to gain muscle. And after six months, you know, after the journey, after losing the belly fat and everything, that's when they realize, oh, I came to you just to lose the belly fat and to get shredded. But it ended up improving my business. Like it ended up like my business improved so much, like even in terms of dating, their dating life, like improved, of course. So that happens with a lot of guys. Like if you're an entrepreneur trying to make like, let's say, seven figures a year, a million a year, and your body is not optimized, like your body fat percentage is higher and everything, it's like a car, like with a flat tire trying to win a race. It doesn't make sense because like it's not just about the fat. It's about your hormones. Like it's not going to increase your estrogen levels. It's going to decrease your testosterone. Like overall, you're not going to be a machine that's functioning properly like this. So even if you don't care about the looks at all, and you just care about your business, you just care about making money, even then like getting your body fat percentage down is going to help with that greatly. Yeah. Do you have any other looks maxing tips when it comes to skincare, hair, stuff like that? Yeah. So I think a lot of guys overlook reducing stress levels. And that's something that I actively...I think nowadays like there's too much on social media like hustle culture and this and that. And you know, like, go wake up at 3am and like all of this bullshit. Like, I think you should optimize your life not just in one area, right? I think you should optimize your life amongst all areas, right? And one of them is my experience spirituality, like becoming more mindful in the moment, like become more present. And that in and of itself, it's going to make you glow more. It's going to make your hair stay in your 30s and 40s. And it's going to make you look better overall. Because there's, you know, skincare routines and this and that. But if you don't have the stress levels in place, that's going to screw up everything, the acne, the hair. I noticed it myself, like periods of my life when I was like really stressed, maybe there was like some stuff happening like with the business or this or that. I noticed my hair getting thinner. And then like when I myself in a period of time where I'm calm, I get like my hair is like thicker, you know, like now, for example, for the past couple of months. Bro, I've been here in Brazil, like I'm calm like a cucumber, like business is going smooth, dating, like, just life feels good. Like, yeah, you know, you go to the beach. And it's like, I see it on my body, I feel it on my body, like you feel it on your face on your hair. Yeah. So it's like a reflection of how you set up your life and overall your stress levels. Yeah, reduction of stress. That's actually, that's really smart. That's good. I think I believe it's either Alex Costa or FedEx Fearless, who said something similar to me, but I think that's really important to understand. \", \"segments\": [{\"id\": 0, \"seek\": 0, \"start\": 0.0, \"end\": 4.480000019073486, \"text\": \" if you're an entrepreneur trying to make like, let's say seven figures a year, a million a year,\", \"tokens\": [50364, 498, 291, 434, 364, 14307, 1382, 281, 652, 411, 11, 718, 311, 584, 3407, 9624, 257, 1064, 11, 257, 2459, 257, 1064, 11, 50588], \"temperature\": 0.0, \"avg_logprob\": -0.2529795467853546, \"compression_ratio\": 1.76691734790802, \"no_speech_prob\": 0.00186730467248708}, {\"id\": 1, \"seek\": 0, \"start\": 5.199999809265137, \"end\": 10.15999984741211, \"text\": \" and your body's not optimized, like your body fat percentage is higher and everything,\", \"tokens\": [50624, 293, 428, 1772, 311, 406, 26941, 11, 411, 428, 1772, 4046, 9668, 307, 2946, 293, 1203, 11, 50872], \"temperature\": 0.0, \"avg_logprob\": -0.2529795467853546, \"compression_ratio\": 1.76691734790802, \"no_speech_prob\": 0.00186730467248708}, {\"id\": 2, \"seek\": 0, \"start\": 10.15999984741211, \"end\": 16.079999923706055, \"text\": \" it's like a car like with a flat tire trying to win a race.
