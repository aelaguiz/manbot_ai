I'm very, very excited to have my next guest on here. When I started this podcast, one of the coolest things I never thought I'd get to do was interview some of my favorite authors. And I've had the ability to do that recently. This man right here, he's got almost 200,000 subscribers on YouTube. In 2013, he wrote a book called The Rational Male, which was very, very controversial and changed a lot of people's lives. It's a great debate about this book. Also, preventative medicine, positive masculinity and religion, three following subsequent Rational Male books. In April, he just released The Player's Handbook, and he is known as the godfather of Red Pill. And we're very, very happy to have him here, Mr. Rollo Tomasi. How you doing today, sir, man? Thank you, thanks for having me on, man. This is great. Awesome, all right. So let's start off. So a lot of my audience might not be familiar with what it is that you do. Let's start off with the idea of Red Pill. Wouldn't you say the godfather of Red Pill, what that means? Going all the way back to remedial. Sure, yeah, yeah, we gotta go back to the fundamentals. Whenever I'm on a new show, I'm always having to run back through the template of what I have to talk about. I started writing in what would become the Manosphere, or what we call the Manosphere right now. Back in 2002, really, I was part of the forum community, the seduction forum communities back then. Now, was I a pickup artist? No. Was I a dating coach? No. I was just a keen observer at that time, and I was also studying psychology. I also happened to be in, I was at UNR at the time. So I was studying psychology, and I was just fascinated by the mystery method, and I was fascinated by the early pickup artists, of the very, like the proto-Manosphere, proto-Red Pill kind of thing. And I saw a lot of parallels, I think, to what I was studying in behaviorism at that time. And I would have probably got more into evolutionary psychology at that moment, had it been offered at that time. Like I was, it really wasn't a hot field at that time. Isn't one of the strangest things, like 40 years completely ignored? Yeah. Like really, like one of the most testable models of psychology that's ever existed. Right. And just the majority of universities, I have a friend of mine, he's a professor at an Ivy League school. I won't say which one, because I'm going to get him in trouble. But he's like, if I talk about evolutionary psychology here, I'm going to get buried. And so that is really interesting, because behaviorism is the thing that's pushed a lot of times. Yeah, and now it's much more in vogue, really, with like Dr. David Buss. But these guys were quoting guys like Matt Ridley from the Red Queen. Of course. They were quoting Dawkins, of course. They were quoting a lot of the people who were doing the research at that time. You got to remember, during that period, during like the early to mid-2000s, things weren't as woke as they are now. So actually doing research and studies of that nature wasn't something that was, you were worried about getting funding for, or worrying about whether or not it was going to get published in a peer-reviewed journal of some sort. There's another component. Back then, it was just dudes trying to help each other. Yeah, just comparing notes. Yeah, it was just comparing notes. There wasn't a sales funnel, right? There wasn't the mass email blast, and there wasn't the say these seven words to fuck this stripper bullshit that came later, let's say post-2005, that's what happened. Again, when you're talking about a manosphere and we're talking about pickup, there is pickup and then there's pickup. There's pickup and then there's what ended up as the car crash that happened a couple of years ago. There's what I call, okay, so there's pickup and there's game, and so, well, we'll probably discuss game a little bit. So anyways, I'm in those forums. I'm having these conversations all the time. I also happen to work in casino marketing at that point. Later on, I would get into wine and spirits and the liquor industry as a result. So not only am I going to these forums and having these conversations, like I said, comparing notes with guys all over the world. It's the first time in history that men were able to get together semi-anonymously and be able to say, here's what's happening in South Africa. Here's what's happening in Mumbai. Here's what's happening in Paducah, Kentucky, right? Here's what's going on. And so, of course, guys being guys, they're like, okay, let's compare notes and see what are some consistencies here. And so the conversations that were going on in the seduction community at that time were actually, I consider it the earliest research for intersexual dynamics because they were doing, they were field testing ideas and theories that you couldn't do in a laboratory and you sure as shit couldn't get it from, get research people to do the kinds of, to go out and run game because it was unethical for them to do that. So I was in that community from 2002 until about 2011 and that's when I started my blog, The Rational Male. And everybody said, you need to turn this into a blog. We need you, we really need your voice out there. And so I became one of the first three R's of the Manosphere which was Rolo, Royce, and Roosh. And both of those, I'm the last remaining R, I guess, of the Manosphere now. But that's when the blog years started. So we went from forums to blogs and that's when things, the social media started to ramp up and that's when you started seeing all of these courses and knowledge products and it was no longer a DVD and a seminar, it was take my teachable course. And so it sort of scaled up from there. It was a dude who spent 17 hours with mystery, started a course like a week later and then all of a sudden he's teaching this shit and I meet the guy and I'm scared as shit when I'm talking to him, like who is this dude? Yeah, it was back then. It draws a certain element. And the other thing, let me say something, back in 05, and I've never been a pickup coach but I'd met a lot of these guys living in Los Angeles and I just remember being like, these guys don't hate women, they don't hate women. There are dudes in this community who do hate women but at this point, this was not what's going on. It's a fraction of 1%, I would say, from my experience in the Manosphere. So anyway, so then there's the blog years. So now we're in 2011 up to about 2013 and I had so many people asking me to put all of these essays into some sort of compendium, some kind of book. And then I went through the process of going back through, okay, if I was gonna write a book, only one book ever, what would it look like? And so I went through all my backlog of essays and all the conversations I'd had for really up to that point, about 10 or 12 years. And I'm like, okay, this will go, this will go, this will go. And then in 2013, I published The Rational Mail which was based on the essays and the conversations that we had over the course of about 12 years. And then I had to become an author like overnight because I had to actually turn essays and blog posts and what really amounted to forum posts into something that's intelligible in a book form. And so I put that out there. I thought that The Rational Mail was gonna be the only book I would ever write. So yes, I know that the print in the print book is very small. I thought I would cram as much crap into it as I possibly could back in 2013 because I thought that that was the only, I was gonna shoot my load on that one book. Well, turns out that that ended up becoming the Bible of the man is for what The Red Pill is right now. And that's the, it's what everybody refers back to. If you look at guys like Kevin Samuels, if you look at guys like Andrew Tate, if you even, even Justin, pretty much anybody who's been admiring from fresh and fit. It's either, you know, quoting out of that book or it's a derivative of that, or it's constant. I'm not saying that they haven't taken it and built upon that, they have, because that's what we do as human beings, right? But it's, that was the starting point was right there. And so then I produced Preventive Medicine, which was a timeline for what men can expect from women throughout their, you know, their lives and stuff through phases of maturity. Simply because I had so many guys come to me and say, Rola, we really need a book because I wish I would have known then what I know now. So I wouldn't have made those stupid mistakes back in the day. And so that's what's prompted. I really think Preventive Medicine is kind of like the sleeper hit of all five of them. And then I did Positive Masculinity because I had people asking me, I've got kids, I've got sons, I don't want them to fall into the same pitfalls that I did. When's the best time to introduce my, you know, my 12 year old, 15 year old, 18 year old son to the rational male? Like I will slow down. So then I wrote Positive Masculinity, which was really like the first two thirds of that book is about red pill parenting. For lack of a better term, you know, like in, you know, in understanding intersexual dynamics and understanding the social nature. And then so it's scaled up from there. Religion was for guys who prompted me to reconsider, like thinking, okay, well, I'm a Muslim. I am an evangelical Christian. I don't believe in premarital sex. Everything I read in the rational male is 100% true, but how do I apply that? Or how do I sort of process that as a person who has religious convictions and I'm not going to have sex before marriage? Okay, that's what's prompted the very first part of the religion side of things. And then it snowballed from there into what religion is. And then most recently I did the Player's Handbook because I had so, I took three years by the way, to write religion because I had to be bulletproof. Of course, everything I did in that, it is the most sources cited book I've ever done. And so I had to be absolutely just dead nuts accurate on that one. And then right about the time that I published that, they're like, well, what's the best book on game? And I'm like, oh God. And so, and I didn't have an answer except for maybe like some of the guys that I know, like Troy Francis or James Tusk or some of the people that are sort of running my peer group. And I'm like, but there's not really a textbook for like understanding the principles behind why a neg hit is a thing. Why do these things work from a psychological perspective? So it's not a how to do it. It's why those things work kind of book. So one of the best books I've ever read on game is called How to Win Friends and Influence People. I love that book. That book has actually helped me so much. It's Napoleon Hill, right? No, that's Think and Grow Rich. That's another great one. How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie. That's fantastic parts in there about, because I do believe like your ability with intersexual dynamics, it does relate very much to my ability as a businessman, my ability to network in general, my ability to show status because status is status is status. And that's one thing. It's like, it's not just one thing I've noticed is it's not just the women who noticed the status, it's the men too. And so that's just a really interesting dichotomy when I read that book and just related it to my life and changed a bunch of things. Well, it's, and that's, you've just made a really good definition, I think, or good illustration, I think, of the difference between PUA, pickup artistry and game. So in, if you read the very first introduction of the player's handbook, I mentioned this, that everyone has game. Everyone you know has game. That nine-year-old kid in grammar school has game. If you go and ask Johnny, Johnny, what's the best way to get Susie to like you? He has a very complex, comprehensive idea of like, hey, I'll carry her books home for you, treat her right, I respect women. You'll hear a nine-year-old boy say, I respect women because their moms or single moms told them that, right? They have a concept of what, how to go from single and sexless to being like, to becoming intimate with a woman kind of thing. Now, not at nine years old, it's like, how do I be nice and how do I get her to like me? Whereas everybody has a certain degree of game. How effective that game is, is really where we have to draw the line because it's based on bad data. Think about the statement, though, that it makes that, from an evolutionary standpoint, that every guy you know has a theory about some, like, every guy I know does not have a theory about making chocolate chip cookies. Every guy I know does not have a theory about how to kick a soccer ball, but every guy I know, every single one, men that have no experience with women whatsoever, every one of them has, can tell me a dot, just 15 paragraphs on exactly how to get women. And it's just very interesting. Whether or not it works or not, the fact that we all seem to, as a species, it seems to be a ubiquitous thing. It's an existential imperative. For sure, it must be an imperative. If, as a species, it's so ubiquitous amongst men. And here's another thing that I thought was really funny. So my course, Men of Action, we just talk about, you know, improvement. And there's a few women in my course, but it's mostly men. And in the course, one of the things that I noticed, I was looking at the other day and I had to like, I was on Zoom and I could see 50 people at once. And the diversity, like the Indian men, the Chinese men, like there was no necessity on my part to make my course diverse. It is the most diverse group of people I've ever been around. Because this is ubiquitous amongst 23 chromosome homo sapiens, this is ubiquitous amongst us. This is not a thing. This is not, for any of you who believe this, this is not a cultural fucking phenomenon. My heterosexuality is not cultural. My belief, my desire to date women is not cultural. It is fucking genetic. And then- It is not a social construct. It is not a social construct. It is something that, and it can't be, again, I had Jen Rufo on here a couple of weeks ago. Huge controversy, some of the stuff she said, like evolve and just learn to be cucked. And I was like, and I was just trying to explain to Jen, it's like, because it's really funny. Jen likes to, she's a swinger, but she's not bisexual. She does not like having sex with women. She likes having sex with multiple men at the same time. And I was like, so you don't want to have sex with women, right? It's like, you understand you were born like this, just like I was born heterosexual. So you can't tell me that I'm going to evolve to enjoy. And then my second part was, from an evolutionary standpoint, how would it make sense for me as a caveman to watch my woman be with some other dude? From a genetic standpoint, this is suicide, right? And then from her standpoint, it's like, no, we can evolve. And I'm like, we, there is what is and what ought. We can't evolve. Again, once homo sapiens become the apex predator, the selection pressure is over. That's why people with, thank God for it, type two diabetes can live. That's why we have people with motor neuron disorder who can end up having children. That's why the trope about the woman who's overweight who lives in the trailer park has 17 kids. It is not a function of like things that would have killed her in an ancestral environment. Don't kill her anymore. And they don't exist. Right, so when people are like, are we smarter or dumber? We're both, there's 8 billion of us. There's 8 billion humans and 400,000 elephants on the fucking planet. We won. There is no selection pressure, which is why idiocracy, you remember the movie, as we move closer and closer to this like average, where the average becomes dumber and dumber, of course, because why would humans have a necessity to get smarter or stronger or in better shape or better financially if there's no selection pressure to do so? You don't die if you're poor. You can still have fucking kids and live below poverty. So of course there's no selection pressure. So that's the reason why I'm sorry to get way off topic. No, no, no, no, no, that's fine. No, it's like, see, this is why I wanted to, come on here. This is like a socioeconomic commentary, but people are always like, how can we evolve? No, there is, this is a real controversial statement. There is no more evolution for Homo sapiens. There's no, as far as natural selection is concerned, because selection is over. You will have children with whoever you want. You can live to be a hundred and have multiple. multiple medical disorders that would have killed you not even a hundred years ago. Even the very fact that you brush your teeth increases your life. Of course dude how about the fact that dental health has contributed to the lifespan you know like something as simple as a freaking toothbrush right like that that contributes there's there's so many factors that go into that. Yeah. What you just described to me is something I actually I think I started out in the introduction of religion where I said we're at a point right now in really kind of with the rise of social media but I kind of peg it right around year 2000 when the rise of the internet and we had this inner connectivity where we can be on YouTube and we can you know broadcast to God knows how many people or we can talk to more and more people like in a global sense so we're disseminating these ideas and we're disseminating memes and we're dissem and I don't mean like memes like the cute cat videos I mean like you know like ideas. You know people don't know that's what memes mean. Yeah exactly. They don't even know that's what memes mean. I know they don't know what memetics are but the very fact that we can broadcast ideas now on a global scale is we've never been able to do that in in human history right and so the what I the way I I looked at it now is all of the things that were prior to like the 20th century like way of thinking the old order way of thinking versus like 21st century what we're seeing now is because we have access to all this new information we can like a guy like me I don't have a degree in evolutionary biology I have a degree in five a bachelor's of fine arts and have a bachelor's of behavioral psychology that's it okay so I can but I can still have access to all of the research data of Marty Hazleton of David Buss of gangsta I mean all the people who I quote or who I'm using as sort of influences for like connecting dots everybody can do that anyone online can do exactly what I've done it's just you have to have the interest and you have to be I'm just good at articulating it I'm good at connecting those dots there but what's happening now is we have this old order belief set or these older memes that were founded on dead ideas that were that were based on bad information or no information so it's our information that was relevant during a time period right we had sort of sort of like again the idea of one-to-one monogamy when I live on a farm and my survival is dependent on my family some of those rules made sense go hunt kill or you're not going to eat or have multiple children with this woman and stay together no matter what fucking stay together no matter what or those kind of things they made sense back then right because that's what we and then again using religion in order as the basis for our monogamy of course we have to say things like soulmate and believe those things that you say I think there was a point like for instance like feudalism that doesn't make sense now we'd be like feudalism that's incredibly neo-feudalism is becoming right we say that's cruel to have a monarch and all this kind of stuff but back then we didn't have the internet you had to have some centralized form of control so what I'm saying is well I agree with you we didn't have antibiotics back then survival was very difficult so I do think that some of these ideas are outdated I don't know if they were wrong back at the time but they're definitely outdated they need to be updated exactly else be updated I was good so what I was saying is that we have we have four generations we got the boomer generation Gen X we've got Millennials and we've got these zoomers now the Gen Z right so so from about four generations long we have generations who have been sort of in the 20th century versus in the 21st century so in the 21st century we have access to data and education and and you know just a research and everything that really conflict with the old order way of things how we think like men and women ought to get together how we ought to do politics how we ought to do religion I mean just think of any theater of human of human endeavor now we can go well is that really right and now we're having this conversation on a global scale that we're not ready for as human beings like that's why people hate each other because they either hate Trump or they you like you know Hillary or some shit like that I mean like people family members hate each other because of Facebook or you know Twitter what's not you said this I can't believe you well it's because of that access to this new access to data now in no other arena well you were just bringing this up and no other arena are we more invested than in reproduction yes we want to guys want to get laid surprise ladies guys actually want to get laid and so how are we gonna do that I have access to all this new information I've got this form right here we can compare notes what about this what about that how about we go out and we field test this stuff and so what you're seeing I think anyways is you're seeing this old emotionalism and this old emotional investment in the way we think things ought to be they should be versus how things are yeah and so in every goddamn debate I've ever been in with Ruslan or whoever else you know the one thing I try to stick to is the fact that I don't deal in shoulds I deal in is you get to deal with whatever the shoulds are you can decide what's the best practices for you but when you say something like you know we need to evolve past our our jealousy instinct and we need to eroticize our jealousy instinct so we can be cocked or we can have a you know these were promiscuous animals and like I don't know what her name was but like you will make up these like really emotionally invested like rationales as to why this really ought to be and they go no and you go and you look at the data and you can see that in in societies where there is like polyamory polygamy there's way more violence in those societies so I've got the data here that kind of confounds that but if you're really emotionally invested to the point where it's part of your personality you're good that's when you get those real online conflicts that that may be right for you if you believe that as far as the cuckolding thing that that may be right for you but the point is like what you said before I'll give a great example the thing that you talk about where sexual market value peak for women being at 23 and for men being around 38 that's not I had heard that from you but I'd also read dataclism dataclism talks and shows irrefutable unassailable proof that what you said is true separate to that so if you have a problem with this idea when women are 29 and they hear that what we roll of Tomasi said that it was 23 years old when you're at your cell 23 to 25 and my whole thing is like no you're not arguing with roll Tomas you're arguing with statistics that that if you're offended by that you're offended by the truth and if the truth is ugly to you then it's ugly if I'm an oncologist and I study cancer that doesn't mean I condone cancer it doesn't mean I don't condone cancer I deal with the fact that it is the way that it is and so that is one of the ugly truths that whole situation I get that all the time I get that from like guys like Chris Williamson and some of these dudes who would they I don't know maybe I've got a fan club or something on on their channel but they constantly try to get me on with Chris Williamson and Chris has been on his show and he's you know he's interviewed guys like David Buss he's interviewed guys like you know Jordan Peterson and everything and I'm there essentially delivering the same kind of information from the same research that they're quoting from yeah but it's cool if they're on it's not cool if Rolo's on because Rolo seems like he's going to connect the dots in a way that's going to alienate 50% of his audience right and it's just it's basically who's good who's the messenger right now so when Tate goes and delivers the same kind of message that I do you know he's it blows up the internet it's it's still the same information it's not the delivery it's the actual data that you can't process because it conflicts with your ego and that's you know so funny about Andrew so so okay we're gonna talk about it so I you know I was that bikini competition right and so I would tell girls I'll be like the conversation would turn to Andrew Tatum's like you guys know I know Andrew like we've been because we were texting way before he before he was famous we were going back and forth because we were gonna plan out him coming on a podcast and we text back and forth like oh you don't know Andrew and the same girls would be like I hate Andrew would be like can we send him a message yes it was so funny like do you have his do you have you know I hate Andrew Tate do you have his number do you can I can I call him real quick you can ask Andrew I would send him these messages be me and these girls and the girls would be like asking him questions it is really funny how that whole that whole dynamic work we'll get to Andrew here in a little bit but I do want to talk about this central tenet okay the tenet of hypergamy and that statement by Sheryl Sandberg about day yeah yeah yeah yeah oh yeah and lean in yeah lean in man you have read my yeah thank you for reading my book son of a bitch somebody who's actually read for sure I person it's very little very little that offends me that statement that she made was offensive to me the idea that I am supposed to like you are as a woman supposed to sell your wild oats go have fun with the bartender and the male stripper and then which is fine do that if you want yeah but then at the end I'm supposed to wait for you oh yeah when you're when you're done with the male stripper my job as as your later on male your boyfriend your husband or whatever your provider is I'm supposed to wait for you to be done with the male stripper and then thank you it's my turn now and as a man choosing again that's why I think David Allen currently chose the title the beta male revolution that's what he's talking about as a man I don't want to wait for you to be done with the male stripper I would rather be with someone who didn't choose the male stripper in the first place does that make sense yeah yeah yeah well and that's what gosh there's so much that goes along with that there's a you you have to throw in the alpha widow dynamic for sure that and you also have to throw in the war brides dynamic into that as well yes and those of course are in the first book as but no you what you're what you're what you're referencing is the Ross and Rachel gambit and if you ever watched that episode of friends where Ross and Rachel breaking up because Rachel says oh Ross you're the perfect boyfriend just not now and they're like I don't know in their early 20s I guess we're supposed to presume that but let's make it let's make a deal if we're 30 and we're both single then we'll get married when we're you know and we haven't found anybody else will you know you'll be my consolation prize and the laugh track explodes and if you watch friends with the red pill lens in 2022 it's like a horror show and you're seeing all these things happening remember what I said is in the 20th century or the old order way of thinking we laughed that was that was a hit show that was funny as hell you know it's you know Jennifer Aniston and David Schwimmer going at it right but now we look at that we go oh my god you know what guy would sign up for for essentially his own cucking right at that I mean in logistically cucking right and it was funny then because we were just sort of getting a ramping up into this idea that women needed to have a ho phase right not my words I said party fit party years in my book but it's the ho phase where it's like you're gonna go and explore your options and have your journey of self-discovery and then right around 29 years old 30 31 that's what I peg as the epiphany phase and that's when women want to get right with God and that's when they want to like settle down and they want to have you know to 2.5 kids and a golden retriever in the yard and that's when you'll hear women say we're all the good guys we're all the nice guys but they were left back in your 20s when you didn't want to sort of put a bet on a guy who had some potential and now you're kind of ass out at 33 34 as far as your selection is concerned meanwhile men at about 30 are on their ascent to their sexual market value peak because it takes longer for a man to achieve the things that makes him maximally attractive and maximally arousing so the guy might have if he's played his cards right and he's maximized his potential by the time he gets to about 36 years old that's when he is the at his peak sexual market value and has if he's done everything done everything right you know money muscles in game he has the same selection or if not better selection than the girl who's 23 years old who was on top of her game and then can you talk about so supply and demand curve you talk about as a woman you believe as a woman comes to that realization and a man is becoming more and more attractive this is where the supply and demand curve hit and around 29 is when you see most first marriages yes it's exactly and so if you look at the age of first marriage in the United States and even in like the UK and Western European countries it's even later than that we are delaying marriage like further and further into our 30s and women I think it's like 50% of women in the UK are having aren't having a kid until after 30 years old which is net like they track these things again we have access to that data schmuck like me can go and figure out what that data is I don't have to be a demographer to do that but so I can quote those stats but when you look at divorce rates when you look at marriage rates when you look at fertility rates everything is sort of this downstream effect of this idea that well I'm gonna play the field a little bit longer I'm gonna wait for the one I'm gonna wait for you know for women anyways it's like it's not about your career it's about you can't you're spoiled for choice right it's the it's the choice paradox in a global sexual marketplace women have believed the perception believe that they have more choice than they actually do so I think you got you covered this with Justin at some point I I talked about in my books the difference between say the local sexual marketplace and the global sexual yeah everything is globalizing currencies are globalizing you know nations are becoming a little you know the national lines are becoming less blurred we have an international economy everything's becoming globalized why wouldn't the sexual marketplace be globalized as well so when we look at how we used to date back in the day before we had the internet before we had cell phones you women were sort of you know stuck with whatever their local sexual marketplace was in whatever town they happen to be born in whatever high school they went to whatever college they went to and that was their their you know most immediate circle of local people that they had to select from as a pool of suitors and that was that now every woman has Instagram every woman has access to Tinder Hinge Bumble seeking arrangements if you can't find your soulmate in you know you know Reno Nevada then you maybe you can find that guy in you know Dubai maybe you can find him in you know Tokyo so I have a term for this is called the Jojo von Sothee effect there's a girl that I grew up that was in the military her name was Jojo von Sothee she was from Wichita Kansas and for those of you who are on Instagram you might know who Jojo is Jojo and I were friends when she was 19 nobody knew who she was when she was 19 she was working at Hooters in Wichita then one day she gets called out to go to Los Angeles and she blows up she ends up in on a bunch of magazines this European magazine publishes her she is the first woman I know to hit a million followers on Instagram this is a decade ago Jojo von Sothee was supposed to like destined if this was 1985 to marry the guy who owns the car dealership in Wichita or to marry the doctor or the dentist in Wichita instead she's at Bilzerian's house with me literally standing between Machine Gun Kelly and fucking Logan Paul and her and I are looking around like holy shit look at this life that we create where we are yeah she was there is no middle class anymore the Jojo von Sothee's are now sucked out of Wichita or Des Moines or wherever and they're they're at the Playboy mansion that was the thing that that changed the whole dynamic is that all of a sudden everyone is discovered now everyone has access and these men who are despots there's no limit like there's no point where it's like you know what I've fucked enough women I'm gonna stop messaging hot girls on IG it It never stops. It never, there is always room on their roster for more. Always. And you just see, like I remember sitting next to a girl and seeing a message from Champagne Poppy, fucking Drake, dude, next to her. And I was like, God damn, dude, Drake? Like, Drake, bro. It doesn't matter. And she didn't go off with him, but I just remember thinking, Drake? Fucking Drake? I gotta deal with Drake, bro. This is fucked up. This is your competition? This is my competition. What the fuck? Like, this is crazy, right? Yeah. Have you, and let me say one other thing. I have some of the most fun nights of my life in hot tubs, in fucking Jamaica, in Mexico, with some of the wildest women. Shout out to Mike Tang. Shout out to Mike Tang. He's at Paradise Challenge. Yeah, yeah, yeah, Paradise Challenge. Some of the wildest women I've ever met in my life. And I love them as friends, and I don't judge them for their behavior. But I also know I don't want to marry them, right? So this is the thing. Like, for every action, there's an equal opposite reaction. I know that because I host two of the biggest bikini competitions in the world, there's a lot of women who don't want to date me. I understand there's a consequence for my behavior. Well, for some women, they're like, well, you know, I did all this wild stuff, and I did porn, and I shoot Guy Girl OF, and all this kind of stuff, and I have a bunch of money. And I don't judge you for doing that. But when later on, you have trouble finding someone who wants to marry you, please understand these things are correlated. And I'm not, I don't hate you, and I'm not judging you, but I am telling you, this is going to be a difficult thing that you're going to have to deal with. Do you understand? Just like if I take steroids my whole life, and all of a sudden my liver and kidney fail, it's not, I don't blame the doctor. It was my fault for doing this, right? Go ahead. All I can say is that's a conversation we've had. I actually, I think I did a whole episode with Myron and Fresh about female promiscuity and why your sexual past matters, even more so in the digital age, because every one of us, I can't just point this out at women as well, every one of us has a digital footprint. So ladies, what's your digital footprint? Is it OnlyFans? Is it amateur porn? Is it, you know, is it like catfishing guys on Instagram? Is it just like you doing like yacht parties that you put on your Instagram that your potential, you know, new husband is gonna have to consider when he's like really trying to figure out whether or not he wants to get with you or not. And so there's this digital footprint, and there's downstream effects from that, that I don't think we're, again, we're in this, we're in the new frontier, man. It's the wild fucking west here. And so when you point out and you say, ladies, there's going to be results, there's going to be consequences, there's gonna be, you know, accountability for him. They're not Rolo's consequences. They don't want it to be. They want to blame it on you. They want to say you're insecure for pointing that out to me over and over and over again, when in fact it's true, but the fact that you even like have a question about it makes you an insecure man. Could you imagine pushing someone off a balcony and then charging Isaac Newton with murder? Like that's essentially what's going on. I'm not judging you. I'm just telling you this is gravity. That's essentially your, there's a physical reaction that's going to happen. Have you seen the Netflix show, Sex Life? Have you heard about this? Yeah, I did a full episode on it when it first came out. I was stunned they even made that show. And the ending of it was like, holy fuck. How did we get away with this? Just right in your face like, I love my husband. Where's that man with the big dick? I'm going to go fuck him at the end of the movie. This is not going to change anything about my marriage. Now, fuck me. That's what he says at the end of the movie. The last line of the movie. Bro, this shit was crazy. What did you think about that? I got a copyright strike for putting that on my channel. Really? Actually, yes. But yeah, it's what I refer to as open hypergamy. I picked up on this right around 2014 with the Sheryl Sandberg quote. I call it Sandbergian hypergamy, but what it is is this open embracing of women's evolved sexual strategy, mating strategy, which is hypergamy. Alpha fucks, beta bucks. They're looking for the best of the best, but they also have to remember it's dual. So they're looking for the hot guy in the foam cannon party. They're looking for the guy who's built and looks like Jason Momoa, who they really want to fuck. But that guy's not always the dude who is good at protection, provisioning, and parental investment. So it's the classic cads versus dads. And so that's the natural way of things. Now again, in the 20th century, women, it was in their best interests to keep that hush hush so that men, so that they could have more selection. So if it didn't work out with Ross, maybe she could go bang Joey, right? That was the sort of, okay ladies, keep it down. So when we used to call gold diggers gold diggers, gold diggers are just like, it's like all women are opportunistic in their mating strategies. The gold diggers are just the ones that were open and overt about it. They were just the ones who said, you know what, it is what it is. I want to get with the rich guy, and that's who I am. The reason why even women hate gold diggers is because they're giving up the game. Now in 2014, no one cares about giving up the game. In fact, I hope you have a good hoe phase. We got, you know, shit, we got what, Cardi B talking about getting what you can get and essentially talking and popularizing in popular media what amounts to hypergamy. And guys, if you have a problem with that, you're an insecure dude and you're not high value enough to fuck a girl like me. It's just like, again, I like Cardi B, I like her music, but she says fuck them, then I get the money. And first off, Cardi B, you got it backwards. You get the money first, you don't fuck them. Anyway, but the whole thing was like, when you hear that, and she's like joking about, yeah, when I was a stripper, I used to drug my clients. Roll my clients. And roll my clients and then rob them. And it was like, yeah, Cardi B, women empowerment. And I was confused, bro. By the way, I'm also confused when I see Machine Gun Kelly wearing pink dresses dating Megan Fox. I know a lot of dudes who want to date Megan Fox. What is the lesson I'm supposed to take out of the pink dresses and the hair that he, like, I don't know if Machine Gun Kelly is homosexual or not. What I do know is that he wants us to think he is. So I don't know what the fuck to think about this. And I'm very, and it's very confusing for me. He's a dandy. There you go. But I will tell you this, Roland, 25 years, I've been dating for 20, I'm 45 years old. In 25 years, I have never had an easier time dating more beautiful women than this point in my life. And it might be because I'm in Las Vegas. And it might be because I have a pretty cool podcast. But I really do think. And everybody in the chat's gonna say, he's jacked. He's a natural, fuck this guy. But I actually think it has more to do with my competition, which I don't feel like I have any. When I talk to, because I do have a lot of female friends. We're gonna get into that discussion. And I'm always asking them, like, why did you like this dude? What caused you? How long was it before you met this guy and you slept with him? I'm always asking these academic questions to these women. And when I do, I listen to them. And I just realize, I just see men qualifying themselves. I see men doing these things that are clearly wrong. And it's just very interesting to me. I feel like I have no competition now. I actually, the female imperative order that you were talking about before, I have found it personally, selfishly, to be an advantage for me. You can leverage it. Yeah, I have found it selfishly. For guys who can leverage it, and guys have the knowledge of the sexual marketplace and have a good understanding of male nature, with female nature and intersexual dynamics, man, it's never been a better time. Especially now in the internet. And even if there's something you don't know, you can go and get the information and figure it out. It's the truth. And you can network like hell now, too. Again, even that gets globalized. I would never have been on this show or even known you had I not known Justin Waller, had I not known Fresh and Fit, had I not known Robert Kiyosaki, had I not known, I wouldn't even be talking to Miguel over here. It's incredible. So yeah, one of Andrew's people reaches out to me. Then me and Andrew start texting. And then Andrew recommends I have Justin on. Then Justin comes on and then recommends you. And then Walter from Fresh and Fit, he messages me to come on there. So you're right. It's the globalization, the way to connect it. And I learned that from a guy named Dan Fleischman. I don't know if you know who Dan is. I'm gonna introduce you to him at some point. Dan Fleischman is like, he pays, he has a company where he gets brand deals for influencers. So those girls, when they make 300 grand a month or whatever, a lot of them are coming from brand deals. He's the one who sets up those brand deals. So his parties are insane. It's every big IG girl you can ever imagine. And they're all there just lined up. It's pretty amazing. You know, real quick, just real quick, because I'm also live casting this to my stream. Can you introduce to my audience what it is you do? Because I'm sure people are like, who the fuck is this dude? For sure. So for me, probably the thing I'm most known for is I host, for like the last 10 years, I've hosted the Maxim parties. I'm the red carpet host for the Maxim parties, for the Babes in Toyland charity events. I'm also the host for Smash Global. I'm also the host for the Model Citizen Fund. But the other thing is that I host the two biggest bikini competitions in the world, which is the Playboy Presents, Yandy Summer Search, and Swimsuit USA. I also host Miss Brazil USA. And then I used to host the Rehab Bikini Invitational with Crystal Hefner, Hugh Hefner's wife. And then I hosted the Dre Swimsuit Showcase. So basically, I am a recruiter for bikini competitions and pageants, and I'm also the host. I also, I work at a hedge fund. I was a military officer for seven years. I flew a KC-135. I fought in Iraq and Afghanistan. And then I started about, I've been coaching for 14 years. I started a professional program two years ago called the Men of Action Mentoring Program. And it was, for me, it was like, I didn't want to teach a pickup course, because it really wasn't, I don't really believe in pickup. But what I wanted was, how can I make these men the most attractive versions of themselves? And how can I teach them the leadership qualities that Jocko Willett and David Goggins talk about? And then also, the entrepreneurship section. So my Men of Action Program is social networking, entrepreneurship, leadership, and mindset. And then we also go heavy into evolutionary psychology, which one of the funny things is when I had Bulzerian on here. That's why I like what you do. Yeah, exactly. Because you stay based and grounded. For sure. Like nuts and bolts. For sure. When I had Bulzerian on here, it's really interesting, because his book, The Setup, I use it in my course, because I agree with everything he said. And it was funny, because we never had a discussion about any of this. Especially like, you know, meet as many women as you can, don't hit on any of them. Don't hit on any of them. Again, women are attracted to you because of your status, not because of your intent. And it was very difficult for a lot of guys, because pickup teaches intent. They don't teach status. They say, stay in your mom's basement and trick a woman into sleeping with you. Whereas the status studies, like true social, but by the way, pickup artists say they coach social circle. I don't know any pickup artists who really do social circle. I can only think of one who was, I think it was, was it Papa? I forget the guy, the guy from RSD who was teaching that. He's the only one I've ever. Oh, Nicco. Yeah, Nicco. I've never heard anybody else say that. But I will say this also, by the way. I cannot believe we're still having a conversation in 2022 about Mystery, or Neil Strauss, or like Owen Cook, or Julian Blanc, or any of these guys who are like sort of the classic pickup artists of the mid 2000s. Because when we're talking about game today, it's like no one is teaching like old school PUA anymore. There's still some guys that do it. Well, I mean, yeah, the grifters certainly are still trying to, you know, hanging on to the loose ends there. But when I refer to game, I don't talk in terms of like, say, pickup artistry. I talk about the social skills that are applied to that. Because I think PUA developed and evolved. If you move from like just aping behaviors into why does this work and how can I internalize this? And why am I such a nerd? How am I gonna be able to interact and present myself in a better way? How am I gonna change my mind about myself? That develops into game in a practical sense. And so I think one of the, I've heard you talk about this with Justin on here. If your impression of like a guy who teaches game or a dating coach looks like Mystery from 2005 with the freaking, you know, feather boa, the top hat, and the elevator boots, and the black nail polish, if that's your image of a guy who teaches game or is a dating coach, you are, that was 2005, man. That was 17 fucking years ago, okay? That is a lifetime ago. And we still use that as sort of this caricature of, well, I don't wanna have anything to do with PUA. And then I, because I hold Justin's feet to the fire on this occasionally, it's like, it's the same stuff you're saying is stuff that the PUA's figured out way back in the day. You just think it's more legit because it's like gentlemen game or it's like, I'm authentic and I do this anyways. Well, they're aping that behavior already way back in 2002 and maybe they were inauthentic when they did that, but the behavior is still the behavior. So the way I'd like to explain it is if, for those of you who watch soccer, you know, European football, the inbound, right? The inbound is a skill that you need, but it's not all of soccer. Cold approach is a skill that you need. Cold approach is taught as if it is game. Cold approach is 2% of, let me say it one more time. Two, yeah. Go ahead. If that. Send the hate my way. Go ahead and send the hate my way. Cold approach is 2% of game. It is like, I'm really good at shooting free throws. Shooting free throws is not an NBA basketball team. Get cold approaches. One is 2% of game. Social circle, which includes social media, is 98% of game. If we want to talk about being attractive as a man, my ability to break rapport, my ability to connect with other people, my ability to lead a room, my ability to be charismatic, my ability to connect to other people, my ability to take what I do and project it on social media to be ostentatious or not ostentatious or to project a certain image on social media, these are actually the major parts of game. When I talk about the three things that Pickup got wrong, number one, the main thing was social media. They fucking completely missed the boat. Yes. Because I personally think this. I think a lot of pickup coaches knew their clients were weird and did not want their clients on social media exposing their weirdness. It's churn marketing. Exactly. In the churn. The second thing I think they got wrong was logistics. I do not want to teach you how to meet women from your mom's basement. I want to teach you to start a seven figure business so we leave your mom's basement. Get out there. And the third thing that was the female teammates, the teammates, having women introduce me to women, pre-selection. It's just one of these things where it's like, whenever I talk to pickup artists, they're like, let's remove the obstacle. The obstacle. That obstacle is the reason she's going to go home with you. The obstacle is the one who's got driving. Obstacle is the way, right? She's driving the fucking car. There's no obstacle with me, bro. They're all gonna love me by the end of the night. That's the way I want to be. And if nothing happens between us, I still want to know you. Dude, you know how many beautiful women I meet sometimes and they're like, I can tell they're not interested. That's fine. Do you want to come on the podcast? You have 4 million followers. Fuck yes, I'm gonna have you on the podcast. Crystal, this is one of my favorite ones. Crystal Hefner is Hugh Hefner's wife. Her and I hosted a bikini competition back in like 2014, 15, 16. When we hosted the bikini competition, she would be like, we would text each other memes, funny memes. And she'd be like, hey Michael, do you want to come to the Playboy Mansion for Midsummer Night's Dream? Fuck yes I do. Pickup artists would be like, why didn't you game her? Hugh Hefner's wife, motherfucker. Hugh Hefner's wife. Bro, whatever you, Crystal, whatever you, I love Crystal. Shout out to Crystal Hefner. She's a beautiful, wonderful, charitable woman. A fucking incredible woman. And she would invite me to the Playboy Mansion. Of course I'm gonna be fucking friends with her, bro. Of course, this woman is high status. Do you know, I have a friend of mine, Toy Hardy. Shout out to Toy, her birthday's on Sunday. This woman has introduced me to so many billionaires. Billionaires, bro. Of course, this ability to connect. But we treat women like they're the enemy. And I don't, I love them, man. I love being in a hot tub with 12 women at the same time. Women make life beautiful. Women make life worth living. I get that constantly. Andrew does too, he made a big deal out of this. Everybody thinks Andrew is like this misogynistic, you know, fuck wit, right? And I'm like, no, he would not be doing what he was doing if he was truly a misogynist, if he was truly hate women. Men who truly hate women aren't online. Men who truly hate women aren't going, oh man, she fucked me over. Because they care, they're outcome dependent on that rejection, right? And so, I've been doing this for about 20 years. I have met a handful of guys who I would say are genuine misogynists, but the reason why we keep saying like, oh, those guys are incels, those guys are misogynists, because it's the easiest 20th century definition that we can give to a guy who women wouldn't wanna fuck. And so, when I get called a misogynist, it's usually because I'm connecting dots or I'm asking uncomfortable questions and that they think they don't have any counter argument to those things, so the next thing out of their mouths is who hurt you, right? Or what was your growing up like? Then they wanna turn into armchair psychologists at that point to reframe the debate at that point because they don't have a comeback to the data or the connections or the correlations that I'm making from the data. And then, it's like, well, only an incel would have that question. Only a misogynist would try to connect the dots that you're connecting right now. And it's like, no, the data is what the data is. What do you think about that? And when it conflicts with their belief sets and it conflicts with their convictions, that's when you get, there's no other recourse but to turn you into an incel. By the way, there's no such thing as an incel, an involuntary celibate. In 2022, if you wanna get laid, you can get laid. Come to this state, come to Fly Into Reno, Fly Into Reno, I'll take you to Moundhouse, Nevada. You give me, let's see, a finder's fee. So, I'll get 700 bucks, I'll take 200, and I will get you laid. You wanna have a threesome? No problem, I will teach you brothel game in Reno, Nevada. 100% user satisfaction guaranteed. Brothel game. Bro, have you seen these dudes who go to South America? You can get laid in the 21st century. Have you seen these guys who go to South America or Central America or someplace in Eastern Europe and they start talking about their harem of girls that they got? And I'm like, bro, it's a, what is it, sexual arbitrage or whatever? I don't really, I'm sorry, man, I don't blame you. I don't wanna go too far in that, but that whole thing is just kinda strange to me. Let's talk about this. My two favorite quotes that you have, ready? There's two of them. Well, actually, there's a third one. I'll get to that in a second, but the first one is women make rules for betas and break rules for alphas. Now, I'm gonna tell you this. If you find that to be offensive, I won't even debate this with you. This is absolutely, unassailably, irrevocably true. I cannot tell you how many times I meet a woman who says, I am going to make men wait five dates to have sex with me and go and have sex with their ex or go have sex with some male stripper or fucking VIP host that they met or some bartender the first night. It is absolutely irrevocably true. Can you talk about this and how it fits in my program? Absolutely, I can. So, there's like kinda three parts to this. The first one is my iron rule of Tomasi number three, which is any woman that makes you wait for sex, the sex is never worth the wait. Now, that is not about, you know, push for a same night lay. That has nothing to do with it. It has everything to do with what I call the desire dynamic. Genuine desire. Own your soul fresh. Own your soul genuine desire, right? And what it comes down to is I don't want, and I don't think men should, okay, here's, we're gonna deal with the prescription. I don't think that men should want to have sex with a woman who doesn't wanna have sex with him or has some sort of mitigating factor in there. Like, well, if you jump through these hoops, then maybe I'll fuck you, right? That's not, first of all, on a woman's part, it's contrived and it becomes an obligation, right? I always say this is you cannot negotiate genuine desire. And when you do negotiate genuine desire, whether it's with the girl that you met in the club or it's your wife at marriage counseling, when you're negotiating genuine desire, the only thing that comes out of that is obligated compliance. It's not like I really wanna fuck you. It's, oh, I owe you a fuck. That's what it comes down to. That's what that rule is really about is genuine desire and getting to that point so that you're not wasting your time with women who are less than 100% interested in you, which then comes back to the quote you're saying, which is women will make rules and make more rules even for beta males and then break rules for alpha males. And the reason why I say that is because that woman will be so into you and want you so badly with genuine desire that she'll be like, I'll call in late. I'll call in sick to work today to come and see you, right? Because that's how invested and how interested I am in having sex with you or getting you, like getting into your world. Receiving your validation. Yeah, it doesn't even necessarily have to be like sex per se. It's just like, I wanna be in this guy's frame. I wanna live in this guy's world. I love this guy. I wanna bang this guy. I wanna have his babies. I think it was, what is it? I forget what her name is. It's Ryan Gosling. And who was the other, who was the chick that was with him? Somebody in the chat will give it to me. I forget the name of the actress. Emma Stone? No, it's not Emma Stone. It's somebody give it to me. Somebody give it to me. No, it was Ryan Gosling. And who's she with right now? I think they just got married. Anyway, she was saying she didn't wanna have kids with anybody. She had no kids, no children at all. And then she met Ryan Gosling and she's like, but I wanna have his babies. I wanna have his, sorry, there it is. Eva Mendes. Okay, perfect. Eva Mendes, Ryan Gosling. She didn't wanna have kids, but she wanted to have Ryan Gosling's children. That's what I'm fucking talking about. So when it's like, I'm going to break my rule of not having kids, but you're worth breaking that rule for. So that's what comes down. So, you know, Bulzerian lives here. And one of the main things that women tell me right before they sleep with Bulzerian, you wanna know what they tell me? There's no way I'm gonna sleep with Bulzerian. It's the same thing with Vegas Dave. Dude, I can't tell you how many times, me and Vegas Dave used to hang out like 2013, 2014. I would always hear these girls be like, I would never fucking sleep with Vegas Dave. And they would sleep with, it was like, they would literally make, whenever I hear a woman make these rules, my first thought is something in you, first of all, you already broke this rule. At some point in the previous path, there's no reason to have, we don't have speeding rules unless people crash from speeding. You didn't make this rule about the sleeping on the third date unless you slept with someone on the first. And then the second thing is what you're saying, you're emphatically saying this to me to prove this to me or yourself, but it's not real. And I just, how many times I hear women say, I'm not going back to this guy and they go back to him. And I'm like, no, you're telling me the rule that you made because you got hurt by this guy who was cheating on you. And you're going to try to follow that rule with other men, but not him. Because the opportunity to get with you and hopefully, well, first of all, have sex with you. And then second of all, lock you down in the foreseeable, you catch feelings for her. That is more of an imperative than anything else. If you're high, high value guys, trust me, nobody flakes on Drake. Nobody flakes on high value rock stars or high value athletes. They're like, I'll be right over. Because it's whatever your motivation is. And if that guy is confirmedly high value, pre-selected, social proof, has fame, by order of degree, now, not everybody has that, right? But by order of degree up that sort of hierarchy of getting to the top of the top, you know, apex fame, that's going to motivate genuine desire in women to break rules rather than like make more rules for betas. And the, I want to ask you one question though, because I'm going to put you, I'm going to ask you the question that everybody asks me, but as far as the beta side of this, and this is where people get stuck. It's real easy to see why women would break the rule for an alpha guy. Why would they make rules for a beta guy? Okay, well, the reason why they do that is because women have to convince themselves that they really want to, maybe this guy could work out, maybe I want to get with him if he did these things. So when we talk about hypergamy, if you have a woman who's like a six and you have a guy who's like a six, right? That is like a lateral move for, like hypergamy never seeks its own level. It always wants something a little bit better, a little bit better than that. However, if that guy's a six and she's a six, just figuratively speaking, that guy better have some value added that makes him worth being with rather than seeking the seven or the eight or the nine that's above him and wanting to get with that one guy. So he better be rich as fuck, or he better have make her laugh, or he better like in some way have some sort of emotional connection or financial connection or whatever it is that has value added to that guy. So it's not just a lateral move. Now she's going to get with that guy, but that's where the rule making comes into play. When women make rules for guys, it's usually in the epiphany phase. It's like, well, I can't lock down Chad, so I'll get with this guy over, with Brad over here. And he seems like he'd be a good father and he really, you know, but he's not as fun. He's not as exciting. He's not as spontaneous as the guy that I met in Cancun in the foam cannon party. But I can't lock him down, but he's kind of, he'll be good if he can convince me that he can do these things. That convince me, that qualify to me, that's where the rule making comes into play for women because they have to say, does he have value added? And I have to confirm that value added by making sure that he's going to jump through these hoops for me to see if he's really into me. Whereas she would never do that for the guy who was opportunistically, she would bang in Cancun on spring break because he was a bit, he was an eight, whereas Brad's only a six and he better, you know, better have something else going for him besides that. Or he made himself scarce or he made himself seem high value or whatever reason. Perceptually, he was high value. So Chad made himself seem scarce and Brad made himself- Perception's everything, by the way, too. So it doesn't, you know, the guy, the hot guy in the foam cannon party could be just as much a dickhead as Brad. I've literally been to foam cannon parties and watched people hook up in foam cannon parties. That's why I wanted to come on your show. Literally watch it at my, like I have the crazy- This is the hot guy in the foam cannon party. The craziest stories I've ever seen. There was one time I had the microphone and I'm like doing play by play. It's like, and Jill is going down on some guy over here. I was remembering that we were in Jamaica where that was hilarious. Let me ask you this question though. Okay, so when I get, when I'm on shows and I get interviewed about like the, you know, third, the Iron Rule of Tomasi number three. Yeah. They always say, well, so you want to have, so you would want to get with a girl who's loose? You wouldn't want to get with a girl who would just bang you on the first date? Because most women don't- No, bang me on the first date. Yes. Bang me on the first date. And so what they ask me is this, is like, so what you're saying is you should look for loose sex, loose women all the time because you want to confirm genuine desire and usually that's coming from like very, you know, women who don't care one way or another. And then they'll say, well, most men want to like sort of at least vet a woman not to think that she's a slut on the first date to get with her on the first date. So I'm like, I always answer that back with like, well, when is it okay? Is it on the third date? Is it on the second date? Is it, are you even having a date at all, right? I mean, it's just, is it just a hookup? So my question is always, this is like, when people ask me like, well, what would you say to that? If somebody said, well, if that, you date non-exclusively, you spin plates. And I would presume that you're like, well, you know, this seems to work for me. I'm not saying you're giving prescriptions, but you say this seems to work for me. Any woman that makes you wait for sex, there's obviously something that's mitigating her decision to have sex with you. So most of the time, like people say, well, then those women are damaged or they must have something wrong with them or they're loose or they're sluts or they're whatever like that. And so it's like, what would you say when somebody says, well, you're just interested in loose fucking club sluts and they're all skank? So I have a macro answer and a micro answer. The macro answer, like from a sociological standpoint would be, for instance, I had a girl that I dated for a while and she didn't sleep with me on the first date legitimately because her best friend wanted to sleep with me. And she was like, I don't want to piss off my best friend. If she is going out of her way to not sleep with me in order to increase desire, then you're right. I think that's incorrect. Like I think because most of the women I know when I'm like, hey, your boyfriend, how long did you make? Like, how long do you make guys wait? They're like three dates. Your last boyfriend, how long do you make him wait? No, it was the first date, right? They always leave that out. They always leave out the time that they hooked up with some guy at the backstage of a concert or they hooked up with some dude in Mexico. They never count those on the body count, right? So from a macro perspective, for the most part, I agree from the idea that like her deliberately trying to use this as leverage in order to make me wait doesn't work. From a micro perspective, meaning from my standpoint, specifically, anecdotally, I don't care because I'm seeing so many other women. Does that make sense? Like I've actually, I've definitely had women make me wait seven dates, but I didn't notice. I was like, after the fact, I was like, wow, this girl made me wait seven dates. And I was like, you know, I will definitely wait seven dates. You're amazing. The problem is you understand I'm seeing four other girls. Just as long as you understand that I'm seeing four other girls. And because my dates are so fun for me, I only go on dates that are fun for me, meaning they're so fun. Rollo, if she just up and left, I'm throwing axes at fucking Area 15. I love throwing axes. I love Area 15. That's like one of my favorite places in Vegas. I'm at Omega Mart in Area 15. If you want to go, just fucking go. There have definitely been girls make me wait, but I don't even notice they made me wait because I have so many other things going on. So from that standpoint, I do agree about, what I do tell women is this, is like, if you're, because here's the problem, right? I've had women disagree with me on this, but it's the truth. The quickest way for me to get a girl to be my girlfriend is what? To have sex with them. It is. If people, you have a problem with that, just look up, like, there's no way to argue that. That is absolutely the truth. So if I really like a girl, see, this is where women get this part wrong. If I really like a girl, they're like, oh, you just want to have sex with me. And I'm like, no, I want to have sex with you because I really like you. And I need other penises to stay out of you. And so for me to do that, I need to have sexual intercourse with you quickly. It's not out of insecurity. It is an emotional urgency. It's an evolutionary imperative for me to do that because I want to lock you down with me because I really like you. Women don't think about it like that. They don't think it the other way. They think it the other way. It's like, I'm making him wait. He's waiting to prove that he likes me. No, I know I like you real quick. Man, it doesn't take me that long. I know I like you real quick. And so in order to do this, I need Chad Thundercock to stay the fuck away from you. So we need to have really amazing sex as soon as possible so that you are at my place all the time because that's what I want. I want to lock you down from these other people. And women think it like, oh no, you're just trying to have sex with me and you're going to lose respect for me. I've never lost respect for a woman because we had sex quickly. I've never, that's never been the issue. I've lost respect for a woman because she's lied to me because she's said, I'm making you wait and then didn't make other dudes wait. Then I lose respect for you. That's when I lose respect. I'll tell you where I learned that lesson, by the way, with the making rules for betas and alpha. when I was working in the liquor industry, I would have to be the one who would select women to go to do, you know, booth candy, right? To select the ones who are like the poor girls, right? And I remember the conversation between two of these poor girls, and they were saying like, would you ever or have you ever had sex with a guy on the first date? You know, because they don't know each other, right? So they're getting to know each other. And one of them says, oh, yes, of course I have. Ha ha, you know, but not if he was boyfriend material. And I was like, so the, and I took mental notes at that time. So you'll have sex with a guy like immediately, as fast as you possibly can, if the guy is hot, is very hot, and he's the hot guy on the phone count. He's a good opportunity to bang right then and there. But if he gives you cues and he gives you signs that he might be like somebody who was a good protector, provider, parental investment, dads versus cats, if he seems like that guy has to wait, that guy has to have a higher burden of performance than the guy who's the alpha guy who you wanted to fuck immediately that same night. And I'm like, that may, like, that's chick logic, right? That makes, that makes no sense. No, it makes every bit of sense because she can't get Chad and she can't get Brad in the same guy. And that's why that guy has to jump. Oh, I'll tell you where it gets even worse. It's I used to have threesomes, but I don't do that anymore because you're my boyfriend. Oh my God, ladies, you want to piss your man off, do that. I was so wild in my college days and I don't do that. I used to have threesomes, but I'm in love with you. So I would never have a threesome with you. And it's just like, women think that that makes sense. No, it doesn't make sense. It is like the worst. I'll tell you this, Mike. And the other thing is your digital footprint. When you say that, ladies, if you have like Instagram that proves that, no, you were really into it on that yacht party way back, you know, back in 2018, that's when guys kind of go, hmm. I've had situations where women I used to date, they start seeing new guys and they're in a monogamous relationship with a new guy, but the guy knows that I could see other women when she was with me. And so he gets very frustrated. He's like, why is it that he had these rules and I had a second set of rules? I've also heard Bilzerian talk about men, women he used to date, and then they would go get married to someone else. And the guy literally had to go seek counseling because it was constantly this problem of like, you were willing to have sex with Dan Bilzerian and nine other women at the same time. And I married you, but you would never do this with me. And it's like, there's this dissonance. I'm supposed to be the one you would do all the crazy shit with and not those guys. Whereas I get the watered down version of your sexuality. Whereas Dan Bilzerian got the, anything goes, you know, off the rails sexuality, because that's, again, the difference between genuine desire and mitigated desire is exactly that. It's somewhere in between those two points. I had guys that I counsel all the time. They were like, you know, my wife and I used to have sex. So all the time, it was great. I lost the frame real low. How do I get the frame back? And I'm like, well, and I go and I say, I threw, you know, questioning the guy, I will say, well, you know, when did you get married? I was always asking about logistics, like age and everything else. And she's like, oh yeah, and she had a really crazy past. And she has a ex-boyfriend or something like that that she can't get over. And I was like, that's the alpha widow dynamic is like women pine for the one that got away, but you're the guy who will do, and she will do, you know, sexual gymnastics with him, but she won't do it with you. So there has to be a rationale. There has to be some reasoning as to why she won't do that. And so she's like, well, I did that for him back in the day. But, you know, what we have is more special. We have more of an emotional connection. It doesn't feel special. It feels less special. It's like, well, if that's the case, like your performance with this guy is completely different from your performance with me. So I'm the one you're gonna spend the rest of your life with and have kids with, and I'm gonna support you, yet I don't have access to the same sexuality when you were on spring break in Cancun. My definition for hypergamy, it's a little different. It's not the best woman she, it's not the best man she can get. It's the best man she can't get. Hypergamy to me is women looking for the best. It's an algorithm in their mind looking for the best man they can't get, right? Because if that wasn't the case, you wouldn't see so many women going after men that would normally never be monogamous. I have some female friends. Well, it's a really interesting thing because we talked about this before. I showed you a friend of mine. She's 37, looks like she's 22. By the way, we had great barbecue the other night too. The place was awesome, rolling smoke. This thing, when you get to the very, very top, you do find women who are so physically attractive that they can get men who are complete despots. Totally, even Bilzerian talks about his girlfriends that he had where he was monogamous for a whole year with Sophia Beverly. And so in those situations, you see these women that are so attractive and they can get these men to settle down because they're so fucking attractive. Most women I see, they're like, I need to get in front of this famous person. We had Mickey Mace on here. He was talking about that before, where these women are like, I can change him. I can make this guy different. Lock him down. That is by definition to me, her getting what the highest status man she can't get. Not the highest status man she can't get. The highest status man she can't get. And so what happens is that now there's this push and pull where she's dating the NFL quarterback thinking she's gonna lock him down, but can't quite. Like, I'll just be honest with you. I don't know Patrick Mahomes. I have a hard time believing he's just sleeping with his wife, his girlfriend. I don't, you heard the rumors about Steph Curry. No rumors, allegedly. You remember the Steph Curry shit with Steph Curry? I have a really hard time believing that Steph Curry has not put his penis in another woman since he married Aisha. I have a very, very, very, very hard time. And then you have Aisha on the red table talking to Jada Pinkett Smith, talking about, I wanna be, feel sexy. How come I can't be on Instagram as a wife of, and like, you're married to fucking Steph Curry. Who is better? Who are you gonna get that's higher than this? He only got a half billion dollar contract. Hopefully that works out for you. And then the other thing, like just a bunch of these guys like LeBron, you wanna, one of the things I've been, always wanted to ask you about this was Tiger Woods versus Derek Jeter. Tiger Woods, he is this, you know, he's purported to be this high status person. I think he got bad advice from people in the golf community. You need to be, you need to look, to appeal to a white Protestant crowd, you need to be married and look squared away. And so he married this woman and then ended up cheating on her with Denny's Waitresses and Rachel Yucatel. And whereas, whereas, I got stories for you. Whereas what happens with, what happens with Derek Jeter? He fucks Jessica Biel and Jessica Alba and Mariah Carey, and nobody says shit because he's not married. And because he's in our minds, we're like, well, of course he's a shortstop for the fucking Yankees. Of course he's worth sleeping with all those women. Nobody complained when Hugh Hefner would like have multiple girlfriends. Some women would complain, but most people were like, because he's Hugh Hefner, of course he's gonna have multiple girlfriends. This whole paradigm, we're like, we saw Tiger as low status because he lied. And Derek Jeter, we didn't even care. We don't care. Yeah. It's like the same thing that's going down with Leonardo DiCaprio right now. I did a full episode on this. No, we did it on Rule Zero, which is my panel show on Saturdays. And we talked about, and by the way, this has been going on for a very long time, at least since 1999. And yes, I finally do understand that his first girlfriend in that rotation of his monkey branching or whatever, yes, that was Giselle, who is Giselle Brady, Giselle Munchen is her name. Munchen, Munchen, yeah. Thank you for correcting me, chat. So looking at how he goes from women who are like, say, 20 to 25, and that's the cutoff point, like it's expiration date hits. Is he doing that because he's like, yeah, I do that on purpose, that's my intent? Or is he doing that just because it's just like, well, you know, after a certain time, that's when things kind of get stale and she's not as hot as she used to be, or she's not as fun as she used to be, I think I'm gonna trade her up for a different model. Women love Leonardo DiCaprio, but they hate Leonardo DiCaprio. It's like this love-hate relationship with him because he's the dude who you can perpetually never lock down, but he's a high-value dude. But they wanna give him grief, there's still that love-hate relationship. And then what I did is I contrasted that with a guy like Keanu Reeves. And Keanu Reeves is with a, I don't know if he's still with her, but he was with his girlfriend, I think it was his PR woman, and she's like 46, 47 years old. She looks like she's 67. She looks like his mom. And women came out of the woodwork and they're like, oh, I love him that much more now. He's dating somebody who's age appropriate. And it's like, yeah, she's like two years away from menopause. And I'm like, that doesn't enter into the mind, but it's just this sort of like what's socially acceptable and what's not socially acceptable. And it's usually in a sort of a gynocentric framework where it's like what benefits the interest of women's mating strategy is always what's gonna play and what doesn't, or what benefits a man's mating strategy, such as Leonardo DiCaprio. And Leonardo DiCaprio, to my knowledge, isn't like going out and banging random hoes. He has one girlfriend that he sticks with for four or five years. And then he gets up to the next one right there. Women hate that even more, I think, than if he had just like, he was banging random club sluts all the time because it's a loss of equity. It's a loss of investment because when women between the ages of 20 and 25 years old, they're hitting that sexual market value peak, that's when they're at their peak agency. That's when they have their most, like in the sexual marketplace, that's when they have the most equity certainly to a guy like Leonardo DiCaprio, right? And so they're giving away their most fertile, sexually youthful, vibrant, vivacious years for a guy who's just gonna cycle her out for the next model four or five years down the road. That's, what is it, a cost, opportunity cost. That's a loss of investment on women. I think he started off not thinking about the 25 year old thing and later on someone probably pointed it out to him. And psychologically, he probably was like, wait, is this a real, you know what I'm saying? He probably didn't know until like the third one. After like a dozen, he's like, oh, wait a second. Maybe this is a real thing that I really like here. You know what I'm saying? So that is an interesting. Another quote that I love, this is the second one I love, is women don't care about a man's struggles. They wait at the finish line. Bro, that is an awesome quote. That's Richard Cooper, by the way. I gotta give big ups to him for that. But yeah, it's, and I halfway agree with that. So the quote is this. It's women don't care about men's struggles. They wait at the finish line and they bang the winners. Yeah. Okay? I think a certain caliber of women can do that. So those are the women who you see who are gunning for high, high value, high status guys who themselves are the bikini models, who themselves are a product, you know, that is meant to pair with that other product, right? There are a select few of those men. There's very few high value men. So there would stand to reason that there are very few high value women who could get with that high value guy. Okay? So there's the supply and demand side of that equation. But the reason why I say only halfway agree with that is most women can't get that. They can't get the high value guy. So what they have to do is what all the girls who date Leonardo DiCaprio think they're gonna do is they get with a guy who they think they can lock down who has potential. Yes. Who has potential to be the winner who crosses the finish line and they were with him. They jumped in the car at the beginning of the race and they're there at the finish line with a checkered flag. So they have to invest their most fertile, sexually valuable, have the most agency in their life from like 20 to 24, 25, somewhere around there in a guy who could potentially be a good bet for their future and that's the potential. So it's not so much about caring about the struggle, it's that they can't be the one who is the one who's waiting at the finish line. They would rather get with the guy who is gonna be the winner, who crosses the finish line. Now, that involves a lot of a bet and also a betting. It also depends on a lot of intuition, on a lot of understanding this guy's nature, emotional investment as well as physical investment. Is this guy actually gonna be a partner in the law firm? Is this guy actually gonna be a multi-million? I think Gary Vee is a good example of this. Like Gary Vee when he's just recently getting divorced here, his wife was on board with him back in his 20s. Now that he's in his 40s right now, if you look at the chick that he's with, she is a much younger model and she's a much hotter model than the one that he was with, his wife, who got with him in his 20s, right? So the greatest fear that is so, so exaggerated right now is well, I don't wanna invest all of my sexual capital from my 20s in a guy who's just gonna turn into the guy who goes and bangs his, you know, gets a trophy wife or bangs his secretary. And then all of my investment that I put in to him becoming a winner and being a ride or die girl, all that goes out the window because now he wants to fuck his trophy wife or he wants to fuck the secretary. What is that, Kanye said? And then at the end, he goes and fucks a white girl. You remember what he told Digger? He said, leave your ass for a white girl. So it's an investment cost loss. And when we talk about evolutionary psychology, when we say that women have, well, women have a higher reproductive cost than men do. Of course, yeah. So for women to sacrifice that and invest, it's like taking, Myron Gaines always talks about, you know, women are born with a million bucks and they have to take that money and they have to invest it wisely or they blow it on hookers and blow throughout their, you know, their 20s or whatever. So that when they get to like the epiphany phase in their early 30s, you had better made a good bet on a guy who was a potential winner or you better be the chick who's at the finish line waiting for the winner. And you better be able to be of the caliber that can compete with all the other bitches that are waiting for that winner to go across the finish line. Okay, when you say the 23 to 25, one more time, I want to reiterate this. I said this at the beginning of the program. Go on, read the book, Dataclism, or look at the statistics from, he specifically, let's just stick to, who gets the most right swipes? It doesn't even have to, you know, those are old stats too. I quote those often enough, right? But there are more current stats that point that out as well, that that's the prime demographic, prime age for women. If you disagree with it, again, we're not talking about your personal internal value, about the value you have as a business. Sexual market value and personal worth. Personal worth, so two different things. Your, the feelings that you have when you meditate, your relationships with your friends and family, how much money you make, how many graduate degrees, that's a separate thing. When we're talking about sexual market value. Volunteering on the soup line. For sure, that's defined, that is defined in some ways, several ways, but your sexual market value is defined by how many men are attracted to you at different points in your life. And if we go by dating apps, it is very, very, very clearly defined 23 to 25. So don't yell at him, don't yell at me, go read the book, Dataclism, yell at them. Go be mad at God. Go be mad at statistics. Well, and of course the joke is this, they call the store Forever 21, not Forever 41. There's a reason for that. Embrace it, it's okay. You know what's funny is like, when I go and I present that and I say, look, your prime sexual market value, your peak years are gonna be right around 23 years old. I tell my daughter this, right? I say, look, that's gonna be your peak years. And when I. You can point out like stats and statistics and all this other shit, but what really I think sinks in for women is when you say, okay, if you know that, if you see this coming, how are you gonna plan ahead? If you're gonna look for a guy who's a good bet, now's the time to look for that guy that's a good bet. Not when you're 33, when you're 23. So look for the guys who, and then also, don't be so full of yourself that you're like, you don't take anybody else's advice, you don't talk to your dad or talk to your brothers or talk to any positive masculine influence in your life to say, hey, do you think this guy's a good bet? Do you like this guy? Do you think he's a cool dude, right? Do you think he's gonna fuck me over? Do you think he's gonna be a good, do you wanna be related to this guy in the future kind of thing? And I think that most women are so full of themselves and they don't trust men to such a degree that that wouldn't even be a concept that would be in their heads. The Richard Cooper quote is, \\\"'Women don't care about a man's struggles. \\\"'They wait at the finish line and they fuck the winners.'\\\" Now, if anybody has a problem with that, here's the problem. Here's why, the first part I completely agree with. Women do not care about a man's struggles. If you think women care about a man's struggles. Yeah, even if they're investing you in their 20s, they still don't care about it. They don't care about your struggles. If you care about a man's struggles, I wanna see you guys dating the stalker, the guy who does the stalks of shelves at Walmart. You're not dating him. He's struggling more than I am. The sandwich artist at Subway. The sandwich artist at Subway. If you care about a man's struggles, let me see you dating him. You aren't dating him. But what'll happen is a man will struggle and at the end, he has a million dollars and you're like, oh, he's struggling. No, you care. I'm sorry, ladies. You do care about the money, but we'll get to the money muscles in the game. You do care about the results. That is the case. Regardless, if you wanna say, when we look at who you date, you date the men who have the results. There's so many men who are struggling. That's why I'd made a statement before. Women got so mad at me. Women do not care about your feelings. They don't. The fact that your ex cheated on you is not going to make her vagina wet to sleep with you. She's not gonna pity her. You're not gonna pity your way into having sex with her. You're not gonna reason your way into having sex with her. There's no such thing as a pity fuck, especially in the 21st century. For sure, for sure. Well, and then I would say this is like, women don't want to marry a man. They wanna marry a lifestyle. Interesting. You hear all the time like, oh, women didn't, they don't want a marriage. They just want a wedding, right? They just wanna have that. And you can see that confirmed because women will go and marry a bridge or themselves or their dog or something. They just wanna have that process. Well, I'm a self-fulfilled woman, so I'm gonna marry myself. They have a ceremony for the whole, you don't see dudes doing that. Guys don't go get married to bridges. They don't marry a chandelier, man. They don't care about that. They just, you know, it's, that's the difference between the two, I think. But it's the lifestyle. It's this, in book one, I talk about this. It's in, I think it's in rule number six, which is women love opportunistically, men love idealistically. Yes, women are fundamentally incapable. We want to believe that, we wanna believe in the, I think men more, men are the romantics pretending to be pragmatists and women are vice versa. And so when you point shit out like that, women will go, but I love my husband. I love my boyfriend. Yeah, I'm sure you do, but that dude had to meet a list of criteria before you would emotionally invest in that guy in the first place. That's what I'm getting at. I'm not saying you're some opportunistic, you know, evil, malicious, you know, bitch who's gonna go on a gold digger, right? Who wants to get with the top shelf guy? Women want that, but they won't allow themselves by order of degree. They won't allow themselves to invest emotionally in a man, to love a man, unless that guy checks off at least some of those things on the, you know, 436 bullet point checklist. Going back to what you said before, from an evolutionary standpoint, I ask women this all the time, when I ask men this all the time. And there's nothing wrong with that, by the way. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not hating for that. I'm just, that's an observation. From an evolutionary standpoint, does it make more sense for a woman to give her undeniable, what's the word? Unmitigated, genuine desire. Genuine, hold on, hold on. Her unconditional love to her children or to her man. Unfortunately, for our species to have existed through multiple near extinction events, different points throughout history, through the anthropological record where there were only 60,000 homo sapiens on the planet, near extinction several times, the propagation of the species was priority. A woman gives unconditional love to her children, not to her man. Thank you for that, by the way. I'm not complaining about that, but as a result of that, you understand that a woman, her love for you is conditional. It has to be conditional. That's why, personally, if I'm a husband and my wife has a choice and there's a train coming and it's me or the kid, let me die so that my kid can live. I get that. But as a result, I understand love for me is conditional. It is conditional. Conditional why? What we said before, it's not conditional on my struggle. It's conditional on how I finish. It's conditional on my performance and I will be judged on performance till the day I die. Your performance, your hierarchy, your status. By the way, your status in a hierarchy is directly, or should be anyway, is directly relatable to your performance. It's directly relatable to your competence. So I'll give you the evolutionary. Okay, I'm gonna put the Mr. Wizard cap on here. The reason for that, of course, is you've probably heard this saying before, which is eggs are expensive and sperm is cheap. That's, I think that's straight out of like the red coin. It's the parental investment hypothesis from evolutionary psychology. And I don't know if, I know you follow David Buss. I know there's, Godsod is a really good friend. I'd like to, I would, Godsod, if you wanna be on my show, please come to my show. He would probably be the only guy I would ever be like starstruck by is Godsod. He's so funny, man. But I follow guys like Rob Henderson, Steve Stewart-Williams, David Buss, all these guys. But across the board, and I don't know if any of these guys are talking about this, but it's the big head babies theory. Yeah, of course. So the big head babies theory is this, is that women are the vulnerable sex. Men are the disposable sex, or the sacrificial sex. Maybe I should say, put it in those terms. Because whenever you put it in those terms, people think that I'm making a judgment call. You're not disposable. You're sacrificial though. And men have an innate protector dynamic. And the reason for that is because human babies have huge heads. Because the human species is dependent upon our intelligence. I know it's hard to believe in this day and age, but we're dependent upon our intelligence. And so to create an intelligent animal, we have to have a lot of neurons, we have to have a big head, and we have to have a large brain, and we have to be able to, complex computer in our heads. Well, first of all, that takes time to gestate. So you've got nine months right there for a human to gestate. And then, once that baby comes out of that woman's hips, who are unusually large because you have to birth that baby, technically premature, because you can't get that big huge head out of the birth canal if they're not giving birth right at that point. So what happens is then there's an investment cost that comes as a result of that. And now you have not only a vulnerable female, but you also have a vulnerable, very fragile child. And throughout our ancestral past, women were carrying around one to four or five of these things at the same time. Because when we were breeding back on the savanna and hunter-gatherer days, right? So women were in a very vulnerable state, evolutionarily speaking. So men, of course, were built for combat. We're there for defense. We're there for the three Ps, protection, provisioning, and parental investment, and hope to God that the kid is ours, right? So because human babies have big heads, like for instance, I made this example in my religion, in my religion book, that if you look at, like say a baby horse, when a horse is born, like within an hour or so, it can run, and it's somewhat self-sufficient. Babies are completely helpless for anywhere between like the first five to seven years of their lives. And the women are also effectively helpless as well, because they are simply the vulnerable sex at that point. So how do you survive as a species like that if the female is vulnerable and the man is not? Well, you've got to have some sort of psychological mechanism that is imbued into the man to protect the vulnerable female and the vulnerable baby, right? So what you just said a moment ago is the women are fixated upon the survival of that child. That's why they have the oxytocin and everything that goes into the nurturing side of everything. They are primarily focused on protecting that child, and there's a relationship from the mother to the child. Well, what happens is from the man to the woman, there is like, you'll hear like pickup artists in the Red Pill community, you hear old guys say, well, women are like children. Yeah, yeah, they are, because there's an innate part of us that wants to treat them like that in a protector dynamic because we want to protect the vulnerable woman and the vulnerable child because the big head babies. So what happens then is you've got this innate protector dynamic in women, and I'm going to throw some, blow some doors off here. When Andrew Tate talks about how women are weaker in combat and everything else, or when women must obey men, like when you have that obedience factor, I think I've seen him on several interviews where he said women want to obey or want to submit to a worthy man, to a guy who's muscular and is dominant and is a high value guy. They want innately to submit to that guy, and women lose their shit whenever he says that, but from an evolutionary perspective, it's true, because if they didn't in our evolutionary past, they would die, the species would be dead. So we've got the protector dynamic on the side of the man, we've got this sort of obedience, deference side on the women, and now, and that's how down the chain, it's God, man, woman, babies, puppy dogs, right? I mean, that's the chain right there. What we've done in really, I would say, since the sexual revolution is we have evolved past all of this stuff and because of social conditioning or social conventions or whatever, social construction theory kind of thing, we've convinced ourselves that that shouldn't be the way that it is. And so what we do is we have taught women to subvert the male protection instinct. So you'll see trad cons do this and you'll see liberals do this as well. So for feminists of, whether you're, ladies, if you're a conservative feminist or you're a liberal feminist, they do pretty much the same thing. They will use the male protector dynamic against men. Your responsibility is this, you don't get any authority over us, but you have this responsibility to us, which is innately sort of imbued in us, right? And so for men to want to protect women is an innate desire to put themselves in front of like, especially in survival situations with like a mass shooting kind of thing. Guys will put themselves in front of bullets of women that they don't even know. Here in Las Vegas, like when the Las Vegas shooting was going on, there were incidences of, multiple incidences of guys putting their bodies in front of women and getting shot and killed of women that they didn't know because it was just simply like gut instinct that just clicks in and they wouldn't be able to tell you why they did that, they just went and did it. Now we call that a noble death and honorable and everything else. So we can give names to it later, but the instinct to do that is part of the male protector dynamic that has been leveraged against women, or excuse me, against men, in the sense that women don't want to obey. They don't want to be obedient. Who the fuck are you to tell me what I can do? I'm my own autonomous androgynous thing and I'm not gonna do what you have to tell me, but they still have that innate want to get with a guy who is a worthy man to submit to a worthy man's mission. And so that also ties into the child, the big head baby side of things as well. So when you've got the red pill, the red pill analyzes all this and it tells men, this is the way things are and don't get rolled by Cardi B. Don't think that you have to, don't, this is the dynamic here and look for the women who are deferential to you. That's how you get an Andrew Tate. For a woman who would disagree with that, just think of the Eva Mendes thing again. I don't want to have babies. But I want his babies. But then she meets Ryan Gosling, but I want his babies. If you think about it from the standpoint of whatever lady's watching this, your version of Ryan Gosling, would you want to submit to him possibly? Maybe you think you wouldn't, and again, try in brain theory, right? From a mammalian standpoint, she does. From a neocortex standpoint, she does not. Maybe that's where the dissonance comes from. Let me say something else. 5,000 species of mammals on this planet, 3% of them pair bond, only 3%. Pair bonding for Homo sapiens is an evolutionary adaptation. I knew you were gonna get to this topic today. Pair bonding for Homo sapiens is an evolutionary adaptation because of what he said. In order for our craniums to be bigger, we had to be born prematurely. Our bodies, everything below the neck, prematurely. That's why children are born without the ability to walk. If you talk to any quadruped mammal, so talk to them, sorry. If you study any- Talk to my gray hounds. If you study any quadruped mammal, they're able to walk quickly because that's an innate thing, and if you look at them, their brain size compared to the rest of their body, so we're talking about impalas or gazelles or horses or whatever, their brain size compared to the rest of the mass of their body is smaller because a cognitive ability to speak and do mathematics and Sudoku puzzles was not necessarily for their evolution. So they were able to walk. They were not born prematurely. They were born able to walk, whereas Homo sapiens were not. And so that's what he talked about. So in order to protect these people, in order to protect these smaller, useless- Fragile. Fragile people. I don't mean to say useless, but children are- Vulnerable, fragile. Vulnerable. I heard the term one time, children are born useless, and I was like, that's horrible. And then I thought, that's kind of true. They can't really do anything, right? They're fragile. They're fragile, right? When they're born that way, you have to have some mechanism in evolution in order- Remember, rule number two in men of action, anything that persists amongst Homo sapiens must exist somewhere in evolution. So in order for us to protect them from an evolutionary standpoint, that's where pair bonding comes in. And then think about this other thing. Childbirth sucks. From every woman I've talked to about it, it's not like playing basketball and spraying an ankle. It's fucking terrible. It is one of the, like, from a pain standpoint, is one of the most horrific things. And childbirth before pre-1850, 50% of Homo sapiens that were ever born died before the age of five, more than, like, we're talking massive amounts, 100 times the level of mother mortality, women dying in childbirth back then, okay? This is another reason why it's an evolutionary adaptation for women to pick the right man, because if she doesn't, she's going to have died for nothing. Investment cost. It is a massive investment cost. Childbirth was deadly, deadly before antibiotics, okay? So when you consider that as well, why in the world would women put themselves up to this for 300,000 years of Homo sapien evolution? It's because after childbirth, it's in flood of oxytocin. Again, another. evolutionary adaptation. Right after orgasm is a flood of oxygen. Exactly. Evolutionary adaptation. Reward center reward you for having sexual intercourse. Reward center reward you for having a child with someone else. For the man and the woman. And then there's the reward center rewarding you for the pair bonding that happens. I don't know. The most desperate fucking male whore I've ever met has fallen in love with one girl. It happens to every dude. There's no dude who doesn't. Unless you're a complete psychopath. It doesn't. And by the way, there's another evolutionary adaptation for why psychopathy exists. We can talk about that later. Oh yeah. Psychopath next door. But when we discuss those things, you have to understand, this is not good or bad. Because I'm an oncologist and study cancer, it doesn't mean I condone cancer. It means cancer exists, therefore I have to study it. In this type of situation, I know I call homo sapiens hairless murder apes. I stand by that. We are hairless murder apes. You belong to the most violent species that has ever existed in the history of the fucking 3.8 billion years that this rock has been floating around the sun. We are violent. And so when you understand that kind of thing, then what I'm saying is if you understand this truth, your decision matrix becomes much easier, right? You can't be aware of anything like in your situation, the red pill. I cannot be aware unless I transcend the Disney paradigm or even the natural paradigm I have. I can't even be aware that there is another paradigm unless I understand. I did not come from Disney. I came from my species only choosing to do things that were evolutionarily beneficial for them and the massive selection pressure that they had to fight in order for this fragile. Think about homo sapiens compared to gorillas, homo sapiens compared to tigers, homo sapiens compared to alligators. In every one of these cases, at least they have weapons for sure. Name all the mammals that you can outrun. A Yorkshire terrier. Name all the mammals you as a human being can outrun. Ned's my greyhound. Yeah, you can't outrun dogs. Most cats you can't outrun. Do you guys know that elephants can run 35 miles an hour? You can't outrun the majority. A bear will outrun you and it weighs a thousand pounds. You can't outrun most of these mammals. In every one of these mammals, almost all of them is either faster, stronger than you, or has fangs. As a species, we're actually kind of a weak, fragile species. We've got a big ass brain though. We've got a big ass brain. And that's the evolutionary adaptation. We're smart enough to fuck you up. Correct. It's exactly right. I was going to say this is because I'm looking at this right now and this is a conversation I think I got into with like Jedidiah Bela and some, it's usually like conservatives will throw this at me. And so I'd be like, do you think that the human species is naturally monogamous or naturally promiscuous? And I said, I said both. I said both. I said, because it's in men's, men's, when you look at men's sexual strategy, the men's innate mating strategy, it is unlimited access to unlimited sexuality. Yes. You, of course, you and Justin talked about this all the time. You've got the win button and you could fuck any chick you want to. That's, you know, you would press the button. Well, most guys press the button and that button is porn. That's a, if you want to know if you have any disagreement with my assessment that says unlimited access to unlimited sexuality, that is exactly what online porn provides men in a vicarious and vicarious way. That's why it's free. That's why it's 4k. That's why it's streaming. That's why every technological advancement we've ever made has been used for porn first. So men want to use that as a, as sort of an outlet right there. And there's a def, I think now in the 21st century there's a real, very real downside to that. However so as our nature being our innate promiscuous nature as men would be unlimited access to unlimited sexuality for women, of course it's hypergamy. They're looking for the next best thing. They're looking for the bigger and better deal, you know, and scales by you know where they can, what they can get. But when you look at those things from an evolutionary perspective and a mating strategy perspective, men are, are selected and women are K selected. So men, it's in men's like DNA, reproductive interests to bang a lot of women to have multiple partners to, to spread the genetic standpoint is a, yeah, from a genetic standpoint, we are promiscuous. So you can make the case and say, yeah, we are promiscuous. We're innately that way. There's a great book that I don't know if you've read before, but it's a, it's by Dr. Tim Burkhead. One of the best reads I've ever read. It's called promiscuity. And it goes through the animal kingdom, including human beings about exactly what you said. There are only certain like maybe two species on planet earth that actually monogamously pair bond for life. And I think one is a swan and another one is like some field mouse, you know, somewhere like that. Right. And so with that in mind, what are the, what are the adaptations? What are the strategies that evolved from the fact that pretty much everything on planet earth is promiscuous? Well, for men and women, for human beings, it is in our evolutionaries our survival, best interests to be monogamous because of big head babies. So we have to say, well, we have to have some sort of natural propensity to want to be invested in our offspring. Women are more nurturing. Men want to ascertain that the damn kid is theirs. They want to make sure that paternity is the thing, because up until 1975, when we could get DNA testings, we didn't know if the kid was ours or not, unless you're white and it comes out black. I mean, maybe that you might be able to figure out, but that's why we had things like we would had a stigma for bastard children. That's why we had a single mothers up until the sexual revolution were shunned because it was, it was a shame to do that. Well, the reason for their, their very real evolutionary reasons for those, those traditions and what we would call traditions anyways, but the, for those practices and those belief sets that we're now in the 21st century going, Hmm, maybe we get married because we are compromising, uh, my, my innate mating strategy, which is unlimited access to unlimited to unlimited sexuality. I'm compromising that by saying, I'm only going to fuck you. I'm only going to be married to you. I'm going to protect, provide and be parentally invested in our relationship. So I'm going to give up an aspect of my mating strategy. And the deal is this, I have to be the one that you're fucking own. You're only fucking me. I don't want to know that there's been any other penises in you and like you were saying, right? And I need to know that the fucking kids are my kids. That's the deal. So when you have marriage, even when you think of the marriage vows, like, uh, you know, till death do us part in for richer, for poor. So if I fuck up, you're still going to stay your ride or die, um, uh, forsaking all others and sickness and in health. And you look at all the traditional marriage vows. Those are like insurance policies against some very real evolutionary realities that could happen. Yeah. You know, I tell my friends, do you have to pass laws in order to get people to eat carbs or fat? No. Do you have to have passed laws in order to get people to go to sleep? No. But in Saudi Arabia, if a woman cheats on her husband, what happens? She gets stoned to death. You suck. So again, if things were not a natural state of, of, of homo sapiens, you don't need to stone people to do things that are natural. The real, the real answer is homo sapiens live a life, a life of polygamy interspersed with periods of monogamy. That's generally what happens. People get married, have the starter. That's why they call it a starter wife. We do. We do. It's a, I mean, I've been married to my wife for 26 years. I've never cheated on my wife. I have a notch count of 40 women that I have 41 women when I was in my rock star twenties. Okay. So, um, you know, they always say, you know, so your wild oats get out of your system. Sure thing. You know, and then the women are now have the whole phase. So they're pretty much like have become the men that we, we used to be, I guess. So women think that for, you know, what's good for the goose, it's good for the gander because we believe in this blank slate bullshit where it's like, if a guy can do it, then I can do it too. Right? Well, no, there's, there's consequences and there's downstream evolutionary consequences to that. Um, but we have conditioned ourselves to sort of, um, to believe that we're above that or we evolved above that through social, uh, social constructionism, um, and through the blank slate and really through emotionalism. I, I, people know this as a quote from me as well as that. If you kick out the legs of emotionalism, social constructionism and, um, and the blank slate out of any like woke ideology, it crumbles, it falls apart. You just absolutely collapses because if you have to give an objective empirical definition of what is a woman, right? Like when, when Matt, Matt Walsh was talking about that, um, if you had to do that, people would have to reassess their identities in, not in emotional subjective relative terms. They would actually have to, you know, say, uh, that's a woman and I'm not actually a woman, even though I have lipstick on and I've got long hair and I got to, you know, you know, blush on, you know, on Dr. Phil or something. So that questions and puts into a puts into question a lot of ideologies. If you can say empirically, you're not a woman, you can't give birth. Uh, and yes, there is a genetic component to gender. I don't give a fuck what you say. I can show you the studies for that. You can look at the four laws of behavioral genetics and I can show you that right now. Um, but so when you, when you encounter a woman who's saying or a teacher or something, uh, advocating for a gender reassignment surgeries because you were born the wrong way, you're born the wrong gender or a gender is a social construct. I'm like, well, if gender is a social construct, then why do I need gender reassignment surgery for that? Why do I need puberty blocking drugs for that? Um, if that's, if it's just, you know, and when you put that kind of those belief sets, um, in the light of empirical data, they fall apart. They just crumble. Sure. And, and when they crumble, what happens is, uh, people are so ego invested in it. They live their entire lives. They've developed their entire personalities around that, that when you present them with that data, you get canceled. Just like, like Andrew Tate, you get, you get, we don't want to hear what you have to say because we're happy in our little cocoon. If someone over the age of 18 wants to change their gender, I support that because I'm a us military officer and we're supposed to support and defend the constitution of the United States. And that's your expression. I have no problem with, I have friends that have done that. I don't have an issue with that whatsoever. However, if I express to you, Hey, just to let you know, even though you have changed your gender, you still have to an XY chromosome. If you feel like what I said is hateful, there's a problem. I'm not, I'm not going to respond with hate, but here's the problem. Where does this stop? Because now you denying that you have XY chromosome, like you are biologically still a male. What happens now is what else do we deny? Why do we even believe in evolution? Okay. Now we don't believe in evolution. Now there's other biological constructs we don't believe in. So at this point, like I know this is going to sound like a real big stretch. Do you know 4% of millennials don't believe that the earth is round? Did you know? Yeah. Flat earthers hit me up all the time. Are you kidding? But Oh, and we never landed on the moon either by the way. Do you understand this continues to rise when we, when we teach the Zodiac signs, mercury, mercury and retrograde. That's why I didn't sign this contract. When we allow that, the science denialism, what happens is magical, but they start when I make the, cause I debated these flat earthers for three and a half hours. I'm telling you that these things are correlated. The idea that we can't like all of a sudden, I don't believe in science when it doesn't, when it doesn't make me feel good. That leads to, I don't believe in evolution. I don't believe in biology. I don't believe that there were dinosaurs and it's a slippery slope that leads right to, I don't believe the earth is round. I don't believe anything anyone ever taught me. And then I don't believe we landed on the moon. I don't believe there is a moon and I don't, and I believe that, that the earth is a, you know, is the earth, there's a, as a disc. And you're like, Michael, that is such an extrapolation. Just because I believe in Sagittarius and Virgo, that doesn't mean I think that the earth is flat. And yet 4% of millennials, that number is rising believe that the earth is flat. There is a correlation when you decide that there is no objective truth. You have your truth and objective truth. OJ either did or did not kill Nicole and it doesn't fucking matter what role or I think about it. He did or he did not. There is not our truth. There is the truth. If you cannot identify a V truth, the problems start coming from there. And now I have family members who teach their children, you know, teach them, teach their children that biology isn't real. Evolution isn't real. And I'm just thinking like, no, I got family members who can never get a job in any scientific field because we've, we've chosen to do this. And so that part is scary to me. But again, I have a friend of mine. He's he's, I'm not going to say where, but he is a professor at a Ivy league university. And he's like, Michael, the stuff that you talk about, of course it's empirically true. But if I were to say this kind of stuff, I would lose my tenure. And so I can't now let's, let's go to one other thing. Okay. Obviously Dr. Buss and I, I feel a kinship because we're both Longhorns and you had a problem with the name of the beginning of his book, which is when men behave badly. Do you remember this? I read the, I, I got, let's see, I read that book, three months ago, four months ago. Yeah. My own. Okay. So my problem with is, and Dr. Buss is just one of these guys, by the way, is I can, I could also make a case for Jeffrey Miller. I can make a case for even who I really admire. Steven Pinker, a lot of people hate him because I think he was on Jeffrey Epstein's like photo list or some shit like that. Right. When he wrote the blank slate, I thought it was absolutely brilliant. Also, I, I often quote Marty Hazel, Dr. Marty Hazelton. Yes. She's a evolutionary psychologist who really stuttered. She's, you know, put her mark on the map for a obviatory shift. Right. And so she's hated by feminists because she exposes like the, the nuts and bolts of female nature and, and, and the obviatory cycle and everything else. And the behavioral aspects of that, they hate her. But yet in her book hormonal, she'll still try to get her feminist street cred, right? She'll be like, I, I'm really a feminist. I'm really for, for women's rights and everything, but here's the studies I have. And they're kind of unflattering, you know, and then try to soften the site, you know, sugarcoat the data. Um, so when I, when I see some, or even Dr. Hector Garcia wrote a great book called alpha God, I suggest, you know, that's one of my, my favorite books of all time. Um, even Dr. Hector Garcia, it's the same thing. I have such a, a respect for them as statisticians, as research guys, as, uh, you know, of collecting the dots, but connecting the dots is something they don't want to do because if they do, they will lose their tenure. If they go out and they become, uh, in any way popular saying, or even, uh, I think it was, uh, Steven Pinker has done a Ted talks where he was said, men and women are different. Here's the, here's what, here's what the data says. Uh, men are interested in things and women are interested in people. The reason that gender paid gap, uh, exists is in, in the collective, in the whole is because women choose these careers. Okay. Because they are more now they have a natural proclivity to want to get into careers that are people careers because that's the movement are more interested in people and men are more interested in things. And so that was just one aspect of a whole bunch that he went into very long, very great dissertation that he gave a, believe it was a text, a Ted talk at a college or something. And then at the end of it, it's like, but I'm still a feminist and uh, don't, please don't cancel me. Right. Essentially it was the sort of the disclaimer at the end of it. And I'm like, these guys can't say what they need to say. Or so what happens is they try to, they try to force. fit the data to fit their ideological mold or what their personal life's mold is. So I love this discussion. Satoshi Kanazawa, do you know who he is? The guy wrote Why Beautiful People Have More Daughters. So I talk to, I text him, we email every once in a while. Satoshi Kanazawa was canceled. He's now in Europe. Fantastic evolutionary psychologist. He was canceled and he's very, he's probably gonna be upset that I'm even bringing him up right now. He posted a study which basically showed which genders and which ethnicities had the best time on dating apps. And he showed that in this one study that black women had a harder time on dating apps and published it and got fucking crucified for it. He just published numbers, okay? He also, the study also showed that black men had an easier time on dating apps. Because he published this, he was fucking destroyed. Now, Dr. Buss is at UT Austin. The other guy who wrote Alpha God, what's his name? Dr. Hector Garcia. He's at UTSA, University of Texas, San Antonio. Those are not like the rest of Texas. These are as blue as it gets. I do not blame Dr. Buss. First off, for writing a book called Why Women Have Sex, he better have a female co-author. It's Dr. Cindy Mastin, number one. Number two, I've been on that West Mall at UT Austin. Bro, they are liberal as shit. So I understand, I want Dr. Buss to stay as a professor at UT Austin. I think his laboratory is useful to the world. I use his stats and research all the time. His laboratory is useful for the world. If he's gotta say whatever he's gotta say, I love David, so I'm all for it. So I understand. And also, the name of the book is Why Men Behave Badly. If you go into the book, they go deep into why women cheat. It is not a one-sided book. That's the first thing. Second thing, I totally understand the first chapter. He goes hard on incels. He goes hard on the manosphere. So I totally understand where that came from, too. And I asked him about it. I don't know if you saw my interview with him. I specifically talked about you. I asked him about specifically, do you understand a lot of the seduction community, red pill, manosphere stuff revolves around your work? And he's like, I didn't know anything about this. He's like, this isn't really my battleground. But he's one of the most cited professors in the world. There's a study, I can't remember which magazine came out. He's the 19th most influential psychologist on the planet. To me, that's only because people don't understand evolutionary psychology. To me, he's one. He's made a statement on my podcast that I- You have to actually read. Yeah, for sure. He made a statement on my podcast that I stand by. I'd said this previously, but he put it better. There is no such thing as a non-evolutionary psychology. All psychology is evolutionary. There is no such thing as a non-evolutionary psychology. And so it's like, I like David personally, but in addition, I think his work is so important. It is because here's the problem. When you're like me, I'm a political moderate. When you're like me, the right hates me because they don't like evolution. And the left hates me because they don't like gender roles. Evolutionary psychology has gender roles in it and has evolution in it. And so I'm damned either fucking way. And so I understand- The right hates me because I'm about evolution and the left hates me because I'm about evolution. Exactly, exactly. So that's the thing. There's no political dogma here, right? You guys have heard me criticize Biden and Trump on this podcast. So that's the thing that I thought was just really interesting about that. The first thing in the first book you wrote that really hit me, I wrote it down, I still have the notes on this, is there's no such thing as a soulmate. I don't know if you've heard me talk about that. Yeah, one-eyed. The soulmate thing. But how about this from a statistical standpoint that makes no sense? How about all the people- From a religious standpoint, I can prove it's scriptural. It doesn't make sense. But again, we had Nick Santo Nostasso on here. He was born with missing two legs and one arm, right? He only has a left arm. He was born that way. He's dating a huge social media influencer right now. Now he's in a unique position, but there's a lot of people born with deformities. I see him all the time. Everybody goes, doesn't that just prove your theory? Yeah, so this issue, no, but my point is, well, my point is there's so many people born, if you're born with spina bifida, I don't know if you guys know what this is, the lower spine does not form correctly. And so there's a flooding of spinal fluid that has to be dumped back into the brain. And these children usually don't live past the age of 17. Don't tell me they have a fucking soulmate. They don't have a soulmate. They were born with a deformity and they're probably going to die. And that's fucking sucks, okay? There are children born in third world countries that die virgins, that get blown up when they're young, hunting for diamonds. Those people don't have a soulmate. So you don't get a soulmate because you were born middle-class in North America and you watched fucking Mean Girls and Moulin Rouge. That doesn't mean you get a fucking soulmate because you have a pumpkin spice latte. You don't get a fucking soulmate. You get what you deserve. You remember Krishna Koye? Led the league in Russian in 1989. Krishna Koye didn't wait for a hole. He didn't wait for a soulmate. He made that motherfucker. He ran people over. He put people in the dirt. Bo Jackson, guys like that. You know what I'm talking about? Michael Alstott, Mary and Barbara III. Mary and Barbara III, rest in peace. Those guys made a hole for themselves. That is how life actually works. That's the part, when you said there's no soulmate, to me it wasn't about one, it was mathematics. It was mathematics. It didn't make any sense to me that it'd be a soulmate. Go ahead. From a pragmatic perspective, yes. It does not make any difference. And I had to learn that the hard way because, and I don't want to get into too much specifics, but I remember when someone very close to me committed suicide. And it wasn't the actual suicide, per se, that affected me. It was the aftermath and all of the things that happened after it, right? So now that he's dead and gone, who's your soulmate, right? And the reason why I brought up the scriptural thing is there's that part in the Bible where they try to get Jesus and they say, so-and-so had a wife and then his brother died and then he died and he died and he died and there's seven of these guys married the same woman. Who gets the woman in heaven as the wife, right? You probably remember that, right? And then, of course, Jesus says, well, there's no giving in marriage, so screw you guys. You just don't know what you're talking about, basically, is what he said. But even from that sort of poetic scriptural thing, it tells a greater truth, which is it's because you're fixated on this idea of having a soulmate or having somebody, if you marry someone, then they go off into heaven with you and then you're with them in heaven kind of thing. That is the reason why I put, if you read my first book, the very first chapter of that, I thought, okay, if people read this book and they get through one chapter and they throw it away, what's the most important thing in that message I can leave them with? And it is, there is no one. There are some good ones and there are some bad ones, but there is no one. So statistically speaking, if the second son or third son or fourth son or fifth son or whatever, whose soulmate is the original wife at that point? And so I got into this sort of, I don't want to say it's philosophical, but even a statistical thinking about it. I'm like, why is the soulmate myth or the idea that there's some one perfect girl or guy out there for you that you're destined to meet and you'll only ever be with that one. And that one's gonna be your most satisfying sexual experience and your most satisfying lifetime experience. And that's the one you're gonna marry. And that's the one that God preordained you from birth to meet. And you'll have women who are like 45, 50 years old who are saying, I'm still waiting for the Lord to give me the one. And what it is, I think it's the single most damaging mythology that we have ever perpetrated on humanity, because like I said, there are, like, I love my wife dearly. Is she my soulmate? Yeah, okay, fine, you can make a case for that. But the thing is, is there are a lot of other women who you can click with, right? There are a lot of other good ones out there. And just because you didn't get with Susie at the homecoming dance and you thought she was your one, it's not that you can't develop and build another relationship. What it really comes back down to is it's a mythology that we have perpetuated really since, it's called the romantic ideal. If you read my religion book, there's a whole chapter on it. The romantic ideal is this, is that there's only one perfect person for another person. It's a derivative from courtly love, from chivalry, you know, people say, oh, women say, oh, there's no such thing as chivalry anymore. No, what you're referring to isn't chivalry. You're referring to courtly love, which got added to the chivalry code way back in medieval times, right? So, but how do we get a species who is innately promiscuous to be monogamous because that is the foundation of Western society. How do we make it so that the majority of men are going to be able to reproduce? And whether they do successfully or not, we can't just have a society built on alpha chads who are sharing this pool of women who are only fucking these girls and putting out all, they're Abraham of old, like the patriarchs of old, where they have concubines, they got three wives or whatever else. How do we, as the 80% of guys, the beta males, how do we stop the top, you know, four and a half percent, you know, 20% of guys from tyrannizing or dominating the sexual marketplace? Well, we make monogamy, the socially enforced monogamy, and by the way, that's not something Jordan Peterson came up, pulled out of his ass one time. Go look it up on Wikipedia. We create a society that reinforces and rewards monogamy and stigmatizes fucking around. That's why we're still, you know, when people say, oh, you're 45 and you're not married yet, Mike. Oh my God, there must be, are you gay? Are you gay? When are you gonna grow up, Michael? Yeah, exactly, when are you gonna grow up? That's why that stigma exists, because we're still in that monogamous mythology, and so how do we reinforce that with magical thinking? Because most people, I could go and explain to you why monogamy makes sense. Big head babies, I just did a moment ago. But I can't, if you're 18 years old and you wanna get your dick wet, and I go, you know what, monogamy might be the best thing for you, and if I can convince the alphas to do that and I convince all this, you know, the vast majority of males to believe that God said that monogamy is the only way you're gonna be able to, you know, that's the only way you're ever gonna have sex, well, now we take that and we build upon that. There's religious mythology and then there's secular mythology as well. The soulmate myth is secular mythology that reinforces monogamy as an ideal to say there's only one for you. And, you know, you'll have this one beautiful, we hear it in 80s power ballads, you know? We hear it in, we see it in Disney movies, we see it in romantic literature. Hell, even Katy Perry had the one that got away. You wanna know why the alpha-widow dynamic is so endemic for women? It's because of the soulmate myth. He's the one, he was, I really feel he was the one. I'm gonna divorce my great husband with who I had three kids with, and I'm gonna go and get, Stella got her groove back, man, eat, pray, love. I'm gonna divorce this loser and I'm gonna go back and see if I can find the one. And really what she's saying is she says, I wanna go back and have a good time with the alpha Chad that I fucked in the foam cannon party back in college, but I gotta have a rationale that says I gotta leave this perfectly good guy with three kids so I can go to Jamaica and find some dick-swinging dude to go and have, that's my one, right? I gotta go to, how Stella got her groove back, how, eat, pray, it's what we call divorce porn, right? Convincing women that it's okay, and they're incentivized to divorce the guy for cash and prizes, and they're gonna get a better dude because right before, it's called sticking the landing, right, right before they hit 40, so they're still hot enough to get the guy that they think is their soulmate from way back in the day. In two weeks, I am actually going to be in a foam cannon party in Jamaica. In Jamaica, paradise, yeah. And I will be taking videos and sending them to Rollo Tomasi, 100% I'm gonna be there. Yeah, and Mike Tang, you better be in those videos, too. Yeah, for sure, Mike, for sure. No, I mean, go back to what you said before, like when we talk about the divorce, people wanting to be with somebody forever, monogamy as a social construct was something that happened because we wanted, again, you understand this idea that we pick who we marry for the first 2,000, 3,000 years, let's say marriage is 11,000 years, let's put it with the Sumerians, it's 11,000 years old. We're fucking, we're taking two groups of wealthy landowners and marrying their children together, and now we have a tax-free ability to transfer wealth, and we keep them together, and we make sure that genetic line works. This idea that they fell in love with each other, we're talking the 16th century, maybe, something like that, Romeo and Juliet. It was before the romantic ideal. Yes. Shakespeare. It was before the idea that it was men's chivalric duty to defend m'lady's honor, like that was a reason to have a joust, right? That was a reason to have a duel. Did you ever see that movie, The Last Duel? No. It was basically over, okay, well, I don't, spoiler alert, but it was basically over a rape, essentially, is what it was, and defending m'lady's honor kind of thing. It was a fascinating, it got panned, but it was actually a fascinating story, because it's a true story, it was a real story, and so looking into how we did things with respect to defending m'lady's honor, you gotta remember, right then, that shit was new. It was a new concept for them to do that kind of stuff until, like, really get so pissed off that you would kill another man for the honor of, you know, for the honor of a woman. Have you read The Murderer Next Door by Dr. David Buss? It's something like 78% of murders are men killing other men over women. Oh, yeah. Yeah, oh, what was it, is it Claire Lehman who said, I think some of her stats were, yes, yeah, something like that, 90 some odd percent of deaths, or violent deaths between men in the past were over sexual access. Yeah, yeah, yeah, so I was just gonna say is that the idea of monogamy as a social construct, or it serves a purpose, I'm not against monogamy, I'm not against, like, spinning plates, clearly, I'm not against, necessarily, promiscuity, per se, because I understand that it's part of human nature, but I think that for a, how do you build a society, how do you build a, you know, how do you organize a society in the most efficient way? Well, how are you gonna have all these horny motherfuckers running around, you know, wanting to get laid, and you're saying, well, you can only get laid if you have a dowry, and if you have, like, seven heads of cattle, and, but, you know, even Fadlan over here can have four wives, and you, that means three of you ain't getting any wives, and that is gonna be something that's gonna, you know, cause a lot of violent deaths for sexual access. So when you look at countries that are primarily based on polyamory or polygamy, you'll see that they are far more violent towards some societies. Yeah, we're talking about Middle Eastern countries where you're at. Middle Eastern, that's why the Arab Spring happens, right? Because you have all these guys who are between the ages of 18 and 29, they got no prospects, they can't get laid because they're not supposed to get laid, because they don't have a job, and they can't marry anybody. So yeah, are they gonna rebel they're gonna go fuck things up Yeah, the likelihood is there the probability is certainly there So when I when I when I look at things like that I got I got a sort of balance or reconcile human nature as permissive promiscuity versus Monogamy being something that organizes society because when you look at like Western society the success of it being founded on socially enforced monogamy It it provided at least the idea the soul. There's a soul mate out there for me Sure, I I'm this loose I'm Quasimodo and I might be able to get that that cute little girl to come into the bell tower with me like that story Means that there's someone for everyone like with Kenny Rogers, you know the coward of the county. There's someone for everyone, right? That narrative gets replayed over and over and over again to the point where we say, okay Well, that's the proper way the right way that we should be doing things We don't really understand that we don't question the the mechanics behind that Why is what's the latent purpose of that? but we will have this this very big discussion about why you shouldn't be banging a whole bunch of women because that is it kind of Goes against the idea that there's someone out there for me And if you're fucking all these chicks one of those chicks might have been my soul mate Yeah, and you fucked her up for me And now I got to untangle her head and I think it was I did a show called the lick in the ice cream right it was how fees from the roommates was talking about like how guys would go into an ice cream shop and they would Lick each flavor of the ice cream, you know, like each one of these is a chick, right? And so when you get in there and you find out that all these flavors, you know You want to pick a flavor and suddenly you look and see some other dude has been licking your ice cream kind of thing It goes back to the alpha widow dynamic it goes back to the idea that now if guys who are alphas who can Break out of that monogamous socially enforced monogamy, right if they can break out of that or if we have like some Social imperative that says yeah, go ahead and fuck around, right? What that does is it crushes the soulmate myth or even the perception of the soulmate myth because the ice cream you licked or the One of the chicks that's in your sort of sexual history. That's might be that guy's future wife. Sure and now You're the alpha that he is widowed from and he fucking Anyone that looks I am actively on today's date experiencing this like today right now experience it Let's go to another explanation from a socioeconomic standpoint what you were just trying to explain before if I am a government and I want To increase the population of my community. It is I have two advantages for enforced monogamy number one If you go to the McComb School of Business at UT Austin, there's a the family unit is standing outside It's a man a woman and a child the family unit is sort of the basis of consumerism for a capitalist nation because the the the The Family unit consumes it buys two cars. It buys two televisions. It buys two cell phones. It has a mortgage It does all these kind of things and it runs up to levels of debt And so that's part of the reason why you do that The other thing is as like you said before We have fewer and fewer men that has zero options if we are arranging marriages or enforcing monogamy Now you have men at the bottom of the evolutionary scale or the bottom of the status scale and they're having sexual intercourse as opposed To strapping bombs to themselves and blowing up a coffee shop in Tel Aviv That's that's the reason why we will force monogamy But here's the trick what I do now in order to encourage these things the monogamy which allows for me to have a higher Population allows me to you know, have more socio-economic advancement and allows me to have less violence What I do is now I try to convince you it was always like this So I make up movies like Cinderella because then it was because it was always like this I show you Hallmark cards because it was always like this But then you take two seconds to go look at our evolutionary past or anthro Anthropological past you find out Genghis Khan was not interested in the soulmate He was raped everyone who was in front of us and and that that's the case that that was happening So we don't talk about that whenever people talk about soulmate I just think about like what if you were You were some living in Tibet like it back in you know in the 15th cent or the 13th I came here Genghis Khan live the end of the 13th century I believe when you're living in Tibet and then all sudden this gang of raiders comes in and rapes all that kills all the women There are they where's your soulmate? Which one was your soulmate? 60 million people dying in 1919 from the Spanish flu Which one of them was your soulmate with a did they all have soulmates the little kids who died like again? It's just the when you use the mythology that's used to reinforce correctly enforcement. I would just rather know the truth Yeah, exactly again. Here's here's the main question the big question for the red pill Would you rather be happy or would you rather know the truth? Yeah, I tell people when you when you join MOA you paid me for the fucking truth if it makes you unhappy I'm sorry and people outside of MOA or people who don't watch my podcast I don't care if you know the truth you get to the learn the truth when you come on here That is my responsibility if it makes you upset don't watch But this is you're only going to get things that are very rarely do I express opinions on here? I express things that are based in science or either in something anecdotally where I've seen numerous people Banging your head against the wall too because I tell you that every time I try to I try to make this a point it's like When people come at me and they have criticisms of the red pill one of the most common one is it well first of all They're they're arguing from position of ignorance They have no earthly clue what I've said in the past who the fuck I am never read my book don't care They just heard a few you know 30-second clips. You know Andrew Tate has talked about this as well It's like that's the your total assessment of who I am in this capacity I've been doing this for 20 some odd years, so I can't expect everybody to be 100% up on everything. I've ever done however I've always expressed. This is that the red pill is not an ideology It is not a philosophy, and that's the first thing out of anybody's mouth because they can't Interpret it or can't process it in it will really anything But like the red pill in particular because it conflicts with a lot of their beliefs But they can't interpret it through any other lens than philosophy ideology or belief or religion or whatever like it's a cult roll up Tomas he's a cult leader. It's like no, dude I am connecting dots and you can tell me what you think about those dots am I equipping guys am I helping guys? With giving them the tools to live a better life. Yes. Yes, I am. I hope I am I hope I'm saving lives by giving you access to information so that you can go and build a better life But it all comes back to one thing Would you rather be happy or would you rather be right? And so I don't deal in shoulds I deal in is and so when people say well We're all the red pill philosophy is this I like click because you say philosophy I already know that I'm dealing with a guy who's seeing this through a put through a filter or a lens of belief and What the reason why they do that is because it for they can't see it through any other way But also if they can say or they can turn the red pill into a belief or a cult or a philosophy or an ideology Then they can attack it in just in the same way as we would attack like Social construction ism or anything that the woke wants to make subjective or relative now It's a belief set now. You're a televangelist now You're a cult leader and that they can they can argue with they can't argue with the facts. They can't argue with empiricism They can't argue with objective reality, but they can't say well It's an ideology and I can I could that's I can argue against that You're a really bad man Rolo when Johannes Kepler came up with the laws of planetary motion That was not an ideology or a philosophy and then later on when Isaac Newton came up with the laws of motion from from Johannes Kepler's observations that is not a philosophy that he came up with those are laws of motion later on the the laws of thermodynamics So that it's not a philosophy evolutionary psychology is not a philosophy evolutionary psychology evolutionary psychology They're again a lot of people like well, why should we trust these studies? I'll give you a couple reasons number one Most of them are done anonymously like for instance why women have sex the women are surveyed anonymously and number two and this one I really love when you look at people's Porn searches when you look at people's Google searches you actually get a much truer Understanding of who they are and what they believe in and so there are different ways of surveying these people But the problem is what should happen is if any of these evolutionary psychology studies are incorrect you they should be falsifiable And what you should do is have an alternate study that shows that they're falsifiable and that never Ever ever happens the best way dr. Bus He put or actually it was Gad said who said this Evolutionary psychology is falsifiable and has never been falsified the same thing with like the the parental investment hypothesis Basically in any two-gender species the gender that has more parental investment is going to be the select the more selective of the two genders There is no example where this does not exist Even when you deal with like seahorses where the males carry the children the males are more selective It's just the way that it is evolutionary psychology is not a Philosophy evolutionary psychology is a study of science and that's what that's what makes it so difficult And why people hate it so much is because of that Why I always harp on the idea that the red pill is like the Chilton manual You know a Chilton manual is like you when you know, okay, like if you're an auto mechanic, okay Yeah for the car like we got these are the parts numbers and here's how you put together a V You're not in 69 color that we call the Air Force Tech order. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, it's the Chilton manual That's what it is. It's not meant to tell you, you know question your belief in God or or your your Convictions of how you think men and women ought to be these are this is just what it is That's why I harp on the word praxeology. And yes, goddamn it It is a praxeology and it is based on empiricism and what happens is people when they look up praxeology They think of it in terms of economic terms because I yes, I I know I do know this But if you go back and you look at the depth the original definition of Praxeology, it is the study of human behavior from the perspective that human behavior has a purpose and has a function behind it What's the late? Well intersex intersexual? That's why I call it a proxy. Sure It will intersect sake and intersexual dynamics has an economy to it. Obviously, there is a supply and demand So it is an economy like I don't know that there's only so again as I make more money and I get more social Media followers, you'd be shocked. I'm let you guys know this more women seem to want to date me. It's fucking crazy I don't know how to explain it But it seems to happen because it's an it is a function of a crazy how that it is crazy how that happens Let's talk about it and the more jacked and juicy Crazy, let's talk about this Washington Post post posted these studies a long time ago You show them sometimes these these graphs. One of them is 28% of men showing zero sexual partners between the time Yeah, the GSS studies Can we go over some of those because a lot I show these two women and they're just like I don't understand What are you talking about? Every guy knows a whore every guy Make sure you got all you talking about the the fucking VIP host. I had sex with he's he hasn't had seven sexual partners He's had 700. What are you talking about? And I'm like, hey, did you look at the guy who gave you your hamburger at Wendy's? Who's fucking him? Did you look at the who's his soulmate? Who's his soulmate? Did you look at the the the person the cashier at Walmart? Would you have had sex with him? No, not only would you not have had sex with him. You didn't notice he existed so when I show you this whole thing 28% of men having zero sexual partners in the last year and you don't believe it you do These 28% of men you legitimately don't recognize they exist You wonder where Andrew Tate came from it's because you ignored that they existed Let's say everything Andrew Tate said is wrong and everything red pill is wrong Let's just play devil's advocate all of its wrong You still you think that these people just don't exist you're gonna wave your hand as a feminist be like well, fuck you I don't agree with your opinion. Therefore you disappear. Do you think they disappeared? Do you think that they they don't have internet access? Do you think that they don't vote they have no economic guidance whatsoever? Do you think that they don't have feelings that they don't have testosterone? They don't have muscles They don't have the ability to work the ability to type sounds a lot like Female solipsism, doesn't it? I mean, it's just it's just a situation where like you have to admit that they existed now Let's go over these studies specifically the two the one had to do with virginity 27% of men What was that? It was like between the 18 and 30. What was do you remember? Do you remember those studies? Okay, so between okay, so the study was between I want to say was 2008 and 2018 Yeah, so and it was part of the general survey study, which is like an American. It's so this is the United States here Okay, and it corresponds with the census at the time as well. So they take that every 10 years as we know so they the Stats basically showed this is that it was like 28% of men Between 2008 and 2018 are literally having no sex zero like no sexual partners and it has astronomically risen since about 2010 well 2007 is when you you first see the the hockey stick spike and that is the year that the Facebook app was introduced to Introduce the iPhone also the year when women started taking white women started taking Antidepressants at astronomical numbers as well If you look at the spike in that and you what I've done, but by the way I have used that everybody in the Manosphere has used that that's that that stat but what they don't do that's one Data point. Yeah, okay You have to take those data points and you have to like Correlate them with other data points so from the even from the same study You can see that and that's just 18 to 29 if you go and you look past 29 up until 45 Men are still having less sex even in those other demo Okay, you know once you're gonna pass the 29 demographic who gives a shit right but wait We see that and we see that astronomical spike because those ones are the people who are those are the guys who are gonna have The Arab Spring, right? So but then when you look at women and you see that there it's jumped just a little bit They're having less sex, but not nearly as much as like young men between the same demographic cohort, right? So when you look at that, how do we correlate or how do we interpret that one data point? I interpret it as this is that we have of course, we're you know in a social media environment right now We're in a sexual marketplace that is globalized sexual marketplace. Yeah, we can literally see Statistically hypergamy right there. Okay. So what happens is it depends on what your ideological bent is So when you were when I have heard like Matt Walsh or Prager you report these exact same numbers, you know what they're saying? Oh, it's because young women are fucking older guys It's because they're having sex with older men who are more more Made and they're more mature and whatever and what that does is it feeds into the personal responsibility grift that they all promote So it's like well if men would just take more responsibility and get off their asses and start being you know Better than women will be better and you'd be getting laid, right? No Women are sharing the hot alphas is what the fuck they're doing. How about we talk about that? You will never hear that from Dennis Prager. You will never hear that from Daily Wire You will never have that correlation made because it is unflattering to the female nature and we all think that to solve men's problems Is to pile on more and more responsibility for those guys without having any single any authority in that as it is But still it points a really ugly finger at hypergamy being true. Here it is right here It's not it's not that these women want to fuck old dudes on yachts, they're fucking guys and they're sharing that guy So we're lean and I made this point before we were talking about Paul I have promiscuity and that's where I I did the show on on Tim Burkhead's book and I talked about this I said we're at a point. We're on a stage right now in society where women don't need men. They'll say this Oh sure. I don't I don't need no man. I make my own money I'm walk like the boss and talk like the boss, you know, and They'll they're very proud and very it's hubris is what it is They get to that point and they say I don't need no man, but I want a man Okay, what kind of man do you want? I want the guy who looks like Andrew Tate I want the guy who looks like Jason Momoa I want the guy who's gonna give me the the highest hottest fucking sex I can get Who is the apex alpha and hopefully I'll be able to lock him down But if I can't I'm more than willing to share that guy either directly or indirectly Whether I cop to it or I don't and so what you're seeing right now is you're seeing a reversal and a sort of a return To polygamy, but it's not men that are doing it It's women who have see that is the only choice for the men They want to get with because they don't need those beta men who are in that 28% right there They don't need those guys anymore for provisioning protection or parental investment. Yeah, because either they've got a college degree They've got a business degree. They've got a business themselves there. They've pretty much settled or Perceptually, they've settled the idea that I don't need a man for the beta buck side of hypergamy. So the only thing that's left fucking Jason Let's talk about this women are always shocked whenever I bring this up, right? The average North American male has had seven sexual partners in his entire life. So let's just look let's look at this from a Statistical standpoint. We know that first 28% of men are at zero, right? And then when we get to the average the mean we're at seven, so let's just let's keep graphing this out We're we now we're at seven. Let's just say this top 60th percentile We have had seven sexual partners. Once we get to the 80th percentile We're talking 400 sexual partners. Once we get to the 90th percentile, we're talking about like Bilzerian We're talking about 1400 1500 sexual partners for men. It looks like a hockey stick It literally goes like flat and then it's a little bit and then once you get above this certain style where you're like in the Top 10% of earners you're good-looking. Whatever the number of sexual partners happens I'm not trying to be an asshole and I'm not trying to be arrogant Let me tell you from first-hand experience. This is absolutely true because I've been on both sides of the scale It is not it's not you don't get have a few more partners. It is Unbelievably, it's ten to one difference. So and so when you see this when you see this the spike that happens I don't blame women for this. I do I understand what happens is look. Let's look at Amazon. Remember back in 1985 We would go to the hardware store for our hardware. We would go to the diaper store We would go to a different store. We'd go to the nursery for our plant shit We would go to different stores for different things and go to blockbuster for our videos Now we go to Amazon for everything. So we see how the internet globalized purchasing now We almost all go to one place for all of our shit Why do you think that was going to happen any differently with dating? Of course, it's the same thing Okay, I'm just I'm telling you I was talking about there and he said like something like 50% of the women He's been with her in relationships Currently in relationships when they have sex with them like this this idea that like it really is like what you said before There is this group of men at the top that are having all the sexual access and then there's this group of men at the Bottom who aren't and this is not a cultural thing. This has happened throughout history Biological evolutionary evolutionary Mubarak the bloodthirsty 888 children, you know I'm talking about right the the from Morocco that read about him that this whole idea Now here's that here's the thing. Here's where I differ from a lot of guys Okay, not all but that 28% my whole thing is don't hate the game Get in the fucking gym get in the game be a player. You're not an average, dude Know that if this top 10% is the one that's winning do everything in your power short of death To get there. How much does it mean to you to get in that top 10%? Nobody loves women more than me women are the way they are I do you can tell me women like status and like guys who are taller than shorter Have I gone to a party? But we've been with a hot girl and she walks off with some dude who's a male strippers Of course, it's happened to me. It sucks doesn't make me hate women. It's just evolution got swooped on I got swooped on so, you know what? I'm gonna hit that motherfucking bench press next week and I'm gonna don't wish you were easier. Wish you were better Yeah, wish you were better. Don't wish it was easier cuz it's not easier if you wish it easier That's when I see these dudes Like I said before moving to Panama moving to fucking Eastern Europe and it just I don't I don't want to I don't want to Give up, but you understand that. Yeah, exactly And so as I was saying before when you look I've done several shows on the GSS study when you look at those Stats you have to correlate them against other stats that really like you say, okay, it was 2008 2018 What else happened during that time? Well, if you look at how college enrollment rates have declined for men and have skyrocketed for women and by the way I think one of the big mistakes that we make right now is I Always hear the stat of how it's 60% women and 40% men in college enrollment. Yes enrollment not in graduation Enrollment and we're having this conversation now because Biden decided he wanted to forgive like $10,000 of student debt Which of course two-thirds of that is owned by women. Okay, but that's for Graduation if you look at graduation rates, my daughter just graduated from UNLV, right? She's got a master's degree I went I looked at the stats, you know being me right to see what the what the gender differential was it was like 68 or almost 70% women and 30% guys were graduating with a master's or above like a doctorate as well And I thought well that kind of like puts things into a different perspective It's one thing if you're going in there and you're enrolling. Did you complete it it? Well, there's 60% women and 40% men All right. Did you go through it? Okay, you went through four years of college You want some men are dropping out are dropping out exactly so there's you have to look at those stats and then compare that versus the same time period as we see an Increase in guys not getting laid right and then you can also you have to look at other like sort of demographic cohort Studies that go along with that and this is straight out of dr. David Buss's book Okay, 80% of men are deemed unattractive By women online on hinge bumble tinder seeking arrangements What you know, whatever the top 10% of men on tinder are getting 63% of the right swipes Mm-hmm, and I believe the top 20% We're getting a it's like something like a 78 or 80 percent of the right swipes the top 20% We're getting 80% of the right swipes on tip So so the mistake is is this is that we call this the Pareto principle or the 80-20 rule, right? Okay, so the mistake is to think this is that 20% of guys are fucking 80% of the women. No, that's not it dumbass Okay 100% of women want to get with the top 20% of guys that leaves 80% of guys Who are the invisible ones who are the sandwich artists who that they completely believe women are completely oblivious to because they are Unattractive they are not maybe he'll do they are I would never even I wouldn't even recognize his existence, right? yeah, so you've got 80% of guys who are never gonna get swiped or never gonna get a you know, a Callback or any interest or how way back or whatever the fuck it is So you got 80 those are the 80 percenters? That's why I always say the 80 percenters like the beta males are 80 percenters, right? So then you got the 20 percenters who are the maybe he might he's not unattractive, but he's not necessarily attractive It's just like I would like to he's interesting enough that I would want to go meet that guy Let's see if he's got what it takes Then there are the four and a half percent of guys that women will actually standard deviations Is that why you'd pick four and a half percent? No. No, I didn't pick it If this is actually straight out of David Buss's research and a Rob Henderson Steve Stewart Williams David Buss and I can't remember who remember the one standard deviation is sixty eight point two percent two standard deviations is is Ninety five point five percent which means outside of two standard deviations would be four and a half percent Four and a half percent of the population is also homosexual four and a half percent there's a bunch of four and a half percent actually comes out to be a lot of different numbers in a normal distribution four and a half percent of guys are hot enough that women want to swipe and initiate a Conversation with them to possibly have sex or possibly have a relationship or get a date They are the ones that women will initiate with so you've got the 20 percenters and of the 20 percenters that might do Foreign of the four and a half percent are the guys that are hot enough for women to go Yeah, I want to fuck that guy. That's a top 20% of the top 20 and that's what we're there So the 40 out of the four and a half percent, that's the Justin Waller's. That's the Andrew Tate's That's the guys who are like way up top at the ape. That's you. That's a Justin Waller Justin Waller came out with me one time bro, and I was hanging out with these girls I was like and they all just stopped and just stared at Justin Waller. Justin Waller looks like a tight end, bro I've been at restaurants with him and and and watched like just the average women go like yes, sir Oh But yeah, I could tell you stories about yeah, and then he won't want me to say to make public Yeah, but anyways, but there so you have the four and a half percenters and really when guys tell me I'm not in the 20% I'll never I'm like it's worse than that, dude They could women aren't actually actively coming to seek you that is a data point that correlates with other studies Right, so it also reinforces hypergamy. So when we were talking about the ok Cupid Studies that say, you know women of at 23 years of age are the are the peak demographic and for women They're looking for a guy in the long term They're looking for a guy who's anywhere between three to seven years older than them, right? Okay, we can see that from old data, but we can also sort of infer hypergamy from those numbers We can infer hypergamy from the GSS studies. We can also infer hypergamy from well I'll just say David Buss's research for those percentages But so we see that women are gravitating towards the top apex guys who the four and a half percenters How is that affecting those guys in the GSS study who own 28% aren't getting laid? Well, we can we infer that the guys who are getting you know, the swipes of the four and a half percent Can we infer that those are the guys that maybe the women have been fucking for the last ten years Instead of oh they most want to get with older more mature guys who have you know Are more emotionally available and make up some cock-and-bull rationale around that rather than just say, you know what? There's two sides to hypergamy there's alpha fucks and beta bucks and you want to know why I get frustrated with Buss or with the Peterson or or anyone else certainly a Hector Garcia why do I get frustrated with them because they have this mound of fucking evidence and You it points all the data points to what I've been talking about for the last 20 years and like nope Must be older guys, right because it fits in with the narrative. I don't want to lose my tenure I don't want to I don't want to I don't blame him alienate half of my audience. I need him on that wall I need dr. Buss on that. Oh, I do too. And I was gonna say I as a Statistician as research. I will always quote them people have given me grief about quoting Pinker before in the past I'm like, I don't care what he does I want to know what the what the freaking data is and I'm going to make those connections Because what happens is when we have like the alpha fucks and the beta bucks the other side of that like when you have Peterson talking about intersexual dynamics, he'll talk about only one side exists. It's only the beta buck side Yeah, all women want men with status. They want men with money They want guys who are good fathers who are going to be parentally invested and you know reproductive costs and everything like that But meanwhile Chad is fucking, you know All these dudes in the in the you know phone and licking the fucking ice cream over here and you just completely, you know Tom, you know tunnel vision with blinders on don't want to see that your little girl wants to fuck the guy on spring break She wants that that's part of the did that's that's the other side of it that you want to ignore because if you were to address that you would get canceled which is what happened for those of you who don't know like from the incel community a Chad it means a dude who just naturally is good I know like a Chad Chad or alpha male Thundercock or whatever Chad just means a guy who doesn't area. Yeah, we'll just walks in He just normally has just all these things going on those area is definitely a gig. Yeah. There you go Um, so so going back to what you said before Let's let's talk about this because I do wanted to move over into this section you have made several videos where you talked about Andrew Tate probably should have expected what happened, right? So when Andrew Tate was doing like I Know in full disclosure, I like Andrew we talk on a couple times He's probably watching for sure The thing is, you know when he says, you know women are property No, my mom is nobody's fucking property So it's hard for me to stand up when he says that listen I don't want the 19th Amendment repealed and I and women pick me up in their cars all it I'd not have some female friends with really nice cars. They pick me up in their cars and they drive the motherfuckers I don't care So I it's a little different for me But I still I like him and the the idea of canceling him is absurd First off, let's let's go over a couple things when they canceled Alex Jones It tripled his revenue on InfoWars when they canceled Donald Trump He became the most Google person in the world when the right try to cancel Colin Kaepernick He became a martyr and got a Nike campaign Cancel culture doesn't work hadn't taken an NFL snap in three years Nike Cancel culture duck dude. He's got he's on Madden. He's actually back He canceled culture. Listen to me cancel culture doesn't work I don't have a lot of opinions and I don't plant my flag often. This is where I'm planting my flag I will literally and figuratively die for this one. I Support people's ability to to express themselves. I had flat earthers on of course I don't agree with the fucking flat earth is what they say. I'm not going to stop them from saying what they want to say Freedom of speech has two sides to it One side is the good happy ideas right the idea of a free market economy or Charles Darwin's idea of evolution, right? This is free speech a lot of churches didn't like that that idea the religious sect didn't like when When Galileo was saying that we the earth goes around the Sun free speech has a good side to it Free speech also has the part where idiots go up there and say stupid shit I want to hear dumb people say stupid shit. It makes my life easier I know who to vote for and who to buy shit from let them talk. That's the thing when you cancel them It doesn't work. I am I swore into the u.s. military and February would in February 21st 2004 and I said I Swear to protect and defend the Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic The First Amendment of the Constitution says a right to freedom of assembly freedom of expression I don't that I will fucking die when I talk to people who are like, hey, man I want to change my gender motherfucker. I will kill someone to allow you to if you want to change your gender I support your ability to do that people want to get married that are gay I support your ability to do that because even when people were sitting there kneeling I wouldn't have knelt if I was in the NFL, but I support their ability to do that We can't it's so crazy to me when I listen to female social media influencers Who had their accounts taken away for no fucking reason sitting there. Okay with this Let me ask you a question if you're a female influencer right now And they took your account away because you have boobs, you know who i'm talking to There's hundreds of you list watching the shit right now thousands When they took your account away when they suspended you for animal cruelty and there were no animals on your account You remember that you know who i'm talking to Did you think that it was cool when they took andrew tate's account away? Do you think meta now has more power? Or less power and let me ask you something since he didn't get due process the next time they take your account away Because you have a butt do you think you're gonna get due process now? It's really funny and it's fun to say. Hey, you know what? uh Germany invaded austria, but that's not my fucking problem. Well, then germany invaded poland. That's not my fucking problem And neville chamberlain watches germany invade france. Okay, maybe it's my fucking problem and then they start bombing london Now it's your fucking problem. Well, you know what they got rid of neville chamberlain That's essentially what happened for those of you read a book if you don't know about world wars Please do please read a book. Don't listen to it read it It's fun and it's fun to cancel people when they don't agree with you, but someday Mark my words They're gonna come for you and when they do who is going to be there to support you? I don't care if what you say is so fucking antithetical to what I believe I will die To support your right to say it and I will never ever support the right of anybody to cancel anybody for shit When whose quote that was like I don't agree with what you have to say But I would die for your right to die for your right to say I forget the quote alex jones when he said the stuff about the you know, the the Sandy hook shit when the people were all actors or whatever He had the right to say it and then those families had the right to sue his ass And he lost a defamation case both things can be true I am not I cannot I happen Again, let me say this again. I happen to like andrew if I didn't like andrew i'm still so completely Against this idea that you cancel him after he was cancelled on uh, uh, tristan tate's channel They used to get 20 000 people on a live stream 130 000 people on their live stream. It was actually 145 145 000 rumble I was on it. That's why I watched for an hour and 15 minutes There's your hey cancel culture That's what you get. That's what you get. You can argue with me. You can tell me that i'm wrong It doesn't make any fucking difference what you say cancel culture doesn't work Cancel culture doesn't work. So this is where I take you know, I don't I don't like to express a lot of opinions on here I like to uh, I I joke with my friends anymore. I don't have opinions anymore. I just have podcast segments. Yeah This is my opinion. This is not my opinion. Uh, this is a fact this doesn't work. It's stupid It's bad and it sends it sends everything backwards one more thing meta. I got news for you. You're not a champion for women No one hates women more than you You sit there and you give women the ability to make a living then when they when you say well This is too lascivious. You're being sexually suggestive. Then you take away their instagram account. Okay, cool You take away their instagram account. Well, i'm gonna go make money on only fans. Oh, no You can't make money on only fans either bro. What is that? You want to talk about grooming? What the fuck is that? They can't make money any they can't make money with you. They can't make money with anyone else. Got it Understand that you're not a champion for women because you cancel and you take you're fucking hypocrite. Sorry No, I was gonna say so I I uh, I was uh asked who was the last oh I was on with jedi abila and we had this conversation. I said this is like Uh, like that's the constitutional american, you know, this is why we have free speech, you know, but you got to remember Why is it and where did that where did that amendment the first amendment? Right? Where did that come from? Well king george was a motherfucker. Yeah that that too, but it also comes from the idea. I want to say it's hellenic You know greece or some shit like that. I don't i'm probably gonna butcher this but the idea is this is that the The only way to test the strength of an idea Is in the crucible of open debate open debate and if you do not have a crucible of open debate You will never come to objective truth. So if somebody says something that's you know, we never landed on the moon Okay, i'm willing you have the right to say that I have the right to I can have the right to tell you you're full Of shit, but if I can go and look at this or the sky is blue and it's not blue, right? Whatever you can go and say whatever the hell you want to say and the fundamental right to do that is one thing What you're expressing is the other thing so but you will never be able to come to uh, the idea of what objective truth is unless you can have that conversation in the first place, so Andrew tate is not the first one to get canceled. I remember when milo yiannopoulos got kicked off of twitter Because he said something about that that big big girl in uh in ghostbusters, uh, the big black girl I can't remember what her name was. It was the all-female version of ghostbusters. They kicked him off Um, and that was that was like sort of like my introduction to it Let me say something. I don't have a problem with them making a female version of ghostbusters But don't get mad at me for not watching it. Those are those are those two things How about this don't cancel me for being critical of that, right? So but then okay So now what we've done is we have subcontracted our free speech to big tech right now That's why so when you have the government that is in bed with big tech That's how you get a full cancellation now He now that was just milo then you got ruch b also got canceled as a result of that shit Uh, alex jones got canceled because of that, uh to a lesser degree I would say, uh, jordan peterson did but they kind of like ratioed him. They kind of marginalized him Um, there's uh has been uh, james demore when james demore Do you know who james demore is james demore was a tech at google and he had put some memo out Uh, just addressing some facts about how men and women are biologically different Get him out of here and everybody had him on the talk show or whatever Um, so there's there's been this long history of big tech canceling people now people You never heard of james demore before I was because he was sort of in my sphere at that time And I look at this and I go those are just like sort of the bush league guys that they can kind of you know A rash a ratio or they can like cancel that guy. Now. You've got an andrew tate who has an army He's got a worldwide army for him and they cancel him through Through youtube through twitter through tiktok through instagram Uh every major social media platform, they cancel him and he loses his stripe and he loses his gumroad Uh payment processors for his affiliate marketing thing All on the all well all within the same like three days two He was talking about like literally watching apps disappear from his phone coordination. It was insane. That is coordination I was texting him. I was like, bro, like because I had a friend at meta and it was like, hey My friends are trying to get your account back. He's like don't bother He's like the people at meta took my shit away tiktok preemptively bad. He didn't have a tiktok account They said andrew if you're gonna try to make one. Fuck you. You can't have one One more thing I want to make this absolutely clear andrew tate Did not break terms of service on instagram call me on that Tell me i'm wrong Show me where he posted one single thing on instagram now people reposted his stuff from youtube for sure He didn't he did not break terms of service one single time on instagram and instagram got rid of him If we're going to use that logic, why does oj simpson have a twitter? I will let me hear this People ask me this all the time. I say do you have backups? Are you on rumble? I'm getting i'm pushing over to rumble now, but I also I mirror this very podcast right now I mirror to odyssey right now. So I I do have backups. I do have archives. I have a clips channel. I have You know shorts channel There's ways to sort of back things up all of my you know My blog posts are all backed up, of course my my books and everything else but that's the scary even the scarier thing is like Uh amazon owns 87 percent of the self-publishing mark of really the publishing market period if they want you to disappear on the same day as your Your youtube account they'll make you disappear It's all coordinated and that right there is I think the more dangerous lesson of of andrew tate with respect to free speech Now people will tell me rollo. Well, they they they canceled him because of misogyny They canceled him because of what he was saying. He was outspoken. He was he's an outrage broker, right? And what he was saying was pissing off women and a lot of really sort of what I call allies, right? They're the cuttlefish, but I agree. He did say some stuff that I was like, oh, he did Women are lazy and that they're probably he said those things. Yeah, he did and he did say those things, right? But that wasn't the reason the reason was he owned the algorithm. That's why oh for sure The first one that i've ever found who could successfully game the youtube algorithm what on what he did was he had his army with separate channels Create and there are subcontractors, right? They're creating more and more of his um his uh videos or their derivatives of his videos And he he was the first one who would successfully like spam the algorithm with his stuff And then that transferred over onto instagram that transferred over onto tiktok and all these other social medias and really The fact that that was the easier way to go about it or the way to sort of subvert big tech is by getting an army To rebroadcast all of your all of your your messaging That's kind of something that they can't tolerate and I once I realized what exactly his uh his marketing situation was I'm, like I don't know how long this is going to last because they're going to get pissed off that he's exposing the he's The code in the matrix basically is what he's doing And so as a result, I would say, you know, of course what he said they can just say well That's why we we it's hate speech, right? We got him off there Really it's because there's so many people because teachers had their kids Talking repeating tate talking points in their in their in their schools for sure so that was like that was something that was really like um endemic in society offline, right and so If that's the reach that he can get then why would like why would they want him to stay on there to be able to do? And why why okay, it's one thing to cancel him off of youtube for free speech, right? It's one thing we can talk about censorship Why did stripe and why did gumroad cancel him at the same time? Do you know it was funny? They did the same rsd during the whole july thing the exact same thing I was talking to owen about it when it happened and they they took away their stripe accounts. They took away several people Yeah, so what they're doing is what ruch ruch used to call taking away their bread They took away andrew's bread, which is they they cut off his oxygen supply And now if it was just about what he was saying online That could be like, okay. Well, we're not going to support you, uh on instagram or meta or whatever else It's another thing to say, okay stripe and gumroad, uh payment processors We want you to shut his ass down too On the same within the same three days that we're doing this that again is I think that's the more dangerous aspect of this It's it's because it's it is absolutely coordinated and i've i've i've Was talking to patrick bet david about this and I said here's the kind of like a an example of what he did was do you remember when all those investors got together and they uh, they uh did the Uh, the the big it was a short I forget the name of the what what the buzzword is But it's they got all these guys online on like reddit groups who are investors And they put money into game stop and they put money into the meme stock shop. Yeah To stop that short right because they were gonna they were gonna short that in 2021 They got all these people to put money into it and completely fucked over these uh, the wall street It was a fundamentally good short, I mean game stop was going to go out of business eventually And so what they did was they got enough people. Yes together To fuck these guys over no and then to the point where uh, was it a robin hood and some other you know was So they so here's essentially what happened because I traded through the whole thing What happens is when you short when you go long a stock? It's great If you want to get rid of it, you can just sell it right if it if the stock collapses You're generally gonna if the price goes low enough somebody will buy it If nobody will buy it at least the market makers will buy like sas like black rock or sesquihanna or something like that When you short a uh something right in this case, I believe they're actually shorting stock I don't know if that was the case game stop. Yeah So there's a limited amount of stock that you can short So if you guys ever trade on a brokerage, you're gonna see what's called ntb Which is none to borrow or uh htb which is hard to borrow if you get to htb or ntb What happens is the interest rate that you have to pay in order to borrow that stock starts to increase and it gets incredibly? Confiscatory like it gets ridiculously high after a while The problem is this if you're in a short position and the stock price goes up You have to get out of the position and that brokerage will charge you anything They want they will literally the slippage will be massive. You will be incredibly screwed You won't just lose the 10 percent you lost on the the rise of the price you'll lose additional money because of the interest rate and because The the your broker now has to go source stock in order for you to replace the stock that you shorted Shorting is dangerous But the the problem with it is like you need it to be able to short otherwise you have these big Uh rises and falls that you see in cryptocurrency because you can't short crypto. That's part of that's part of the reason Why there's an issue there? Um, and also with the with the stock options It's the same kind of thing like you are on the hook unlimited Unlimited amount of if you short stock options You're on the hook for that stock option until the until the whole thing expires And there's no guarantee you can ever get out of it if there's no liquidity, especially in smaller Which is why when all those guys got together and said, okay everybody We're going to get together. We're going to buy GameStop and we're going to buy AMC to the point where they were fucking these guys over so thoroughly that Robin hood had to stop the trading for those those particular stocks stocks, right because they said okay Well, they're gaming the system. They're playing by the fucking rules that you put out there They just got enough guys to come in here and game your algorithms. It's exactly what tate did Maybe he intentionally or unintentionally, but he had enough guys who said we're all going to play by the rules we all are agreeing to play by the rules together and we're going to we're going to game the algorithm and who and just like Robin hood YouTube says uh, you're playing by the rules. You haven't broken any terms of you know terms of agreement for for instagram But we're still going to ban you anyways because you're gaming us and because uh, we're going to change the rules on you right now Yeah, I mean that was that was a crazy thing that happened there I mean those those I I feel like those hedge funds got lazy and that your losses and short positions are unlimited They're unlimited losses. You can really screw these people over the problem The thing that I thought was funny was afterwards they kept trying to make it happen again And I kept and I kept telling my friends i'm like do you understand you have pissed off? Some of the largest financial institutions in the world you think that you have this secret reddit group that they're never going to find out About I promise you half of that reddit group now is full of bots and people that work at fucking blackrock That's what that's what's going on And they are like the next time you try to do they're gonna they're gonna try to fucking Bait you into a pump and dump at this point. They are not going to let you embarrass them again I promise you that won't ever happen again. Google has been Quiet last quietly or not. So quite the only reason I know about this is because they send me like, you know notifications for my youtube channel, but google has been Instituting new rules for affiliate marketing for their terms of terms of use Since, I want to say March of this year, they have been rejiggering all of their affiliate marketing agreement side of things and I don't know, I can't say for sure that it was sort of like, you know, prompted by something like what Andrew Tate's doing, but like, for instance, if you are doing a product review, they want to know that you actually have the product and you actually know what the fuck you're talking about rather than just trying to pump something off on your own social media for influencers. But then they have been rewriting the rules for affiliate marketing links, like for instance yesterday I did a show with Troy Francis and James Tusk and they've got a new program out called The Edge and I had my affiliate link in there as the very first one and I'm getting flagged for that because they want to know that you've actually taken the course and you know what you're talking about and then you have to jump through some hoops. Now it's still back on there, you can go do that, but they're tightening the affiliate marketing because of what happened with War Room and Hustle University, yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Yes. Let me ask you your opinion about some other people that you talk about often. Let's go. Let's talk shit about people. No, not talk shit, but like it's interesting because you seem to have like a very cordial relationship with Michaela Peterson and Jordan Peterson, but at the same time you and you criticize somewhat Jordan Peterson. I don't know, I've just seen clips. What is your belief about Jordan Peterson overall? I think cordial is a nice diplomatic way to put it. I thought you, I kind of got the vibe that you guys liked each other. She's been sniping at me from behind a block since about January of this year. Oh, really? Yes. I have a real kind of love-hate relationship with Michaela. I did an interview with her back in December of last year, which was a pre-record and again, just like you know how Andrew always says, you know, like people will take him out of context in these 30 second clips, well that's exactly what, that was my education in that by the way. That's exactly what Michaela did was she just like mined that two hour long podcast for just buzz clips that would put her in the best light and put me in the worst light. And there was a point where we got to, I think it was in April of this year and she was trying to make a move I guess from Nashville to Miami and she went on her Instagram account and she was petitioning just random people who followed her on Instagram to help her babysit Scarlett while she was there and I'm like, are you out of your fucking mind? And so I did this full, it was almost an emergency podcast and I happened to be going to Miami at that time because I was doing Fresh and Fit and I was like, where the fuck is your dad? Where the fuck is your soon to be husband? Where is the fuck is the baby daddy in all of this? You're out there petitioning random people on your Instagram for a babysitter because you want to go party in fucking Miami? Which was ironic because it was exactly what I held her feet to the fire to back in November when I said it's the kill to party dynamic, which is I'm not going to show my kids on my Instagram because I don't want people to think I'm a single mom. So she was just one example of that. She lost her shit about that. And then I saw her like when she went and did the, I don't know if she was drunk or what the fuck was going on, but she did like videos trying to cover her ass on that thing. It's not that big a deal. And she's like, you know, buy a pool somewhere in Fort Lauderdale or something. And so what I did is I did this show and I said, look, Michaela, I, I'm a father. I had a daughter. I said, I'm in Miami, bring her to panorama towers at 9am and I will take care of your kid for you while you're out doing whatever the fuck it is that you're doing. I'll take her deep sea fishing. She'll have a great time with uncle Rolo, you know, and of course I was only half serious when I did that, but it was like, I was just like, why the fuck, why is this a good idea to you? I like as a father myself and when my daughter was like, say five years old, that would never have been a concept in my head to just like petition random people and say, Hey, will you watch my daughter while I'm over here, you know, having a good time or doing whatever the fuck it is I need to do. But as far as Michaela's concerned, she's been riding her dad's coattails for a long time. She manages his account. Peterson is not what he used to be. And again, this is not to just talk shit about Peterson. I like a lot of what Peterson has had to say in the past. I disagree with a lot of the stuff that his takes on intersexual dynamics because he's again one of these guys who only focuses on one aspect of hypergamy. It's always the nice safe beta buck side and not the alpha fuck side. So I've got, I've got a history with him, but, um, uh, the idea of me actually having a debate or an interview with Jordan Peterson is probably not going to happen in this lifetime. Okay. Interesting. I mean, I, I want to like him more than I do and it's not that I dislike him. It's just a function of when I read the book, the first chapter I was like, wow, this is impressive. He's talking about serotonin levels in lobsters and then it just feels like I'm reading Ulysses by James Joyce after that. It's just these run on sentences. I don't understand. Okay. When he first came out, you got to remember that Jordan was in the right place at the right time. Yeah. When he had that confrontation with his students where it was the gender pronouns, he was the hero we needed at that moment and everybody blew his ass up and he went from being this kind of obscure, uh, professor at a university, Ontario or whatever, making maybe a hundred thousand dollars a year doing that to making $80,000 a month on Patreon and then having world tours going out with a Dave Rubin and becoming a multimillionaire off of basically what he'd been doing as a professor for a very long time. So he leaned into that. I always use him as an example of too much, too young, too fast because you and I are in the engagement media business right now. And what happens is that there is a potential to make a lot of money and people are not prepared to make a lot of money. For sure. I am a get rich slow guy, not a get rich fast guy. And that's not because I don't want a lot of money. I would, but there's a lot of lessons you have to learn along the way so that you can, so you don't, it's like you're familiar with too much, too young, too fast, which is like, so you've got a college athlete and you suddenly you get, you put them in the NFL and you give him like a $10 million contract and he's gone from the ghetto and now suddenly he's driving around a Lamborghini. Mike Tyson, Antoine Walker, and what's his face, Allen Iverson all blew through a hundred million dollars in their twenties. And it's so, it's the same dynamic you take. And now granted, you know, Jordan Peters is not too young, but he's too young in the sense that he's just coming into this new media and does not know the ins and outs of it and does not have the, the depth of knowledge to realize that he's about to go from being a sort of naive about these things to making a whole shit ton of money doing this. And so what happens is you end up carrying over the habits you had from being, I'm not poor, but like, you know, from your old life into your new life. So it makes sense that when you look at like, like rock stars, when they die at 29, you're Amy Winehouse. So when they die at 29 years old, it's usually because they're taking habits from their old life into their new life where they've got, where they're popular, famous, they've got a lot of money and it follows them in there and you might end up in rehab. So the issue for me was you see, you hear the Richard Dawkins interview that he did. Okay. And the Sam Harris one too. So for all of us, if we're all talking and there's a bunch of people talking, if Richard Dawkins starts talking, everybody needs to shut the fuck up. If Richard Dawkins is talking, okay, Richard Dawkins would win 500 years from now. They will still be talking about this man. It's different for him. Like this man is an evolutionary biologist. I wanted to hear what he had to say. I didn't hear a fucking word he had to say. All I heard was Jordan Peterson consistently interrupting him. And I really appreciated when Richard Dawkins started talking about the two snakes curling around each other and how that looks like DNA. And Richard Dawkins was like, that's bullshit. Like that's not, again, what I, what I like about Jordan Peterson is that there's this evolutionary psychology component and then he puts his emotion into it. And I'm like, we don't, he puts his magical thinking. We don't need the emotional part. Like we can do that on our own. That was the part. It was like, I really want to like him more than I do. And then he does stuff like that. And I just don't know what to do because like, I want him to, I want a concise book where you as a professor and a PhD, give me stats on stats on stats. And then at the end, if you want to have an interpretation or you can show me anecdotally how these things make sense, then I'll, then I'll do that. By the way, I have that. His name is Dr. David Buss. And that's another reason why I like, I'm still mind blown. Do you know where Joe Rogan lives? Austin, Texas. Texas. Do you know who Dr. David Buss' laboratory is? And literally all of these guys, their foundation for so much of their work is because of this one man who lives less than five miles away from Joe Rogan and Buss has never been on Joe Rogan. I was asking Dick Gadsad about that. By the way, Gadsad has been on Rogan more than anyone else. I really want to get Gadsad on. Yeah, for sure. And I, and I asked Gadsad, I was like, dude, why is Joe, like even Gadsad is like me. He's like, we, we all, David Buss, Gadsad's a character, man, I love that guy. But he, he respects Dr. Buss so much. Oh yeah. So do I. He was a student. He, he actually took classes from David Buss. Yeah, he took, my whole thing is like, why don't we go to the source instead of like an interview? Because there's only two evolutionary psychologists that go on Joe Rogan, right? It's Pinker and it's, it's Gadsad. Is there anybody else? Peterson's been on Joe Rogan. But I don't think Peterson's an evolutionary psychologist. He has a, he has a PhD in, he's a clinical, he's a clinical psychologist, I can't remember, but he does not have, he does not, he talks a lot about evolutionary psychology. You want to, you want to know why that's palatable, why, why, why it's the, like Jordan Peterson wants to add woo-woo magic tea leaves and woo-woo magical thinking to like really practical, you know, the latent purpose kind of thing. It was explained, I use this as actually an analogy in sort of the last chapter of religion and it was, I'm going to reference this cartoon that I once saw and it's like this, this Tibetan monk and he gets up to, the first panel, he's trying to get up to the top of the mountain to see the guru, the divine master kind of thing, he says, oh, guru, teach me the ways of like combat, you know, how to throw the perfect punch. And the guru says, or the, he says, the guru originally says, don't try to hit the, you know, the target, you know, use your peripheral vision or whatever. And then the monk says, oh, why, wise master? And then the guru says, well, because you're using implicit memory and not like a, you know, a cognitive memory and it's like the prefrontal cortex engages here. So essentially you're accessing the, the wrong memory to, for muscle control and whatever like that. He gets this really like, you know, empirical diagnostic description. And then the next panel is the monks and he's like, and he goes, can you put that in some like, you know, worldly wisdom kind of thing and the thing of the, and so then the last panel, the gurus like dwell within your inner in this, you know, and so what that, I got a lot out, it's funny as hell, but I got a lot out of that because it's some people want to hear astrology. They want to hear tarot card readings. They want to hear alien landings. They want to check crack, right? They want to hear something that's a little more like spirit, worldly spiritual has kind of like that element to it that still teaches the same question or same same data, but it's more palatable when you say, oh, well it's this, you know, it's this new meditation technique, but it's really, there's actually some functional purpose to it. But people learn that because it's the, the, there's an element of magical thinking that everybody has. And by the way, I think that's actually not a bad thing per se. It's a feature and not a bug of human. Is it responsible for the atrocities of humanity? Yes, but it's also responsible for imagination and for the greatest achievements of human. Like what, what is possible is also part of that magical thinking. So it's a necessary element so that we don't get nihilistic and off ourselves because we want to believe in what is possible. So there has to be a module or something of our brains that predisposes us to that. Now, when, when I talk about stuff on fresh and fit and I'm Mr. Wizard and I'm giving you evolutionary psychology reasons and everything, I'm telling these girls, well, here's why hypergamy is, and here's the, you know, everything we've talked about for the last hour and a half here. I'll be on there with Hotep Jesus and I'll explain this stuff to him. And then Hotep Jesus is like, you know, we just vibe in and, you know, he says the same thing and he's like, he's puts it in an emotional package, right? And the girls are like, and they, he's like, this dreadlock guru guy, but he's saying the same thing. And he's doing it in a way where it's engaging the magical thinking and emotionalism. Do you know what's so sad? Like you and I right now, I'm not even kidding right now, we could create a product and it's called like dating for your Zodiac sign or how about this diet for your, the perfect diet for your Zodiac sign. You're lucky we use our superpowers for good, not for evil. We could make millions of dollars selling to all of you people diet for your Zodiac sign. You would all, you guys would all believe that, you know, my, one of my favorite studies is that there was no need to do the study, but there was in, uh, in England, there was a speed dating thing they had with thousands of speed daters that went through there and they started correlating the success of the speed dates with, uh, astrological science. And of course you and I, without any question whatsoever, knew the results of the study. The study is for those of you who are shocked by this zero correlation, there is no correlation between who you date and what your Zodiac sign is. There is no correlation ready for it. Some buttholes are going to clinch on this one. There is no correlation between your personality traits and your Zodiac sign. Zero, zero. If I'm wrong, find one single peer reviewed study that shows an even 0.01% correlation. Nothing. Zero. Nothing. When I tell people this story, they just shut it out. They still like, it's fine if you want to tattoo a Libra on your arm, do it. It's fine. It's like you feel part of a clique of people that were born in October. Do it if you want to. I know I'm elite. There's a bunch of comments right now. They're like, that's exactly what a Libra would say. The reality of the situation is, here's the thing, I'm going to go back to this, you want to believe in the Zodiac sign and then when I have a discussion with you about evolution, you don't want to listen. Like, you know, at some point, I think it's irresponsible that people still like fall into this. It's easy. I was just going to say this, is that like when we're talking about magical thinking, the reason why I, there's in my book, Religion, in the fourth one, I go into a little bit of detail here because I didn't want everybody to think I was shitting on religion and I didn't want people to think I was shitting on atheism as well. Yeah, like what? Like, Gad Saad does that at the end of his book. He gets brutal, bro. If you think that that book is shitting on your religion and I don't, I cover all religions, not just Christianity, or if you think that I'm going to be like trying to make a case for religion to atheists, you're going to be sorely disappointed because all I do is basically just give you the nuts and bolts of things. But during that part, like I was faced with the question, I think it was Einstein that says, you know, what's more important, imagination or knowledge? And of course, oh, imagination. No, I disagree. I think it's both. There has to be imagination for us to get to the knowledge and there has to be knowledge for us to ideate about the imagination. So it's kind of like back and forth with that. But again, I don't see magical thinking as necessarily a net negative. It's just something, it's just part of our nature. Have you read Sapiens by Yuval Noah? Yeah, I have kind of mixed, I've got mixed reviews on that one. But have you, have you heard? I don't think it was like Brett Weinstein said this I use this in book four Do you know are you familiar with the concept of metaphorical truth? No, okay So this was something that actually I think was Brett Weinstein. He was moderating a Debate between Jordan Peterson, and I can't remember who the other guy was but he brought up the point of what metaphor Metaphorical truth and I use this in the book is this Stay away from porcupines Because they can shoot their quills and those quills will get you in the arm and and and they're very very painful, right? So give them like state, you know, 30 yards away from a porcupine, right? They'll shoot their quills at you and they'll stick in your body, right? They'll tell children that keep the dogs away from it right because they're gonna those flying quills watch out for them, right? Porcupines can't actually shoot their fucking. No, they're scary shit, but they can't shoot But do you get a porcupine quill and I've had a dog that got a porcupine They run at you backwards bro. That shit is crazy. Oh, they growl. They growl the porcupines growl. Yes. Well, they're scary Most painful fucking thing in the world is they get a porcupine quill in you. So is it? Necessarily objectively true that porcupines can shoot their quills out of their body No, it's not but it is is it in our best interests to believe that they can So we stay away from porcupines so we don't get a quill in us. Yes So that's what that's an example of metaphorical truth as opposed to like sort of objective truth and that is it teaches a lesson so that you will perform a behavior which Is stay away from the fucking porcupine, right? And then you take that and you extrapolate that into into memes right into mimetics is from there So for instance, why is it that we have sort of this species fear of bugs? Why do we have a revulsion to red bodies? Why do we not want to be near snakes? Why do we have that? Why is the snake in the Bible right? Why is that the most evil creature, right? well because the snake was sneaky and it could get in the crib and kill the baby and you wouldn't even know it was there and It would shock you. I mean unless you're completely vigilant all the time, right? So metaphorically speaking they the snake is the metaphor for the truth. That is like watch out for fucking snakes. I'll kill you Yeah, right. So there's the latent. It's almost like a like when we have pros proscriptions against certain things to eat in like say you weren't allowed to like Orthodox Jews can't eat ham, right? They can't eat pork. Yeah, no hoofed animals or shellfish I think it's still I think Muslims do the same thing, right? It's halal versus haram food or whatever Well that used to have a real a real function back in the day Which was if you eat pork, you're gonna fucking die right you get trichinosis, right? Well now we can make make it so you can have a good, you know, Pam's fucking good, right? Bacon's bacon's good Yeah, you can right but but so So but they had those are that's metaphorical truth don't eat the God said don't eat those things because you you know It's hara haram and and so it benefited the the people at that time But now we know better and the objective truth is that yeah, you'll cure pork. It's fucking good, right? Yeah, but But that was the that was the metaphorical truth So when I when I go into this part and by the way, I stole this real liberally stole this from from Brett Weinstein but I thought it was true because it coincides with what you were saying about Jordan Peterson how he like talk about like some nuts and bolts shit, and then he'll add some like flowery prose to it and that's the Metaphorical thing where he's trying to sort of sweeten the deal for people who don't want to sit there Right, so yeah, yeah. Yeah in ways we don't I made this show because I'm sick and tired of hearing there's several reasons But I'm sick and tired of people seeing like yeah, man People cheat because of this people cheat because of this and I'm like stop stop. Stop. Stop There's actual data on this spend 10 minutes and look it up But instead it's just this back-and-forth conversation about dating or economics or what or even real I have real estate agents on here or whoever There's these there's these things that you can actually look up science for and people choose to not do that If you actually did this a lot of these dating shows would be a lot shorter, right? Yeah, well, I get into it One of the things I've been trying to tell Myron to do on the after-hour shows with the girls is Whenever he's confronted with this because it happens all the time These girls are like 18 19 years old and they're regurgitate parroting back all of this 1970s Gloria Steinem Betty Friedan, you know a woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle that that kind of rhetoric or They'll they'll rattle off, you know turn, you know buzz terms like rape culture or bro culture or this culture or whatever or You know things that we can statistically and we have Myron and I statistically Disproven on show after show after show and then on show after show after show more women show up more young ladies show up and they're still parroting back that same rhetoric that has been around really since the sexual revolution and so my I've been trying to encourage Myron to do this and I I'm trying to do this myself It's like when I hear that now I stop I stop everything and I go where did you hear that? Yeah, where did you where did you learn that you're 19 years old and you're repeating something Gloria Steinem said back in 1972 where did you get that fucking message from was it mom? Was it your teachers? What where are you getting this message so that the the meme never fucking dies, you know? Yeah, it's funny because you know, some of my female friends are watching this right now this idea that you don't need a man You're great. You don't need a man. You technically do not need a man now If I come out and later and I'm like, well, you know There's these studies that show that if you're over the age of 40 you do not have any children and you're not married Those women tend to be less happy. That is a Statistic I am NOT giving making a moral judgment telling you to get married or telling you to get married at 23 or telling you Not to have an orgy or telling you not to fuck the Chad Thundercock in the fucking foam cannon party Do whatever you want room do whatever you want Just understand that like later on You're gonna come to me because I'm your friend and we're gonna talk and you're gonna be like well this this this and happened and I'm like do you remember we had this conversation before you keep going back to this dude or you keep making this decision or you keep fucking the Drug dealer with the better cocaine and then you keep doing and then you keep telling me that you're not gonna ever talk to this Guy again, and then you go back to him Just understand that it eventually because like you said social media footprint there are repercussions for this downstream effect, but they're not my Repercussions, they're not roll those repercussions Again it when I put if you push somebody off a balcony, you don't sue Isaac Newton gravity. It's not Isaac Newton's repercussions It's gravity So that's that that's a bigger problem with all that and I have 100% agree with you But the bigger problem with that is that we we want to absolve women of their guilt and their sins and their their liability You want to know why fresh and fit is so big a show? It's because it holds women accountable even in the remote even when it's just like team sports get her get her get her You know, it's still at least raising awareness to exactly what you just said right there and that I I put it this way You remember tender swindler, right? Yeah When what he got like what 250 million or two hundred fifty thousand dollars out of that one girl Over the course of like nine loans for that one and I'm watching this and I'm watching all three of these women who are the it Part of the documentary. There's probably more out there as well, right and I'm looking at them And of course at the end of the show, they're like, oh he finally got this son of a bitch and everybody's like rah Yay, what they do though is they're still on the hook for two hundred and fifty thousand dollars in those loans And so what they do is they go to fucking crowdsource or they try to get the Kickstarter, you know I think to get to get men and women to pay for the mistakes that they legitimately made He's not on the hook for it She is because she's the one who took out the loans because that's what she was doing Yeah And then that so they want to be absolved of that even in that show even in a very popular next Netflix show Yeah, they want to be absolved of the responsibility of having got built by this guy in the first place by believing in the bullshit Story of like I'm a Mossad agent or whatever that you know You know wanting to buy into that stuff and then that one girl who's in the very beginning of it. She was like she met the guy on tinder swindler met him on tinder swindler and Was on his private plane within 45 minutes or an hour meeting the dude. It's so crazy to me And then and then I'm like, where is your dad? Where is the like you said they're gonna come to you, right and they're gonna say like, oh, you know I'm so I'm a mass out right now because I made these bad decisions where the fuck is dad. Where's the brother? Where's the the positive masculine influence in there who could said you're gonna get on a private plane with this guy. Oh, no, you're not I'm gonna physically restrain you from fucking going and doing that if I were to do that You were to do that her dad or and her brother were to do that. We'd say he's a horrible misogynist He doesn't believe in love. He doesn't believe that she this could possibly be the one for her Yeah, and it you're being judgmental. You're being judgy by doing that. No, I'm being a responsible fucking male Who's interested in your well-being and I don't want you to get killed in fucking Bulgaria on this guy's private jet You know what I say is it's it's my job to protect them But not to save them because one of the things that's happened is when I go out with like large groups of girls Sometimes we'll go. I can't sit like though. They'll sit there and they'll go they're like, okay I'm gonna leave with this dude and I'm like, okay, if that's what you want to do I can't save them. But if they want to walk back to their car, I'm a 235 pound man. I'm going to walk you back to your car and nobody's gonna lay a fucking finger on you It's my job to protect you, but I can't save you and that's one of the issues like and this is actually let's transition to This because most of when I ask people like what question they want me to ask you the most. This is the number one okay, I post I Checked yesterday. I've hosted 45 bikini competitions in my life in the last 10 years I also do the recruiting for the Maxim parties the night parties of Dan Bilzerian tiles I get I usually try to get about a hundred girls to go with me I'm the guy who likes to show up to a party with 70 girls 70 80 girls It's not possible for me to do this unless I have female friends and there's this thing that I've heard Andrew say I've heard you say and other people say I know what's a Steve Harvey had It's thing like you men cannot be friends with females. I Don't know how to rationalize this sometimes sometimes I do I think most men don't know how to be friends with females because they get in the friend zone I do not ever let these women put me in the friend zone. I understand my value and my worth How do you rationalize the whole female friend thing because like I told you before? All of you out there if Krystal Hefner wants to be your friend you better say yes, she's an amazing friend, right? She's a good person. So, how do you how do you rationalize? Who is your best male friend right now? My best male friend? There's a couple of them. It's probably the two execs that the other guy execs in my What do you do with it with him? Do you like hang out? We play basketball hobbies. What kind of like interest do you guys share? basketball It's funny. We're always on the MOA calls together Watching football this podcast Making money making money is probably the number one thing. That's the same with Justin Waller He and I become friends really recently and it's like hey, man I'm interested in being your friend unless we can make money together. Yes. Yeah, so the way that men Create friendships between other men is entirely different. I agree with that I agree the way women create friendships between women is entirely different Well, so this idea that men and women can be sort of like these completely platonic friends and that's really what it comes down to Yeah, it's not necessarily a working. I work with lots of women. I work with Torsha. She might be in the thing I work with a lot of yeah of women who We have a shared project and my relationship with them is more like it is with with a guy I want to know like here's a project. Here's what we're gonna do. Here's a problem We're gonna solve and that's but I'm not going to See movies with them. I'm not going to the mall to hang out. We're not painting our toenails So so the second one you're correct. I don't paint toenails I like to go to the movies with seven or eight girls with me I like I love walking in nightclubs with 20 or 30 girls with me I get comp dinners my birthday is usually being 50 girls I like that lifestyle, but I'd not woman like I still you know I take girls to go do play basketball and throw fucking axes. We don't go paint our toenails I take girls to go, you know paintball or stuff like that or watch football do my ex We just sit there and watch football. I'd still do masculine things The problem is it's not that I'm looking to have more female friends What I've found is that when I have a ton of female friends and I want to throw a charity event I can raise another $100,000. Okay, you understand what I'm saying? So it's for me and maybe maybe the disconnect is first the word friend is the wrong word Maybe that's maybe it's acquaintance or teammate is probably a better word. Okay, this is first thing I see Torsha the chat right now. You're my friend Torsha. Yeah, for sure The other the other issue with me and maybe this is a unique situation for me I don't find 99% of women attractive. It's only 1% of women. I find a track Oh, yeah, especially considering the the environment. You're right. Yeah So this idea that like I can't be friends with women you have no idea how many friends out women I'm friends with I don't Find them attractive at all, even though they're gorgeous I can tell you some girls that are models right now and we talk and I'm just like I don't need I'm seeing somebody I don't really need anything more from this I think that what the majority of guys do like you're in a definitely an outlier in that sense because you and then I Hate to go me too as well but like I think I am kind of a little bit too because I worked in the alcohol industry for a long time and I Had to had to be the one selecting women to go to yeah, I'll be booth candy, right? But when when I have said in the past like men and women cannot be like friend friends But not it's not necessarily that men and women can't be friends It's just that the the idea of what what do we define as? Friendship between a man and a man and a woman and a woman and then a man and a woman, right? So eventually what I mean the way that it got started is this is that eventually that chick that you're friends with is gonna hook up with a guy and She's not gonna be wanting to pursue and develop that friendship with another guy when she's already fucking this guy who she should be Going with this guy and have genuine desire for so that or and maybe vice versa You find a chick that you want to be with right? So the idea of a platonic friendship between men and women is a very recent invention. I should say Post-sexual revolution Invention like men in the in the 60s in the 50s in the 40s. They weren't this not like I'm gonna go hang out My good friend, you know Kathy over here and we're gonna go down to the sock hot No, that didn't that wasn't there was two different, you know definitions of that but the reason why I bring up like you're I asked you about your your best male friend is because what we tend to do Is we take the models of a friendship of of our same-sex friends and we try to apply them to an intersexual? Friendship and so the things that like guys will put up with for a woman as a friend You would probably bust your friend in the mouth for for doing pretty much the same I wouldn't bust them in the mouth But I do treat them the same like you've you ever seen have you seen the videos of me before the bikini competition where I'm? Yelling at the girls like an offensive coordinator and football because you work with them Yeah, but no, but they're those girls are there because they're my friends like the thing about it So like I'll give you an example CJ Sparks CJ Sparks helps me make money CJ Sparks. I've introduced her to guys She dates she's introduced me to so many girls that I've ended up dating. She says at my place in Vegas I say at her place in LA We're just friends and the thing about it is I also know that CJ Sparks is a fucking playmate when you see her She's stunning. I know that most guys when I introduce them to him would have no chance like you're trying to get in Yeah, you're trying to be friends with her to get it, but it's not even that it's like most guys When I introduce them to CJ, there's no way they'd want to just be friends with them I think the difference is this when I'm with 70 or 80 girls. It's like I can't Hypothetical hypothetical you're you're with CJ Sparks in LA Kindly kindly smile. Okay, you're spending the night there cuz you need a place to crash and whatever you're doing something She comes out to you in the middle of night and she's like stripped buck naked and she's like, you know what? I think we need to take our friendship to the next level. Do you fuck her? No, I would not Because the problem is there's a cascade of issues that would happen from that point forward There is a cat It's a you were on this show and Justin was sitting in this fucking seat and he said if you had the option to go Fuck these girls and you had that button But it was your dream girl. CJ CJ is like my sister. It really does feel like she's my sister We've been looks similar. She feels like she's my sister same thing with kind. Okay, so Fraternal maternal. Yeah, let me do this other thing Like what kindly kindly is one of my other probably one of my closest friends kindly is married. I respect her I wanted to go to her wedding. We couldn't it was during kovat The the amount of shit that would destroy in both of our lives if anything like that happened The reason why I can think like that is because I am not to sound douchey I'm dating several girls you'd consider super options right now There's girls that I'm dating that are supermodels right now. And do you know how I met these women through kindly and CJ? Do you understand what I'm saying social proof? This is so social proof. They literally introduced me to these girls So for me, maybe it's a unique situation the guys in MOA. They have the same unique situation They're always around I teach them learn how to be the guy who shows up to the party with 60 70 girls That's one of the things I teach in my program And so I don't know maybe it's just that we're in that maybe outside of one standard deviation or outside of two standard deviations But the thing is I do know it's possible if that's what you want the thing for me is I'm not going to be on on the marquee sky deck and I don't get invited to the Playboy Mansion and I'm not on stage at The Maxim party or hosting the red carpet of the Maxim party if I don't have a ton of female friends It will literally was Sierra no walk who told the organizers at swimsuit USA Michael has to be our host because she's my friend and I don't want to hook up with Sierra and Sierra Sierra has a type and I'm not her type. So I'm not her type. She's not my type And so we're just friend even though she's gorgeous, but your friendship is based on it's not based on her physical working but it's based on common interests, which is what most were like my my friendship with Justin is based on college football the fact that we both like to make money together We find each other funny barbecue. All these different things are a friendship for women. I find the same thing. Here's here's here's what the difference These women are so fucking beautiful that 99% of the men in their life can't see past the 800 cc But yeah, they can't but I've just been with so many women like that that this physical attractiveness does not affect say what you're saying is you're above the You have so many options that you're above the need to pretend to be their friends and you can actually I'm actually be their friends and I and I know other dudes who can do this But they they're like club promoters in LA guys cannot do that I will tell you that I agree with you certainly the 80% of guys now I'll explain to you why I've said this in the past as far as like men and women being platonic friends if You're working if there's a working situation strip club. Let me say this also. I've managed a strip club for a while There's I'm not gonna sleep with all the girls. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean again like I again I have worked with very beautiful women Like guys I have it a pick the guys to come into the to you know promotions and yeah That's what we've with thunder from down under right? I've had to promote those shows before so it's not necessarily it's not necessarily options so much as it is like I think guys how they bring a a Model of their same-sex friendships over to the female friendships, but they're really that they but I don't I don't think I don't think They're motivated by this the same to say I think they're motivated to be friends with these women because The what they like they shot their shot They lost and they're like, I will stay an orbiter in your life in the hopes that I'll wait for you, bro I do not do that. That is not what I do What I do is I'm friends with all of them my a typical thing for me would be I have a hundred female friends And I'm sleeping with eight of them. That's it And by the way, the girls that I'm sleeping with they're also my friends Like you can't tell if you ever hung out with me at a bikini competition not a bikini Oh, that's a bad example the Maxim party. You can't tell who I'm sleeping with I do not let anybody know and so do you know what talk about the guy who doesn't count bro? That's me I'm definitely the guy who doesn't count so that's it that's an issue the situation where I just see this and It gets to the point where a lot of girls seek me out because of this because they know I'm not gonna treat them differently Because they have boobies. Does that make sense? Yeah, the beauty doesn't affect you It does but not at all. So the superpower doesn't work on correct. It takes it. It takes it takes a lot Let me let me look let me just see if I can add a little bit to this because when I've said that in the Past like platonic friendships The first thing is that it's it's usually based on a guy who really wanted to get with the chick Sure, she shot him down. So can we just be friends and the guy goes? Yeah. Okay friends. Yeah, it gets into the friend zone We agree on that. Okay, so friend zone is basically All of the emotional support and all the emotional investments of a of a boyfriend with no sex Yes, fuck buddies are the opposite of that So it's all the sex and no emotional investment on the guy's part So they're really kind of like those are two parallels there But when guys come into that and they think that they can be friends to the same degree They are with their guy friends with a woman friend like different I'm not see people whenever I say oh men men and women can't be friends I'm saying it in the sense that they can't be of the same Character friendship that you're friends with like Justin or your friends with your best buddy, right? It's gonna be and by the way women same thing You're never going to have the same relationship with your girlfriends that you're gonna have with like with your well Certainly with your husband or with it with the guy who's you know, quote-unquote your friend now again Every example you've given me up to this point has been Women that you work with sure and maybe you're above it to the point where you're like, okay It's no big deal to me. I don't I've seen titties. I worked in a strip club. I can actually be at least To the point where our friendship is a working friendship great But what I'm talking about in the in those instances is guys will get into that point and what they will do is they'll try to cater their Interests and cater themselves so that they can be a better friend to that girl with of course The interest is you know was romantic. Maybe it's not maybe it is But the idea is this is that when guys start relating to women on a friendship basis They start to speak women's language. Hmm And so what happens is men and women speak completely different language for sure men are overt men are up front We are languages is blunt and to the point we are information based and we are content based right now Everything you and I have been talking about has been we're relating information to one another women will get together Just to talk because the feelings and the context of that conversation is what's important And I should say is the priority of that conversation So if you and your girlfriends want to get together, let's go catch up at Starbucks. That's that is an enjoyable experience for them I'm not gonna go How the kids right? I'm not gonna do that We're gonna get together the reason why you like Justin's because immediately I could the same reason I like Justin Immediately we have like this shared kinship, but it's also how we're gonna make some money Oh, yeah, and we talk about college football. So yeah Yeah, I will tell you this man, and I know this may I may be unique in this Do you remember a Hank Moody Californication? Yes. Yes. That is the biggest corollary to me. I love every woman I love women even the ones I'm not attracted to I think they're fucking amazing I want to help I like, you know talking about protect them. I love being friends with them I love having them in my life now. I doesn't make me more woman. Like I still watch I watch Texas Longhorn football Dallas Cowboys football I'm in the gym seven days a week and I eat fucking red meat. I shoot guns There's nothing about it that changes my behavior and I do agree with you I may be one outside of one or two standard deviations in the uniqueness of the way it works However, there's this other part of it and that is when these girls are shit shows, bro. I laugh my fucking ass off, bro I love it. And I'm a dick. Maybe I'm a dick a little bit of drama because you have no investment in not okay So this is this is the second part Which we talked about Rich Cooper earlier. You remember the 21 red flags? He talks about in his book I remember reading those red flags me like goddamn. That's hard. He's hard on these women and then I started to realize. Oh Yeah, I don't want to get married. That's why these don't seem like red flags to me I do sometimes I meet what there's a show called inside only fans my friend CJ She hosts it and again, so she hosts CJ Sparks Oh, it's not only fans and girls come on they're talking about cheating on their fucking boyfriends Dudes cream pie in them and then fucking with some other dude and I'm just like laughing myself. I watch don't jumper It's very similar. No jumpers the same kind of way. I don't know if you remember Adam 22 He was talking to Dan Bilzerian and he starts saying there was this one guy who's an intern and he's like this intern became friends With the porn stars and because he became friends with the porn stars. He got invited to all the porn Parties and he said he's from there He's just been hooking up with girls left right because he was friends with a couple of these girls for me Part of it is also access that I think a lot of guys miss the reason why I'm on stage at nightclubs is because I'm With seven or eight women and so that I think that's another part So the greater narrative of that is this is and again, this is I think it's my actually my first book confidence Okay, one of the things I really hate about like success porn hustlers is they're always trying to like hawk confidence confidence Got women want confident men. Yeah, they want confidence. Well, how do I get roll? Oh, how do I get confidence? Where's the magical well of confidence that I can go and get well confidence come like objectively speaking Confidence comes from options. It comes from knowing that you've got another job so you can tell your current employer Hey, I got another job and he's gonna pay me $10,000 more. You want a deal? No, fuck you. Bye So it's like having the option to do so similar That's why I always advocate guys spin more plates, right? Be be date non-exclusively until I get to the point where you're a good judge. Yeah, you say, okay I want to get with this girl, right? But having those options is what generates confidence and that's really where I think you're at right now because most men Don't have options and they don't have the ability or they don't have the the history of having Generated those options in the past So even if they're optionless They still don't have the experience of having generated them in the past so that they can create more in the future So when men do not have options they become necessities for sure and necessities men are never free So when you have when you have a guy who wants to be friends with a woman who and he has no options His only option is to find some way to align himself and to find some sort of common ground and find some sort of Compatibility with that woman to the point where he begins to relate to her and speak to her as one of her girlfriends Mmm, I've said this in the past. I will say it one more time. This is my show right now. So Women have boyfriends and girlfriends if you're not fucking her You're her girlfriend because that's what most women will see when they when the guy wants to be her friend because you start talking to her and Hanging out with her and doing the things that her girlfriends do with her because you're accommodating her From the perspective of how she feels her How she relates with her other girlfriends if you start speaking the language of women you're that women's hind brains or lizard brains are gonna interpret you as and in and so you will know it's like you have We got to the point where like I have a million guys have said this to me She says she sees me like a brother where she you know interprets me like a brother, you know, she's you're nice You're my best friend, but I'd see you as a brother What that means is is that she thinks of the idea of sex with you is incest gross. Yeah is incest I mean literally down to the evolutionary perspective. You're so familiar like you're a family member Yeah, and generally we don't want to have sex with you I think I think where it started for me is when I used to work at the strip club I remember the girls that were like really hot and then maybe they were married I would always ask him like where'd you meet? The guy that you ended up marrying and they would almost always that was never cold approach pickup and it was never Cold DMS. It was almost always a girl introduced me to this, dude And so when I started hanging out like most of the women I date the women are introducing me to these to these women You understand what I'm saying? And so that's one of the things like I'll go out and I'll hang and by the way This is another thing you you'll see it someday. We'll go out sometime I'll go up to the prettiest girl you've ever seen your entire life I'll be like what a motherfucker and we've chest bump like what a motherfucker and she'll be like, what a bitch She'll say this to me tries to get all bro with for sure because I don't change who I am Based on that and I do and this is just my this is only time. I'm gonna express an opinion I believe there was fun man when I played football When I was in a when I was in you when I was in a flying squadron in the US military There was this fun camaraderie that we had that I feel like some women wish they could have had And I give that to them a little bit because I don't treat you differently because you have boobs And I do think there's a lot of girls who like hanging out with me because of that Here's another thing that happens when you talk about the whole brother thing I don't really get that very often a lot of times they start having a crush on me that happens a lot like a lot more than to the point that sometimes it gets kind of uncomfortable where I'll have like 20 30 girls with me and Then all of a sudden a girl like just out of nowhere just expresses that she's interested in me and part of that I got that from bulls arian like watching bulls arian bulls arian had two girls one of them was the name Quote me on this. It's a fuck one of us Masha did hook and the other one is She lives in Florida. I can't remember what her name is right now Bianca Ghezzi Bianca Ghezzi used to have a podcast called the shit show and those girls Their only job was to book models for Dan and his trips and Dan wasn't sleeping with these girls They were friends. There were female friends who brought more girls to Dan now. Here's the thing is funny Also, when I talk to girls who are bisexual, we have one thing in common roll-up. We both like we both like chicks I have whenever I'm hanging out with girls who bisexual we have a lot to talk about a lot of time But sometimes I'll be sitting there with a girl who's bisexual and she's just going over game like game game like real Get the girl home game and I'll sit there talking to her and it's like very interesting But I still I'll go with you on this. I still think it's outside of two standard deviations. Most men can't do this I just know that my life empirically there's no way I could live without having a ton of female friends I'm hosting a party Saturday night, and I've got 45 girls coming there with me You know I'm saying and so that that's the only thing the other thing is like they helped me build my business My business is a networking business, you know, and so if you saw you saw my copy, right? You saw my dad's my ads are full of these girls that love the shit. I don't look at your Instagram Yeah, by the way, go look at his Instagram I love these girls and these girls love me and I'm never gonna tell you which ones I'm sleeping with it's enough But that's that's the thing. Maybe my view on this is unique, but I just I feel like I mean You're definitely an apex outlier in that respect. I mean, it'd be like it's also like, you know Talking about this with Dan Bilzerian or somebody who's like really super high level, but I will say is going back to the options thing The you were on here you were with with Justin and you probably have covered this on in other shows as well where Well, it was either Kevin Samuels or is Myron Myron on Fresh and Fit or if it was a Andrew Tate How a high-value man should cheat right he should have a It's less of a big it's um What I said was it's a bigger deal if women cheat because of dr. David Buss's study about 78 So, let me let me relate that to options So in my past work, I think it was in book two I talked about this, I said when it comes to cheating, when it comes to infidelity, you're breaking a contract first and foremost. So it's like, I agree not to fuck anybody else. Are you good with that? Cool. Okay, so that's our agreement, right? So you're breaking that contract first and foremost. The other thing is this, is that for cheating or infidelity to occur, two things have to be there. There has to be options and there has to be a reason to cheat, okay? So most men, the 80% of men out there, the guys who want to be your friend, who want to be women's friends and all that, they don't have options. That's why they're trying to be friends with somebody because they think they can get in there. They have no options. Most men, and then once they get married, they have no options. In fact, one of the rarest things for married men to be able to do is to generate preselection or... It's tough. Yeah, because they're not, like when I talk about how married men or guys who are in relationships need to at least have some form of passive dread. They think that that's horrible because they might... It's fear of missing out or it's like throwing the baby out with the bathwater. They don't want to even experiment with that because they don't want their wives who are their only source of sex or their girlfriends to think that they would ever be unfaithful or whatever, because those guys don't have any options. Most men have no options. So when they do cheat, they're cheating with a hooker. They're cheating with an escort or something like that. It wasn't that the girl really wanted to fuck him. He just wanted to generate an option through having $500 at the fucking cat house and then he can go get laid. It's $500? I didn't know that. Well, whatever. It depends on the girl. I wouldn't know. I don't really know those things. But so the most men have no options. So then there are the guys who have... But they have all the reason in the world. They're in this sexless marriage. They're like jerking off to porn. 68% of Christian guys admit to having a porn addiction. That's incredible. That's incredible. So I brought that up with Ruslan and it was like crickets, of course, but it's like the reason... I didn't get to say this, but the reason for that is because those guys have no options and that's why their only option for unlimited access to unlimited sexuality is pornography. It's the virtual experience, right? So they have no options, but they have a reason to go jerk off to porn because the wifey put on too much poundage and she's too fat and now he's not getting what he thinks he should get and it creates problems in the marriage because he sees what other people are getting and he's not getting anything like that. So therefore, it causes a lot of marriage discord, let's just say. But he has no options. He has reasons, all kinds of reasons to leave and to cheat on his wife, but ain't nobody wants to suck his dick, okay? Then you've got the guys who have options, such as yourself. Tons and tons of options, but you've got no reason to cheat. If you're with a girlfriend like that, you're like, I can get with any one of these girls right here. I have all kinds of options and honestly, I think that's almost a healthier position to be in. I have no reason to because my wife takes care of me before I go on every trip. She knows what, maybe it's passive dread, maybe it's just like, you know, appreciation for like what it is, who I am as a man, whatever. But it's, I don't have any reason to cheat and that's why when like, when I'm confronted with Myron Fresh or I'm confronted with Andrew or even Justin or whatever, it's like when I hear them talking about this, it's like, I've been faithful to my wife for 26 years. I don't have a, because I don't have a reason to cheat. And when Richard Cooper asked me, how did you vet Mrs. Tomasi? And I said, I didn't vet her. I vetted myself first. I needed to know that this is a person, this is a woman that I could be faithful for because I seen me, I've seen you do it, I know me, I've seen me do it, right? And I'm like, I'm a good dog, but you got to pet me to keep me on the porch, right? But I saw that and once I settled that question in my mind, I said, hell yeah, I can. And that's from there, it was, you know, okay, well, she would make a great mother. She has a lot of value added that goes along with that. She wants, she expected me to be in the driver's seat. She puts me into the position, she expects an alpha male. She expects me to be the head of the household, which she was the first woman who to ever want to, like I would, I was, the women that I'd had before that, it was always this egalitarian like sort of pretense to everything. But options in working in casino marketing, working in alcohol, being a semi-pro rockstar for a while, like all the options were there, but I got no reason to cheat on her. And so, as I said before, options imply confidence, that's number one. So that's going to, it's going to relate to that. But in an optionless man is a necessitist man. So the guy who's cheating because he has no options, he wants to like go sleep with the hooker, he's a necessitist guy because he has all these reasons to, but he's not actually doing that. So you've got a necessitist man and necessitist men are never free. Do you remember what Justin said? He goes, I'm not afraid of a bad man, I'm afraid of a desperate man. Yeah. Right. So I agree with you on that. I think, I think what happens is my, part of my program is you, you, you, it's a lifestyle where there, you have so many options that these guys have an easier time of it. Right. Let's go, let's go to this. Cause I have a bunch of questions. We've been going on three and a half hours. I know. Oh, and shout out to Ned. I already got a super chat for Ned, for Ned's college fund. Beautiful. Keep it, keep him your boy off the only thing. Let's do it. I'm going to do a question. And if there's questions on there, you want to pull up. So I, I, they've been, they've been sailing by I, sorry guys, I can't get to super chats on this because I'm not on stream yard. I'm actually in the studio right now, but I will get back to you on your, thank you. I appreciate every single one of your super chats, by the way. All right. So let's do this. How do you overcome this from Reddit? How do you overcome the initial nihilism that happens when so many guys, after they take the red pill, I have also had a similar issue in MLA where a guy goes through like the first three weeks. One of the, I make them read the, I make them read your book. I make them read the setup by bulls area and I make them read a bunch of books about this. And when they do, a lot of times the response is like anger. Like they're like, I can't believe that this fucking happened to me. I can't believe I've been lied to about this. How do you get them to not take that? So first off, you have to clarify terms here because a lot of people think that that all I'm about is like a, it's truthful anger. Oh, you, what he says is true, but don't let it like destroy your, you know, precious soul, you know? And I'm like, no, it's just, it's just the truth and how you go and how you process that. And most guys have a real tough time with that, particularly when they are this side of a divorce or they're in a position in their life where had they known about this stuff, had they read my book prior, that's why I wrote preventive medicine. Had they known this stuff, they would have made different decisions, right? And so they kick themselves and they're not mad at women. And I want to stress that point. When guys go through red pill rage, it seems like they're misogynistic and they're just, they're, they're going to go and be like what Alex Menazian or Elliot Rogers, and they're just going to go take matters into their own hands and do a mass shooting or something. That's not what the red pill rage is. It's anger at themselves for having invested themselves so long in a game that was completely ineffective because no one was playing that game. They were playing by a different set of rules. It's not the anger at women, it's anger that they, it's a loss of investment. It's a loss of time. It's a loss of effort that could have been, they maxed out the wrong character stats in their RPG of life, right? And so they get really pissed off at that, but the problem is you have to get over that and you have to get over that nihilism because a lot of people will say, there's a, I have a, an essay and I think I put it in positive masculinity and it's called the five stages of unplugging. Oh no, I'm sorry. No, it's in the very first book. The five stages of unplugging, which are like this five stages of grief, like denial and, and acceptance and, and, you know, you know, optimism, whatever, whatever those five stages are. And the reason why I use that as sort of an analogy for guys unplugging from the matrix is because it's similar to killing off your old personality and you're mourning your old personality and the problem is, is guys get stuck in the anger phase and they get stuck in the mourning phase of who they used to be because they really, really want that blue pill idealistic goals that they were sold since the time they were five years old. They really want those to be true. But now they realize it's the, the, the, the, the setup was bullshit and nobody's playing by those rules and now they lack the creativity and they lack the, the optimism and they lack the ingenuity to really see the opportunity that once you are red pill aware, dude, fucking sky's the limit. Cause now, you know, the fucking game, you also are responsible for knowing the game as well, but it's, it's like now you know this shit and now you can make better decisions and now you can live a better life. And you're also responsible for that. That's how you get over it. You're responsible for that. It never turns off. That's another question I get often. It's the bitter taste. Yeah. You never take, once you put the red pill lens on, you cannot take them off. And there's like, even if you don't believe that you're having to perform, you're still performing. Yeah. Yeah. Get used to, I get this all the time. Dancing monkey stuff. Oh, you shouldn't want to do things for women. Blah, blah, blah. I'm like, you know what? If you're going to play the game, if you can decide to go, it's not just for women either. Yeah. You can get, you can decide to go live in a shack in the middle of some, you know, remote place or you can get in the game and you can be a player. And that's exactly how I start the fifth book, the player's handbook. I've talked to, I've heard Andrew talk about this and I've heard Myron talk about this, the demise of the West. Okay. So now follow the list to generosity. Just be honest with you. Now maybe I'm biased. Okay. I'm from Texas. I went to UT Austin and I joined the U S military. I do not believe in the demise of the West. People ask me, what does, what backs up the U S dollar? I'll tell you the F 14, the F 18, the F 15, the F 16, the F 22, the F 35, the Los Angeles class submarines, the Ohio class submarine, the blue water Navy, the global positioning system, the Casey one 35, the Casey 10, the Bradley fighting vehicle and the M one Abrams tank. That's what backs up the fucking U S dollar. But anyway, go do what you're saying. I felt like it was a little bit of an exaggeration as far as I've been hearing that since I've been doing this for 20 years. I think I've probably been hearing that for at least the past 17 years where it's moral degeneracy and uh, Oh, what is it? Uh, was it a weak men create hard times. Create a strong man, strong men, create good times, good times, create weak men. And then let's continue the cycle around. Okay. Got you. Thank you very much. Everybody wants to think in terms of cycles and circles and predictably, there's nothing more than that humans beings want is predictability in an unpredictable, chaotic world. Okay. So when people tell me like Rolo, when do you think that the pendulum is going to swing back and we're going to go back to the good old days of 1950s masculinity and women are going to, you know, respect men for being men and women are going to be women and men are going to be men. I'm going never. It's not going to happen. There is no pendulum. We only go, we don't swing backwards. We go forwards, right? And so when I'm, when I'm having this conversation with these guys, I, it's actually a quote from the book Dune is you cannot back up into the future. You cannot back the car into the fucking future. You have to take the lessons of the past. You have to understand what was good back then. And if you want to take those and put them into a new context in the future, more power to you, your red pill, go for it, man. Do you know, build something new with that, but don't think that you're going to back yourself into a better life by backing yourself into the future. I said, this is your trad cons do not want the red pill. Matt Walsh, Candace Owens, Ben Shapiro don't want the red pill. They want a fucking time machine. They want to go back in time to some golden era that they romanticize about that never fucking existed. Here's the good news though. I am on board with you. I've said that in fact, I've talked, had this conversation with Aaron Clary of all people. I don't believe in, in this sort of enjoy the decline thing. It's like, well enjoy the decline because it's all going to go to hell and, and we're going to just fall into moral degeneracy and we're going to, it's the fall of Rome, right? Well, yeah, if you don't fucking get off your ass and fucking do something, there's more opportunity. Rome did not fall because of degeneracy. Rome fell because barbarians were motherfuckers. That's like, that's the problem. Like the problem is they want to see that cycle. They want to see that predictability that the America's falling, it must be the fall of Rome too. No, dude, we live in 2022 not fricking ancient Rome. Well, let me, the problem is like, who are the barbarians? Because I got news for you. The United States has 5% of the world's population and 25% of the planet's GDP that like we have the only, you remember they were worried about Russia. I don't think Russia, I'm going to say this right now, I'm gonna get a lot of trouble for this. I don't think Russia has one single functioning ICBM, not one. I don't think they have one intercontinental, you have no idea how expensive those things are to maintain. They will. You saw what happened with Chernobyl. I do not fucking believe they have one. There's no other country in the, what people in the chat are putting links. Here's one. Here's one. Like we spend more money on defense than all the other countries provided. We have all of the world's liquidity and we have the most prime farmland on the planet. I do not see this, like I don't, it's not saying it could never happen. I'm saying we have such a lead right now. It's a, we're a long way from the actual decline. Now maybe the problem is I'm thinking of literal civil war and literal decline and people are talking about moral decay, meaning we have a trans person as president, we have trans person and president. I'm still going to be a multimillionaire. I don't give a fuck. I really don't. I just enjoy the decline. Like I just don't care. Like that's the, that's the issue. I don't think when I think of decline, I'm literally thinking of apocalypse. Maybe that's where, maybe that's probably where the, that's the difference there. Now I always point out, I try to make this a, this, I'm probably going to butcher this too, but I make this illustration whenever somebody says like, when's the pendulum going to swing back? Right. I think about this. I watched this, I forget which movie it was, but it was about world war one and it was a documentary about like a, it was on Netflix. It wasn't Dan Carlin's thing. It was something else. But anyways, the, so I'm watching this, this documentary and this historical on a, on world war one. And in the beginning of world war one, they thought it was, the war was going to be done in like, you know, a year. And all these guys were like, all these young men were like, yeah, we can finally fight in a war. Bitchin man. It's going to be cool. Have you read guns of August? Have you read that book? No, but there's when they were, cause it was, I think it might've been on the anniversary of the end of world war one. But anyway, so what they were thinking was that it was going to be, the war was going to be fought as wars had been fought before, you know, on horseback with a, with a saber and you know, all that kind of stuff. They weren't even getting guns. There were, there were cavalry units that refused to learn how to use firearms. Yes. And then the moment they experienced a 50 caliber machine gun and death on an industrial scale, that's when shit changed. So when I think about like people say, well, you, do you think we're headed for world war? Three I was like, well, I will tell you this if we're headed for world war three It will be something we do not expect in the same way that the young men in 1914 weren't expecting When they saw their first 50 caliber machine gun that mowed down entire regiments Like it was like they were on an assembly line or the way the iraqi or the people in baghdad All of a sudden didn't see anything in the sky and then their buildings were on fire Yes, so what I was going to say so think about it in those terms when I think about how our expectations are of a Declining western civilization are built upon our old order our 20th century way of thinking about what's ideal I will tell you this if we do go into some sort of like, you know Moral panic or some sort of like degeneracy or some sort of chaos or whatever like that. It'll be far worse than anything your 20th century imagination interesting could think of it being just like those poor kids in 1940 or 1914 who faced their first machine gun so it will be war on an industrial scale I think we I think we are getting to a point where if we're going to talk about like war Uh, we're beyond like conventional warfare We're talking about we won't do it like we have done it after watching russia trip on their own dicks trying to invade ukraine Stop telling me about war right where there is no country on the planet It is literally like playing an nba team versus a fucking peeweed team There is no country on the planet that even has a blue water navy much less functioning icbms One country on the planet has stealth technology one just one now we're selling those f-35s to the europeans But like we are so far away. That's why when I hear this decline of the west i'm like I don't care what you think about joe biden He's still got his finger on the button and it's a pretty big goddamn button So I think maybe the problem is whenever I hear civil war I'm, like man you guys should read about what the civil war was actually like I don't think we're ever going to get to that point But I do think that like we did it will be destroyed from within before that Okay, so that that then that may be the issue which goes back to four percent of millennials think the earth is flat That's how I think you destroy us from the inside. You know, what's funny flat earth. You destroy the world with tick tock Yeah flat, you know flat earth came around 2015 and that's when the russians started using uh, creating those facebook groups So like misinformed people it's like so funny that a lot of these people who have these conspiracy theories They have conspiracy theories about the deep state They're literally reading conspiracy theories that they learn from russian bots that created facebook groups back in 2015 before the election That caused them to have these beliefs. It's insanity. Like they're literally like i'm the only one who gets it Do you know what? Um, do you know what? Um, Direct energy weapons are of course So I had no idea what a dew was until 2020 When the wildfire season started in california now, I live in reno, nevada Whenever there's a wildfire in northern california all that fucking smoke just like right now Just goes right into the washoe valley and nothing pisses me off more because I know goddamn well It's some californian arsonist who decided to set his fucking fire set something on fire, right? 2020 there are more wildfires in california than ever before 2021 More than ever before and all of them next to all of them were set deliberately and if you see there was actually a Roster of the people they arrested for setting these fires and they are all like these antifa You know super liberal, uh, you know militant, you know Progressive leftists, right and i'm looking or they if they are weren't exactly like that They certainly look the fuck sure look the part, right? And so what i'm hearing is people are going. Oh, it was lightning strikes There was no fucking storms for a lightning strike to happen. Then they'd be like, oh it was um, Uh a campfire somebody flicked a cigarette or some shit like that No, because you could see the pattern of the fires going along then people said it's direct energy weapons The fire that's right now i'm like no motherfucker It's like it's like it's like a laser. It's like a laser. These sons of bitches are setting it deliberately. So funny. Yeah direct energy That little bick lighter that you use to light the candles. That's a direct energy weapon That's the thing that they're like, why would they bother with shit like that when they got these guys out there ready to just go? Create, you know havoc by arson. Um, let me ask you about this because I thought this was really interesting So I have my own theory about this, you know, i've been open about this. I'm on trt uh, I think that a decline in men's testosterone which we can talk about the reasons why I know that people talk about pesticides and the The food that we eat and all this kind of stuff, but there is a decline and the decline I think and also there's there's studies that show when men have children and have Get married that their testosterone declines at an even more rapid rate when they get divorced, correct? It goes back up It goes back up now Here's the thing I will tell you when I was 38 Like my sex drive dropped off my muscle mass and my upper body just fell off I got fatter and I started I got on trt. I was four years of me Just like wandering in the woods, bro. I was at I couldn't put on any muscle I was just like I had no goals in life I was just it was depressing and then about 42 I started taking trt and it was like the world became colorful again They were like the same time I started this podcast the world became colorful again And I and I my interest in women was just exactly like it was when I was 19 I wanted to get them my levels back to about 800 Total tests back when I was 18 And when I did this I started to think about these men who felt hopeless and were suffering from depression And I can't prove this and I do believe that if somebody actually did a study on this someone would say it's immoral But if they were to take all these men in their 50s late 40s and early 50s who were committing suicide Which there are a lot of them deaths of desperation deaths of desperation and we were able to correlate that to total testosterone levels I think we would find a Shocking correlation and you would also find a correlation to obesity rates as well. Well, here's the thing but obesity rates What does that do? It aromatizes testosterone and turns it into estrogen But we talked about this before if you are carrying around all this weight the older you get you are double fucked Your body your body now is taking that testosterone your fat people don't know this Where does estrogen come from in the males it comes from? Testosterone going into your body fat being aromatized look that word up and it turns it into estrogen You can get men who are so fat their estrogen levels are higher than their testosterone levels man boobs You guys remember man boobs you've seen those things before that's where it comes from So we're starting to see these men and they're overweight This overweightness is causing higher estrogen levels lower testosterone levels in men that are 50 now You're 50 now. You don't have any upward, uh financial mobility You don't have upward mobility sexually because you've put on all this weight literally no upward mobility Upper mobility because you're fat you basically can't sit up right all these things and now we have this level of depression And then we have this the suicide has to come from somewhere. It has to come from something. So I my Hypothesis and i'm look forward to anybody trying to disprove my hypothesis I'm open to it is that they decline in testosterone levels is almost i'm talking 99 correlated with this epidemic of suicide. I would say so. Yeah, I agree with that. Also you have to um, you have to look at the uh The social situation that we're in right now is what nobody cares if somebody if a guy kills himself Nobody nobody nobody gives a rat's ass about that Um when we when you look at the suicide rate for men right now depending on whose numbers you use It's either three and a half to five times the rate of women Killing successfully killing themselves if it were women with that rate We would have a special month dedicated to women's suicide awareness month Then we'd be wearing they have purple bands or whatever the fuck we wear in the nfl, right? um, so We simply because men are the disposable sex and women are the vulnerable sex and we live in a if there is a separate Standard of justice for men than there is for women for women than there is for men Um, so having said that I 100% agree with you. I think that uh testosterone levels I have actually done interviews with uh, with with reporters about um, trt Um about declining sperm count too. So you have to take that into consideration. So it's not just testosterone It's also declining sperm count which you will hear You go on youtube and you there's nothing but articles about that right now But um, so that coincides with like phytoestrogens that coincides with trt, you know declining testosterone which also declines with uh The idea that we have been essentially gelding the last three or four generations of men so that they become self-loathing of their own masculinity to be a man is to be insecure to be shameful or to be like You know, it's responsibility without authority We have the responsibility to live up to a masculine ideal, but you have no Authority to actually affect that responsibility in the first place. It is the gelding of of well western men that has been going on really I would argue since the uh, since the uh, Sexual revolution at the time but uh, but it definitely comes down to I haven't okay So let me just answer the question really quickly here because I get this shit all the time When i'm on my show you can see me from about here up. Okay when I go on fresh and fit and i'm wearing a tank top and that i'm I look like this right or I do a photo shoot or something people go. Oh, man. Swallow tomasi He's yeah, I can't swallow rollo lift and i'm Like dude, okay, so I am this is no secret. I'm 54 years old. I have always lifted weights I've always been athletic. I've always been competitive. I've never taken trt Okay, because the next thing out of anybody's mouth is well, it looks like trt's work This guy's like I don't care. Why can I not own this? Why can I not just have done this naturally? Do you want to you want to know why I never cared about that? Do you remember mark? I don't care about it. Do you remember uh, what's her name margot robbie in wolf of wall street? Oh, yeah, you remember they don't or eddie falco in the sopranos. They don't care where the money came from They don't give a shit that you were doing illegal shit I know hundreds of dudes who took anabolic steroids and I know thousands of women that those dudes fucked and not one time Not one time have I ever heard a woman be like, oh those big muscles you have. Oh, you took steroids I'm, not gonna fuck you anymore. Not no one Time because you want to know why because they don't care about your struggle They wait at the finish line and they fuck the winners I did a uh, I did a a live stream last saturday with my i play in a band called trial of ascension We just put out an ep on uh on spot of our third ep actually is now available on spotify You guys already know this but I did a a live stream with uh, first time I ever did this with my bandmates And we were in the rehearsal studio and I had a tank top on What do you think they they didn't talk about the music? The questions weren't about like, you know, like hey, what do you you know? How are you? Who are your influences as a guitarist? No. No Uh, what what supplements are you taking? Like what's it? What's your workout like? Well, it's a mazda I can't believe you're not on trt Um the squat rack that's my trt. There you go squat by the way Actually if you do squats it actually increases your um hgh levels you should go it increases growth hormone Um, so let's talk about this man. We are almost at uh, four hours now So I got one last question for you. Here we go Uh, what do you think is most misunderstood about your work? Oh gosh, where can we start? um I think that a lot of the stuff I the most the thing that's most misunderstood I think is people who want to cast me in a particular mold because it fits their ideological bent right or They would like to take my work or take like little snippets of like Andrew tate was talking about, you know Take a 30 second snippet and they want to make that the whole the somehow they were going to dismiss you because of this one 30 second thing Uh, the same thing kind of happened to uh, myron and fresh when they were doing that interview with dj academics and uh, and britney renner a minute and a half, uh short is all anybody cares because they just want to see people get their comeuppance and um I think that's kind of tragic right now because we live in the tldr generation the tiktok generation where we're used to a 45 Second clip and that is becomes the sum Total of whoever that person is. I have 20 years doing this. I have five books So when people go and they go rollo, you don't have any receipts show me the hot bitches You're relatively don't get no hose man, you know, like that's one of my intros and and um, like so when I hear that stuff I have to laugh. I have to own it now because I have to laugh at that So show me your receipts. Show me your receipts. Okay. Well my receipts are Uh, let's see. I've got a 40 plus notch count I I have been in uh, I was in the metal scene of the late in late 80s early 90s I i've got all of the i've got a lifetime worth of receipts. I've got five books that are receipts I've been in this for 20 years as receipts and it's like Show me the hot bitch with the big titties So here's here's the issue right because I I do have a few of them and uh Those girls and I will tell you that if you were saying something that was incorrect academically or empirically Like myself or justin waller would tell you it was wrong But it's not the thing is at some point the high the the scientific method does not work. Here's my hypothesis Let's prove my hypothesis. The scientific method is here's my hypothesis now disprove my hypothesis So what should happen is somebody should read the rational mail and say well And then I put this into practice and then I had terrible deleterious results and that doesn't happen So that's the reason why like I don't care that you've been married 26 years doesn't make any difference But like that's the that's the reason why but if you were saying something that was empirically untrue I would know trust me, bro. I would tell you and it's not well I usually I usually get into like people will always say rollo. You need to debate destiny You need to debate ruslan. You need to debate this guy or that guy or whoever else and i'm like, okay Well, what are we going to debate about if you're going to sick if you want me to come on your show Or you want me to do something? We're going to talk about whether i'm a good guy or a bad guy That's not a debate. That's a that's opinion. That's belief, right? So what you're saying makes you an evil person. I don't like is what I say true Did like where am I wrong? Oh, you got long hair and a ponytail. Where am I wrong? You know, where am I the scientific show me what show me what show them? Okay, so oh here Okay, so here's what what really throws me off is this when you do Algebra when you do calculus when you do trigonometry It's not enough To get the right answer. You have to show your work. Yes, right You can't you can't just because you could just easily just say it looks like this is it right here You could just stumble into the right answer But the teacher wants to show how did you work this formula out? Show me your work. I go to the point where I go and I show the work. I show the studies I showed my rat how this is how I got from point a to point b and this is why I say Men and women can't be friends. This is why I say the alpha widow is a thing This is why I say war brides, right? But all they hear and all they see is the answer all they see is the the the and they disagree with the answer, right? War brides this soulmate that what you know, all these things that i've been known for over the years, but they never check the work They never go. Okay. I'm gonna i'm gonna see what the fuck this guy is actually talking about because when they do Then suddenly they go, okay, maybe he's got a point, right? So it's usually ignorance and I can excuse stupidity. There's a difference between Stupidity and ignorance. Okay. There are a lot of people who are Very smart people, but they're very they're ignorant because they simply don't know the family ignorant of a lot of things, right? I'm a very smart guy, but I'm ignorant of certain things The difference is I don't go popping off about things. I don't know about right and then there's stupidity Which means you just simply don't have the mental, you know faculties to process that, you know Understand what we're even talking about in the first place. I can excuse Stupidity because you don't have the raw material to work out the problem What I can't excuse is ignorance especially when you're trying to make a buck off of your your Confident ignorance about what you think I have said over the course of 20 fucking years Yeah that I know is empirically false and is Statistically factually and even but if you watch my show false because I never said these things or I have said other things Yeah. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense, man. That's crazy Yeah, I get this a lot when I when I post statistics I'll get to these guys in the comments stop trying to push your ideology on other people and I'm like you don't understand what? Statistics means I'm not pushing my ideology on you. And that's that's it. That's an issue I that's the thing like what I want to do different what I wanted to do with this show is I don't want to have Arbitrary arguments. We're at the end. We feels before we feel good about what I said It should the ends of my show should feel fucking uncomfortable You should have learned something that bothers you a great deal and that means you probably got some truth and I probably won't grow My youtube probably won't grow that fast But I'm I would ray way rather because some of these questions have answers. I have a This is actually God's side. I kind of I stole this from God's side. Sorry God. I have an Obligation to objective truth. Yeah, yeah, and that's what that's what he would say I think he said that to rugged so fuck your feelings. I don't know if you saw that episode You said something interesting to me when we were at barbecue and you said I can say there's an 80% chance of rain tomorrow and If it doesn't rain, that doesn't mean that I was wrong It means that there actually was an 80% chance of rain, correct But it didn't rain just happened to be the 20% this time and it didn't actually rain So I wasn't wrong when I said that empirically everything I said was a hundred percent But the outcome might not have been what that yeah, that's one thing we had to do when dr Bus was on here because he talks about when he ever he makes these statements He has to say in general He has to say this because that's how statistics work people do not know how to most people especially on this on social media If you have a shorter attention span, you have a binary type of thinking instead of a nuanced way of thing That's part of the TLDR generation. They want to make a decision and move on to the next correct, correct So if I say something and you're like, oh no I found this man and everything you said was wrong and I do porn and He accepts me for the way that I am and I'm like, okay, that's awesome You are outside of two standard deviations By the way, I'm not mad at you. You didn't prove me wrong. You had just you prove the statistics are correct You asked me about Michaela Peterson in that that whole situation and there was a time I think I was on I was on with Freshman Fit I mentioned this I said look at the end of that like she took she I know she was on Freshman Fit and she was Was asked like what what was it like to go on with Rolla Tomasi kind of thing? She's like, well, you know, we talked about these things there's just some wishy-washy bullshit, but at the end of the At the end of the thing she was like, but I didn't really feel I didn't get a good feeling with Rolo afterwards Yeah, like after the thing I'm like good good And I thought about that and I'm like was that the function was that the purpose were you hoping to feel good and have some? Good warm fuzzy moment afterwards. I'm not trying to be a dick. I'm just trying to like educate.
