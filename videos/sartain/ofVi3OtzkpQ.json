I don't know if you guys night I don't know if you guys want to be do three hours on each one of you So I thought this was a great way for us to like get out here talk about what's going on in Las Vegas Talk about dating in this city, which is really different from anywhere else and in general talk about like some sociological surveys That that kind of are interesting to a lot of people. So I'm gonna get to our four guests here today I'm really excited for first one. She is a pageant model. She's a professional smoke show. She's in better shape than you are Welcome, mrs. Jordan sky to the podcast What's up, Jordan and also she's an internet superstar you'll see her all over Las Vegas She's uh, she's always out at the clubs with me. Sometimes. This is miss Natty nugs.

Great Beautiful beautiful and she is an adult actress She is a financial dominatrix what you're going to get into quite a bit and she's a cannabis influencer. This is miss Domo What's going on? Beautiful glad to have all you guys here So the couple things I wanted to start this off because I just did fresh and fit like three times last week We had a question that we asked there and I really loved this whole thing because it kind of it kind of sets up the Whole point of this show, right and it is we always talk about men are like this or women are like this One thing that was always annoying to me is whenever I watch dr. Phil or Oprah or the viewer, whatever Don't get started They would they would make these they would make these fucking statements and the thing is they would ask questions and there are answers to These questions do men cheat or women cheat more? There's an answer to this question. You guys know that right? They've served they've surveyed 30,000 people anonymously that are men and women you can find out actual answers to how many people an average person have had sex with Or how long a marriage lasts or whether or not a marriage lasts There's actual answers, but nobody ever looks these answers up and these answers are done a lot of times by the US Census There's do it done by different Different universities and that's one of the things that we try to do on the show We try to have an evidence-based approach to dating relationships and evolution evolutionary psychology as far as stuff Is that like that is concerned? So the first thing I want to ask you guys is the demographics of your ideal man Okay and it could it's I know obviously if some of you guys are seeing someone you're gonna be kind of in a tricky situation because If your ideal man is 6-3 and your boyfriend's 5-7, this is gonna be a problem So whatever answer that you need to give is it's totally fine, but we're gonna go with the ideal man Can you write these down real quick? I'll run it while I'm on it. Okay, cool. So here's my my notebooks in the in my backpack. Okay, beautiful beautiful So let's do the first one Jordan. There's a couple things. I'm gonna ask you Okay, I'm gonna actually can we can you also can you pull up the the delusional calculator? Yeah, okay So here's what we're gonna do All right We're gonna take we're gonna take the numbers for your ideal man and we're gonna look it up as a percentage Okay, because this is something a lot of ladies don't know now The thing is for you ladies, obviously you live in Las Vegas You're exposed to a lot you guys are all on social media You're exposed to a lot men a lot more than your ancestors were do you understand that right more men have seen you in your Life than your aunt your great-great-grandmother did in 1850, right? Your great-great-grandmother may have met a total of 15 men in her entire life Maybe 10 and you guys have been I'll bet you if we go through your impressions on all four of your Instagrams We're coming up on four or five million impressions a month, right? So this is a very different world that we live in but with that being said one of the things that I think a lot of women don't understand is how few men there are like for instance how few men Are over the over six feet tall. What do you guys think? Would you take a guess? Yeah, I don't know. I feel like There are a lot of like shorter guys. I feel like like for me, especially being a tall girl It is so hard to find a guy that's like way taller than how tall are you? I'm five eight So, I mean, yeah, definitely as far as like that goes. What percentage of men do you think are over just in the United States? Okay, um, I would say probably like 40 40 percent of men over six feet tall. What do you think? Yeah 30 30, what do you think? Probably like 20 20. What do you think? I was thinking the 40 40. Yeah, it's 14% of men are over six. Oh, yes Once you get once you get yeah, see now, here's the there's the first expression we can look at any space. I think everyone's tall Yeah, okay. So good. How tall are you? All right good get ready because this is this whole show is gonna be just like this Okay, so now 14% I know when we get to six foot three, how what percent is a population? What do you think? Just blur that a number real quick What six It's 1% of the population is over six foot thirty. Yeah 1% of the population now What happens is where do you guys you guys live here a six foot four? Gorgeous former male stripper turned VIP host walks you into the fucking nightclub has tried to fuck all of your friends Sleep sneaks in your DMS. You understand what I'm saying? I got another question. What do you think the average height of the average American male is? Yeah, no average height five six probably five probably five eight I Would say like five eight It's interesting that you would think 40% of men are over six feet tall, but the average American male is five eight That doesn't make any sense. It's a 510 Sorry, yeah, so five nines the average North American male, okay, got it. It's cool. So Tom Cruise five seven cool So we're gonna go now. The other thing is I'm just just curious What do you think the average guy makes in the United States like a household income for one person single male? What do you think? Average maybe like probably like 80k Wow. What do you think? Average man We're talking about annual right? Yeah Average man make 200,000 I don't know realistically with everything that just went on in the world. I don't know maybe like 70,000 I know that sounds crazy, but Average male 70,000 Okay before tax Interesting, yeah, it's $37,000 a year. Oh Interesting so 1% of men are over 6 3 The average meet the medium take-home pay is 37,000 for a household. It's 69,000 for a household Yeah, yes again. You guys are used to being hey I went to the club the guy spent 15k bottle men and he makes a 4 million a year Isn't that how most men are? No, the guy like it seriously if we were to go to Walmart and you were to see like the Filipino cashier Who's 5 foot 5 foot 2 you don't even notice him when it comes to dating? You don't literally don't even fucking see him and that's the thing That's one of the things we're trying to bring up is that like the world is not what you think it is Just when when you're here like when women complain that men cheat the number of men that cheat is extremely low Most men don't have the ability to cheat. Most men don't have any chance whatsoever to cheat. You guys understand No, it doesn't That's funny No But a lot of men in Vegas will come here because they have an advantage like again the guy the guy who works security at The nightclub takes fucking roids He you know and he works like three or four different jobs and he's been with hundreds of women The average North American male how many sexual partners you think he's had in his life? 60 60. What do you think? Six what do you think? Five five I'll say probably like like eight to ten The answer is five it's five it's five. I thought it was seven. It's actually five. It's five four minutes We looked it up this morning. It's three Here's another thing I just because I don't make you guys guess but for men the top 5% of men or top 5% of women Have had 35 sexual partners the top with the most number of sexual partners the top 5% of 5% of men have had 150 so it's a little bit more skewed towards men at the top Where isn't it? So for men it would look like this like so well, actually, let me express this Before we go forward the number of men that have zero sexual partners Before we go forward the number of men that have zero sexual partners or in the last say no sexual partners in the last year What percentage of men have had no sex in last year don't well, you know, cuz I brought this up on your show Do you remember? Sexist guys that that weirdo who does the crosswalk at the school all of them the guy who fuck Age range no 18 to 30 You're right age so the guy who fucking gives you your fucking food at the drive-thru the number of Sexual the number of the percentage of them that have zero sexual partners in the last year 10% 10% What do you think? I would say like 30 30. What do you think? Maybe like 30. I don't know that sounds like an unhappy 70% of men have had zero sexual partners in the last year. That's incredible that's Yeah, so so you so in before 2008 the number was about 16% now it's 33% It's almost doubled in the last decade because in 2008 what happened? What happened guys What happened in 2008? The Facebook app went on the iPhone That's essentially what happened in 2008 and from that point forward you're right men's ability to communicate with other women Became almost non it just non-existent does it make sense and it got significantly worse and worse Social media did not make it easier for men to meet women. It made it easier for a small group of men with Lamborghinis With Lamborghinis with fucking six-pack abs with paddock watches With mansions to meet all of the girls does that make sense? And then part of the proof is when I asked you guys what percentage of men you think were six foot three you said You know what four percent or whatever and it's one percent So these men that you think are normal making two hundred thousand dollars a year By the way, the top 1% of wage earners in the United States make how much what do you think? We're talking the top 1% the top one. You're at the very top 1% What do you think it is? Do you think two hundred thousand three hundred thousand four hundred thousand three million four million I was thinking like at least Two million two million Meaning ninety nine percent of people ninety nine percent of men make less than this number Maybe like seven million six seven million a year a year not total net worth. I'm talking about how much they make a year seven million Maybe like five six five six million. Okay, what do you think? One million ten million Yeah, probably a million. Yeah, beautiful four hundred thousand dollars What you guys have bottle you guys you guys who've worked in bottle service? You guys have people you serve all the time that make more than four hundred thousand dollars a year, right? One the top 1% of wage earners makes four hundred thousand dollars a year. The average man makes thirty seven thousand dollars a year Ready Wow now, here's what happens now you start because here's the problem a lot of women like why can't I find a good man? And the reason why is because you think they exist when they don't They fucking don't and that's the thing It's like it's one of these things that this city kind of screws you up because you met a really hot guy who works at The club or whatever. He's you're sleeping with the DJ and you're like, no, he thinks that I'm different but no the DJ's been with a bunch of girls because the DJ six foot three makes $200,000 a year and he has so many fucking options. You don't realize whereas every other man you met in your entire life has None, it's not it's not a linear progression. It's a fucking exponential progression So we just said 33% of men zero sexual partners the average North American male has five So once we get to the 50th percentile, we're at five when we said we get to the top The top 5% we said a hundred and fifty partners it goes like this That's what it looks like. So it's like and when women are complaining about men over and over They are literally fighting over this one this 5% of men that they're all fighting over. Do you understand? So with all that in mind now, let's let's not we do that ideal guy. We're gonna find we're gonna find your ideal guy I almost wish we'd done this first. We did it in reverse, but it's cool because now they have A preview here. Yeah, cool. You like this? We do a lot of sociological Cool, it's about to get way more interesting once we get to this part now the first question You we're going to talk about your ideal man. Okay, how tall he is? How tall is he? Can you write these down so we can put them? Oh, yeah. Yeah, well average amount. Yeah Needs to be a minimum of what? It's got to be taller than me, I guess but you're five five foot. You're five feet. Yeah, baby. That's right. You are Yeah, getting taller than me. I used to care. So five one is good. So five one is the bare minimum Seven five so maybe that would be the lowest good enough beautiful Natty Really Okay Again, I think you're five three You're fine a good day. Yeah If we hang you upside down for half an hour, you're five three if you if you spend a week in space You're five foot three. Yeah. Yeah, cool. Shout out to the flat earthers. You can go to space Fuck you minimum height Six six feet six weeks, okay There goes the average. Oh, I'm five seven five seven. Really? Okay, this is crazy area This is definitely the shortest we've ever got so just to let you guys know on dating profiles It'll go like you'll have a normal distribution for men. We don't care about a woman's height at all Absolutely, no preference men will put five foot three. No five one. They do not care in the slightest men do not care whatsoever There's a few men that are super into like models in New York or whatever, but this is a, we're talking about less than one percent of men. Most men absolutely do not care about height. For women, you have this normal distribution in Europe where it goes by centimeters, right? And the normal distribution looks like this, but not in the United States, because we don't go by centimeters, do we? We go by feet in inches and it goes like the normal distribution is six foot three, six foot two, six foot one, six foot, and then at 511 it drops off a fucking cliff. This does not happen in Europe. It only happens in the United States. For some reason, American women who go by the imperial system, that six foot number is a magic number, even though it doesn't mean shit. And most of the guys that you're dating who are six feet are wearing those Balenciaga lifts. That makes them two inches taller. Alright, let's do age. Age. Minimum age, maximum age. Oh, man. I mean, based on experience, probably somebody either 25 years older than me, maximum, and then minimum like two years younger than me. Can you just give an age for the guys? Oh, for the guys? Oh. Without me asking how old you are. I thought we were like picking out our max that we would date. Yeah, the website doesn't know how old you are. I need an age range. Probably like anywhere from like my age to like mid-thirties. How old are you? I'm 28. 28 to mid-thirties. To mid-thirties? Yeah, mid-thirties. Let's say 25 to 35. Yeah. Okay, what do you want? I like older men, so I would say like 40. 40? Yeah. What's the oldest? Oh, the oldest? Oh, God. You're a Fendom queen. We're going to talk about Fendom for a long time here. So 40 is your youngest. 40 is my youngest. I mean, I could go like 36 maybe, but say like 55. Okay, yeah, say 36 to 55. What do you want? I'd say like 30 to 50. 30 to 50? That whole range. Ms. Nugs? 23 to 40. 23 to 40. You would date a 23-year-old? Get it. Real talk? I'm really like motherly. Yeah. I usually take care of people. So that's... Rob the cradle. Okay, cool. Got it. All right. So let me get this in here. Now, here's the thing. Just so we can skip this part, just in case. Do you guys care about his physique? Would you be with a guy who's a little bit chunkier or you do not want someone who's obese or you don't care? I absolutely give a fuck if a man takes care of himself, because why would I be taking care of myself more than he is? Hell yeah. Okay. And what do you think? Yeah, same. Like, I mean, it's not a big deal if they're a little out of shape, but as long as they're like healthy, that's my main thing. It's like you don't need to be jacked or anything, but you do need to be, you know, healthy and in shape and keep up with me. I want to like, you know, I'm going to I'm going to exclude obese. Yeah. Okay. What about you, Domo? You would exclude obese? I personally, I mean, I want to do obese, but I personally don't really care. But as long as, yeah, they put some initiative to like going to the gym and eating well. But I do like people who. Yeah, I feel like it really depends on the person. I like really scrawny, sometimes like really tall, skinny, like. Heroin chic. I'm like learning so much about Maddie. But I also like dad bods. So it doesn't really matter. Oh, there we go. Okay, we're coming back to that. I just recently started liking men with muscles. That's that's new for me. I was never into that. It's the cycle, roided up cycle every spring here in Vegas. That's when all the fights, that's when all the fights start. Wintertime, the dad bods come out. Girls are laughing because it's true. So the thing is, what the problem with the whole dad bod myth is if I were to show you an actual dad bod, you'd be like, that's gross. People think dad bod is Jason Momoa. That's not dad bod. Okay. Oh, God, no. Yeah. Dad bod is like pasty, fat, no six pack muffin top hanging over the side. That is that's the dad bod. Leonardo DiCaprio. Actually, yeah, I mean. I had to have to see. Yeah, like a range for sure. I've just found that when women say dad bod and we show dad bod, it doesn't it doesn't match up. All right. So we should. And then the last one. Yeah, we're going to we should exclude. We'll do both. We'll do both. We should exclude married or not. Yeah. Would you guys ever date a married person? Just raise your hand if you would. No, no. Have you guys ever dated a married person? Oh, I mean, I would date them if like I was dating their wife, too. Okay. Good answer. Yeah, I don't have that option. I know. I have. I usually check off like a different box. I have dated a married man, but I would never do it again. It would just have to be more so like on terms. Yeah, for sure. I exclude married. Yeah. OK, so. Oh, now we got to do race. No, we didn't have the money yet. Well, my minimum income. Yeah. Like how much they would have to make a year. Yeah. Minimum. Probably at least probably 70,000. OK. Minimum income. Annually. Yeah. Oh. I don't know. Forty thousand. Forty. What do you want? What do you think? Maybe more. Came back from where I come from. I feel like you've got to be making more than my real father, first of all. I'm not going to take you seriously. Second of all, I'm thinking about a mill. I know that sounds crazy, but I have my reasons. I have my reason. OK, I'm going to average it. That's fine. That's fine. And yours? Now, what we're going to do is at least you didn't say five. That's what CJ Sparks said. He said she said five million a year is what her minimum was. We'll do the highest and then we'll do the lowest. Go ahead. Highest and lowest. No, not you. I will. I mean, I feel like as long as they pay all their own bills and are making me take care of them, it's fine. But like I said, I usually end up taking care of them. So I don't I guess I don't really look at guys' money sometimes. And it's one of my flaws. Yeah, it's all I care about right now. It's actually one of my biggest flaws. Trust me, you're going to care about it. Have you ever dated a guy who's homeless? Who's homeless? Yeah. Couchsurfing, homeless dude. Have you ever dated someone? I didn't know. Or would be homeless if he were. He just came over and had a backpack and then never left. Yeah. And I was really confused because. And what ski resort did he work at? You just came to visit, but you have your toothbrush, like everything with you. That's weird. I'm learning so much about you, Natty. I did not know. I just give a number. What's the minimum number you think they'd have to make? OK, like 40. 40. Yeah. You know, it's interesting. We had Amanda Nicole on here a while ago and she started talking about when she was dating guys in Los Angeles. It's like they had so much money that they would like not pay a lot of attention to some girls because they were just fucking loaded. She said, like, I like living in Vegas because these dudes are broke. They're so good looking and they're fucking broke. And it's funny. And it's funny listening to you girls, because the answers that we got in Miami for women who are not, I don't mean to be rude, but like not anywhere near an order of magnitude less attractive than you guys. They they were all saying they needed guys making one 30 or less. And and they believed I mean, their their numbers were outrageous, except for the mill. They were their numbers were just fucking outrageous. Every one of them wanted a guy with six three. It was crazy. All right, cool. So very, very cool. So now here's what we're going to do. Let's do this. Let's just let's exclude obese. Let's do we got to do race, too. Oh, right. Sorry. Yeah. What race do you not or do you not care? Yeah, I don't care. Any. Yeah. Any. OK, because the options are this any white, black or Asian? I don't care. Any. I like white boys, for sure. OK. We are in Las Vegas. That is the least common answer in Miami. Yeah, I don't really care. I don't really care. I'm just going to put any at this point. OK. All right. So let's start it. Let's start at the top. So she said, no, we can't do what? No. No. OK, well, the lowest was the lowest was 40 was 40,000. So the top will start at the top. The top would be five hundred thousand. Well, she said one mil, but I don't you can't go. I can only I can max it out. That's a max out is five hundred thousand. The top one percent of wage earners in the United States make four hundred thousand dollars a year. So that's that's it. So let's max that out. And then let's say the tallest you said was six feet tall. I got the average at five ten right now. Yeah, but no, but let's not do the average. I want to do the top. Oh, the top. Yeah. So the top was what? Six. She said six feet tall. Yeah. She said a mil any race. And then they said not married, not obese and not obese. And we said the age range was 20. Let's just say for this, let's just say twenty five to fifty five. Just put them all in five to fifty five. Got it. All right. Those parameters we just gave you. They're six feet tall. We're going to do all of my way. They're six feet tall. They make seventy thousand dollars a year. They are not married and they are not obese of any race. What percentage of men do you think that is? Seventy thousand. Seventy. Yeah. Actually, no, no, wait, I was maxed out, maxed out, maxed out, maxed out, maxed out first and then we'll do five hundred thousand. OK, making five hundred thousand. What percentage? Ten. Jesus Christ. OK, what do you think? Probably like point five percent. Point five. Somebody can do math. What do you think? Point three. Point three. What do you think? I was going to say like two percent. Two percent. What is the answer? The answer is zero point zero one zero. So it's one one hundredth of one percent of men because because because because we just said four hundred thousand is the top one percent wage earner. So the number can't be higher than the number. It can't be higher than one percent. Does that make sense? Now do the same thing with seventy thousand dollars. Seventy thousand dollars. Same numbers. What percentage of men? What do you think? Probably like five percent. I'll say five percent. And I don't know, like one percent. What do you think? OK, this is the two percent. Two percent. What do you think? Getting close. Zero point eight three percent. Almost one percent. So ready? Here we go, guys. You want a dude who is over six feet tall and make seventy thousand dollars a year. It is eight tenths of one percent. That is the likelihood of you finding them now. It's good. It's good for you guys. It's good for you guys because you live here with a bunch of fucking male bartenders, male strippers and male VIP hosts. And they're all a lot of them are in that category. And so you believe that's what they're talking about. By the way, a lot of the hosts here are lying about how much money they make. So that's essentially what happens, you know, because they end up on your fucking couch for a long time. But that's essentially what happens here. And so this is kind of part of the delusion where women start to believe that these numbers exist. And part of the reason why is because social media kind of makes us believe it that way. By the way, men have the opposite problem. You know what it is? It's called pornography. We watch porn and we start believing that women are like that and they're not like there is a male delusion calculator. Yeah. Oh, there is. Yes. Oh, cool. I know we need to check that out. Definitely have to check that out. The problem with the male delusional calculator is like your physical attractiveness is not something that's very easy for us to, you know, calculate. You understand? Yeah. Well, there's different criteria. Yeah. OK, cool. Very cool. OK, do we want to do another one? No, let's do the low end. So we're going to do 40000 a year. We're going to do five foot seven. OK. Forty thousand dollars a year. Any race, not married, not obese. Forty thousand, we say five, what? Five, seven, five, seven. Any race, not obese, age range the same. Let's do twenty five, fifty five. OK. OK. Forty thousand. All right. Now, this sounds like now we're here, we got this. Yeah. OK, so not married, any race, at least five, seven, not obese and earning at least forty thousand dollars per year. Hey, by the way, there's another thing. You know what? Most people making over one hundred thirty thousand dollars a year. Most of them have in common. They're married. So when you guys say not married, you are excluding a massive amount of the male population. That's one of the things that happened because a lot the most the majority of millionaires in this country are married. And so that's the reason why that that was also excluded that. So go ahead. What's the answer? Well, what do you got to go around? What do you think? The answer is five or seven, seven, forty thousand dollars a year. Probably like two percent. No, it's going to be hard. Go ahead. Twenty percent. Maybe like 50 percent. I don't know the answer to this, and I think it's going to be over 40 percent. What do you think? It is nine percent. Nine percent. Nine point zero percent. So the reason why that is, again, because it was a ten year. You win because of the marriage, because of the marriage statistics. And because, like I said before, so many men in this country make less than thirty seven thousand dollars a year. That's the reason why that number so low. Now you're getting towards averages. So you've got five, seven. So we already know that the average height of American males, five, nine. Do you know? Do you know most of the club promoters you guys know don't make forty thousand dollars a year like that, that there's a lot of there's a lot of that. Yes, for sure. The guys who are stocking the shelves at Walmart in the middle of the night do not make forty thousand dollars a year. And so that's the reason why that happens. Now, if we were in New York state, yes, if we're like in Manhattan, those numbers are going to be skewed upwards, obviously, because the cost of living there and same thing in Los Angeles. But in general, if somebody lives in Waco, Texas, there's a lot of guys out there that are not making forty thousand dollars a year. Crazy kind of sucks to be a dude, doesn't it? Yes. Kind of kind of gives you some insight to the plight that they have and why so many of them like started doing a bunch of crazy shit on the Internet in the last couple of years. You understand what I'm saying? Yeah, this is this is one of the reasons why I want to do this, because I wanted to have people understand whether or not you like people like I don't know. We'll just say Andrew Tate. The reason why so many people like why there were 12 billion searches of his name this past year, he was the most searched person on TikTok and the most searched person on Google back in August in the entire world was because there were a bunch of these men who nobody noticed. Do you understand? And women are like, oh, yeah, just get be hotter and taller and just have more money. Why don't you? Then you'll get all the girls you want. Do you understand how demeaning that was to a lot of men? And they were sitting there and nobody was listening to them. No one noticed them. And then he came up and started saying the stuff he said, regardless of you, if you agree with it or not, the reality of the situation is that's where it came from. Does that make sense? It was almost like when you think about the coal miners during the Trump administration, when he was talking to these unemployed coal miners, getting them to vote for him or the African-Americans that ended up voting for Barack Obama, they went and found a group of people that did not feel like they were being represented. And then they then they represented those people. That's essentially what happened. Got it. Got it. OK. The other thing is also the obesity rates, too. So, yeah, that's the other thing about 75 percent of 75 percent of the U.S. population is. Yeah, that's the other reason why. And I should have I should have said 5 percent of men are obese and 40 percent of women are morbidly obese. Yeah. 75 percent of the population is obese. Yes. When you go to Europe, you don't see these morbidly obese people. So one of the problems is from a from an evolutionary standpoint, your species, and you can see this with like Yama Mano, Yama Mamo Indians, and they're certainly Yama Mamo, Yama Mamo. Sorry. I know it's hard. This is Professor Jared Diamond from UCLA. Thank you, Professor. Before before anybody gives us grief about this, because I know people are going to take this and they're going to go. They're going to clip it. Are those numbers really what? Yes, they are. They're they're drawn from the U.S. Census Bureau data and the NCHS data. So go talk to them if you don't believe it. So so with some of these Inuit tribes, some of these ancestral tribes, what will happen is when you when those people are injured, when those people are introduced to McDonald's, the. Some they're introduced to like Western cuisine that often they become diabetic often They become morbidly obese because in their society there there they're scourging for food right there hunter-gatherers They have to hunt for meat and they might not eat eat consume meat for maybe once every 14 days Then all of a sudden they live in this like you can be lower middle class in the United States and eat enough french fries Till you die till you fucking die you can afford french fries till you die There's a 99 cent menu over at Wendy's that will fucking kill you if you want it to you understand So that's that's the reason why we don't have to forage for food anymore. And so we have an obesity rate That's just outrageous. And that's that's what happens You can use fat in certain ways where it actually acts in the brain like heroin There's a great look on this call sugar salt fat and the omnivores dilemma If you guys want to read that you can actually use fat and it will trigger the same reward center as fucking heroin That's what happens. And so people do that They trick that some of these food producers trick your mind and then so you're eating those lunch Lunchables with the crackers and the fucking yellow cheese in it. Yeah, they were so in the little pizza the pepperonis and everything Are you guys on diets? Like are you guys do you like stick to? Yes, I mean most of you are like well all you are like our models to some degree I mean you're on Instagram. Are you on some sort of like fitness slash? Diet program. Yeah, I'm meal prep. No carbs ever. No carbs I She punched me the other day I was like, dude, oh she hadn't had any carbs I'm at least like aware. I don't like I'm not on a strict diet, but I've cut like, you know, read me out And I just try to pick healthier options now Yeah, I mean same thing with me. Like I just try to eat like a lot of me around this time It's like audition season. So right now, yeah, I would be dieting but normally like when I'm not at the pool then I'll just you know, like same thing just kind of like eat healthy for the most part but Also, I'm not gonna turn out a pizza I was doing really well And then I've just been traveling the last two months I had To go see my family and then holidays and I also just I love food. So It's really hard for me. Yeah no, I asked that because I think a lot of people what what I what I get a lot of criticism for is like a Lot of people will watch shows like this or they'll watch like pressure fit or something else say well Those women on that show are like hand-picked or like cherry-picked from you know, this is the we want to in some way Insinuate that that this is the you guys are the average, you know women out That's why I'm asking about like food and your preps and stuff like that to see like exactly like what it is that you guys Do just because clearly you're no one here is overweight So you're already beating the odds as far as like the 75% of the United States But I think that a lot of people will probably say well they starve themselves, right? They're there they do they wake up in the morning and they just like have coffee and stress. That's their diet, you know Actually, the the hardest challenge for me was having a baby and then going back down to my size Did you breastfeed I did my daughter didn't really latch on okay well and so but I did try for the longest and then once I was done I was like You've seen where women will breastfeed to the point where they'll be ripped. Yeah, they'll burn off every calorie They have to do nothing They'll end up breastfeeding their children to they're like five or six Because they lose the killer they use lose so many calories that way That's crazy If you just had like a pump that could just all the calories in your body would just go to be freaking incredible Travis I see there's one super chat there, but before you ask that How many of you guys are on birth control right now? Hell no No, no one at this table is on her mom really where it's why I feel like I'm so chill Yeah, okay, so you tried it before and then what? just Makes you emotional. Yeah, I think that there's a definitive line between girls that take birth control and girls that don't Travis Can you read that real quick? I sure can ladies and gentlemen You know, you can super chat this stream and these ladies might actually read your comment who knew so this super chat is from Pat Steadman's polished passport. Thank you Pat have the ladies notice any difference of guys They're into when they're off birth control versus on birth control. Great question. Did you notice any difference? Yes, and I actually From being to the doctor they say that's a thing that happens You can actually be more attracted to a male that you're with While you're on birth control and then the second you go off of it your hormones change and you're no longer attracted Jesus Christ Yeah, we just had a podcast about that. Yeah last week. It came out a couple of days ago So basically the idea is this and I want to ask you the rest of this question Because what will happen is you're basically the way it works is when women right before the week before they ovulate They're more attracted to men that have more masculine features There have been several studies that have been replicated that show this that women have you looked or shift? Yeah, so there's an ovulatory shift that happens and women are more attract They tend to wear red colors and they tend to be more attracted to men that are hoop earrings Yeah, and they they tend to be more attracted to men who have like symmetrical fucking masculine features And what happens is when you're on birth control this doesn't happen anymore and you end up with this is this is not my words But somebody else's words these women will end up marrying men who are much more beta much more feminine looking than what they're normally attracted to then when they try to have kids they get off the birth control and they Look at over the over there Fucking weak chinned husband and they're like what the fuck is this and then divorces happen then massive amount of divorces I understand that though because when you're on birth control, you're way more emotional. I feel like your mental Equilibrium is a little bit off So you're gonna need a man that is more beta that's gonna listen to your shit and put up with your crying and put up With you being emotional whereas when you're off of it You're more stable so you can have a more masculine man that it's gonna put you in your place when you're acting out He's gonna be like cut that shit out. So I I totally agree with that. I yeah I be with an alpha I had to get off of it because every time my period would come it was like a Super emotional for no reason and I would have like really bad fights with my boyfriend's and yeah Did you notice? Libido, did you notice attraction that was different when you were on it attraction to different types of men when you're on it No, no, I don't see that's that's a common thing so so here's the thing I know I don't know if you and I've ever had this conversation before but One of the things when we're talking about Like ovulatory shift really what it is is it's throughout a woman's menstrual cycle There's the first 14 days and then there's the last up to 28 days, right? So the 28 day cycle so between day one and day seven I know he's gonna say here we go between day one and day seven is when you get really bitchy and that's the PML pre-menstrual Syndrome comes through there. Okay, so but from like 7 to 14, that's when you're ovulating and that's when it's time to go Do the girls night or go? Hey, let's go to Vegas and what happens in Vegas days in Vegas, right? And so then the egg drops and then you go into what's called the luteal phase and that's the phase in which like women tend To be more attracted to more feminized features They're looking for a comfort and rapport you go get your girls around you and that's when you call your beta boyfriend and say Oh, he's so fucked up. I can't believe my help man. You know, I fucked him last week, whatever That's when you get the the guys who are like sort of like a beta orbiters to give you that comfort and everything and then Right towards the end of that cycle right around 20 like about the 28 days point right there that's when you go into being real bitchy and you push away all the all the betas and all the all the Orbiters and you go back into the cycle once again, and by the way, I didn't know if you were aware of this But it also emulates pregnancy and you're the only one that I know at this table has been pregnant So you've heard of the did you go through a nesting phase when you were like when you were pregnant? Did you like want to like stay at home and and eat? Mac and cheese totally be comfortable and like sort of in that necessary home. Yeah So what what happens is after right after when you go into a luteal phase it goes There's a kind of like a smaller a lower scaled nesting phase So the body thinks a female body thinks that it's pregnant then it goes into like Oh, I better get all my girls around me because I I might be pregnant and so therefore I'm gonna need support I'm gonna need you know The the village to kind of help me out here and then they real then the body realizes that it isn't and that goes back Into the cycle once again, you go and start looking for guys who are more alpha And that's where the the idea is is that that hormonal birth control pushes that pushes that down now some people will say well There's been some studies where what you guys experienced was I I was with the guy. He was very beta I went off of hormonal birth control and I'm like, what am I? It's like waking up from you know, some stupor like oh my gosh. What am I doing with this guy? But Marty dr. Marty Hazleton As far as I've been able to find out in her book hormonal It doesn't necessarily like eliminate that that want for the alpha It just compresses all of that like the luteinizing hormone and progesterone I think so It's not so much like it eliminates the alphas alpha fucks side. Yeah of that It just it depresses it and convert So when when you go off of it, it all spikes up again Once like going off and say like TRT or something. Yeah, all your hormones come back up again. Yeah, very nice Oh, did you notice before or after on birth control? Do you notice any difference in who you were attracted to? Um, I mean, no, not really, but I definitely didn't notice that would be more of a psycho and I was like And I mean, isn't it what only like six days out of the month that a woman can actually get pregnant Yeah, so I mean that was another reason that I went off and I was like It's just not worth the emotional like turmoil and all that. Yeah. Yeah. How about you? Did you notice any difference on and off birth control? Um, I was on birth control for like seven years straight And so I didn't even realize the difference until I tried taking a few months break Usually whenever I was in a relationship, that's when I get on birth control because then I'm consistently having sex Thank You Brian and then I Changes when you're on or off birth control, yeah No, I realized being off of it how much crazier I felt trying to get back on it And I I just I took a break and decided to not go back. Yeah copper IUD for the win Yeah, they wrote that in the chat. I thought that was funny And I don't like like things stuck inside me that freaks me out. So it's just How do you ever have sex I'm at my bed forget it, I'm sorry What was crazy when I was on birth control because I was on it since I was like 16 or something I Noticed by my 20s. I I even got to a point where I didn't even want sex. My libido was so down like I Didn't want it at all. I didn't care for it. Mm-hmm. You're in the adult industry and you didn't Before the adult industry and I I noticed something and so I just consciously I'm you know a little bit into like homeopathic Remedies and I was like, you know, I'm just going off I tried every method the pill the ring the fucking whatever the copper The IUD I did everything and I was like, you know I just I'm gonna go away with it and after I got off it my libido was Through the roof and I guess yeah, I stumbled in the adult industry I Tried to describe for people the madness of this But it's hard for them to understand the tryouts for the pools here the one thing people don't understand is like what we do generally the way it works is the pools fire everyone at the end of The the pool season the pool season here goes from the beginning the middle of March to the middle of October about the third week Of October is when the pools close during that time They let everyone go and then they do a rehiring process that happens the first week of January and you see a bunch of girls In here, they buy a bucket of clenbuterol or not Yeah, and then they fucking they get ripped to shit and then they go do the tryouts, right? And then they lie about oh, yeah about their their bottle service experience when they used to work at the right now. Anyway I'm just saying this because it's true Anyway, so you've done this several a few times and you and you're one of the girls who gets hired What percentage of the girls do you think get hired that that tryout? Man, I don't know probably I mean it depends most of the polls are only looking to hire like anywhere from like 27 to like 50 girls depending on like what pull it is so if you have like Hundreds sometimes even like I don't know What would you say you do ball service to write like a thousand girls like showing up like that's super low percentage Like what's 10%? I don't know The other part was I remember one year at encore Beach Club. They hired back 38 girls and only hired two new girls Well, it was the same thing I wet like I wet Republic I was one of the three girls that they hired everybody else that already worked there Yeah, so they hired three girls now the I've heard it's more than 8,000 girls that come out here for this That they're gonna come so they're gonna do The main trout is going to be for Tal hakasan, which I believe is on the 3rd and the 4th January 3rd and 4th January 2nd and 3rd is going to be It's gonna be resorts world. So that's I you what's a competition like that A lot of people a lot of girls that want to it's like a like I said It's like 8,000 there used to be a line when you go The hakasan competitions used to be at LAX Which is a club inside of Luxor and there was a line down the street and it was funny because club promoters would go out There and they would just like get girls info because most of those girls were gonna end up either working They were gonna either like a cocktail as a strip club moving back home Becoming an atmosphere model or dance or becoming a stripper or end up working at like some lesser club That's essentially what happened But those big two and then so the big three are gonna be for the win It's gonna be for IU and Zouk and then the main one Which the most the most properties is gonna be tal hakasan and those are all gonna happen the first week Maybe the second week then they get callbacks and then they come again. But the answer is it's less than 1% It's like less than what but for the bottle server job. It's less than 1% for bartenders It's a higher percentage because you actually do have to have a poor card and it is a skill set So fewer people can apply and if you have the in there and also men can be bartenders So it's a it's a greater number of them that a greater percentage of them. There's bottle car as far as bottle servers I believe the highest paid bottle servers on the planet or in Las Vegas So this reason why every every January there are thousands of girls that come out here if you guys stand in front of Tao on the 3rd of Town the 3rd of January you'll see literally a thousand girls out there waiting And then some of the girls like I'm sure you probably don't have to wait in the same line Like there is a VIP line for some of the girls Yeah, there's a there's a VIP line for some of the girls if you if you know one of the hosts or something like that It's incredibly competitive. You have to do your interview in a bikini, right? Yeah, pretty much like I mean not the actual like interview. So if you make it through the second round then yeah You're gonna be in normal clothes But for the first round it like it's basically a cattle call like you show up you're in a bikini you You have this super bright ass light shining on you, you can't even see like the three, you know, whoever's looking at you, and then they ask you to do a walk and then they see your body, they ask you three questions and you're done. You literally wait for like five hours just for like, what, two minutes of the whole thing. Yeah, the first interview is solely looks. Like it's a yes or a no. Does she have the look? And if you have it, you move on to the next one, if you don't, you're done. But it's wild too, because you'll be there for hours and half the people, I don't mean to say this, but half the girls that show up, it's almost like they're delusional. You know what the other bottle service girls look like, you know, the work that they put in. It's a 24 seven year round thing that you're doing, you're taking care of yourself and some of these girls, it just makes it longer for everyone else. And you're like, what in your head makes you think that you could have this job when you see what the rest of the staff looks like? What's the answer to that question? That is part of the problem. Part of one of the things we show on this show, part of one of the things we talk about on this show, delusional. Sorry guys, I'm on a hell of a lot of promethazine right now. Can I ask this, what's the look that they're looking for? So if you don't have the look, then it's like, thanks for playing. They're holding up the line. No, they don't even say thanks for playing. Everyone tries out, they just don't call you back. I think right now, I think the look has changed. I think it used to be, the look was about being super skinny, but now at the clubs, I think it's about being skinny fit. And I think it's definitely like, if you have an exotic look, you're going to get pushed right ahead. If you look different, and it's really like lights and darks. If you have really light blonde hair, you're going to go through. If you have bright red hair, you're going to go through. If you have jet black hair, you're going to go through. But anything else that doesn't really fit that whole Maxim, Playboy, FHM look, Sports Illustrated, you just have absolutely no shot. Can you be too over the top? Can you be like too much? Absolutely. And that's what I think separates being a bottle server and then working at a strip club. And I have so many girls that are out of the strip club and stuff, but there's a definitive line of still maintaining that model, almost like supermodel Victoria's Secret look. And then having that more so porn star look, and they'll be at the strip club. Yeah. So it's like this 50-50 toss up. Yeah. And then there's all the girls that you're just like, oh my God, you're just holding up the entire line. Why do you think they're doing that? The word delusional is going to come up a lot. We just had the delusional calculator. We're talking about how the type of men understand why do these women believe what they believe? Why do they think that they're going to get that job? They went to Wet Republic. They saw the fucking girl. Do they see Emmy Zoop? And they see all these fucking girls that are out there that are fucking perfect. Like Tori Lupo. I don't know how she is. She's fucking perfect. Love Tori. They see these girls and they're like, they're in perfect shape, right? They all look like they can squat four plates. What makes these girls that stand in that line think that they're going to get that job? It's, it's, it's, again, it's just being delusional. It's ignorance. And it's, yeah, it, do you think they're entitled? They think, Hey, they're going to, so they're going to, there's a thing that's causing they should, that there's like a quota or something for, for girls like them. Yeah, absolutely. I think that they're entitled. And I think that they also have men around them, beta males that, you know, gas them up and encourage them. Where are these beta males coming from? Where are they interacting with these beta males? Where? Yeah. Vegas. Clearly the strip club. It's the whole social media thing. Correct. Social media. That's exactly right. So what's happened is these women that what, what happens with a lot of times with women is they go on, they go on IgE and they'll sit there and post a photo, but they'll snatch their waist on Facetune and then they'll submit, they'll make their face symmetrical and perfect on face out. They'll look like 20 years younger. And in their mind, they believe the girl in that photo is going to the trial, not them in the mirror. Do you understand? Exactly. And then they'll go to school Turkey, show a picture of them face out and tell the doctor, I want to look like this. Do you understand? And so that level of delusion, because the men, when they, those men give them that attention from a psychological standpoint, they're getting validation for the person in that photo, which is not them. And that's why you're sitting there for five hours instead of what should be like an hour trial. Because I can honestly, I can tell you in two seconds, if a girl is going to get a call back for, for what Republic I'm one, I guarantee you, I walked by that whole line. I can tell you 100% of the time you're getting a call back. You're not, you're not, you're not. You are, you're not, you're not. I can tell. Exactly. And so can you, I'm sure you can too, from working there. Oh, for sure. Yeah. Also, the other thing I want to comment on when Hakkasan first opened, you guys remember in 2013, half the waitresses were Asian. Yes. Yeah. Cause that was the look that they were going to look, they were going through. There was also like, there was also like, uh, I remember, uh, one year at fucking Encore Beach Club, all the girls had like the same high profile boob job. Like it was what it was where you can tell that the guys are doing the hiring and all the girls that rehab and fucking what did they all have? Do you guys remember all the girls that rehab at tattoos? You weren't, you weren't getting hired at rehab unless you were fucking inked up and same thing. Like some of the girls that Drays had tattoos too, but yeah, it was like every club had their own type of girl that they would do. Whereas what Republic, it literally was IBFF pro like that. They were looking for fucking monsters there at one point. So I was going to look, that was the reason I'm asking, is there an over the top, is there an extreme that will like knock you out of the running? We're talking about the girls who like are never going to get there in the first place. I love you. I love you Elaine, but Nicolette Shea is not getting hired at wet Republic. That's it. That's it. I love you Nicolette, but she's not getting hired at wet Republic. Let me, let me throw this out there as sort of like something else, something else to think about. You're on OnlyFans, correct? Yes. Is anybody else on OnlyFans? I'm on OnlyFans. You are on OnlyFans. So we got two that are on OnlyFans right now. You guys are, you two are not on OnlyFans. I'm a fan club, but it's not OnlyFans. I'm also on Pornhub, I'm on other platforms. The reason I'm bringing this up is because I think that perhaps it has something to do with the fact that guys that you want to know where the guys who are encouraging these, these girls to go and do that. I think that there's, there's a certain demographic of guys who see women on porn or on Pornhub, on OnlyFans and the top earners on OnlyFans don't look like the girls that are, that are going and are the top, you know, contestants or, you know, getting into these clubs. They're girls who are like, they're not like tens, right? They're like seven, seven and a half because they look attainable. And that's what I was saying. Oh yeah. When I managed the strip club. Yeah. The girls who made the most money were not the hottest girls. Yeah. It's as if they, they're approachable. Like maybe I could get it right. She's the girl next door kind of thing as opposed to being over the top, which is why I asked you that. Yeah. But there's a difference between over the top and symmetrically perfect. Like when you, when you go to some of the, when a club first opens and they get their pick of the litter, like the first week, like the first week Omnia opened, every girl who worked there was perfect. They had the girl, like they were so perfect. They were like the furniture. You didn't even notice them. They were so perfect. Like I've noticed that's something that happens where you ask guys. But is that the draw though? Because like, but this sounds like, if you're dropping a hundred K for a table, yes, that is. Okay. So the draw, the draw is there are the hottest women on planet earth are in this, are in this. I believe the hottest women I've ever seen in my entire life. And I've been to the Playboy mansion several times. The hottest woman I've ever seen in my entire life or cocktail servers in Las Vegas. Yes. So what I'm, what I'm saying is this. So when you're on only fans and guys are paying you small fortunes every month because they have that sort of girlfriend experience, so they have, they want to feel like they have some sort of connection with you. There is no way those guys are going to go into that club and feel like they could possibly have a connection. Oh no, no. This is absolutely true. Yes. So yeah, I've talked to this. I've had clients do this before. Like literally I'll introduce them to like a cocktail server and they don't remember meeting them because the girls are so far outside of their reality that they're, they're like the girls are almost like furniture. Do you understand what I'm saying? Yeah. The girls are so beautiful. It's like going to the circus. Yeah. These guys are like, you know, very like socially awkward. They can't even think about going in to a club, let alone a strip club. But you know, it's also only fans is like a new market base of this social media people. So there is potential of, you know, rich people, there's celebrities on there. They have fake aliases. So some of them could, could potentially be in the club. What I'm saying is like the, the, the standard, the barrier to entry, I guess, to, to that venue right there is to the clubs, to Zouk, to, you know, Wet Republic, those, to those are guys going to that because they think they're going to go there and meet the hottest woman in the world and they're going to actually get laid with them or they're going to have some chance with those. Are we talking about nightclub? I'm trying to say, I'm trying to, what I'm trying to suss out here is like, what is the criteria for, um, for the women that are going to be accepted to be there, you know, for that? I mean, are we talking about atmosphere models, girls in the club, or are we talking about I'm just saying like, so like why, why do guys go to those clubs in the first place? I think it's a function of status and meeting beautiful women. But do you think that they're going to do that? Does the average guy who's going there think he's going to have a chance with the, like the top shelf, the elite level, we just had, we just had, we just had two great comments on here. One of them says anything over an 8.5, it goes anything over an 8.5 or higher. Not mad. Waste of time for you. Gents. Another one said, it goes, guys always play the odds. Waste of time dealing with a 10. No, most guys don't think that they have a chance with girls like that. That definitely, that is not the frame of reference thing we've been talking about for forever. It definitely is the frame of reference. Now the thing is, I hear some girls, we had Tawny Jordan over the other day, Tawny Jordan's won several different pageants. She's the only woman to win the bikini competition at rehab and wet in the same year. And she's a world-class ring girl. And she says guys don't even approach her when she goes out. Guys don't even approach her. I get that a lot too. Yeah, it's like, I don't know if men are afraid of me. Of course they're afraid of you. I'm fucking afraid of you. I'm afraid of you now. We're friends and I'm fucking afraid of you. Listen, I'm pretty sure I can beat you in a wrestling match, but I'm not completely sure. I'm not completely sure. Well, that's also a function of scarcity too, because they're not used to being around. Yeah, I think though too, when you compose yourself in a certain manner and you're very composed while you're out, I think that men don't really know what to do. Whereas the average female girl that's kind of more like, not really composed, not caring about her reputation or what other people think about her, they're going to be more approachable and guys are going to think it's easier to obviously go home with them. But a person like myself or anyone sitting at this table, a man has to step up to be with us. You have to bring a lot to the table. You can't just walk in here and expect to go home with me. There's a lot that comes with it. Okay, you're correct, but you also heard those numbers we said at the beginning of the show. And so what ends up happening is you end up being with a guy who has a lot to bring to the table, but he also brings his other girls with him. That's the issue. It's like one of these situations where maybe it's not you guys specifically, I'm sure none of you have ever been cheated on, but sometimes there are dudes in the city who will literally be everything you ever wanted and they're also talking to other girls at the same time while you're at work. Yeah. When I first moved here to Vegas, my first experience dating a guy in Vegas, I went on two dates with him and each time he brought a different girl. Did you know that was going to happen or was this like an openly bisexual thing? No, I asked him to please not bring someone else if he was trying to pursue me. If he wanted to get to know me, then I would like to spend time together on our own. And then he brought another girl and the second time she tried to fight me. That was just a different guy. You got to send me who it is. Just text me who it is. I got to know who this is. You got it in Vegas? Yeah. That's incredible. Actually. I'm sure I know him. There's no chance I don't know who he is. Of course I know who he is. Let me throw this out because I'm looking at the chat here and I recognize you. Don't worry. So when we're talking about League, do you have trouble with guys? Do you think that guys are intimidated by you, like they're fearful to come and approach you? Or do you think that they're just simply saying, she's out of my league. There's no way. Forget it. There's no point in me doing it. Like they're trying to cut their losses. Do you think there's a fear factor or an intimidation factor? Or do you think that it's more like, um, it's just, uh, the, they already shoot themselves in the foot. Like they already self-defeat before they even attempt. Yeah. I think it's a fear factor. Absolutely. And I think that it's that most men nowadays don't have their shit together. So why would they approach someone like me? That looks like they have everything together. I, I really feel like that's what it is. I feel like it's like men just don't want to step up. Do you think that they're like limiting themselves from like approaching you or actually having some sort of like, like even just having a conversation with you? Yeah. Yeah. Do you, do you encounter this too? No, I mean, yeah, I do. Like, it's funny because, um, I have like dated guys who like, you know, you're a cocktail atrius, so you probably get hit on all the time at work. I'm like, I actually don't like even my own like clients, they're just don't, they're like, bring me girls. You know, they'll like talk and flirt a little bit, but nothing, nothing crazy. So, but as far as like that, um, I mean, I've had like guys come up and literally just say, I'm not hitting on you. I'm just letting you know that I think you're very beautiful and walk away. I'm like, okay. Like, so I compliment. Yeah. So they'll make it very clear. I'm not hitting on you. So I don't know what that's about. Like, yeah. They'll in person. What it's about, what it's about is that they're hitting on you. Well, I mean, they're hoping you'll go, Oh wait, don't come back. Come back. It's cool. Yeah. It's called a, what's it called? A disqualification. Yeah. It's just, it's just, it's antigame. It's fine. It's antigame. It's called a false disqualification. Don't disqualify. Yeah. It's just, it's just game. That's what's wild though. In person, you know, they're all timid and afraid, but in your DMS, they all think they're I want to see Bob's and Virginia. I want to see Bob's and Virginia behind the computer. They're wilding out. They'll say anything to you. Do you want to do the sex? Do you want to do the sex? I want to see the Bob's and Virginia. Show me now. I'll tell you, I come from a background of working in a wine and spirits. So I was, I was a art director, principal creative for a import export company. And so I would have to hire talent to come to promotional events and things like that. I was a guy that was actually picking out the girls and then I had, you know, my select few that I knew were good for particular events. So if I was going to go do a show for like a, I don't know, a martini fest or higher end, there were certain girls I would bring in for that because I knew they were approachable and I knew that they could, it was more than just like, I'm going to pour drinks for you. It was also having that slightly flirty conversation with the people who were there, right? If I'm going to like a goth bar or something, I even go to a rock club. It's a different, that's a different caliber of poor girl that you're going to have to be there. And so what I was, what I was noticing at these events is the, I found myself choosing the girls who had the personality factor that was sort of like made them approachable. There were good conversationalists. I knew they weren't going to get drunk while they were there too. But they, the, there's the, not just the beauty factor, it's like the, the girls could be so exceptionally attractive that they would be intimidating for the guys to even come up to whatever booth that we had for whatever drinks we were pouring. And so we would tend to pour less on those if the girls seemed like they were too over the top and they were too flirty. Extreme was opposed to like you get a girl who's like an eight eight and a half like a man You know on the ten scale and she could carry on a conversation Then we would do way better with with on that event as a result I'll tell you as a as a manager to strip club one of the things I noticed I couldn't believe because I girls would tell Me how much they'd make because they didn't tip out or whatever I couldn't believe like it was it was never the hottest girls the hottest girls were always super frustrated They were all in the guys were always like I have no I know I don't have any shot with this girl and the girl Who was like one rung down who? Really knew how to make the guy thinks that he had a shot without acting slutty like acting super slutty in a strip club is actually A really short-term strategy and it doesn't work super. Well, it's like keeping them chasing keeping the chase going and Yeah, it's all it's all hustle it's all Psychological too. Yeah, so so what those girls ended up making the most money They were the ones that like you were saying before like to the level that's unattainable I know you guys from events that I threw I went in your podcast But I know you guys mainly through events that I threw I could tell you like Jordan you would be Intimidating for most guys to go up and talk to you these big fucking bright blue eyes and you're built like a goddamn linebacker like you you Big old fake boobs and your ability like you look like you kick somebody's ass I'm saying this in a good way in a good way in a Vegas bottle server kind of way That's why I'm saying right and so that's that's the thing like it's kind of hard and the other thing UK You were at my birthday last year Remember how madness it was it was like 50 of us then bulls arian showed up and all that kind of stuff Nobody was coming up to our table You remember that like nobody was coming anywhere near us like they were intimidated by us Yeah, I mean until Dan until Dan got there. Yeah, no, I invited him. Yeah Do you remember do you remember that one dude throwing water on him? Yeah, he threw a drink bulls arian takes a drink and he throws it up into the balcony You remember that shit was crazy. That was a fucking crazy night, man. Shout out to Jason Strauss, man I'm watching the chat here. It's like everyone says it's not about fear. It's not about intimidation They just don't think they have any shot with a sure with a top-shelf girl. So they simply just don't do it So it's like it's easy to it's easy to characterize it in that sense because it's like it then suddenly you seem brave, right? Well, you know, I know better than to bother with that. So I'm just gonna you know, I'm I can't get with the nine So I'll stay with the sevens and so it's like it's like It's league mentality is what I've written about it in the past But for instance like I met you as soon as you walked a year the first one to come in here Jordan And so like as soon as I'm talking to you, like I'm used to this because I have you know poor guy worked in the industry Right, but like we also have music in common, right? So we have like some some sort of you know thing to talk about. Yeah, it's not it's not like so seriously It's not intimidation as far as like the conversational side of things I think it's the guys who just simply have they live in this mind the scarcity mindset where it's like Maybe if they had taken that shot, maybe if they had actually, you know Stopped believing in this league mentality, then there would be having these conversations. They might get a little bit further than I think they can. Yeah Yeah, it's really crazy. How many you guys have been to one of my events and you haven't you've been you never been to babes No, I haven't. No, I haven't been to that one. But I feel like I would met you at any event I don't know if that was like your event though. I don't remember. It's been a while. You've been to babes. Yeah, okay Yeah, you've been to babes. Okay, so you guys been to babies in toilet? I have found that that like a charity event or something like that soup kitchen Any kind of volunteer work is the easiest way to meet a girl who's out of your league and there's no intimidation We're talking to them I think any kind of if you guys want to know this is one of the key tenets we teach in men of action is The idea in the event planning pillar, which is the seventh pillar I think of the program when you in that pro in that part We go over exactly how to create these events that give value now if I were like Hey guys, you want to go do a comp dinner at SDK the four of you been like fuck that I've done comp dinners that why do I need you? Hey, I can get you on stage at XS Steffi would just be like get the fuck out of here. You don't stage it. I don't need to get marshmallow Just wrote me last night, bitch I don't need you to get me on stage at XS because you guys live here, right? You know when girls come and visit I'm like, do you want to go on stage at Zouk? They're like fuck. Yes, but you guys would have no problem getting on stage It wouldn't it would be any problem with you at all And then so that's not those kind of things the promoter thing incredible book. I highly recommend all of you read it It's called very important people by Ashley mirrors She's a professor of sociology or she's a doctor of sociology and she went undercover as a model for two years in New York Just going to nightclubs every night and she wrote exactly how everything worked and I there's stuff I didn't even know Jason Strauss is mentioned often in the book. There are two Harvard case studies on Jason Strauss I don't know if you know this Harvard case studies on him and I'm reading them right now. He goes and speaks at Harvard regular And so there's a really really awesome book I don't agree with the interpretation But the documentation is fantastic and when you when you see this the way that these the people live it's just very different It's it's hard for a lot of people outside this realm to understand when there's a table full of atmosphere models You know you've seen you've atmosphere before right? Yeah Guys are looking at that. They're like what is happening? How are there this many beautiful women there and then who's paying for it? And then they're like this same thing happens for me every year for my birthday. It's at least like 50 girls They'll come dressed in like a themed outfit and guys are looking at us from other tables and they're like, what is he a pimp? Like what's happening there? I don't understand. They'll come and tap me on the shoulder. Like hey, man, what's going on? And they asked me these weird questions. I'm like not just my birthday and they want to hang out with me Cuz I guess I'm not fucking weird like you. I don't know what happens I don't have a bunch of pictures of my fucking creepy ass, you know, whatever on my Instagram I guess that's maybe what but that's the thing that I found out the events are What I found to be the key the easiest way to find some level of common ground Without the cold approach because it's very difficult for a lot of people to be able to do that You know, that's that's why I planned this whole program about around events because it made it a lot easier This is why I would consider event the six of us hanging out here and you know You you're drinking all that tequila and no wait, I'm just kidding Cocaine in the back, you know So she's not doing anything Every time I Used to think this way it is it's I see I'm watching you guys in the chat. Trust me. I hear you But like I used to think in terms of there are 1,000 people watching us live. Yeah, I was Sometimes I'll go to like Miami or I'll go to like I'll go to Fort Lauderdale and I'll be will be You know walking from a set to set and they're I mean beautiful yachts or like everywhere like these beautiful boats are everywhere and I Would be sitting there. I'd be like, how do these guys afford these fucking yachts? I mean, they're just I'm in multi-million and there's as far as the eye can see there. Yeah, but somebody does Somebody owns that yacht. Somebody's paying for that slip. Somebody is paying for that that actual, you know Whether or not they're taking it out of often who even knows but somebody owns that Yeah, and so what like I was thinking about this in terms of like this limiting buffer like mentality It kind of applies to a lot of other things as well Like approaching a beautiful woman like somebody somebody's got to be what somebody's got to be with you guys Who's it gonna be right? It's gonna be you or is it gonna be? It's gonna be somebody who actually just took the chance to actually come and talk to you because they got over this You know the scarcity mentality to do so Yeah the other thing and I loved I've heard several people talk about this is the rich guys who have no game whatsoever in it and It's like this idea that just being rich is enough. Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's also does that I'm sure you can talk about this often Where there's super wealthy guys, what's the highest men you've ever you've ever been a bottle? What's the highest men you've ever done? But Like what's the highest what's the highest been that you've ever had you personally? Me purse. I don't know. Um, I mean probably around like recently, maybe like 60 K 60 K. Yeah, you've had a If you had a hundred K at wet was there one of any hundred K's at wet the whole summer? Oh, yeah, not with me. But like with our like girls who are fucking monsters. Yeah easily like every Saturday for sure There's one or two hundred hundred K. Yeah, but I went to Houston last week Dollars for tables like it's a hundred thousand dollars for a table. Go ahead. What was it? What is that like buying a house? What is experience like for this guy who's spending a hundred grand at a table? I mean, honestly, those girls are like on another level like I I don't know what they probably just someone with upsells The girls are upselling them to 100 K. Yeah, what is the guys experience? Like what would you how would you describe it? I mean, they're having a blast like every time we go over there We do that they're having like presentations like have a ton of girls like getting champagne showers Like they're having a fucking blast over there And and the thing is too they know that they're spending this like, you know And we were also like really good with like making sure that you know with signatures and everything So but yeah, I mean they know what they're doing and then they're having like the whole time like we're up there We're hanging out and you know, I mean at marquee it's a little different because we're allowed to actually drink with them and But at wet like we're not allowed to drink. It's because marquee is not Union. Is that right? Yeah. Yeah Yeah Okay, so and the other thing I was gonna say is like so we were always in bungalow one where I would so I host The play I was hosting the playboy Yandy summer search at wet Republic all summer So I'm coming there Fridays and Steph would be working some of those Fridays I would have bungalow one Bungalows three four and five would always be big spenders in there and I would take those guys and make them judges in the bikini competition Whoever the whoever the host manager was would tell me who it is I was like, yeah for sure. We'll bring them in and then we'll make them judges in the bikini competition We would do that also as part of the experience. But yeah, dude, they're dumping bottles of champagne on each other They're not even drinking all the alcohol. It's not really possible to drink all the alcohol One of the reasons why atmosphere models were created was just so that they could drink the out the excess alcohol So that the guys would buy more champagne There's some girls I know that are like pert like they specialize in getting guys to buy more champagne Like that's their only purpose when they go there is to do that. It's crazy How many girls are there on a shift like at one like one night? How many I mean? What like I mean cuz I'm at Omnia now to Omnia There's probably like I don't know like 40 something and then at what there was only like 29 of us but it depends on like the day to if it's like a slower day and then there will probably be like I Don't know like 19 or 20 of us and then they'll like cut girls, but usually on a full day Saturday There's 29 and they cut you by seniority to write Yeah. Yeah, so they have they have they draw for seniority every year actually, but you don't mean that's 20 Months a year. Yeah, so seniority set for the top girls there. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, cool Yes, and you already gets reset every year in the pools, but not at the nightclub so you can age out Yeah, it's it's that that's a whole nother thing because their model. What what is the description for its model? Model cocktail servers and so they actually can weigh you Yes, they can't they have to weigh you just like in the NFL if you if you if you go overweight in the NFL the NBA they can find you the same thing they can they can find girls for being overweight you guys wonder why I live in Las Vegas They can find girls for being overweight as a model cocktail server Yes, and it's the fastest way to fire a girl that they don't want on the staff. So say one girl slip in She's just not really doing her stuff. Boom out comes the scale put her on the scale immediately fired It's the fastest way to get rid of them. It's weird though, too When you do have those big spenders because they're very peculiar some of them with what type of girl they want So they may latch on to one girl or this guy only likes brunettes. So he only wants brunettes in the cabana or He only likes blonde. So then he has just a bunch of blonde girls You really have to customize their experience to what they want And I think it's even further than that like the clients and stuff I've had then you have to get yourself and then three other girls you got to go out to dinner with them after because you want them to Come back and spend the same amount of money the next day It's almost like this whole entire experience that you have to give them for this one weekend when they come in. It is crazy I've seen yeah, here's another thing. That's nuts. So a girl will work will do Friday and Saturday at hawk us on and then on Sunday They'll go to to excess and so let's say they're at Hawks on the hawk us on bosses will tell them No, you're going with that client to fucking excess Yeah like they will not leave they will not let the client out of the cocktail server site the next night because the guy spent so Much money, so I've seen It's like a casino. Oh, what is it Mandy Olsen? I can't remember one time I think she got off on a Saturday to follow a client to another club to make sure that the guy came back or something Like that. Yeah, it was crazy the kind of because of how much money these guys were spending It was nuts But often you'll see them go to one club and then a different club and that's a lot of reason why the cock song grew Tell Hawks on will have multiple clubs because it won him at Omnia one night and at Hawks on the next night at wet Republic On Friday and then go to towel Beach on Saturday Is that that that's part of the reason why they do that? But for a lot of people it's really hard to explain to them because atmosphere modeling, you know, it doesn't exist in other cities There's a word for it, but it does it's not the same thing girls We'll get sit sit there and get paid a hundred an hour just to sit at a guy's table That does not exist in other cities And in fact, it didn't exist in this city until 2013 when somebody came up with the idea to do it And then afterwards it just kind of took over everything. Yeah, it's really interesting. All right. Now you're in a relationship Yes, and you single you're just single. I just got out of one. I'm right back in one now Is it a different one? Really is that that long? There's a bunch of disappointed motherfuckers in the chat right now From the last time you were with your ex to the first time you're with the new guy, dude. How long was that? I've seen 10 hours before I am maybe like I Would say like a month a month. Was this guy? What was this guy waiting in the wings? Did you know who he was while you're with your ex? It's warm. He's in the bullpen You fought did you find him attractive at all or did you just not notice him and then you notice him once you were single No, I found him attractive the whole time. You found him attractive. Was he your type or was it do you have a specific type? Due to what my last relationship was like I Feel like he's different you were overcompensating you were compensating in the opposite direction because of what your last relationship was like Yes, I've been I've definitely been there before. Did you did you meet him at the club? No, I had a mutual friend So it was so it's through friends mo a mentoring.com mo a mentoring.com She met him through a friend mo a mentoring.com sign up made it feel safe. Mm-hmm I probably would have been alone for a very long time after what I just went through But due to who the friend was and the way we were introduced it was a safe Safe, uh, did you have any kind of like previous relationship with him like a friendship with him before? You know, it was just like okay this guy's next. No, nothing Did he could he approach you was it like remember we were just talking a moment Yeah, like guys get intimidated was he how did he approach you? Do you go oh you're single now? Hey, is that how it worked out? No super cool. Super cool. Super smooth. She don't want to say But he but he didn't like that He just slide into your DMS or something or did he actually like say like meet you through a friend and like talk to you And then what went from there? Yeah. No, the friend tried connecting us and then he yes lit into my DMS and then He asked me on a date like a proper gentleman because nowadays for some reason guys don't think that they have to ask you I thought we were just going to after hours at Dre's and getting fucked up, what do you mean, I have to go on a date with you? What the fuck is this? I thought we were all going to Mas Port Favour on Tuesday and just getting fucked up, I thought that's what we were doing. I have to follow protocol? I have to take you on a date? What the fuck is this? I didn't know it was like that. You asked me to be your girlfriend too, don't just assume we're together. You asked me to be your girlfriend. I have a five bottle cop in fucking excess on Sunday night, I thought that's what we were doing. That was our date. See how the girls are laughing because it's so fucking true. It is exact, it is so true that that's how it works here. You're right, I agree with you, I prefer dating, but it's like I see so many couples that get together in the city because it was just like Tuesday they were at Omnia and Wednesday they went to EBC and Thursday they went to Hakkasan or they went to fucking Zoo and then Friday, like they bumped into each other, Sunday at Access and they would just bump each other or they'd be out at Lake Las Vegas or we'd all be at Jing on Monday with fucking OJ Simpson or something like that and we'd just all be in the same circle and the next thing you know you're hooking up with somebody and there was no date. You know what I'm saying? Are any of you now, well probably not now, but have you ever been on Tinder? Used a dating app, any of you ever used a dating app? I made a Tinder, but I was banned from it right after I made it. Because you were trying to get people to follow you? No. So a lot of times girls get banned because they're trying to get people to come to their IG. I think like four or five years ago when it first came out, I was like, I would love to meet someone, I don't have time, I work so much, let me do this, I get the app and then people were actually really mean to me on it and I ended up getting banned within like the first two or three months. Because you were like fighting with them on the app? No, a lot of people kept being mean to me saying that I was fake and they're like, yeah right, as if you're on an app to find a boyfriend and like all these things and I was... No one thinks I'm real, but other people have Tinders with my picture. Hey listen, so in general, I want to let the guys know, when you see women this attractive on Tinder, it's one of two things, it's either a fake, a profile basically. It's not a catfish thing, they're like, oh yeah, come here and then it's a link that leads to their only thing. That's usually what it is. So do you see why she's laughing? Do you see super attractive women on those dating apps? There was a point when Tinder, Bumble and Hinge first started where there was an asymmetry and you could actually meet attractive women on there. That point is completely fucking over now. If it's almost like, do you watch football, right? Oh yeah. You know T.Y. Hilton just signed with the Cowboys? Yes. Okay, T.Y. Hilton, doesn't matter guys, I want you to imagine this. After week 12, they signed T.Y. Hilton. Does that tell you T.Y. Hilton's healthy and everybody wanted him? Yeah. Or that there's some damaged goods there? Yes. Right, there's damaged goods. T.Y. Hilton is signing with the Cowboys because he's not that good anymore, right? The guy was a pro bowler and he's probably been hurt. Yeah, they're hoping it'll be okay. They're hoping it'll be okay, right? This is what happens. When you see a girl who's like that, who looks like that, who's on Tinder, there's something wrong. Something smells funny. Normal, really attractive girls do not spend a ton of time. I'm not saying there isn't a 1% exception, but for me, when I'm on there, I'm just like, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. And you can tell real quick. And when I see girls that I know that are on there, I already see that they're fucking like, they're catfishing to try to, not catfishing, but they're trying to hook guys into a funnel so they can come back to their only fans. It's a great funnel. Well, it's like my good friend. And you'll get banned for that if they figure that shit out too. I don't do that. I don't even interact. They just come over to my Instagram and then when they try to talk to me, I hit them with the. As my good friend Jason Hartman would say, Instagram is funnel marketing for women. Yes. That's basically what it is. Absolutely. So have you ever been on Tinder? No. Have you? I have. So I was like when it first came out and then I stopped because it was like very adamant that these guys just want to fuck. I don't even need to ask. But Jordan, have you? No, I would not. Not natural. Yeah. Wait, guys on Tinder just want to fuck. That's crazy. Where do you get that idea? Well, the reason I'm asking is because. Shut up. The number one way for men and women to meet and link up, hook up, whatever. Even form a relationship sometimes is through online apps, is through Tinder, Hinge, Bumble. It's more through Instagram, but yeah. The reason why I wanted to ask you guys this is because you are at the elite level of going to clubs and being. You are paid to be beautiful, essentially is what you are. And you're not on these apps. But the vast majority of women who are sort of the average woman is on these apps. And I think that a lot of guys say, oh, well, that's just what they're doing. That's how we meet today. It's like in the music industry. How do you become a rock star? You go on The Voice. You go on America's Got Talent, and they find you, and you get a record contract. It's the same thing. It's like, well, how do you get laid these days? Oh, you go on Tinder, right? And you find your girlfriend because that's how we do things today. But I also wanted to point this out. I was trying to highlight this because women such as yourselves are not on Tinder. And if you see someone who is using your photo, it's probably a catfish, or it's probably a funnel to get you to go to the OnlyFans. Yeah. But I do have girlfriends that they use it, and they do legitimately meet guys. And I think they're crazy. Yeah, for sure. I just feel like once we get to Instagram, something went wrong. I mean, I'm sorry. Once we get to Tinder, Bumble, or Hinge, something went wrong. Something somewhere went wrong for us to be at this place. The majority of the time. I agree. I think it was like Instagram or social media was one thing, and now Tinder and these other apps, it was like official that guys were like, oh, great. Now I can really invite myself to try to fuck you. That's industrialized. They will spam approaches. They will spam introductions or likes on you. Yeah. I mean, essentially, they'll build machines that will just swipe through everything. What else is interesting is that we've kind of moved from the old style of writing a dating profile like on Match.com. E-Harmony. Yeah, E-Harmony. It was like, okay, I like long walks on the beach, and I like coffee, and I like rainbows in Disneyland, and all this other stuff. And these really insightful things. This is what I'm about, and this is what I'm looking for in a guy. Now we have gotten to the point where it's no, no, no. And all it is is about the visual. The descriptions are even so low. Yeah, exactly. All it is is, is he hot? Is he worth my while? Am I going to swipe on him or not? On those dating apps, Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge, what percentage of men do you think women deem unattractive? What percentage? I would say like probably 80. Girl, that's what I was going to say. 80. I was going to say 80%. The correct answer is 80%. Yeah. There you go. Guys, I want you to listen to what I said. 33% of men having zero sexual partners between the ages of 18 and 30, 80% of men deemed unattractive on social media. Think about it. Super fun to be a man, isn't it? Yeah, fuck yeah. It's super fun. And then you guys are like, oh, this guy's a piece of shit who cheated on me. You're like, no, that's not most men. That really isn't most men. Most men you guys would never give a fucking shot to. That's what happens. You would step on their balls and then make them give you money. That's what you would do. Is that what you do? Well, I mean, not fully necessarily, but it's only if they consensually want it. You know, I'm a financial domination. I'm not like a dominatrix. I'm not like a femdom. Write me bad checks. Is that what it is? No, no, no, no, no. Go into debt for me. I do. They do consensually want me to drain their credit cards, their bank accounts. Really? Yeah, I do. So I kind of fell into this weird little niche where I used to do live sessions with the actual guys, and I've turned it into virtual sessions. So I do virtual dates and virtual shopping. Wow. And they love it. And they buy my \\u2013 I've sold my used socks, shoes, leggings. Bathwater. Not bathwater. I mean, I haven't proposed that. But, yeah, and I make them buy me high-end, you know, shoes, anything, clothes, lingerie. About how many \\u2013 do you call them pay pigs? Is that what you call them? They are my bitches. How many do you have right now? I have about \\u2013 I have a solid, like, five. But I also have \\u2013 you know, they all come in different shapes and forms because not all of them are super, super rich. But it's like, you know, that 1% of men who are \\u2013 they fall into this. Why do you think they do it? They do this because they are actually in their normal life. They are CEOs. They are alpha males in their business. And they have so much responsibility that people look up to them in their work life, right? So in their personal life, in their private life, they don't want to do that. They want to fucking let go for a beautiful woman to \\u2013 in their work life, for anybody to insult them, humiliate them, talk shit to them. It would never happen. So for a beautiful woman to do that, that kind of turns them on. So it's sort of a power play, a power reversal. Yes, it is a power play, and it's very much a psychological thing. Because even un-beautiful women can do this too. Yeah, I was going to say it's like the top earners on Tinder or on OnlyFans tend to be like just approachable, like the girl next door. I forget the girl's name, but she's making $100,000 a month right now, probably even more than that. There's probably 50 girls I know making $100,000 a month. Yeah, that are at least doing that. But no, was it Amaranth? She's making \\u2013 well, she might be making. She's not really \\u2013 is she OnlyFans? She's a Twitch girl for a while. She's a Twitch girl, yeah. She's a Twitch girl. And a lot of these guys, they're not even from OnlyFans. These guys can come from webcamming, seeking arrangements. Sometimes you could even get them from LinkedIn and Instagram, Snapchat. It's very much how you write, verbalize your bio. It's kind of like this imaginary code language that they know. I get this question a lot because people will say, well, why is it that OnlyFans is even a thing? Pornography is streaming free, 4K. You can go rub one out anytime you want to, but what is the appeal? I'll ask you that question. I have my own answer. I will say this. As a person who came from mainstream porn, it was very different. We had agents that had to book us for shoots, right? And then there was our appearance, our persona. I couldn't dye my hair. If I started with brown hair, I had to stay with brown hair. You just did a feature at Little Darlings and they had you in red hair on the screen, right? Yeah, that was my red hair. I mean, that's kind of my brand now. But what I think a lot of girls need to understand is OnlyFans is really a game changer to the adult industry where it kind of puts the performer in the power and not these agents, not the production companies. And then also, too, because I'm a dom, porn is still a little misogyny. My agent would never book me for a dominant role, maybe a more submissive role. But you have the power to do whatever the fuck you want. When you were in mainstream porn, how old are you now? I'm 33. 33. So when did you start? I started when I was 23. 23, so about 10 years span. And then you just recently got into OnlyFans? No, so I started OnlyFans about 2016, I believe, like kind of when it first started. And it was only because I was webcamming and I actually did pregnant content, which is a huge moneymaker. And a lot of my cam guys were like, you should start an OnlyFans. And so I was like, OK. The difference between camming is the currency is in tokens. So that's like five cents per token. So there's a whole like... Did you have like, I hate to use the term, digital pimp? Did you have somebody like managing you when you were on the cam? Absolutely not. It was all you. It was all me. So basically, like I'm an entrepreneur. So what happened was when I was in porn, my agent started to like book these sessions where we would do this camming. And for me, I'm a real smart, like I'm a business person. So I was like, hold on. If I'm fucking camming in your office, where the fuck is this money going to? And why can't I do this at home? And then why can't... How can I do this so I can teach my girlfriends who aren't really down to do porn? And this is something where they can be financially independent. Because I used to book... I used to man in L.A. I used... Before I did the adult industry, I used to book go-go dancers at nightclubs. But you're talking about $100 for four hours. Wearing nice outfits. Working your fucking ass off. Doing 20-minute sets on and then 20-minute breaks. So it's a lot for $100. And then, you know, you get into music festivals. So the rate's a little higher. Like $200. But it's still... It's not even comparable. It's not comparable. And then as you're working at the strip club, I still work at the strip club. But if you're solely working at the strip club, that's long fucking hours. You're drinking. You know, you gotta drink. And then, especially in Vegas, I call Vegas stripper Olympics. You need to... You're working till... You probably get in 8, 9 o'clock. You are working till 8, 9 in the morning. 12-hour shifts. Yeah. So... The conversation we just had is actually similar to what I had with Andrew Tate when OnlyFans started to become a big deal. Because he was all about webcaming girls and all that. And he was trying to make the case that... Tristan was managing those. Yeah, he was managing. And they were saying, you know, the girls who are the most successful, even on OnlyFans, are gonna be the ones who have like a Tristan or an Andrew behind them. And I was like thinking, you know what? I was more apt to listen to like say, you know, this is sort of a game changer for women who might not ever have been into porn. Or maybe they were married. And then she and her husband just want to have sex on camera. And now they can make... That's their side hustle becomes their main hustle right now. So, as a game changer. Now, the question I was gonna ask you is this. Did you get into OnlyFans because you were aging out of the porn industry? Now, before you get offended. The reason why I'm saying this is because my good friend Sterling Cooper, who is in the industry. Okay. He was saying this. Is that when women get into mainstream porn, they'll go for a little while and they get to a point where they're right about 27 or 28. And then they get cycled out of the age out of it. And then they can come back later on and do like mill for mommy porn afterwards. I have a statement for that. You can never age out of porn. You're probably right about that. Theory. Yes. So you do have a, um, you know, a sweet spot of theoretically, the woman, the performers, um, uh, highlight of streaming of, you know, her porn career is solely four months, four months, you're going to get shot. You're going to work with all the production companies. And then after that, you're going to cycle it out. You already shot with everybody. So now new girls coming in, they're going to want you. But if you're smart, you, once you do porn, it's for life. You have, you have people who are fans of your porn, your art, your erotic art. They are watching that every day. Young boys call, you know, they're coming into college. Mia Khalifa was doing it less than six months, I believe. And she was the number one porn star in the world. She was only doing it for less than six months. And I believe what's her face. Um, Ronna Rhodes, it was also less than eight months. She did porn for eight months and all of her content came in. That is, that's, they aren't lying. That's, that's really how it is. What ends up happening is so for that production company, because browsers, uh, Naughty America, digital playground, you're going to have your scene up there. And then what ends up happening is they shot so many girls. So then your scene that was new goes to the bottom. And then after it's like, what do we do with this scene? Well, they're taking, they're basically making residuals off. So they sell it to the tube sites. So then it just gets, it's just filtering on the internet. But what's powerful is, you know, porn hub and other sites, you've got billions of people go into that site, you know, close to Google. It's called, it's called affiliate marketing. Yeah. It's just affiliate, it's affiliate marketing for your downstream. We're not benefiting off of that, but that is why, you know, for us with social media, you know, we'll get deleted fucking 10 times. But once we go back, it doesn't matter. We have fans that they've jerked off to us many times and they feel a connection. Jay, have you ever been recognized outside of Las Vegas? Have you ever been recognized somewhere else? I have. And it was a little weird. It's so weird for me. I will, I will say that because I have a lot of fun going out and I do like my privacy. So sometimes when people recognize me, it makes me, you know, it makes my guard up because I'm like, Whoa, you know, I want, I make sure if I'm like with somebody, I don't ever want to be put in a situation where it's like, it's just myself. Yeah, I do. I have a question. This is always something that I wanted to know. So you just mentioned the current guy that you're dating now. Jordan is, was introduced you to by a common friend? Yes. The previous boyfriend before that, how'd you meet him? Oh, God. What gig was it? Just through social media. So Instagram? Yes. Okay. Where'd you meet your last boyfriend? Yosemite. You were just out there hiking? You just bumped into him? Damn. Yeah. Okay. And the book saved your life. But no one introduced you. There was no comment. Oh, yeah, I have a common friend. You had a common friend. Did you have the person before that you dated? How'd you meet them? date before that? I haven't dated someone in a long time. Okay. Well, okay. Um, it was also through the same friend. The same friend. Awesome. Steph. How'd you meet the guy you're with now? At what? You guys work together? Yeah. So lots of common friends. Yeah. And then the guy before that, what'd you meet him? Um, through a mutual friend. And then he slid in through my DMS. Yeah, because he was living in LA. So then we were just friends the whole time. And I think I met him. I think I'm in the previous guy to one time. Yeah. And don't want the last guy, the guy you're with, or were with. Where'd you meet him? Through friends. And then before that? I've always I've kind of always met my guys through friends. Okay, so so you're guys saying it wasn't through fucking day game cold approach at the mall. That isn't where you met your balance boyfriend. Really? It wasn't through day game cold approach at the mall. It was through a common fucking friend. moa mentoring.com moa mentoring.com fucking Oh my God, bro. It's so crazy. You guys wonder like, why? So the thing is, that's what I'm known for is like, I build social circles for people. And they always wonder where I came up with this or like, this is some ancillary thing. And like, no, every girl that I talked to that's beautiful tells me the exact same thing that you I knew what your answers were gonna be. I knew it was all gonna be either one of you was gonna say Instagram and the rest of you were gonna say fucking through a common friend. And they all these guys are like, No, dude, I do hardcore cold approach a girl I just go up to random girls at the fucking mall. Like, it's just so crazy to me when I hear the shit and they sell products. They literally sell fucking products, trying to teach guys that this is how they're gonna meet women. And I've been telling them for fucking 15 years. This is utter nonsense. It doesn't work. Your percentages are so fucking low. I'm not saying you can't ever walk up to a girl. My point is, it's a lot better when your guys are at an event where you have common friends. There's this like, sort of like, as men, we don't need comfort to have sex. I'm not afraid if I had sex with anybody, that they're gonna fucking hurt me. Although I there's a few times where they did. They're like, and I mean, physically hurting drain your bank account. Yeah. I'm not I'm not worried. I'm bigger than essentially, I'm bigger than the women. I'm not worried for women. You guys literally have comfort that you have to have you feel need to feel a certain level of comfort towards a man before you have sex with them. Part of you doing that the first time has to do with common friends letting you know, hey, he's not that big of a fucking weirdo. You know I'm saying, or he's dated other girls. And guess what? They were also pretty, which means he's capable of dating a pretty girl, which means it's probably going to be normal. Does that make sense? Right? For you guys? It makes sense. It is so crazy. Even in 2022. I still have this argument with dudes. They still think that no, what I teach is like nonsense. No, get all these girls just said, the last eight of them, seven of them said, I was I met somebody through a common thing. Now I do want to bring this up. Oh, yeah, I got a point. But good. Oh, you want to bring this up? You were dating a co worker. And that's something we talk about frequently. How does that work? Um, I mean, so at the time, I was actually with my ex. So I, you know, when I'm with somebody, I don't even look anybody. So when you started out, what that first week when I saw you at what you were with your ex, and then yeah, and then what happened was, we just kind of like had a common we both love music. And that's pretty much like we would talk about the whole time. It's like, hey, invite me to shows like as a friend and stuff like that. And then eventually, when I got single, we had, we always had great conversations, great chemistry. And then finally, I was like, you know, I should give this guy a chance because I found out he liked me. So and then that's pretty much what happened. Well, you just went out with him as friends. That's crazy. And he when you guys were going out as friends, did he act like a friend? Or was he constantly hitting? No, he was very respectful. I want to point one thing out here, though. So each one of you said the last like person that you've been with has been you met through friends. That's like, exceptionally rare right now. Because when you look at the stats, the number one way that that men and women meet, of course, is online through Tinder, Hingebumble, that kind of stuff. What's been on the decline is meeting your next boyfriend, maybe your husband, via the church, through your family, through your friends, through school, through work. All of that's been on the decline, really, since about 2010. And then the one thing that's been spiking, of course, has been online dating. All right. So here's a theory for you. Tell me if I'm wrong about this. The higher the level of attractiveness of the woman, the more likely it is that she will meet that guy through friends, as opposed to like the more average woman is going to be the one that is going to be on Tinder, that's going to be that's going to make those hookups on there. Do you do you think that's more time? Do you think that's plausible? Well, so so more elite level women, like, let's just say very attractive women don't meet men through. They meet them through friends, clearly. Exactly. Yeah. Rather, rather than rather than the average woman who is statistically meeting the guys that they're with through Tinder. So I don't think the average woman meets guys through Tinder. I really don't. I still think it's true. I mean, I've got the stats. The average girl, I think the average girl meets guys through social media through the internet. So when you count, if we were to count Facebook and Instagram together, it's 10 times more than it would be Bumble, Tinder, Bumble, Tinder and Hinge together. I think Instagram alone would be 10 times more. Just when you look at like the none of those three, none of those three dating apps have have a billion active users. Instagram has 2 billion. I don't think so. So that so let me so let me clarify why am I making this theory here is because what I think is a lot of guys see those stats and they see that the average woman is meeting the average guy online. And so what I have found out is through like very attractive women say, well, he had the balls to come up and actually approach me he had the balls to actually say, hey, well, let's go be friends go go see a show or something together. He actually and that right now I think is like what's what's called playing to the meta, right? Everybody else is doing like Tinder and Hinge or Bumble and it'd be so nice if a guy would just have the you know, sack up and like, you know, ask me out on a date kind of thing that becomes novel. Yeah, you know, most of the guys that I dated, I told them to fuck off so many times, but they were consistent. Oh, yeah, persistent. So I liked that. I was like, Okay, I've, I've told you to fuck off. You're still around. I'll give you a shot. Yeah, it's like, I always say when it comes to men, it's like if you want me come and get me right, like making known. Yeah, that's some alpha shit. Yeah, you want me coming? That's I was gonna say that's the number one thing. You saying that or he's saying that? No, I'm saying like, yeah, for sure. You got to put in some effort for sure. Yeah, but there is still a minimum level of like height, physical attractiveness, like level of charisma that he has to me. This is one thing because girls leave these fucking weird signals that really throw dudes off when they're like, Yeah, I just care that he treats me well. It's okay if he has a dad bod and then I look at who you date and I'm like, No, that linebacker you're dating doesn't have a dad bod. You're saying shit that isn't true. And it's really frustrating for you. It's really frustrating. Do you understand how frustrating it is for men? I remember when I had Elizabeth show alia on here on my podcast. And she's like, she's telling me all these qualities of men that she wants to date. And then we talked she talks about her ex and he's like, yeah, he's a narcissist. I'm like, wait, you just told me the fucking qualities of the man you want to date. And the guy that you're dating is none of those things. And I was like, just stop for a second. Be a man listening to you right now. Do you understand how confusing this is? And how fucking frustrating this is listening to you guys tell us what you want in a man and then going after fucking Chad from thunder from down under. Do you understand the problem? Who fucking cheats you? I'm sorry. Not actually Chad. Shout out to Chad. There's a dude. Hold on. Sorry. Sorry. There's a guy. There's a guy. Stop. There's a guy named Chad who works with under red under. I love you, man. I'm sorry, bro. He's a great guy. I'm sorry. So hold on. Sorry. Sorry. There we in in the manosphere. They say Chad Thundercat. Chad is like, it's just a name for like a Karen. You know what a Karen is? Chad is just a good guy. Shout out to Chad. I like Chad. There is a guy named Chad. He works with under for better. Yes. Yes. It's Masha's ex. Yes, for sure. Okay, man. Sorry. My bad, Chad. I just, as soon as I said, Chad from, uh, from, uh, um, um, well, I tell you, so like what you're saying about like how confusing this shit is. It's like, what happens then is like when, when, when you hear like very exceptionally attractive women say like, oh yeah, I'm into the dad bod and you know, damn well that they're really not into it. I, I, we, I think it was on our very first show. We were sitting here and we said we're, I was making this comparison. I was saying what calendar sells the most? Is it the thunder from down under calendar or Chippendale's calendar or is it the dad bod calendar? Which one outsells the other one when, when we're really, really comes down to it. And the honest truth is it's going to be the hot guy and the hot fireman calendar is going to be what's going to outsell. So there is a, an arousal factor that I think that, uh, we kind of just have to clear the air and just like call bullshit, cut the shit kind of thing. But, uh, so when we were talking about like the dad bod thing, or we're talking about like, oh yeah, I'm really into a guy who's into puppy dogs and you know, rainbows and has to be funny and everything. There's that aspect where guys realize that, okay, maybe there's something to that. But for the most part, what they're saying online is they're saying like beautiful women getting with beautiful, beautiful guys. Right? So when I see a guy like Chris Williamson, for example, trying to explain away why women are really actually into the, the dad bod because he's a better bet for their, uh, their children's future. And he, he's less likely to go cheat because he's not as attractive to other women. And so therefore they feel safer and comfortable with this guy because they know that not very, very many other, other women want to get with that guy. And so he, it's like dads versus cats, right? It's like, and so what gets me is like these guys, a guy who looks like Chris Williamson, who, by the way, if you ever see his, his site, he's like his, his main splash page is him with like a V tape or, you know, he's like a six pack abs, looks like he's bodybuilder kind of guy. He was on like a paradise Island or total drama Island or whatever the fuck it was back in the day. And now he's got a podcast and he has people on like Rob Henderson, like, um, like Dr. Bus has been on his show. And I'm like, why are you promoting this shit? Because the guys already don't believe this stuff, but now you're buying into this and then making content developed because you have bought into this bullshit. He's bought into the bullshit of not looks money status. Is that what you're saying? No, he's bought into the bullshit that there's actually something to the attraction factor of a dad bod. And so we decided we're going to try to force fit it into evolutionary psychology to make it work. We talked about this before. What ends up happening is if you were to get pregnant, your, your pair bonded partner would start to produce what's called prolactin and he would get fatter because from an evolutionary standpoint, he's going to get less sleep. Evolution has selected for, he knows he's going to get less sleep. So he has to, he has to contract more fat. Does that make sense? Yeah, correct. And he eats with you. So that's, that's what happens. What happens for women from an evolutionary standpoint, their ancestors would see that extra weight and be like, this is a man who's going to stay with me while we take care of the children, the child for the first three years. And so what you feel is comfort towards him, not fucking attraction. You do not feel, you don't look at this fat pasty dude. And you're like, my vagina is wet because he's fucking fat and pasty. That is a lie. You feel comfort because you know, this motherfucker is going to stay. That's what I'm saying. That was my whole problem. Because what happens is you have these super hot girls saying, you know what? I really love the dad. And I'm a performance coach. And I'm starting there trying to teach men to go to the gym. It's like, no, no, no. But that girl, you that FHM model you had on said she likes dad bots. And I'm like, dude, you're just fucking it up for all of us when you do this. But women will say that shit. And I get it. You can't teach you. You can't ask the deer how to catch the deer, right? I actually dad bods. I mean, I, it's not that that's attractive to me. What's really attractive to me is humor. And the fact that they are comfortable with themselves, even though they know they ain't they, you know, they're not a thunder down under guy. That's sexy to me like that. That's hot that you can live within yourself even if you're not super fit and make me laugh. So you how old are you? I'm 2828 3333 3030 28. Do you find that the guys that you're attracted to now, maybe your new boyfriend, are different than the guys you were in when you were in 23, let's just say? To be honest, I feel like I had it right back in the day. Really? What was different? Because I feel as though you're more primal when you're younger. So more alpha characteristics is what you're attracted to. Yes, and then, through experience and time, you get hurt and yeah, then you want more of the comfort. But then, at the end of the day, I don't know, the whole ancestor thing that you're talking about, so yeah, I feel like back in the day when everything was primal, like yeah, you'd see a man that was working, like men are hunter-gatherers, and women take care of things, stay at home. Yeah, if I see a man that works hard and that's built, immediately my senses are going. If I see a man that works out, it's like my pussy's fucking wet. But if I see a man that, again, coming from what I was just with, that I thought I wanted, nothing. Like I literally went to the doctor because I thought something was wrong with me and that I never wanted to have sex, I never felt alive. No, exactly, yeah, and so I'm thinking like, okay, something must be wrong with me. And then you meet the right person that does take care of themselves, that is more masculine, that is more alpha, you want to fuck all the time. So I think, yeah, it just depends. And yeah, I think that some women get convinced that they do want the beta, they do want the comfort, they don't want to get cheated on, they don't want a man where all the other women are giving him attention and trying to get with him, you know what I'm saying? So you do admit that him, other women being attracted to him is an attraction trigger for you? Hell yeah. Be the guy that other men want to be and other women want to fuck. Have you changed the way, the men that you're attracted to since your early 20s to right now? I think every person I've ever dated has been completely different. There's not really like a type. Well, I feel like Natty's just on a journey. She's just been. No, really, my whole life has just been a journey of figuring out what I do like. And it started in Yosemite. Seriously. Natty, you gotta come back on, you got some stories. I have a feeling you got some fucking stories. Do you feel like the men that, to your early 20s, just out of high school to now, do you feel like the men you're attracted to, are you attracted to a different type of man now? Physically, I would say they're all around, I have the same physical attraction. That hasn't changed. But as far as what I'm looking for, personality-wise, it's completely different. What's the difference? So back then, it was more of I just want somebody to have fun with who I'm just mainly attracted to, wanna have sex with all the time. But now I'm looking for somebody who doesn't make me feel, it's kind of sad, but doesn't make me feel like I'm hard to love. I'm too much. Somebody who is very emotionally mature can handle me at my worst times. Is that part of why, does it, because you understand, so a lot of guys, I would imagine the guy you're with, because you work with him, understands some of the things that you go through better than the average guy who might be like, oh, you're a cocktail server, you're around rich dudes all the time. Oh, he's so secure, it's annoying. Yeah, okay, so that's, and you've dealt with the opposite, where he couldn't deal with it, right. Yeah, my last ex was like, he was so unhappy that I got wet. He's like, really, so yeah, it's complete, like night and day, completely. Yeah, when a man's not proud of you, and when they can't handle how much you're doing for yourself, it's the most unattractive thing. There's that quote, and it says you either, you either build with a busy man, or you babysit a broke one, and that's real ass shit. Dumbo, have you changed? Absolutely, so I was in, like since high school and stuff, I was in a seven-year relationship before I got into the adult industry, and I had a hot model guy, and I was into those type of guys. Had a little bit of interesting situations that, you know, he had some offers from rich men that I didn't think that I would ever. Oh, tell me, before this goes on, have any of you, the three of you, had to deal with this before? Dudes on the down low? No? With what? I don't know what that means. Like, secretly gay? I mean, maybe, honestly. They were openly gay. They were openly gay, that you dealt with. You never dealt with that before? No. Have you ever dealt with that? Not openly, but I had suspicions about a couple. You had suspicions, go ahead. It was traumatizing to find that, and so for me, and it was after the second one that I was like, yo, I can't, especially in LA, you know. But yeah, so I just, you know, things change, and I think now as I'm a mother, like, you know, finding a man who is stable with, you know, financials, mentality, because, you know, I mean, I'm pretty good at taking care of my daughter, but, you know, I need someone that knows how to handle that. And then also, I mean, hey, I need some taking care of after I take care of my daughter. So, yeah, definitely. I used to go on, I lived in West Hollywood for like two years, and I used to go out with girls, and I would tell them straight up, guys, I'm not even kidding, I'd be like, hey, just to let you know, I've never been with a dude, I'm not gay. And the girls would be like, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. And I'm like, no, seriously, I've never been with a dude. And they're like, what? I was like, I've never, because every dude in West Hollywood, it was crazy. Dude, I will tell you what, I've never been served so quick at Chipotle in my entire life, is when I lived in West Hollywood. I know. I'd go to a bar and get a bunch of free drinks. But no, it was one of these situations, I was like straight up telling people, hey, just to let you know, I've never been with a dude. So many girls there had been traumatized by this thing that had happened, because so many dudes there were gay for pay, or gay to try to get acting roles, or whatever. And I was just like, I did not know how pervasive it was until I lived there. And then the king of it, it's actually the most, it's not the most DL city I've ever seen is Atlanta. Atlanta, there were so many women that I would meet that were dating African American men who were down-low homosexual. Undercover brothers. Yeah, undercover, there was so much of that going on in Atlanta, it was crazy. They made a movie, Moonlight. That movie, Moonlight, was about that shit. Essentially what happened, so you just don't know. Listen, I'm not trying to denigrate anybody for their sexual preferences, but you should tell the truth. You know what I'm saying? That's why, do you remember, that's why August Ames killed herself. Do you remember the situation with August Ames? Well, August Ames, in her defense. No, I am in her defense. Yeah, because I will say that, so the reason that she killed herself, well, the reason that she got harassed. She was bullied on Twitter. So she turned down this guy, because when you get booked for a shoot, or a scene with this guy, you have like a week to find this guy. So what you wanna do is you wanna do your research. Who did he shoot with, and whichever. The problem is, is that some, the gay porn industry is separate from the hetero industry. So she caught on to this performer, and nothing. She just said, I personally do not want to do this scene because I found that this guy did gay for pay. It's her body, it's her choice. And then everybody slammed her, and even some legitimate porn stars, female porn stars were attacking her, saying she was homophobic. Jessica Drake called her homophobic. Jessica Drake produces, Jessica Drake gets to choose every single performer she works with. August Ames was 19 at the time, 20. She didn't get to check shit. And because she said, I don't wanna have sex with a guy who's doing gay porn, then they told her to fucking kill herself. And she did. And she was married. She killed herself. Yes. It was the same night in December of that huge forest fire. She goes into the forest and fucking hangs herself. And it was crazy to me afterwards. And I was like, dude, she has every right to know. Because that's the thing, at some point I understand that people are gonna call me bigoted, because I wanna know if a woman that I meet was always a woman. Guys, those surgeries are getting better and better every year, I don't know if you noticed. I feel like I deserve to know if you have a Y chromosome. That's my right to know. I'm not homophobic. I just feel like I have the right to know. If you wanna take that right away from me, I don't think that makes me fucking bigoted to wanna know that. When she says that shit, I remember being so angry. I was like, I cannot believe they would bully her like that to where she fucking killed herself. That part was crazy. And this is, again, why OnlyFans is powerful for females to be in control, because you couldn't even voice this type of stuff, and it was really fucked up for her, too. Do you have a tough time finding guys who want to be in a long-term relationship with you? You were just saying, I was gonna get to this question, yeah. I wanna know, first of all, the general question is this. Do you plan to be married? Do you want to be married? Do you want to have a long-term, have a family life or something? Well, you've already got a kid, so you're just saying, I'm looking for a guy who's in it for the long haul. I'm looking for long-term security. I'm looking for a guy who's good with my daughter, but also knows how to lay down the D, I guess. But you're looking for somebody who has, that's why I asked this question, is has your criteria changed now, as opposed to when you were 23, and at this stage, are you looking for something that's more long-term? I may be crazy, but I don't ever wanna get married. But you're still looking for a guy who you wanna be in a long-term relationship with, who's got that? Sure, the reason why I don't wanna be married is one, a lot of my regulars and customers are married men, so I see that side of things. But then also, it's the financial, so if I don't like a guy now, I can leave him, and no harm, no foul, right? But if I have to financially pay for a divorce, like, fuck that. And also, the financials, blending the financials and stuff. So money-wise? Yeah. Do you wanna get married? Yeah, I wanna be wifed up. Let me ask you a question. Do you feel that, rightfully or wrongfully, that the way you are judged on social media is going to affect your ability to get married in the future? Ooh, that's a very good question. Not for the right person, because- Okay, you think the right person would just look past that? Yes, because I think that what I put off on social media is very surface level, so someone who's trying to get to know me will have a completely different version of myself. If you got married and your husband was loaded, wanted to take care of you completely, and asked you to stop posting pictures in bikinis on Instagram, would you stop doing it? In a fucking heartbeat. Beautiful, okay, awesome. Maddie, what do you think? That's a different answer. I would. You told me what to do. So if you met a guy, he was loaded, he wanted you to not be on IG, you wouldn't stop being on IG? If you met your ideal guy. Oh, okay, I could stop being on social media, I just don't want to be told what I am and am not allowed to post. No, but he's like, you're mine now, I want us to be in this relationship, you don't need to show all this off for other dudes. Yeah. You would stop? Yeah. Okay. So it's funny, they do this in Miami, and they ask all the girls, would you want a long-term relationship, or do you want your Instagram? And every girl said, I want my Instagram. Every girl said, I would not give up my Instagram for a long-term relationship. Would you? Not, yeah, I would give it up. I have a hard time with social media already, anyway, as you know, I just finally started taking pictures, posting, but yeah, no, absolutely, 100%. Yeah, and are you looking for long-term, do you want to get married? Yeah, I do. You'd get wiped out. Yes, I do. No, I would not give it up. Well, it's your vocation, too. It's a business, it helps with my business. Can we talk about this? So here's some stats that are on the face level that would seem like a double standard, but they're still true. And so this is something that a lot of women find to be uncomfortable, and this is the statistic. So as you go through life and have more sexual partners, there's studies that show, this is Family Growth, the Office of Family Growth, did this study? It's the IFS. Okay, IFS. International Family Studies. Okay, so the International Family Studies did this, and basically what they did is they took the number of sexual partners you had and then how that would correlate in a marriage, whether or not you're happy or not happy in the marriage, the actual question was very happy or not very happy in the marriage, and the second thing was, did you get a divorce, right? Those were the two kind of things that they went through there. And what they found with men is that when men had very few sexual partners, they were happy and fewer, and then once they got to like six to 10 sexual partners, they actually got happier. You notice this? It's like, because normally adjusted men in North America will have like six to 10 sexual partners. That means they've had some sexual partners, then they met their wife, and then they're with their wife. Having more sexual partners, what I'm trying to say is, did not affect how happy a man was in his marriage, okay? And I know some guys here, some girls here that live in Vegas, they get married to a dude, and the girl's been with three guys, and the guy has been with 500 girls, and he's just normal, because it doesn't really affect men in their relationships if they've been with a lot of, you agree with this? You've seen this before, okay. For women, not the fucking same thing. For women, as you got, like it would go, like the happiest women are women who literally, the first guy they had sex with, they married, those are the ones who showed the highest level of happiness. Once it got to six to 10 partners, it plummeted below 50%. It got really, really low, and women were saying that they didn't enjoy it, and in fact, it got to the point where we had 20 sexual partners, you had a 17% chance of staying in a marriage. For men, this was not the case. Men having more sexual partners had very little correlation on whether or not they stayed in a marriage. Women having more sexual partners had a very deep, not deep, it was statistically significant correlation on whether or not they got out of the marriage. And remember, it's correlation, not causation. Yeah, it's correlation, not causation. Also remember that happiness is a qualitative figure, not a quantitative figure. However, there's also stats for when women have higher body counts, they have a higher instance of depression, a higher instance of marital unhappiness, or a marital, I forget, stability. Again, this is not a statement about what the world should be, but when men have a lot of sexual partners, they don't get depressed. When women have a lot of sexual partners, a lot of times they do, if you guys wanna check out the end of the movie after porn ends, at the end of the movie, they show all these porn stars, and at the end, have you seen the end of the movie? Yeah, yeah, I've seen them all. But the women are not well-adjusted. A lot of them are very unhappy, a lot of them go back into porn, a lot of them, like, they got religious, went back into porn, some of them were into drugs, every one of the dudes was happy as shit. They had started a law practice, they had. And that was like a different time period. Well, I mean, I don't know that studio porn is really even a thing anymore. I think every one of those people. It's still a thing. Yeah, but they all have OnlyFans. Yeah, but it's still a thing. Yeah, I'm saying, like, all of them are using it as lead gen for their OnlyFans now. Sure. Yeah, that's why I'm saying it's significantly different now. There's also the, I mean, there's the STD, you know, stats, which is easy to track. But then there's also, so there's depression, there's an incidence of divorce, higher incidence of divorce. And then there's a higher incidence of, like, marital unhappiness, stability is how they define it. Also, and just because I know people are gonna knock us on this, it is also, The test, the pool, the test sample is for women who are 30 years old or older. So it's not like we're not looking at it because the reason why they do that is because the average age of first marriage in the United States is 28 for women and 29 or 30 for men. And then it's couples who have been married for at least five years. Yeah. So that I want to have that out there because I got to be accurate here because there's a lot of sons of bitches out there quoting these stats and they never quote that stuff because then people go, Oh, those are, those really accurate. Yes, they are. That's how that those are the math. That's the methodology that they use. And we have to clarify that because people will take it and then they'll run with it. So the point is this book behind me, the evolutionary psychology book, this is a book about the way humans are not the way they ought to be like evolutionary psychology does not cover human rights. Evolutionary psychology covers what were the naturally selected proclivities that human have that aided in survival for women to be selective about who they have sexual intercourse with aided in survival and for men to not be picky aided in their survival. Men can separate emotion from the sex. For sure. Completely. So let me ask this question here. Let's let's throw this one because we've put this one out before. If you meet a guy, maybe you're with a guy right now, does his sexual history make a difference to you and does your sexual history make a difference to him? Is there, is it an issue? If you met a guy that had a hundred partners, would that, would that bother you? It's Vegas. I'm sorry. It's Vegas. Let's round, make a nice round number. I mean, honestly, as long as he's clean, doesn't have any STDs, like I don't give a shit. Like your past before me is your past before me, like especially sexually, that means better experience for me. You know what you're doing? I was going to say, does that improve his chances? Yeah. So no, I don't give a shit. As long as you're clean. It's fine. Sure. Let's make that a tick tock. And don't make that a tick tock. Sure. I know your business. So maybe this is kind of a midpoint. Testing is important. I don't really care about the past of other women either. That doesn't bother me and I don't feel like threatened by that. But, you know, just being aware of your test results is, is your status is important. So the number is not important so much as the health factor. Yeah. Okay. No, the number does not matter at all. I could care less, but I do have four brothers at home. And if there was a girl who had about a hundred partners, I know that that would be a problem for them. What about what? It's different. What do you think of women? I think it's different for men and women. So what's, what's it? So you, you, would you not care if I don't care? I wouldn't care. That's their past. That all happened before me. Once you have met me and we have started a relationship, it's a whole thing. Once we get to the natty voodoo clam, then there's no other voodoo clams. There's no other clams. It's just her. It's got it. I understand now. The magic. Okay. I'm going to ask you a question. Absolutely. Yeah. Because I know, I feel like, so this may be a bad example, but I feel like if a woman like found out her man was cheating, I feel like they're more likely to forgive them and take them back. Where if a guy I know personally men who have found their girl cheating, it's like the end of the world. And they're like, she's a fucking horrible person. Yeah. Yeah. So the, the way Dr. Bust describes this, men generally ask when they get cheated on, did you fuck him? Women ask, do you love her? And then the other thing about it is when gay men get cheated on, they ask, did you fuck him? Lesbian women get cheated on. They ask, do you love her? It has to do with, it actually has to do with X, Y chromosome and hormones. It does not have to do with your sexual preferences. Interesting. Oh, what do you think? Do you think that it matters to men? Yes. And no, I mean, it, it depends what type of men, some like, especially like girls that are in the industry. So I'm going to get really excited about that. That's kind of a fetish for them. But then there is that other, you know, uh, citizens, demographic of guys or civilians. I'm sorry. Yeah. You already said your brothers would, would have a problem with a girl at a hundred. Yeah. And you, you, do you feel the same way? The men care more? Yeah. Yeah. For sure. It's interesting. So we've, we've asked this question before and then sometimes instead of this, we'll have a girl be like, men shouldn't care. It'd be like, okay, so you have a son and your son is coming home. She has a, he has a new girlfriend or a brother or a brother. Uh, the, the, the girlfriend has three different baby's daddies and has been with a hundred women are, what are you going to tell your son? And you should see the dissonance in the woman's face. She's like, Oh, okay. Yeah. I would, I would tell, I would tell him not to be with her. He can do better. Cause all of a sudden once it's yours, you don't want to be number four, but, but, but all of a sudden when it's your genetics on the line, cause this is your chop, this is this person's related to you and all of a sudden you give a shit and that's essentially what happens. Whenever you ask, it's funny when you ask men questions through the lens of their daughters, they become blue pills. When you ask women that questions to the, through the lens of their sons, they become red pills. It's just really interesting how that whole thing works. But yeah, there is, there is a double standard. If it sounds like there's a double standard, there is a double standard. A man could go to Brazil, fuck 17 girls and then the next day be cool. And then after that, fuck 17 girls and then go back to his fucking wife and not act any differently. And it blows women's mind. When you say that, I'm not excusing that. I'm not saying guys go to fucking Florianopolis and have sex with 17 girls. What I'm saying is that men that our psychology is different, like different animals can eat different things. It's, it's just part of their psychology. As men, we have the capability of doing this and separating the love from the intimacy. And so, um, there's another thing. Do you believe that this is cultural or evolutionary? What do you think the fact that men can get away with this and like not be affected by it? Do you think it's cultural? Do you think it's evolute? Do you think it's cultural? What do you mean? That's the culture that we live in. You think that that culture teaches men to be okay with having multiple sexual partners and not be affected by it? Yeah, guys are high fived every time. But it's not genetics. You don't understand it would happen. You don't think it's genetics. You think it's cultural. What do you think? I think it's evolution. 100%. What do you think? Evolution. What do you think? Um, I think a little bit of both, but mainly evolution. Yeah. Okay. So here's the reason why it's 100% evolution. There's a study done in 1989 by Dr. David Buss where he does, he goes to 37 different cultures. And all of these cultures have no con, no contact whatsoever with the Western world. We're talking about tribes in the Andes. We're talking about tribes in the, in Polynesia that have no contact with anyone else. In every single one of these 37 tribes, when men were more interested in casual sex than women were in every single one of these tribes, men found the same signs of youth and symmetry in women to be the same across all of them. And they had no contact with each other whatsoever. They found a 0.72 hip to waist ratio to be the most attractive. And the women found men to have a 1.65 to one shoulder to waist ratio to be the most attractive. There were women preferred men that were tall, not that specific type of height, but taller than them. And like I said before, in every one of these societies, men were more aggressive than women. It is not cultural, 0% cultural. It is 100% because you belong to a species of hominids that's been around for 300,000 years. And that this is a survival characteristic of men. Women or men throughout evolutionary history have needed to have sex with as many partners as they could to spread their seed, and women needed to be picky in order to protect their offspring. That is just the way it's been, and it aided in survival, and that's the reason why it exists. It has zero to do with culture. When we asked this question before, I think it was like on the first or the second episode here, we asked exactly the same question. Would you be okay with a guy that had a lot of partners? And every girl that was on this show said they would be okay with it, so long as they didn't have to meet any of the ex-partners in a club or something like that. Except for Natty. There was a social thing. Natty wants their autograph. So would you guys line up with that? Would that be an issue for you? Would you be okay with the guy having a sexual past, but also just so long as you don't actually have to meet them socially or just run into them at the grocery store or some shit? I don't care. Especially, Vegas is so small. They're going to run into my exes, I run into his. Honestly, as long as they're cordial with me and you're respectful, I don't care. Don't sit there and try to flirt with him or something. Oh, you're fucking him now. Yeah, that's right. But no, I mean, I don't care. As long as the chick is cool. I also get along with... I've dated guys in the past where I'm actually friends with their exes, so I don't care. I dabbled in a polyamory relationship and I personally want to do it again, but I have made some very solid relationships with my exes. Why did polyamory not work for you? The reason for me, I think having a threesome or something like that is nice where the woman can go away. If your business is porn, does that automatically make... That's a crazy suggestion, girl. That's a crazy suggestion, girl. I can't believe you said that on the air. That's a crazy suggestion. I can't believe you said that, girl. I can't believe you said that. So look, the reason why it didn't work out, and I think it was a lot... This was a younger girl. She was not in the industry and she was not mature enough to handle the situation. So she was battling her own demons where she was taking him away from me and then being competitive and then living with this bitch and then our periods and stuff. It's like... You guys started to sync up? Huh? You guys started to sync up? Yeah. And actually, no, we didn't sync up. It was always off. And it ended up being that this fucking bitch... Every two weeks, one of them's a bitch. Well, no, she was a bitch the whole time. It was just, she was so young. And then... So behind the closed door, she wanted to basically be competitive with me. But then with friends and stuff, she was trying to be my girlfriend. I'm like, bitch, you ain't my girlfriend. You're his girlfriend. And I just think living with that person, for me, I'm not saying... I've met some successful polyamory people. They could do it. For me, it's just not for me. Would any of you... Well, hold on. I want to hear the rest of them. That's where I was going to go with this. It's like, would any of you guys be okay in a poly relationship or would it be okay if you were with a guy and you were his main girl, but he gets side pieces? Would you be okay with that? If he's high enough value. I mean, he's your ideal guy and he's like, don't worry, I'm in love with you. I'm going to wife you up at some point, but maybe I still got to hit it on the side. I'm still pretty old school. I feel like I'm still pretty monogamous, which is crazy, but I flirt with girls all the fucking time. You know my ex was trying to get with you. I know exactly who you're talking about. She sleeps at my house every time she fucking comes over. She has a crush on me. I crush on her too, though. She's hot. Anyway, keep going. But you still don't want a polyamorous relationship? No, I wouldn't want to do it. I feel like I'm very old school in that aspect and I just want to know what I have is mine. I don't want the stress of all of it. I have so many model girlfriends that are poly and it just seems to always go very sideways. Of course, now bringing multiple partners into the mix and not being poly, but having a couple and then you bring girls into it and you're hooking up. Yeah, of course that works out. But having a third person in a relationship with you, I've seen nothing but a fucking mess. What you're describing is a thruple and the other thing you're talking about... We don't make these words up, by the way. So thruple tends to be a problem. Polygyny is what you're referring to before, where like most of the girls I date, it was like her and I, we would pick up women together. So that's polygyny, right? So that's fine. Polyandry is where there's multiple men involved. Polyandry is when there's multiple men and only one woman. So a polygyny is something different like what you're describing. I find that to be like, that tends to be a little bit more stable. Complete polyandry, polyamory, unless the dude's bisexual, I think that doesn't really work very well. I don't think it works either. Yeah, we didn't have another dude, but no, I wish there was. This is all really new to me. I never heard about these types of relationships. I feel like I might be okay with it just because I feel like all the relationships I've been in, the men have been really possessive of me and they just want to be with me all the time. And I don't like that. So if there was somebody else to take them away, I'm like, yeah, take them, please. Yeah. Sometimes you need to call in like a pinch hitter. Sorry. Yeah. Anyway. Cool. Rhodes, do you have another question? No, no. Let's go to the super chat. Super chats are just like all over the place. So like Travis, if you want to read the super chats, you can. This chat is like fucking on fire. Just to let you know, guys, I mean, just to be honest with you, like a lot of the people who watch this, a lot of them are guys and they're under the belief, like everything we describe. Brace for impact. A lot of the things they describe, I describe them as functions of evolution. These men see them as like you're evil because the fact that you guys are, what do you mean you have this double standard? What do you mean you're delusional and think you can all get six foot men who do this? What do you mean that you want this and that or like that? That makes them very angry. So they write, they send in these ugly chats. Just want to let you know. Don't take any of it personally. While he's queuing those up, the other thing that I think that's kind of unique, especially to this show, and maybe it's just because we're in Vegas, is I titled this show, you know, are the women in Vegas and Miami, are all women like you guys? And clearly it's not the case. I mean, we were just making the easy example of how most women meet other guys through like Tinder and hand your mobile. The average woman meets the average man in a much different fashion than any of you that are sitting at this table right now. So I think we can sort of separate that from who can answer that question right now. Clearly that, you know, the women that are in Miami, the women that are in Vegas, at least the ones that are doing what you guys do at your level are not the, let's say a sample of the average woman right now at a different level than most of them are. So let me just clarify that for the chat here right now. So, hey, how come you guys don't get average women on there? Why don't we have some, you know, 40 year old soccer mom with three kids? So here's the problem with these dudes, right? And I'll straight up say this. If you want to denigrate a woman's looks on the podcast, that's fine, but you have to write me on IG and let me see the girl you're dating. Oh, well, crickets, crickets, crickets. It's fine. You guys do whatever the fuck you want. You can say whatever you want. Trust me, the girls aren't reading your comments. So you look like a bitch. The problem is if you want to say that, that's fine. Just write me on Instagram and then let me see the. girl you're dating. For some reason I've been doing this for weeks and not a single time has a single dude written me and show me the girl that he's dating. I don't give a fuck guys about calling, you say we don't call women out, I call that Brittany Renner out, I call that fucking Amber Heard, I call that fucking, I mean seriously, you know, Giselle Munchin, I was on here, I got clips that did a million views for what I said about Giselle Munchin. It's not an issue about that. The problem is, you suck with women and you're sitting there making fun of women. Don't suck with women first. How about you do it that way first? And that's the whole issue. Well I think we can learn a lot from panels like this, honestly, because it's not just about the guys in the chat who are going, oh I respect myself too much to actually ask these girls out, blah blah blah, like limiting themselves. Like I was saying before, they would never even, like the thought of even approaching anyone at this table would never be a concept in their brain to start with. But then, so there's those guys. I'm already prepared for that. It's when I get critiqued by people who are like, say, other podcasters who will probably take this very video and start clipping it up and going, are these really the women of the future? She's going to be a mother when you're 30 now. What's she going to be like when she's 40 and she's got kids and everything and they're worried about your life course or your life plan or something. But I think what happens is when we have these conversations and we don't have just the average 40-year-old soccer mom or somebody like a day worker at CVS or something comes in here and tells us what her dating life is like, the chat is still going to tear them apart no matter what. But then having elite-level women, let's just, for lack of a better term, elite-level women here to explain what your experience is like, it's not going to be what the average woman's experience is going to be like, but we'll still be, I still think we can take a lot of value from what you guys have to say, not because it's just like everyone else, but because it's not like all the other girls that are out there. So I just want to preempt that because I know for a fact that there's going to be other podcasts that are going to take this and they go, well, not all women are like that. Yeah, but these women are like this. And when we were having the discussion about waiting in line and you were saying, why am I waiting for five hours for these bitches that know that they're not going to get in there? It's a similar situation, right? So why are we having conversations about the average woman when I'm the one that's going to be here and I'm the one that's going to get the job in the first place? So how are we doing Travis? We have the super chats. Are you ready? Yeah. Rock and roll. Ladies and gentlemen, super chats are super cool. The ladies will actually listen to what you're saying. If you chat them also like the damn video, there's so many people watching right now. Like the video right now. I'm okay. You get it. So I'm going to read the super chats, ones that are just donations, whatever in the super chats constantly. Thank you so much. Whatever. He's verified guys. You should actually go. Oh, it's the motherfuckers name. Whatever. Okay. Shout out to Ryan. All right. Whatever. Whatever podcast is Brian Atlas. There you go, Brian. There's your plug. Fantastic content. Uh, Jake, uh, cow Cohen, uh, for $20 note, no chat that we have a Jason DG saying, love the show. Read the, uh, rational mail and players handbook. Hey Mike, what book is on the bottom shelf behind you? You should put the girls links in the description. I definitely put the girls links in the description or as soon as I'm done here. Uh, that's the, the operator by Robert O'Neill is one of my favorite books. He is a Navy seal and he purports there's other people who agree with him and some that don't, that he was the man who killed Osama bin Laden. But the reason why I love when I love the book is because it describes leadership in a way that I try to pass on to a lot of my clients. And there is a scene in there where he talks about a seal training and buds. That is the funniest thing I've ever read in any book in my entire life. Also the, the, the events in this book are what are portrayed in the movie zero dark 30 at the last 30 minutes of that movie, which is my favorite. Those 30 minutes are the greatest 30 minutes of cinema ever, ever filmed. So that's why I love that book so much. And like the damn video. Don't be a ninja watcher. We don't like ninja watchers like the damn video. We got whatever coming in for $2 soup chat saying linebacker Xd was laughing at the linebacker comment you made a bit earlier. I thought it was pretty funny. We got reckless gaming for $2 Canadian. If you're not select, should you be going for an eight or 10s? Hmm. What about leagues? If you're not an eight or no, no, no, no. You could say, so here's the thing with the LMS guys, the fucking black pill doomers. The thing is with looks, can you fix when you, when you fix, can you fix looks to a certain extent? You can fix your teeth and groom your hair. Most of you guys who complain about men who have a really good looking, there's so many things you could do to fix your own appearance. Wear clothes that fit one more time. Listen to me now. Those those fucking jeans your mom bought you from Walmart back when you're junior high, wear clothes that fit you properly. Work on your physique. There's so many ways you can look smacks before we get to the point. Well, yeah, if you're a shorter dude, it's good. Is it going to be a disadvantage for sure, but there's so many things you can do. Money. That's something you can fix. That's something I recommend you try to fix. Let's get to a certain level. You know, at least, you know, you should, I know some guys say $78,000 a year is at the end. Once you get to that point, you don't really get much happier after that. Your looks get to the gym, get your fat ass. Yeah, for sure. That's the first thing because that's the thing you have the most direct control over. Right. But as far as status guys, fuck dude, just learn how to do preselection. That's what I've been teaching for 15 fucking years. It's so easy. Status is so controllable for men and you can do it for free. It's so mind boggling to me. So no, there's no, there's no excuse. You can go for any money muscles or game like social skills. In what order? Start over here. Um, when you say game, what do you mean by like social skills? Like he's, he's good. He's like a conversationalist. He's a good, he's good with talking. He can run good game on you. I would say that's number one money. Second muscles. Third. Yeah. Social skills, money and what was it? Money muscles or game muscles. Yeah. Muscles at the end. Exact same. Exactly. There you go. Okay. Uh, next Travis, you guys are not keeping to account. Green glasses also help. Um, interesting. We've got Terrell Xavier, uh, for a $5 super chat. We got birth control, a birth control pill lowers female testosterone by 60% lowering sex drive, making exercise less effective and increasing weight. It is female castration. Oh wow. Okay. I didn't know that. I got to look that up now. All right, moving on. We have the Hudson for a $5 super set super chat. Someone explained the Prego content. Was that, uh, was that solo or with other guys? You know, he wants to link. Okay. So that it comes in many forms. You can do it with men. I did mine completely solo and I did it within my boundary. So there was definitely some requests I did not do, but all by myself solo. Got it. Solo. Fantastic. We got whatever with another $2 super chat saying, if all the girl tell me to F off, I'll happily oblige her. All right, Brian, we know what you do. Brian Gonzalez for $1, a one 99 super chat. Delusional is an underestimate understatement with these gremlin. Wow. Uh, Brian Gonzalez, one more time with one 99 says you're a few years away from a high risk pregnancy.

I just brought like, okay. The look on your face when I told you how many men were over the age of a fuck or I'm sorry, over six feet tall and you were like, what? Like, you remember that? You know, there's other shows where guys are like, Oh, you're fucking delusional. I'm not going to call you fucking delusional. Most people just don't know this. Like I think, I think the proclivities that women have have to do with natural selection. The proclivities I have have to do with natural selection. I know that if I'm in married monogamous relationship, I will look at other women and be like, God damn, she's hot and I want to have sex with her. I know that hunger still lives in me because I have 17 times as much testosterone as you do. That is evolution. I'm not blaming anyone for anything that they're doing. And some of these other things are some of these other shows. I'm not saying because obviously I love Myron and fresh. Their show is a little bit more red meat. You understand? They, they get out of the girls will go back and forth and they almost get into fucking fights and the girls get kicked off the show and we're just not doing that here. Cause like, you know, we're having a conversation. We're having a conversation. Exactly. Shout out to fresh and fit. We are not done. Brian Gonzalez is back with the one 99 super chat. They are six is at best 28 to 32 aging. Like no, still waiting on those pictures. Exactly. It's the way no pictures of who you're dating, buddy. Send it to the DMS. We'll find it. Like if she's a six, show me what the fuck it is. Show me the eight you're with. That's what I feel like this guy's trying to flirt with us. Kinda low key.

I've been watching a lot of your videos, Rolo, and it seems like the doomers are all out tonight. It's only for this show on my show. It's like, it's so much more highbrow. Uh, okay. We got wealth mindset with just a nice gift of one 99. Not saying anything. Thank you so much. Brian gets all us our favorite man. Come back with one 99. Personally supporting the show. Just paid the rent, Brian. Thank you. Do y'all, uh, do y'all do take your kids to work day? Exactly. All right, cool. I'm sure we know what that means. Uh, no, we don't. That's weird. Uh, one 99 super chat. A Brian is also against supporting the troops. Uh, a bro. You got to roast them like FNF. Fresh and good. Thank you. Keep on make a comment. Okay. Because, um, you know, obviously in porn, it's very easy for men to troll us about us being mothers. Um, there's a lot of badass bitches who were in porn and we're moms now. And, uh, we can provide nannies daycares so that we do our work separately. And no children is harm. And our children are very well taken care of. So fuck you. There you go, Brian. That's what you need to say. There we go. And show me pictures of your girlfriend. But most importantly, thank you for your donation guys. Remember to like the video. I'm being serious. Go. I will do something horrible. Don't do it. Um, what is it? What are we at view saying keeping up for one 99 keeping Ned off only fans. I'm not sure who Ned is. My Greyhound. That's my dog. Okay. Fantastic. Thank you, Tori. We got did, uh, did you know mad for $2 and Canadian Owen cook FNF laughing and Rolo's a hypergamy poem. Oh, that was a long time ago. Yeah. He was, uh, no, he, uh, Owen cook from RSD came on fresh and fit and he had, did he have some poem or something about like hypergamy? He doesn't care. I think is what he was reading. That's what he's referring to. Uh, he was reading your, from your shit. Yeah. I, there's one, the one time I've ever met Owen was like, I think it was like early. He read your shit on there. Oh yeah. Wow. Okay. Yeah. That was, it was an interesting experience. Let's say I wasn't expecting to be on the show. Yeah. Yeah. That it. All right. That's it. Good. We are good. We lived. All right. One more for Brian. Just kidding. Come on man. Pay it off. Yeah. It's interesting. The reason why they can't work on Instagram is because they don't have Instagrams. I wanted to ask why you think he has a girlfriend. What do you mean? Uh, Brian, he doesn't. I know. Yeah, that's the point. Yeah. The thing is like they get, they get triple angry. And by the way, I don't care. You guys are all failures and none of you could afford my program anyway, so I don't give a shit about pissing them off. But the thing is like they get more angry when I say, then show me who it is that you're dating because I'm literally calling out the ultimate, ultimate insecurity that they have. They're bad with women. So that that's why they're saying this stuff about you. And that's essentially what's going on. I don't care. Like, dude, do women, do I have some female friends that do wild shit out in these streets, fucking crazy laughing about their fucking sugar daddies? Yes. All the time. Do I want to marry them? Fuck no. I don't want to marry them. It doesn't mean I want to marry them, but at the same time, I'm not going to denigrate them for no fucking reason. Do you understand? Because we all make different decisions. The thing is, I understand men are the way they are and women are the way they are because of 178 million years of mammalian evolution, 3 million years of hominid evolution and 300,000 years of homo sapien evolution. That's the reason why we are the way we are. It's nobody's to blame, but that's the way the world works. And the next question, because I saw some people saying this, uh, I said some people saying this, where do we go from here? Wherever the fuck we go. Like we won. There's 8 billion humans on the planet. There's 400,000 fucking elephants. We're done. We won. There's no, there's no more. The dumbest people on the planet live on the planet right now. And the smartest people who've ever lived are on the planet right now. The tallest people, the shortest people. There's no evolutionary pressure to survive anymore. You can have type two diabetes and sort of live forever. You can have all kinds, you have fucking kidney failure and get a replacement kidney, all these things, antibiotics, like people, there's no evolutionary pressure to survive. We are the, we are the apex predator on this planet. And so when people are like, what, what happens? Like whatever happens, it happens. It's not that big of a deal. We have four more super chats. I pissed them off so much. I know you're provoking now. So a house of pain, this is really good. Uh, ladies, do men with children from previous relationship matter much in deciding to date them? Oh, um, no, single fathers. I don't think that matters at all. I, um, I still believe in God, even though a lot of people don't now in this day and age, but I think that, um, I so need my stream deck. I believe that, uh, God or the universe kind of set certain people out in this world. Um, certain women or certain men that can take care of another person's child and love it as their own. I personally feel like I've always been someone like that, that I could have someone that has a child and love it just as if it was my own blood child. Can all women do that? Absolutely not. Can all men do that? No, but I think there are certain people that would love more than ever to take care of someone else's kid, as long as it made the person that they're in the relationship with happy. Let me pick this one up to a JJ $9. Thanks brother. It says not. Sartain it's because the girls on that show want a high-value man without bringing any value. That's where the delusion comes from No, the delusions fine. I don't mind see but but that's not what I said Hold on. Somebody said I'm bringing a vibe Here's the point when somebody says something that is not true and you say that they're delusional that's fine I'm not complaining about that what I'm complaining about is a woman who wouldn't piss on you off You're on fire and you're calling her a wrinkled hoe. That's the problem. I have it Here's my chance you're terrible with women Like listen to me like look how mad they're getting in the chat to you It doesn't matter say whatever you want about me. You still suck with women if a an attractive woman came around They would run away from you. That's the point and here's the thing You could make me shut up just write me on IG But you none of you will write me on IG because what I'm saying is so fucking unassailably true You're fucking losers because you suck with it's and by the way, you're not a loser because you suck with women You're a loser because you suck with women and then you come on a show to denigrate women who you could never date So if she's a hoe and she wouldn't date you, here's my chance. What does that say about you? She's a hoe and she wouldn't date you bro. That means you suck even worse. That's my point I'm not here trying to be a fucking white knight. I'm point. I am a performance coach. I am a performer It's men of action not men of commenting not men It's not men of estrogen It's not men of fucking dithering and men of blathering. It's not men of theory. It's not men of fucking message boards It's men of action and you don't take action bitch. That's the reason why you're getting fucking called out in the chat I got mims here says greetings from Arizona Rolo Just wanted to personally thank you for your work throughout the years changed my life and made me a better man Thank you very much for that my friend Let's see Casey whose name I can't get a great dialogue Rolo. Thank you fire already read House of Pain Brian Gonzalez you're back. No, you're not Brian says I still love you girl. Oh, thank you very much that your love means everything to me Bind a blind controller chat ease up off of Myron's ball bag. This is a different show Everyone doesn't have the same approach shout out to a fresh and fit. But here's this is access Vegas. Thank you very much You are correct my friends. So, um, do you guys have any questions for us? And what are the statistics of women who get in domestic violence Relationships like the impact that it has in their Relation future relationships with other men. It's really interesting because for that it there's so many Unreliable statistics as far as that's concerned because one of the things about by the way Sexual assault and domestic abuse is that it's we don't know in some cases. It's over reported in some cases. It's underreported So it's really difficult to say almost like there's certain there's certain things We just don't ethically know about what where the reality is that with that whole situation? What I do know is that there's a middle ground I know some people are saying like with the whole believe women believe everyone right the whole believe women thing then Amber Heard comes out who has borderline personalities order and she just sets that movement back a hundred years, right? And then there's some people that are like no every time a woman claims that she was raped She's just using this as like a fucking leverage against men. Both of those things are wrong The answer is that it's somewhere in the middle, right? I don't believe all men I don't believe people that I don't believe my fucking family members half the time. I'm not gonna just believe all women I'm gonna leave it to the legal process and see what happens. That's generally that's generally how it works you have to develop some level of Fucking evidence, but I don't know that's it. That's a good question as far as that. How's that works? What I do know is this it's really interesting fact about the OJ Simpson trial Marcia Clark She went they did a moot trial in fucking, Arizona before the OJ Simpson trial and they they found out that 69% of african-american women thought that some domestic abuse in a relationship was tolerable. It was normal It was acceptable and then they put nine black women on the jury He got called 21 times for domestic abuse violations Marcia Clark tried to paint her try to paint OJ as a domestic abuser before he painted her before she tried to paint him As a murderer and that's why he was acquitted. That's part of the reason why he was acquitted It's just really interesting. Like one of the things is it's not fully reported all the time. So that's that's a good question I don't know. Yeah, I actually had to field that question on a certain daytime talk show Yeah that I went on back in November who I will yeah remain nameless until the show has actually dropped at some point But they the the guy who was on the panel sitting opposite me tried to get me with that He's like, well, don't you know like what's the number one? Way that what's number one crime or whatever against women? And of course, it's like, you know Men's violence is what he was insinuated and had I if I could get a do-over on that I would have said no actually the number one killer of women is actually heart disease Because it's a it's a weight related disease. That's what it is Really that's what kills the most amount of women. It's not guys being violent with them. Although that's what he wanted to To talk about but that's that's that yeah, it's true. That's that's what men are. We are violent We are aggressive that is simply part of male nature. And so it's so saying that You know, we need to teach men to not be violent is kind of like saying well we need to re-engineer the machine I was just a who was it a James Cameron the director from like Avatar or whatever He's in the news these days because the new Avatar movie is out right now And he was just quoted as saying that the number one like most dangerous, you know chemical on the planet is like Testosterone and we need to find some way to make sure that we can like, you know have a kinder gentler world by you know, eliminating testosterone because it's it's the it's the source of all all of the world's Problems kind of thing and by the way, that's not a new sentiment. I have heard that like over the years I've been doing like I've been doing this for about 20 years But like to hear that kind of like as being something that should be broadcast as it and people be like, oh, yeah Yeah, you're right. You know, we need to we need to really Throttle back the testosterone and and and you know toxic masculinity and all that good stuff. It's it again. It's Men are gonna be violent that's part. That's part of our nature. We're supposed to be with how we were That's how the machine works. Do we have self-control? Should we teach self-control? Absolutely, we should shoot you need to be able to keep that in check But it also doesn't preclude arguments or discussions about other things as well So when I hear like well, what about domestic violence? What about this way? Yeah, okay I agree with that, but that's not the conversation that we're having at this point. Like I'm not saying no That's fine. But like I'm just saying that it's usually used as some sort of counter to like anything That's sort of like an unflattering truth about men's nature or women's nature because it does impact women Choices for the future. Oh, yeah, absolutely Let's see. What else we got? I got a few more left Jeff White says I just broke up with my girlfriend today. It was really bad. I plan on continuing to self-improve gym finances, etc I'm sad, but it's her loss. Okay John dread who I know hi John dread a great show gentlemen. Enjoyed the panel discussion I'm curious where the where the ladies see themselves in 10 years I asked you guys if you wanted to get married also, like where does that fit on your like sort of priority scale? You'll be at your your your your fourth year at the new Edward Talbeach I mean definitely want to be married and then Financially like have complete financial freedom Happy like on it. That's such a hard question because I don't know like I think it one day at a time So I'm just assuming you make significantly more than your partner. Has that ever been an issue? Um, I mean actually no the past couple guys that I've been with because I have been with guys I have been with guys where I had to take care of them So after that after like the last relationship that I had with that I was like never again So this guy no, he actually like I make more than him But like he still makes a really good money and then the last guy he made more than me. So yeah got it In 10 years, I see myself being an entrepreneur running my business teaching girls actually coaching girls how to hustle on Only fans webcams safely where they don't have to be exploited by a man in order to do their job You know running events, you know, I do Toro I rent cars out like I'm a serial like entrepreneur I like the hustle. I like the process so Jordan Married and happy. I just really care about being happy Bill is I've wasted a lot of time over the past few years with being stressed out or being in Relationships that maybe weren't serving me properly. So all I care about is being happy. It's a huge thing Nugs, I have a few different like projects things. I want to work on in the next 10 years I don't really know what's going to do well, so I can't say where I will be. Mm-hmm Okay Okay, last one here don't give us any more I'm not gonna read any more after this Pat Simmons Polish passport, thanks brother What's the lady's opinion on Kim Kardashian's crying about her toddler? Finding out about her sex tape. Do the ladies have any anxiety about having to explain their lifestyle to their future children? I Guess I will say that because I and I'm in an industry You Know for Kim Kardashian, I don't necessarily feel Sorry for her in a sense because of the whole like the mom was a part of it and all that however I do feel for her about her son potentially finding her sex tape and stuff and I think For one when I joined the industry, you know My parents because I actually took I Helped my parents with the money that I got that when it comes down to it I will definitely have a conversation if that ever comes But my whole thing is I'm doing everything that I'm definitely going to make sure my daughter doesn't do So I mean, you know, I'm an adult. I'll handle that situation when it comes but Are you guys worried about your future children finding your old Instagram? I mean, I'm not like if anything I'm like, yeah, your mom was hot back in the day, right? Cuz that's what I think when I look at my mom and dad. I'm like dang you were good-looking what happened? I'm just kidding. But yeah, like no, I think that I mean to be fair. You don't really push it. Okay? Well, I'm getting better. Okay, baby steps. Yeah, I Think you will probably be proud of what you have produced. Oh, yeah for sure Absolutely No from what I've seen no, it's more it's like modeling though, so yeah Yeah, because of doing you know the pageants I can't cross a certain line So I can get right to the line, but I can't cross over it. So my content is very Right there without fully diving in but yeah with the pageants you can get exploited in a second Yeah, and if they find anything like that, you're kind of screwed Yeah, no, I think it's really about Having open communication with your kids. Mm-hmm. I feel like as soon as they reach a certain age It's okay to talk to them about it. Kids are really really smart they're like sponges and it would be way better for you to talk to them about it, then you Know their friends tell them about it. Yeah I Whenever I hear this question, I know I have like put this question out before as well It's like what will happen when like if you had a son if you found your only fans like how how does that work out and I have to have to kind of like dial that back a little bit sometimes because a Lot of guys want to say. Oh see you're gonna get yours sooner or later You're gonna get found out and your your kids are gonna be ashamed of you and mommy's a slut You know that like that's the what the hope is but then I think about I think how many Women are have a digital footprint on Instagram It doesn't even have to be doing only fans just has a digital footprint of all the the yacht parties You went to you don't even have to be having sex You're just on that, you know, you're shaking your ass on on on a yacht somewhere and being able to sort of go back and retrace your digital footprint of when you were like in your 20s and now in your 40s and mom boy you were so crazy back Then look at you on the yacht there. I Think it's kind of a moot point Right now to talk about that because it's going to be so common that the next generation of kids are gonna be like Yeah, well, my mom was you know on a fresh and fits. Yeah, I was dancing with fresh, you know I know you're twerking on a yacht somewhere There's that's going to happen and I think that that generation has going to interpret it differently than this generation Thinks that they will because it will be so common by that point. So yeah, though. So is that a good thing? Is that a bad thing? I don't know but it's going to be a thing So what you're referring to is like the Overton window what what we find acceptable in the future again in 1983 I remember when the I came up with these ideas for like gay marriage It was getting laughed off the fucking house in the Senate now If you went up and started to try to get rid of gay marriage unless you're Clarence Thomas You're gonna get laughed off the House of the Senate like it's it would never happen the Overton window on gay marriage Changed 180 degrees over the last 30 years the Overton window tends to shift to the left over over time People will find things that are a little bit outside the norm to be more and more acceptable if you have conservative values and you're Like I want my wife to act like this and want my family to be like this Then you do that in your own home You wait you raise your children as Christians or Muslim or agnostic or whatever you want to do you raise them with the morals that? You want but you do that in your house waiting for the world to swing back to the right. It's not gonna happen There's no pendulum. There's no page only go forward. It only goes in one direction. So that's a realization I'm not saying that that's the way things should be. I'm speaking as a conservative That's not the way things should be but I know better than to try to fight the river that is flowing in one direction I also know that my evolution created me a certain way and when I hear When I hear Jordan say this thing is I wanted a fucking alpha male I loved it when he was when he had these alpha Characteristics and I could tell that's what I wanted because with him I wanted to have sex with him all the time when I hear That I'm reminded. Yes, we are fucking biological creatures that were created through natural selection that reminds me of that You know, I remember I I see that whenever you say that so that's the thing is guys What happens is when they see this evolutionary mismatch? Which is what all this is. They're like, well, there's an evolutionary mismatch. Therefore. It's the women's fault Or women or women go on the view and they're like well When are men are gonna step up and start taking care of these single moms? No, it's neither person. It's neither sides fault This is how evolution created us and once you come to that realization, then you stop blaming people for how they are And then you start seeing, oh wait a second, this is how I can get rich. This is how I can get the girl of my dreams. Don't hate the player, hate the game. I can play the game and get everything I want if I just understand the rules of the game and not hate the players in it. Yeah, and I become a competitor within that framework. Okay, let me get these and then we'll finish and we'll get out of here. Chock T says, great show, gentlemen. Rollo, hope to bump into you at the local guitar center. Oh, here in Vegas? One day and to shake your hand. Thanks for the work. Okay, thank you, brother. Faniam says, what would affect the ladies more if men deny you sex or money or attention? Okay, I think we already talked about, we already got to that. D Howard, let's see. Hey brothers, y'all doing a great job. Love to see y'all on Fresh and Fit.
