What do you think about it? Well, um, there's a lot that I'm basing my opinion on so much more than that I Think we have to take a look at Jada in order to explain Wolf Smith's behavior and why he may have responded that way And I don't I really can't possibly Give your audience all of that information right now. However, I will say that From what I have seen and what an interviews that I have watched and I again, I'm not diagnosing anybody But Jada presents with very strong narcissistic traits. Okay. I see a lot of triangulation with her. I see a lot of cognitive empathy I've you know, I've heard a lot of stories where he does something very nice and she devalues that like her 40th birthday He did had like a whole three day or seven day extravaganza and she wouldn't even attend You know, you see the triangulation with Tupac in August, you know, like there's always somebody in the mix where she's you know Devaluing him and and this was his night. Yeah, which I find very interesting This is this is something that where he is being honored for and he is being praised for and that threatens a narcissist Control, right it threatens it. And so what does she have to do and she doesn't know what she is She has no idea right, but she subconsciously her narcissism is like, well, I need that Yeah, this can't be about him. This has to be about me. It's even more so because they're in the same profession I want you to think about it, right? Well, he's greater than her, right? And that's gonna threaten her narcissus. She was if you go back to like the late 90s Jada Pinkett's in the top five, bro It's like Vivica Fox Jada Pinkett Halle Berry Like she's up there right and she and so with a lot of those actresses They have an opportunity like Selma Hayek did where you have a chance to act if you if you can make this motherfucker work You are gonna end up like Scarlett Johansson happens to be a fantastic actress and she's also very very attractive, right? And so Jada it never hit for her She never got the she never got the thing that how where Halle Berry she knocked it out of the park Holly Berry is a world-renowned Academy award-winning actress Jada Pinkett was a pretty face and what happened with will is that will kept going up will it's not just that It's not just that will got that respect. It's that will got the respect that Jada always wanted I think the fact that they're in the not a similar profession the exact same profession I think has a part to do with this as well. Well, you're a hundred percent. Correct? Absolutely. I will say this It won't matter what profession they're in that that actually isn't relevant But because they're in the same profession it throws salt on the wound. Okay, so so if we go back to that night Again, he's being honored it threatens her sense of control So she again is she's gonna have to do something to regain that control and she is doing this on a subconscious level because she Does not know what she is. She doesn't know what's going on And so what happens, you know, he cracks a joke at her and then she gives the look of disapproval There's probably a long history of this a long pattern and Will Smith knows exactly what that means You know, and if he doesn't correct it if he doesn't stand up for her, he's gonna suffer Yeah, right and there's probably a huge history of that so he knew Subconsciously again, he's not doing this consciously He knew he's like well if I don't do something I'm gonna suffer The devaluation phase for him is gonna start so he has to he has to act so he's like he My wife's name mom and then she sits back and she's just you know, stoic and Victimized and you know, and she didn't even like praise her husband or anything, you know, and I mean she's just like, yeah Oh, I I was I willing to bet you she text some other guy right after that happened We're talking about how how annoying she is with really interesting after that. So like if I Explaining his behavior and why he did that I think it's a it's more of a trauma response than anything because I think he's a highly empathic individual Actually, I don't think that he's your average Joe I think he's highly empathic and even empathic people have moments where they're extremely reactive again There's probably some PTSD because when you have prolonged exposure to a narcissist you're going to have some PTSD Okay and people with PTSD can be really reactive and really responsive and he's got to do this to protect himself because my god if he Doesn't he's got to go home to that, you know, and you can even see afterwards like there's a moment on the red carpet Where she changed outfits, you know, and I'm like god damn and again it to me the way I interpret that is another way to draw attention to and Here he is there there with their whole family and they're trying to present as a united front and the family leaves You know the family leaves and they're you know, taking picture going down the roll and she stays Yeah again to regain control and she even goes Yeah, because she wasn't done yet, I mean it just shows You know, and then he sure enough he comes back like a good little boy, you know, it just you see these dynamics That's a narcissistic dynamic. I was watching this like red top red table talk shit that she does right fucking gag me and God that stuff want to throw up. It's so ridiculous Are you talking about what she had? Well, they just they just ax she acts so woke and I'm like, but you're not though anyway There was a moment where they were talking about her entanglement again. This is blame-shifting. This is escaping accountability Narcissistic traits guys. Okay, and she won't even call it what it is. She's not taking ownership Let's also say this will isn't calling him what it is. Well, he's not but he's doing that for a different reason He's doing that because if he calls it what it is, it's gonna threaten her sense of control and he's gonna get it again Yeah, okay. And also he doesn't sorry this fly He doesn't call it what it is because He's trying to regain a sense of power and control as well. Yeah, that's another dynamic that's happening here He's trying to act like my wife doesn't run the show here We we had like like I was for this as well or like he there was something Something there that he was Yeah, it is. It is a really weird dynamic with that without that whole situation So first off he's using comedy if he goes back and watch the red table thing He uh, he when he's being interviewed by his wife He is using comedy to deflect and he goes I was through with your ass and like no you You you weren't you weren't through with her. You're still with her today You had kids with her and you're like that that was the part like I want to like in this case with the Johnny Depp Situation. I don't know the whole the function of this I'm not gonna marry a woman who is going to express her undying love for Tupac I'm just not I'm like like I'm not you've made this a little too public I need you to be mine and I need this to be team a team. This is not a team This is me. This is and I'm again. I don't know Kanye West personally I think Kanye West when he wasn't famous the hottest woman in the world to him was Kim Kardashian And when he got famous he got a chance to date the the biggest crush of his life Not giving two-tenths of a shit about what the rest of it was like and then Kim Kardashian was like How can I remain relevant? Well, I can remain relevant by dating one of the biggest producers in the world I don't care that he has a mental disorder doesn't make any difference to me So I'm just gonna go ahead and date him and I think Kim is like well How can I continue to main remain relevant? Who is the person that would upset the world the most for me to date Pete Davidson? So let me just date him because it doesn't make any fucking sense And then we'll just see how how much news I can churn up so that me in my 40s I can maintain some level of relevancy. That's what I see. That's what I see in this \", \"segments\": [{\"id\": 0, \"seek\": 0, \"start\": 0.0, \"end\": 5.21999979019165, \"text\": \" Eat my wife's name out of your fucking mouth that all of a sudden that changes because he's not getting his wife's approval very Stockholm\", \"tokens\": [50364, 14429, 452, 3836, 311, 1315, 484, 295, 428, 5546, 4525, 300, 439, 295, 257, 3990, 300, 2962, 570, 415, 311, 406, 1242, 702, 3836, 311, 13317, 588, 38730, 50625], \"temperature\": 0.0, \"avg_logprob\": -0.33004340529441833, \"compression_ratio\": 1.610223650932312, \"no_speech_prob\": 0.028857460245490074}, {\"id\": 1, \"seek\": 0, \"start\": 5.21999979019165, \"end\": 8.359999656677246, \"text\": \" Syndrome looking exactly.
