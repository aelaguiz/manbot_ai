How you doing, gents? Hope you're doing well or okay or doing well at doing okay. Today, I wanted to do a follow-up to the video I put out a while ago called Real Men Don't Cry, the hustle versus healing video. But before that, I want to show you something. See this? This tree, I bought off the back of a truck literally from Spain. It's 400 to 500 years old and there's six of them in the property now. They literally came in a truck and Antonio dug a big hole and stuck them in. So now, I've started building my Babylonian garden. That's how I've been healing my traumas. How about you guys? So, I received probably the biggest personal response that I've ever received from that previous video. We've had other videos that got more clicks but in terms of people writing to me privately, the types of comments that we received, this clearly struck a huge nerve with men all around the world. This permission to feel, this permission to cry, to feel some kind of sorrow, to accept the parts of yourself that aren't perfectly optimized, that aren't hustle monsters, and to allow yourself some space to feel what you need to feel, whether that is sorrow or loneliness or frustration, and to start to develop processes to actually heal those issues. And it would come as no surprise to you or any other man pretty much on the planet that it is not generally encouraged that men are very open and vulnerable. It's not encouraged that they cry. In fact, the opposite is encouraged in most circumstances. There's only a few situations where societies in general sanction male emotions, like football matches. Like you're allowed to cry at a football match if your team wins or loses. I don't know. I don't watch sports, but you're allowed to have emotions about that. Men are allowed to have anger and violence in some sense or some degree depending on where they are. Other places, that's shamed as well. And then what else? Maybe when you go to your parents' funeral or you have a baby and you're allowed to be like, it's just like me or whatever people do. But in general, men don't have institutionalized ways to express and process emotion. And I'm here to talk about this today from a survival perspective, but from a perspective of thriving. Because the interesting thing about humans is that we are walking wounded. We not only can operate when we're crippled, we will operate when we're crippled. And I don't just mean physically crippled. I mean, if you are someone who's had extreme trauma or you perceived it as extreme trauma, you've been brought up in situations where you didn't receive certain aspects of love or encouragement that you needed, or you had someone do something terrible to you, or circumstances did something terrible to you, you will survive all the way up to the point that you don't survive. You will find a way to get up each day and breathe and eat and feed yourself and do what you have to to survive and you'll get through. And this is a magnificent quality of humans is that even if they've just witnessed something awful or gone through something terrible, they can find ways to compartmentalize experiences. Let's say they're in a wartime and they see something terrible. They won't necessarily just fall in a heap and experience the despair and sorrow and whatever of that experience. They might just compartmentalize it, put it somewhere. The subconscious blocks it away and says, we can't deal with that now. We don't have the resources to deal with that now. So we'll just forget it even, or we'll numb it, or we'll put it into your dreamscape, or hold it in the tissues. And that's in the musculature, in the tissues, the sinews. That's where we do hold a lot of our damage and our trauma and our pain and our sorrow. It's held inside the body and compartmentalized and then just left there until such a time as you can deal with it. Now, that doesn't mean that everybody deals with it. All of us have been traumatized by life. It's part of the process of when you're ripped out of the womb into the light. That's traumatic just to start with, unless you have a home water birth where it just glides out like a porpoise. And then you have a choir of hippies just om-ing, om, to the baby as it comes out and goes, I'm a perfect child. I don't know. And then hippie parents screw them up anyway, because they make the meat tofu and their birthday cakes are made out of fucking carob instead of chocolate. And that traumatizes a kid as well. So what I'm saying is that we will be damaged, we will accrue damage, and we will continually accrue damage. That's the nature of humans, is that every day you have cells in your body that are being destroyed or damaged and then being rebuilt and healed. So the idea of healing, it's not like, oh, it's only some people heal, or that's only for pussies, or that's only for guys who are really messed up, that they need to go and seek out some way of healing. You are damaging, being damaged, and you are healing all the time. That is part of the human condition. And maybe this makes more sense if you think about it in sporting terms. Like, for anyone who's done any basic level of training in the gym and has any understanding of the science, you'll know that when you go in and lift heavy weights, it rips your muscle fibers, it damages the body to a certain degree, which is manageable. Right now, if we just literally went into the gym after never going to the gym and just bench pressed all day for eight hours, as much as we could, probably you would rip something and it would be damage that is counterproductive. But if you go whatever, three, four times a week, or you have a physical practice and you stretch yourself past your original limit, you will accrue damage. Now, there's very few men that would say, yeah, go to the gym, do all that, and then don't be a pussy about it. Don't stretch. Don't go to the sauna. Don't worry about your nutrition. You don't need to heal. I'm tough. Most intelligent bodybuilders or people who go to the gym wouldn't think like that. They would think, I damage my body, and then I repair my body. And I do that in cycles. And overall, the testing myself or stretching my comfort zone physically means that I get stronger and bigger and more fit over time as my body changes and adapts to the new stresses and learns to deal with higher levels of damage, higher levels of trauma, and it becomes stronger and better at dealing with that. You add processes to that. You do a warm down stretch. You go to the sauna. You get a massage. You look after your nutrition. You have your glucosamine and your joint stuff and your essential fatty oils and your creatine or whatever it is that you're taking to assist you. And of course you do because that's smart. You have to process the fact that you're damaging yourself along the way. Why don't we think about our emotions like that? Why don't we think about our past like that, the things that happened particularly in our childhood? Those formative years, there's no escaping that, that they form you. We don't want to, most people that work with us don't want to be subject to extreme conditioning. They don't want to be tied to their conditioning, but we are all conditioned and we all accrue damage throughout our lives on the various levels of what it means to be human. And if we do not work out a way to heal and process, we'll just do the best that this machine can do. As I said, you will survive probably until the point that you don't, let's say if it gets too much and you top yourself or you're not looking after your health or something, but basically you will live and you'll probably still have a more or less functional life, even though you may be feeling shit, even though you may be feeling unworthy, unloved, in physical and emotional pain, stuck inside your own thought loops of negativity, believing belief structures that are negative by nature and directly affect your happiness because they mean you can't see the world as anything other than negative, right? You can still live like that, but it's not great living, I would say. Now I'm not saying that everyone needs to get therapy. What I'm saying, well I kind of am, I'm saying that everyone needs to do something that is therapeutic in their life. And I've certainly met quite a few people throughout my life who certainly don't need any kind of specific therapy, right? They don't need to go and see a counselor or a shaman or to do dense medicine work, for example, plant medicine work, but that's because their lives are therapeutic. And I've seen that quite often with a lot of women that I've met, not all by any means, I certainly meet plenty of women who are highly strung and emotionally numb and have sexual issues and so on, traumatic experiences, but I've met more women than men who live in a therapeutic way. And what that means is they do a whole number of practices and maybe they don't see them as practices, maybe they just see them as this is what I like doing, but they do a bunch of things that have the effect of just flushing things through, whether that's physical toxins or emotions or looping thought processes or stuckness in the body, they do something to let that out, to process it. And that's really what I'm talking about when I'm talking about healing, right? So if we look back to our sports analogy, what are we doing is we're getting the lactic acid out, we are breaking down the calcification that's happening between joints, we're repairing muscle fibers and so on. So somebody who lives a therapeutic type of life will do things like dance, right? So why do you think girls like dancing? Partially if it's in a club, it's to get the attention of men and part of the, you know, I'm beautiful and I'm part of a female hierarchy and all of that kind of attention stuff. But women do dance by themselves or with each other or in their bedrooms, or you'll see women be the first ones to get up and dance to a DJ or a band. Girls talk about that, I just need to dance. Do you need to dance? When was the last time you felt the need to just get up and do a tap dance and a Jimmy Joe jig and a shimmy? Never, right? Like men don't, very rarely do we feel the need to dance. But we do feel the need to express ourselves physically. So men will do it in a more masculine conditioned way through contact sports or the gym, getting in fights on the street, uh, whatever they need to do to express that physically. But the notion of dancing combines a number of therapeutic aspects, right? It has movement, but it has movement in non-linear ways. And I'm not talking about like formalized ballet, for example, right? Like that's a totally different thing. I'm talking about expressing your body to music. So that involves improvisation, moving it to flow, sinking, immersing yourself into the environment through the music and through the physical sensation expression. Uh, it evolves like physical release, right? So, you know, like if I open my chest up and do some, some dancing of some sort, that's a very different experience of my body than this, this, you know, or this, right? Like the, the linear kind of prescriptive movements that we do in our job or, or in our routine, if we live in flat surfaces all the time, uh, and we just walk around in shoes, we're not expressing in the way that a hippie chick who's doing dancing is. Now, I'm not saying you have to go and do hippie dancing, although it would not be a bad thing, right? Because I, I want to, in this video, give you a bunch of suggestions of ways that you can heal. Now, I'm, I'm want to be careful about saying exact types of modalities. I will give some examples, but I don't want you to think that there is any therapy or any school of thought or any technique that really is the answer. And that is the, the, a very common human mistake. And it's one that we want, we want there to be an answer that is prescriptive. Humans, you know, like how people say women, uh, women like to follow and men, men like to be leaders. I think that is tripe bullshit. 98% of the human population likes to be, likes to follow, likes to be told what to do, likes to be led. Like, you know, men are leaders. Where? You know, I don't see very many male leaders, uh, or very many more than there are female leaders, really. Sure. There's, you know, when it comes to the couple, the male female dynamic, dominant submission within the bedroom and, and that a woman likes a man who has a plan, right? Who can lead her, not, not lead her life necessarily, but, you know, take her through wonderful experiences. But in general, people have a need to be told by somebody, how does this work? What do I do? Why do I, you know, if I feel like this, what's the answer? And so, you know, throughout history, the answer therapeutically was usually through organized religions. Now, I'm not going to go off into a big, uh, historical tangent today. Am I? Am I? No, I'm not. But you can just think about it in broad terms that an institution, an institutionalized religion of whatever type does give you a process for healing in some sense, right? Because it, it, uh, ceremonializes, if that's a word, creates ceremonies around introspection, right? So prayer. Okay. So I disagree with the way that people pray, pray in religions because they, it ties into an ideology, but whatever. It does give you space to listen, to receive, to relax. If you've ever been, I mean, I still walk into churches when I go, you know, in countries and I go in and it's undeniable that there is a, that there is a peace within a nice old church. And I would say that's because every person that walked in there, except for the times when, you know, peasants, the Jews ran in there, and then the church was burnt down by the Nazis or something like that. But usually when, uh, everyone who's gone into a church has gone into an introspective space, into a submissive space and submissive in the sense that they are willing to receive as opposed to willing to just say what things are. And it's funny that some intelligent religions have release valves, say the Catholic tradition of, of, uh, confession, penance and redemption is an I think it's really smart because it gives you a really rigid ideology that's impossible to live up to. You have a moral code that's impossible to live up to. And then when you break it, which you inevitably will, and you feel shame, which they want you to feel shame, you can come and you can purge and heal in some sense. At least you can say to a priest, all right, here's all the awful shit that I did. And the priest will, in their own way, not judge. They will give you a way to vindicate yourself so that you can then finish that shame cycle and come out in some way healed and cleansed. I understand how those processes worked within modern religions. And then when we look back to more ancient religions, let's say pre-industrial religions or pre-Christianity religions, there were all sorts of processes that were part of the way a tribe would work. And as I talked about last time, I'm not glorifying and saying that everything that happened in tribes was beautiful and wonderful. There was also awful things. But some things that many tribes did well was they understood the human animal needed to purge. For example, I know in Peru, when I've been there and you go and visit little tribes, there are some tribes that get up in the morning and everyone goes and vomits. Everyone, they go, they stick their fingers down the throat and they vomit into the river. Because they're cleansing, they're purging, right? And there's no shame about vomiting. It's just a normal thing you go and throw up. Because they know that helps to purge, especially in the jungle where there's a lot of parasites. They do ritualized rituals, which include stomping, shaking, dancing, moving into trance states. And this is a big, big part of healing, is that we can't really just think through our problems and come to solutions for them. And you know that because you've tried to do it. Now, there are some, yeah, I can think through a mathematical problem or a technical problem or a logistical problem. Sure, I can think through those and come up with better and worse ideas and come up with a plan. But when I have a deep sense of, like, I don't feel good about myself in some way or I feel sad or I feel broken, I can't think my way out of that. And you know that. You've tried. You've looped around your head over and, what's wrong with me? Why can't I do this? How can I do this? I should do this. That person did this to me. I did that. I should have done this. All of this talking to myself, it doesn't actually heal me at all. There is definitely some value in just spitting it out. And that was something, and just so you know, the way I do my talks, in case you've never seen a James Marshall video before, is that I'm going to jump between 19 topics and hopefully tie them up together. But what I'm starting to look at is different ways that we can be therapeutic to ourselves and how we can ask for help to bring others to heal. My first premise being that you don't have to heal. You can just be crippled, but your life will be way worse. It's not tough. You're not a martyr. You don't get anything out of it. It's not better. It's not honourable to be a martyr to your own pain. I know that. I've rolled around in my own pain at points in my life, and for whatever benefits I got out of it from, I don't know, thinking weird thoughts or coming up with some strange plans or something, writing a song, it wasn't worth it because the pain was way more intense than what I got out of it. So if you're living in pain, you need to understand you don't need to. Human life includes pain, but if we learn ways to regularly process it, then it will be much less painful. And just as I was saying in my last video, it means that you will get to experience more of the bittersweet mixed juice that is life. With all of its ingredients, sorrowful and joyful, I think it's better to experience all of those than it is to reach some numb bandwidth in the middle where you don't really get peaks and troughs. You don't really get the intensity of life, and you don't really feel the pain of it either. Personally, I would rather feel the pain and then get to experience all of it. And most people would, I would think, if you had a taste of what that's like. A lot of people don't even know. They have lived in numbness in some form or another their entire lives. I would ask you to start living in more conscious trance states as opposed to numbness. And they can be similar in a way. If I'm very numb and distracted through whatever, TV, alcohol, porn, just distraction and being physically very unaware of myself, slouching in a couch for hours on end or whatever, this creates a certain trance state in a way. And what is a trance state? A trance state is one where we are immersed in the moment, and it's a full physical experience. So you would say, okay, if I'm making love to somebody and I'm really into them and we're really in love or something, that we're in a trance state because nothing else matters. Probably our brain waves are working differently, our brains are working differently than they are. Usually, your fingertips are tingling, you can hear your own breath, you're there. And it alters your state of consciousness. If you take drugs or have great sex or go skydiving or just sit there and look at a beautiful sunset and just allow it to just go, whoa, that kind of thing, it will settle you into some form of trance. And this tends to be where we can start to deal with our subconscious better. This surface level logical mind, as I said, we can't think our way through our childhood issues or our pain about our sense of worthiness or our father or whatever the things are. We can think about them and we can create a narrative. And sometimes that is important, but it is not really the therapy itself. And so a little aside here, when looking at, do I need to get a therapist? I'm not saying you necessarily do. As I said, there are people who learn how to process life just by living in a therapeutic way. There are also some people who are just not traumatized as much or at all by certain things that other people are traumatized by. And when you're a six-year-old kid, you can't really tell how good or bad this is on the scale of everything and decide, is this a traumatic event? I remember one traumatic event I had was my mother sent me into the library once when I was, I don't know, eight or nine or something and said, just go and tell the lady, can I have my card? And I walked in and I went up to the lady and I said, can I have my card? And she went, what do you mean? And I'm like, I don't know. Can I have my card? Because I didn't know what she meant. My mom just said, she gave no other instructions. And the lady said, that doesn't mean anything. And then I went, and I ran out. And I didn't go to that library again for years. And I hated, I was just like, when I thought of libraries, I felt bad about myself. That was a traumatic event because some, you know, middle-aged lady behind the desk was like, what? What are you talking about kid? And it deeply offended and made me feel very foolish. And I didn't know what she meant. I don't know what a card is. And then I came back to my mom, like, she just said that. I just, I was angry at my mom or whatever. Like, why do I remember that? That was one thing that happened once when I was eight. And I remember it having a deep effect on me and it affected me for some time later. That's not rational. That's not like I should have gone, well, you didn't get beaten as a child. So, okay. That was traumatic for me. Okay. I processed that particular one, but there's, as young children, we're not able to, to rationally itemize things and figure out what does and doesn't matter. We just experience, and we experienced like a sponge from all of our inputs, right? From our physical body, from what we hear people saying, from the emotions that are projected towards us, and from our physical environment, from the food that we're eating, which is what we put in our body massively affects our moods for sure. And so we don't know. And so we get damaged by whatever it is. It was hardcore trauma. It was a seemingly nothing trauma, but whatever it was, it caused this ripple effect. And then over years and years and years, we find ways to walk wounded. We find ways to compartmentalize. And then often we find ways to suppress. And so maybe these things only come out in dreams or when you're in a very angry or sad state or under therapeutic situations. So if you know that you're someone who doesn't just naturally process things by dancing in the fields and going to nudist colonies and just picking flowers or whatever some people do, then you will need to first recognize that there is issues that you have that should be solved, not because you're weak, but because you want to be more than just a walking wounded droid. You want to be someone that gets to experience love and joy inside this life experience, that you want to enjoy as much of it as you can. All life is suffering, said the Buddha. But as I said in the previous video, it's not all minutes of all life is suffering. It's more like it's the interpretation of suffering that really hurts. Now, of course, if I chop my arm off, there will be a very objective pain, right? I can't go, wow, man, what does that even mean? All right, there'll be a very high level of pain. But if I take it back from something very, very extreme, like I remember when I was with Ido Portal and just training in his class, like a grunt, I was just a normal dude in the class. And I remember we were doing something very fucking difficult because everything he makes you do is very difficult mentally, physically, emotionally, because you're just frustrated and you're annoyed and you can't do it and it makes no sense. And he just goes and you're like, wow, how did he do that? Anyway, what he said to us was, because whenever you're practicing a new thing, you know this, right? So let's say your gym teacher is trying to teach you a new movement or some new skill and you're doing it and you're finding it and you reach your frustration point and then you go like this, right? So you're doing this movement and you're like, at least that look of, ah, this is hard and I'm finding it hard. And Ido said, he walked past me and I guess I did that and some other people and he said, when you feel a painful situation, you're frustrated, don't do this face. Just don't do it. And I was like, what do you mean don't do it? And I didn't say that. I was just like, what does he mean don't do it? And I just thought, he literally means just don't do that face. And so I'm doing the exercise and I reach the point where it's like, ah, this is hard and frustrating. I find my mouth, my face when I go and then I just went, I just let it drop and then I just continue with the movement. And it was a fucking revelation because he was so right. Because the only thing that made that movement hard, because it wasn't, he wasn't asking us to lift 200 kilos or something that was physically impossible. It was a complicated set of body mechanics for someone who doesn't, who's not practiced at it, but it was solvable. And this didn't help. This was just me trying to tell the teacher, I find this hard or I'm really working hard. That's really what I'm, it's an ego thing really. It's because if he wasn't there in the room, I might not, I probably wouldn't do that. I'd just be like doing the thing. But it was definitely a call. It was me and the other people going, Ido, please look at me. You're making me do a hard thing and I'm trying to do it and it's hard. I need your validation or something like that. And it was just the very action of just like not adding an extra layer of pain to what was objectively a bit painful, but it was the, that's what made it very painful. That's what made that exercise suffering as opposed to enjoying sweating and learning something physical, right? So there are many ways that you can reframe and change the way that you interact with the world and with traumatic events. And there are many technologies that you can utilize in order to process them. That, and that doesn't mean curing them all forever. And that's something that took me ages to figure out. Cause you know, I've been doing healing work on myself since I was 18. I've been going to meditation retreats. I've been going to teachers. I've gone, I've seen therapists. I've gone to many, many, many, like, I don't know, 30 or 40 ayahuasca ceremonies. Um, you know, I've gone to hippie dance festivals. I've been in BDSM scenes. I've gone and spoken to amazing masters and I've talked to wise people and I've shared things with my friends and I've had long talks into the night with lovers. You know, I've been healing and processing all my life. And I, and I had this thought when I was at an ayahuasca ceremony a while ago and the shaman, who's a girl that I've, a lady, isn't that terrible that I still call all women girls? Like she's 32. She's a fucking witch of power, absolute power. I'm like girls, this woman, woman, she said something about, you know, and we've got something about our healing and I just, she just said something, you know, like we need to, we need to process and heal our stuff. And I thought, what is she still healing and processing? Like, I've done 30 of these sessions over, you know, many different dietas or retreats. She's done hundreds of them. Literally, she's, she's gone through tripping ceremonies hundreds of times. And I'm like, does she still need to cure to healing? When do we stop healing for fuck's sake? Is this what we do as hippies? You just spend your entire life healing and you, and like one day when you're 60, you can finally come to terms with your childhood. And of course you can get into, you can certainly get into a, an addiction or just a repetition of going from next workshop or next healing thing to the next. I used to see that with people when I was going to a lot of different workshops, that there were people who, they were junkies of new technologies, right? They wanted to learn a new technique. They got excited about it and then they dropped it and moved on to the next thing. So yes, you can just, you can live a self-indulgent life, just kind of dabbling in all sorts of healing things and not really, you know, still not really live a very effective life or make that just too much of your life, right? Like where everything has to be healed all the time. And you know, you can't walk next, walk past someone who was smoking a cigarette or anything else without going, Oh no, I need to go and purge and heal for a month. So we don't want to be that, but we don't want to be the guy that never looks at this stuff.
