And she's like, yep. How often would that be? It would probably be daily, right? Or quite often. If you're not able to get sex in, and when I say sex, I always mean sex plus something. Something which has emotional aspects to it, but there's more friendship, or which dives deeper into real pair bonding, oxytocin and serotonin mixtures and falling in love, which is like another level of that kind of experience. All of those things can be exceptionally nourishing. And if you have none of those things, as a man, you're gonna feel lonely. You're gonna feel left out. You're unlikely to feel like you're at the top of your game or that you are as masculine and as fulfilled as a man as you could be. And so therefore, if you agree with that and you acknowledge it, you're gonna have to learn how to juice it. And if it takes 500 approaches to get that locked in, that can still be done in a few months. So what? Cool. Have two or 300 women in your life go, oh, no thanks, or sorry, I've got a boyfriend. And experience that, get a bit of a thick skin around it. It's just the numbers. You just gotta crunch the numbers and the skillset increases the numbers."}
