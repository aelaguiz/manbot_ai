It's one that is very important, so let me read out this question. When do we know a girl is the perfect match for us, and what is the time to stop gaming and settle down? Good question, and the answer is, you'll know. You'll just know. Just kidding. So the answer is, there's multiple factors that we need to consider here when looking at what's the right time to settle down, is this girl really good for me? Something that we see a lot of in our work, in our field of work with our clients is that guys come into this with a need to want to get a skill set. Guys come into seduction, they come to the natural lifestyles, they come into looking at videos like this, often times with a desire to have more freedom, more choice, more possibilities, more experience, and that is often related to dating, relating women, sexuality, so it's very common that guys are showing up without a lot of experience, and they want to get a lot of experience. Now, if you want to get a lot of experience, then you have to go out there and do a lot of practice, and if you're going to do that, then it's going to be very hard to do that if you're locked down in a relationship. So there's this kind of paradox that happens with guys that are into seduction and practicing pick up, because they're doing it because they actually want to have a better sense of self, and ideally have better relationships and better connections, but at the same time sometimes pursuing a lot of pick up can mean that you're almost working against yourself because you're having a lot of experiences that are not necessarily the best experiences for creating a relationship with a girl. So how do we know when it's time to choose a girl or when it's time to settle down? Well a big thing to recognize on that journey is where are you at? What stage are you at? If you're in a position where you haven't really been dating for a long time, or you've never had a relationship, or you haven't had a relationship in a very long time, and you don't really know what you want, or you're just coming back into really connecting with women for whatever reason, then it can be very important to start to go out there and build a dating life, to see multiple women, to have some experiences, and maybe that lasts months, maybe that lasts years. And typically what we recommend as a general rule, which I tend to agree with, is that you don't want to get stuck in a relationship, especially early on, because that's going to put you back into the comfort zone. It's going to put you back into the place of not really developing and evolving on your journey as a man as much as you could. Now once again, we've got lots of videos on our channel that relate to this in various forms and you can go and refer to those, but today I really want to look at how do we know if we're making a good choice or not when we meet a girl that is a good match for us, or a good potential match, and also when is it time to settle down? Well, I would say that the important thing to recognize here is that you need to have a range of reference experiences to be able to make a good judgment call about that. You can just go out and find a girl and have a relationship with her and you might find that in weeks or months you're very dissatisfied with that because she doesn't really match you in various ways. So the important things to look at in a relationship are things like, does the person that you're spending time with have similar values to you? Does she like doing similar stuff? Doesn't have to be all the same stuff, but does she at least have some important parts of her that match the important parts of you so that you guys can see eye to eye and value the same kinds of things? Because one of the things that makes relationships very hard and kills a lot of relationships is misalignments of values to people wanting to go in different directions or to people that are butting heads on a major point of contention that they regularly have to face. So for example, if you're a very freedom loving person who likes going out and being social and having constant adventures and you start dating a girl who's very shy and conservative and wants to stay inside all time doing things that entertain her in a more introverted way, then you might butt heads. You might also not because maybe you have another area of your life where you really share an amazing value of spirituality or you really share an amazing love of nature or an amazing love of art or an amazing joy for some passion that you both have. And in some sense, because you have an alignment on that value, then the other value of extroversion versus introversion doesn't really matter too much. But if you have misalignments on these really core levels, you've definitely got an issue. So make sure if you're dating a girl that she's got good values before you're even going to consider settling down and really being with her in a more intense kind of way. Now, how do you identify values? Well, that's a whole thing in itself. Well, identifying values is a lot about getting to know somebody. And there are specific things that you can do to identify people's values. And basically what it comes down to is understand what your values are. What's important to you? So for example, for me, what's important to me is having a strong understanding and map of reality. I like to map and philosophize and understand the world from multiple perspectives. So what does that mean when it comes to when I'm dating women and finding a woman who really matches me? I really appreciate and enjoy and need a woman with an open mind, with a curious mind, with a mind that wants to learn, that wants to analyze. And ideally, a girl who's into stuff like psychology or history or spirituality or whatever. So she has some elements of herself that's into that. So that's one thing that's really important for me, for example. So I know I'll filter for that. And that will come out fairly quickly because I share that I'm a coach and I'm into philosophy and I'm into sociology and I'm into all these different things. Then they'll start to say, oh, I like that too. That's interesting. Whereas if she's not interested in that, then OK, that's fine. But then I might fish for something else because it's not just that's not the only thing I'm looking for. For example, maybe I'm looking for something like a good sense of connection to her purpose. So does she know what she wants to do and what she's doing in life? And does she have passion for who she is and where she's going? Because I have a lot of passion for that in myself. So I like to share my mission and my purpose. And in some ways, that is good when I have that. But then there can be a point of contention on that level, too, because if she's too driven, too focused and too on her purpose and I'm driven and focused on my purpose, then we might be might be really hard to connect because there's not a lot of like meeting each other on that level. So it's about finding somebody who can match you on those levels. And sometimes, not always, and this is something to consider, which is important in relationships. Sometimes one partner needs to be the leader and the other one needs to be the follower. And that doesn't sound very appealing, but it's definitely dominant and submissive dynamics, power exchanges that are happening inside healthy relationships. And for example, it's not always the case, but a general thing is that when a man is directed and on purpose and he feels strong about who he is and where he's going, then he is usually well matched to a supportive woman who wants to go with him on that journey and is happy to let him lead because then he gets to feel like the leader and be more masculine in his role. And if he's with a woman who's very leader orientated herself and she wants to go and push very hard to do her own thing, then there can be sometimes some contention over who's leading the relationship, who's the dominant. So imagine you having like two people trying to be captain of the same ship, which is the relationship, and that can be hard. So at least from time to time, there needs to be one captain and one follower and then one captain and one follower. And you can switch between, but definitely not two at the same time because that's not really cool. So that's something that's important to recognize is, does the person that you're with match you in their ability to either understand your purpose and want to learn about that? Or do they have a strong purpose and you want to learn about that yourself and how can you collaborate on this? That's an important one for me. Now the second one, sorry, the third one that is important for me, for example, is having a strong sense of emotional intelligence about relationships. Now I have a lot of emotional intelligence about relationships. I love to be very real and honest and human and share a lot of things with the girls that I'm with. And I really appreciate a girl who's able to be open and honest and can meet me on those levels. Especially because I live this weird life as a dating coach and I'm traveling around the world doing this kind of work, that can often be very hard for a woman to understand because she's very quick to jump into judgments and opinions and, you know, what she thinks that I'm doing, which is might not necessarily even be true. And it helps me a lot if she's at least open in her mind to be able to say, ah, well, I don't really know what you're doing, but I'm interested to learn more. Or it seems like you're doing something that I'm not really comfortable with, but I'm at least willing to talk to you about it and learn about what's going on. Now, that's a bit of a side rant, but you can see, for example, there's some of my values and then it allows me to match and qualify and find girls that are in alignment with those. Now I have other values like playfulness and fun and, you know, being sexually, like, liberated and at least curious, you know, obviously having things like a good sense of adventure, you know, and a good understanding of life is always a plus. So I try to work out how can I communicate with the girls that I'm with to find if they match me on these levels. And if I find I'm dating a girl who doesn't really match me on these levels, honestly, I am not going to be spending that much time with her because I'm not getting anything out of it. She doesn't stimulate me. I don't stimulate her. We're not really sharing anything amazing. So the result is that maybe we can share some sex or go on an adventure together, or maybe it's cool to hang out with her for a weekend or whatever. But I ultimately know that it's not going to go that far because I don't want to have to play the role of constantly investing in her to try and shape her or make her into the person that I would love her to be so that then I can connect with her and vice versa. I'm sure she doesn't want to have to invest in me and, you know, turn me into the kind of guy that she wants to be in. So just look, I'm looking for that. So that's an important thing is looking for, you know, what are the values that you, you know, you're sharing and if you really match each other on that level. Another thing that I personally think is very important, and I think it's a pretty good general thing to come up against as well, is if you want to date a girl long term, if you think that she's like, you know, quality material, she's like, she's a keeper, look for a girl that is a giver. And what I mean by that is, I mean, she wants to give, she wants to serve, she wants to please, she wants to give you herself and her time and her energy and her femininity. Why is that important? Because it's one of the most powerful things a woman can do and can share with a man is nourishment, blessing, femininity, you know, her feminine essence. Now there is an exchange here because in a healthy dynamic between a man and a woman, when you have a very giving woman, what she's often really lacking in the man as a result and a reflection of that is that he is also giving to her but in a different kind of way. So it's often more like the man is able to lead and take care of and create a kind of a clear container, a clear strong space for her to feel comfortable, to be vulnerable, to connect with herself so that she can allow herself to want to go into that feminine sort of state. In my experience, I mean, there's a ton of different people out there doing different things. There's a lot of different styles of women and I warn you, some women are selfish, some women are narcissistic, some women are immature, some women have had a lot of things in their life given to them for free and they never really had to work for anything and they don't really care about taking care of anybody else or wanting to give or wanting to share or wanting to be really feminine for a guy because they don't have to and they've never learned that lesson and maybe they never will learn that lesson. So you need to also realize if you're with a girl like that, how much do you really want to spend time with that because ultimately, that kind of girl is going to be a big investment. I mean, she's going to take a lot of time, she's probably going to be high maintenance and ultimately, you're going to end up in a position typically where you're the guy who's always trying to work hard to make things work because she's not really willing to meet you halfway and to give in return. So make sure you're looking for somebody who's a giver, somebody who's nourishing, somebody who's a good person, a good, sweet, nice girl, a girl that wants to share and that's also going to pay off in places like the bedroom because she's going to want to please you, she's going to want to explore, she's going to want to give you good experiences and learn. So if you're able to give her your masculinity, create the space, make her feel safe, make her feel okay to be in her vulnerability as a woman, then she's going to want to open herself to you, she's going to want to give herself to you and that's a blessing, it really is a blessing and as a man, it's very important that you respect that and that you acknowledge that and you take care of that so that you're not damaging her and also hurting yourself in that process. Now, that is something that takes a bit of practice, it's something that you need to develop emotional intelligence about and it helps to have things like sexual skills and physical skills like learning how to touch and lead and all these things that will happen through dating and that's also why it's important to have a broad experience of dating with lots of different girls, with lots of different tastes and different needs and sleeping with different women at different times will show you so much about different women. Some women are really sensual and they just want to be constantly affectionate. Some women are not particularly sensual and even though they might have a very high sex drive sometimes, it's only in some moments for a short period of time. Other women are not very sexual at all and some women have a high need for affection but they don't have a high sense of need for sexuality. There's all these different dynamics and also as a man, you need to learn how to navigate those things and understand the different natures and the different codes, the different languages of different women. And, for example, something to check out, which is a powerful thing for every man to understand in general, and I wouldn't say it's the complete answer, but a useful model to look at is the five love languages. Now, the five love languages explain that different people connect and love each other based on their primary love language. So, for example, from memory, the five primary love languages are quality time, there is physical touch and affection, there's gifts, there is praise and acknowledgement, and there's one more that I can't remember off the top of my head right now, it'll come to me in a minute. But the point is that, depending on what those languages are, you're going to start to work out, like, how are you connecting with this girl, and what are yours? For example, my primary love language is a quality time and physical touch. So I know that I'm having good quality time with a girl and she's giving me a lot of physical affection, I feel loved, I feel connected, I feel good. Whereas if I'm with a girl who needs to hear constant praise and gifts, then I need to be aware of that. Because if I'm trying to make her feel loved by giving her quality time and affection, but she's feeling unloved because I'm not buying her gifts and giving her praise, then they've got a problem there. But if I understand that, then that's going to make a big difference in making that relationship work if that's something I want to do. And also, it can be very useful and is very powerful if you have a partner that at least has one of your primary love languages. Because we have at least two, and oftentimes more, and in some ways we could say, yeah, we all like them all, but we often have one or two that are our really strong primary ones, and when we have those, we feel most met, most acknowledged, most appreciated. So be aware of that and how you're matching on these different love language kinds of levels. So there's another one, like I said, coming back to that idea of look for a giver. The next thing which is also important, and it is related to that, is find a girl that can love you. If you want to be with a girl long-term, you want to settle down, you want to create something and not sure whether that's a good idea or not, make sure you find a girl that can love you. Now, this is a complicated topic to a degree because what is love? Well, love is a big, interesting thing, and yet again, we learn about love over a lifetime. It's something that is not easy to put into a box because there's many definitions, many perspectives, many variations on what love is and how we can relate to this concept of love. Now, in my view, as I'm sitting here right now relating about that idea of love, I look at it as if love is an ability to meet somebody as they are, to bless them in who they are, and to wish the best for them to be all that they are without judgment, without constraint, without control, without possession. Now, we've got a bit of a paradox here because on some level, you could say, well, that's what idealistic love is, that's what romantic, no, that's not romantic love, that's what idealistic unconditional love is. But on the other side, you've got conditional love, romantic love because in some sense, I can meet a girl and think, wow, she's amazing and I really hope that she's happy and I wish her all the best and I really want to spend more time with her and I hope she gets to be all that she can be, and then she might be out hanging out with other guys or fucking other guys and I need to make a judgment in that moment as like, am I okay with that? Is that within my boundaries and rules of what is okay for me? And if it's not, which for a lot of guys, it's not, for example, then I'm going to have to deal with that. I'm going to have to come to terms with either creating a negotiation with her to say like, I really want to bless you and be with you and share this amazing journey of love in an unconditional kind of way, but for me to be intimate and feel safe and feel connected on a romantic level, then I'm going to need you to understand that there's some kind of rules that are most effective for creating this relationship, for allowing us to work together. Now, the thing to realize along with that is a relationship is, it's a container. It's a series of negotiations and rules that allow two people to share time and energy and ideally get the best out of their time together. Now, the thing is, not a lot of people are aware of that. They just fall into the unconscious habit patterns of like, oh yeah, we're in a relationship, and then what often happens is people turn this thing, which is actually a dynamic, living, constantly changing negotiation, they turn it into an object as if a relationship is something they can put into a wheelbarrow or that they can somehow produce and go like, yeah, I'm in a relationship, as if it's like a piece of toast or something. No, a relationship is not an object. A relationship is a process that is constantly being negotiated, and the more that you're able to negotiate and understand your terms of negotiation, the easier it's going to be for you to be able to stay in a healthy sense of relationship. Now, this is something that is more advanced as a concept, but I would say that one of the things that ultimately you're really looking for, and this comes down to like, when is it time to settle down, well, it's time to settle down when you're mature enough to settle down. It's time to settle down when you're conscious enough to actually be able to relate on a high level with somebody, and you've met somebody who is also mature enough to settle down and is conscious enough to be able to relate. Then you have two mature people relating in a conscious way to create a dynamic, positive, really good relationship, and there's lots of good rules for relationships. For example, some simple stuff that I can just say off the top of my head is, if you're going to be with somebody, take care of them. Treat them like royalty. Make sure that they are a special person. Don't treat them like shit. A lot of people get into this thing of like, once they're in a relationship with somebody, they get less and less appreciative of them. They take them more and more for granted. They pay less and less attention to them. They don't adore them. They don't appreciate them. They don't honor them. It can be sad when people are in an intimate relationship for a period of time, and then they're treating strangers better than they're treating their partner. Now, that's not fair, so don't fall into that kind of trap. Obviously, if you're in a position where you've got a partner, and you find that you're treating them with less respect and less honor and less appreciation than you would a stranger or somebody that you hardly know, like a new friend, then there's something that either needs to be negotiated, or it's a sure sign that you're in the wrong relationship. You're with the wrong person, and you need to negotiate something else or get out of that relationship to find something that's going to be healthy for you. Because in my opinion, it's better to be single and to be happy than it is to be in a relationship with somebody that is not really making you happy, and ultimately, you're not making them happy as a result either. So these are really important things, is being aware of like, being with somebody who can love you, who can meet you in this space of these rules, these rules, this game, and somebody that you can make sure that you're really, you know, solidly relating to each other in a conscious kind of way. Now, that, like I said, is an ongoing conversation. That means that when things come up, which they do on a regular basis, you're able to be honest about them in the right way. And sometimes things come up, and it's not the right time or place to deal with it. Sometimes emotions come up, and you have to think, hmm, I'm feeling some emotions right now, I could talk about it and make a drama out of it, or maybe I should sit with my emotions for a little while, and understand whether this is actually a real problem or just something that's a result of a state that I'm in right now, or it's a reaction to something that I'm dealing with right now that actually doesn't have very much to do with her or to do with the relationship. Sometimes that happens. So sometimes it can be really good when you're in a relationship to step back and to think for a moment, like, is this a good time to voice this or not? Other times, it's important to step in and make sure that you are voicing what's appropriate at the time, because there's something important that needs to be understood, it needs to be negotiated, and the sooner, the better, rather than later, because some of these things, if they fester under the surface, can create difficulties. Now the art of being able to do that is intuitive, really, and it's also intuitive because it's a result of having a lot of reference experiences of relating and relationships and seeing positive models and effective models of people relating. Now it's important if you want to be in a good relationship that you find somebody who's able to meet you in that. So for example, be with a partner that, if you feel strong emotions and you can say to them, I'm feeling some emotions right now, I don't know what to make of it, and I'm just going to sit with it for a while. I don't want to talk about it for a few hours or a few days until I really get what's going on, and it's important to have a partner who's able to say, okay, that's cool, I understand that, or if it's not cool with them to say that, they're like, no, I really need to talk about this, that you can negotiate that, or vice versa, it's cool to be with a partner and you say, I have these things I really need to talk about right now because this is really important for me, and even if she says, I'm not really cool with that, I need some time, then you negotiate that. So you want to be able to meet each other in your negotiation, in your consciousness, in your ability to keep this relationship alive. So that's being able to meet somebody who can really love you, and that's also being able to really love, and finding that balance between the ideal of love, which is, like I said, the ideal of love is I want you to be the best that you can be, and if you being the best that you can be means that you have to take me out of your life, or that I have to allow you to do things that are not okay with me because of my expectations, then I have to deal with that. But that goes both ways. That's the important thing here, is that you have to make a choice. If the best thing for your partner is to allow her to go and sleep with another guy because that's truly what she needs to do and that's who she really is, then maybe you'll have to deal with that. And vice versa. This is where the power comes in for you guys out here as well, because if the best thing for you, for your truth, for your true higher self, for your true love of who you are and where you're going, is to be free and to date other women or to be in open relationships, then you need to do that. And ideally, if you're with a woman who loves and respects you, then she will give you the freedom to do that and meet you on that level. Now if somebody is unable to hold the space, it's such a hippie thing to say, but unable to allow you to be the person that you need to be to experience your higher potential and to be all the things that you want to be, then they're probably not the kind of person who's going to make good relationship material in the long term. Now there is a paradox here as well because the funny thing that can happen is if you're with somebody, for example, and there is this knowledge, there is an understanding that you just want each other to be happy. If that means being with somebody else, then that's okay. And the irony oftentimes is that when somebody gives you complete freedom to say, if you really need to be with other people, go and be with other people. So the irony is that when you're with somebody who really acknowledges what you need and loves you and wants you to have all those things, then the tendency is that you don't want to stray away from that person. You actually respect them more. You want to fulfill their needs more. So you can find this kind of amazing balance of like the more that you give somebody freedom or the more that you're given freedom to be all that you are, sometimes that makes you want to serve the rules, the romantic rules of devotion that then allow for the best possible conditions for that person to keep loving you in that way. Now something that, I'll just tell you a little story really quickly, which I think is a powerful story that illustrates some key points, is there's a teacher, she's worth checking out. Her name is Byron Katie and Byron Katie does a lot of things, but she teaches people how to break out of certain emotional patterns and she's worth checking out. But she told a story which was quite key for my understanding of love and she was going through a stage of depersonalization, I guess. She was breaking out into a very expanded state of awareness where she was seeing her humanity and her new individuality and her truth in a completely different light. Now she was in a marriage at that time and that's quite weird because her personality was changing, her habits were changing, the way that she was connecting with her partner was very, very different. And basically her husband came to her and said, do you still love me? And she asked a key question, which is a very powerful question. This is a good one for you guys to keep in mind. She asked, well what is this thing called love that you're asking me about? What is it that you think that love is that I need to understand so that I can answer that question? And he basically said something along the lines of, well do you feel these feelings of special significance for me? Do you feel these like warm fuzzy feelings and fantasies and desires and do you want to adore me and do you want to appreciate me and do you see me as somebody really special in my life? In her life, sorry. And she thought about it for a moment and she said something that was very powerful. She said, well I feel those feelings when you create the conditions for me to be able to feel those feelings more easily. So when you take me out, when you appreciate me, when you talk to me, when you do nice things for me, when you take care of me, I feel those feelings more regularly. It's easier for me to go into those feelings of love. So what she was saying to her husband at that time is like, if you treat me with respect and you understand the patterns that I need inside myself so that I can be safe and comfortable in my ability to see you as that kind of person that deserves that kind of connection, that kind of emotional attachment, then I will do that. And what she also said is like when you don't do those things, when you don't act like a mature husband or you don't take care of me or you bring too much negativity or judgment or frustration or whatever it is into the relationship that's not healthy for the relationship, then I don't feel those feelings for you. Now it makes sense, right? It's pretty simple. Now what does that demonstrate? It demonstrates that there's rules of devotion. There's rules of romantic love that work. Now the second part to what she said, which is also extremely powerful, was she said, and in some sense, I don't love you because I am love. We are love. This is love. Life is love. So that's a pretty trippy spiritual thing to say, but she's talking about how her perspective of love had shifted from this small contained box of rules that most people think a relationship is that's based basically on possession. The typical role and rules of relationships that people have is like you act the way that I want you to act so I'll feel the feelings that I need to feel and then I'll act the way that you want me to act so that you can feel the feelings and then we'll basically write a contract over those feelings so you become the drug dealer of my feelings and I'll become the drug dealer of your feelings. So we become responsible for each other's feelings and then you start to become dependent on each other and then you start to want to possess the other person. That's where it really goes wrong. As people start to possess each other, they start to control each other, and most of this stuff happens unconsciously. "}
