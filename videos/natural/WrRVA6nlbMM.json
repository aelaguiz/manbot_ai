When you really have that intention behind anything, and I think you'll back me up on this point, in-life intention is the most important thing. Like, you've been meditating for a long time. If you sit there and meditate and your intention is simply to clear your mind and be present and just allow the thoughts to pass, that's probably what's going to happen if you focus. You're probably not going to have a profound spiritual awakening because that wasn't what you were asking for. You see, the intention behind what you're doing is the key. And so for me, for some weird reason, I don't know why I'm a freak, but around 2015, I was like, I'm going to wake up no matter what. And I was obsessed with it. I went around and saw enlightened masters. I did seminars. I was reading all the books, watching all the videos, gone into meditation. I mean, everything to just like to try and wake the fuck up. And I've had experiences of various degrees from like subtle to like, holy fuck, that are absolutely indescribable. But ultimately the experience are basically in layers. It generally happens in layers for other people as well, that the ego, this idea of what we think that we are, like these series of thoughts, this body and this mind and these beliefs, I'm a man and I'm successful. People like me, all these ideas that are completely just constructs. And in these experiences, what dissolves is that idea of identity as this guy, this one person who's going to live about a hundred or whatever years that be completely fading away of that. And the realization that, holy shit, there's so much more going on that actually, at some level, and you tap into that, even if it's for 30 seconds or a few hours or whatever, that you are actually something so much grander. And it is consciousness. Literally we are that awareness that goes, I exist. I am. Other animals, even doggies, they're great. They don't have that. They don't go, I wonder what I should do. No, they're just dogs. Ants are just ants. Plants are just plants. They exist. They have a consciousness too of some type, but they do not have self-awareness. And that, in the big, big, big experiences, because I was so desperate to know the answer, I was lucky enough by God's grace to receive the answer, which is, I am actually, period. I am full stop. Sure, I'm a person right now too, but in the ultimate, I'm not. I'm so much grander. And that, the peace and tranquility, the liberation that comes when you realize that this is, if you lose the body, it's not a big deal. You continue on. You're actually on a soul level, on a much higher level. You are eternal. Everybody is eternal. But discover, if you want to actually discover that, holy fuck, if you set your intention to that, onto that, the things and experiences you can have are absolutely mind-blowing. And I would say to anybody listening, it really is worth it to explore that question. Who am I? What is consciousness? What am I doing here? You know, what is my nature? And to take that into your, whatever, into your plant medicine trips or into your meditations or into your contemplations, but take that with you because it's a question worth asking. And I think we're so busy in this society, running around, trying to make money and be successful and get the next house and, you know, all these things. Do we really take time to just answer the, to ask even the big question of what, who am I and what am I doing here? So just, just something I wanted to put out there. Yeah. It's, you kind of have to answer, ask that question at some point in your life. And people do ask it in different ways and they come to all sorts of answers. You know, sometimes they're like, what is, what's the purpose of my life? It's to be a consumer. That's, that's my job. And that's what it works, right? I work, I make money and I buy things and people say, good boy, keep buying things. And maybe I get a, maybe I get a partner who does that too. And maybe we live happily ever after buying shit. I don't know, but it's, but there's definitely of course, multiple layers of, of experiencing consciousness and reality. And what I've found in those moments where I've had breakthroughs, sometimes breakthroughs are really boring in a way. Like they're not like necessarily, uh, for me anyway, like not like fireworks and always like, well, like in, in the movies when someone breaks through in the matrix or something and suddenly like everything makes sense. Uh, it's been, it's been more like, it's this amusing remembering suddenly like, Oh yeah, I know Kung Fu. I remember that feeling a number of times in various meditations or in trips of just going, Oh, now I remember. Now I remember me like, and me, the, the, the, whether it's eternal or more, or whether it's this connected me, or it's like the, Oh, all of those things that I thought were me, those things I was stressed about. And it looks so funny. Like it's quite, it's really like amusing to look and go, Oh yeah, I cared about all that. None of that. None of that matters. Don't worry about that. I remember who I am. And then the funny thing is that you forget, you can forget it again. Like humans are hilarious. They can then completely fall back into a delusion. And then three years later, be reminded again, Oh yeah, this is me. That's, that's one thing I found with my spiritual quest, because when I started meditating, I was 18. I was, I was gunning for enlightenment by 25. That was my goal. That's right. That's, that, that's what's so fast. That's so interesting about you. You went on to such a wild ride. You did it way too early. And then you're like, fuck it. I want to get chicks. And then you went all the way on the other fucking end. And I like to think at some point now you're going to slowly come back to the, the other side. I will be teetering in the middle somewhere. Or you'll be teetering till 80, 84 years old, reading the Bhagavad Gita while getting a blow job from some 26 year old. See, I'm now I'm going to blame that on you. No, I had that idea already. I know Kung Fu. If you'd like to learn how to crack out of the matrix, not just on a, let's say societal or dating level, which is where most of the guys start with in terms of thinking about alternatives to the swiping and waiting culture that now exists in terms of your dating life. But if you'd like to look at things more deeply, as Sasha and I have been talking about in this video, unplugging yourself from incorrect mindsets, from negative self-talk, from ideologies that are trying to jerk you around and use you for their own Machiavellian purposes, then check out my free 90 minute video on how to break free from the matrix, both internal and external.
