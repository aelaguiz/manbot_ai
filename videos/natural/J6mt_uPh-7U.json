What do you communicate most? WhatsApp, Viber, Instagram? But you will reply to me? When I write to you, you'll be right back? Okay. You're so sweet. Are you a little bit shy? That's okay. I was shy before. Now I'm different. How long have you been trying to approach a woman? It's been roughly a year that I've been trying to do a cold approach on the street by myself. It didn't really work out very well. Most of the time I bailed when I saw a woman walking by. I decided to approach and then finally I didn't approach. So I thought this is so bad. I'm stuck in this situation. I will never be able to do this. And the reality is we came here, we had one session with the coaches and starting from then you just go to any woman and you approach. Hi. Excuse me. I just saw you. You look so good, summery. I love it. Would you stop for a second? What's your name? Esther. What are you doing today, Esther? Meeting with my friend. Are you in a hurry? Are you late? No. For your friend? Okay. Well, I'm Sebastian. I know it's strange, I don't want to scare you. But you just look very... It happened before. You're used to it? Sorry? You're used to being approached by men on the street? It happened before. I can imagine. I'm not surprised. So what's your plan with your friend? Just talking. Talking, shopping, chilling, drinking? Not drinking. Drinking coffee or something? Yeah. Well, you seem quite uncomfortable with me. I think I will let you go. Have fun. You too. Bye-bye. Okay, so never tell a girl that you're making her uncomfortable. Because why would I do that? It makes it more uncomfortable. I wanted to acknowledge that I realize what's going on for her. Just say... I know this is a bit random. The reason why it was uncomfortable was a series of things that happened. Where you opened, you sort of said something, you started laughing, releasing the pressure. Then she walked past you, then you followed her. Instead of just... Okay, so let's do that again. So you're the girl. And do what she did. So, just like... Hi. Listen. Stop for a second. Stop for a moment. Come here. What's your name? You look so amazing today. Okay, so that's me dealing with it, as opposed to you could have sort of following it. I mean, it's amazing that when you said... You know, can you stop? She did. Could you stop for a second? What's your name? But you were behind her and it was that begging frame again, right? So it's like, all right, I'll get around. Hang on a second. I'm not selling something. You just look super sexy. What's your name? And then, okay, then you recovered it a bit and then you introduced yourself. And it was actually like, you kind of blew yourself out there. Like, because you felt uncomfortable, you then told her she was uncomfortable. Right? I think she was very uncomfortable. Yeah, but... It could have... That can be released, right? Because, like, when you said... I didn't mean to scare you and she said it happened. You thought she meant it happens that men approach you. She just said, it happened, you startled me or you scared me. I said, well, that was not... If you then released and said, well, that was not my intention and I'm not scaring, with a smile, then, you know, then she gets to see, okay, all right, I was startled for a second. She'll survive. Girls get startled. Guys come up to them and you're not a crazy weirdo. You're not dangerous. So you... By you proving that by just going smiling and releasing the pressure on it, cool. And then you went a bit serious. And so what are you doing now? She's like, I'm going with friends, shopping and stuff. And she's like, oh, you're talking. And then, what could you have said about girls talking? Girls love to talk. Girls talk a lot. No, that's, that's, that's like, yeah, it's like, cool. Is there some gossip? Or is there serious, serious chats today? Serious girl time? Or, or just talking shit? That's a fun way to discuss it, right? Otherwise, it's a bit antagonistic. As always, it takes so much time to come up with something. What I'm working on right now is mainly the conversation skills. Because stopping is okay. Starting a conversation is okay. But then keeping it going and keeping it interesting and keeping her or getting her interested, that's the difficult part right now. There are some techniques to improve your conversation skills. And that's what we're working on right now. Hi. Excuse me. Let her go. Yeah. Bye-bye. If a girl blanks you like that, just let her go. She's never gonna stop. You know, you see a girl like, go like this, there's nothing you can do. It's not good for you to just follow after her. Okay. Yeah, there's a... I never know when this, when the right moment to... Yes, you do. Yes, you do. A girl goes like this, you're like, excuse me. That girl does not want to talk. As opposed to this, you say, excuse me. Hi. That's, that's something, right? She's registering, she's registering me as a human, as the other ones are like, get the fuck out of my way, any, whoever you are. There's a difference. Excuse me. Sorry. Sorry to stop you like this. You look so beautiful in your, in your dress. Thank you. I really just wanted to say hi. Very kind of you. Thank you. What are you doing? I'm doing, making my... student pass. You're a student at the university? Yes. Okay, cool. First day today, right? Yes. Or second day? First. Good. And you like it? I don't know. I didn't start. Start at six o'clock. Ah, okay. Tonight. Yes. What are you studying? Sorry? What do you study? Liberal arts. I think that's the English name. Yeah, I know what you mean. And what are you doing here? I'm basically on a holiday. Doing some, some workshops also. Relaxing. So it's not work, it's not holiday, it's a mixture. Do you live in Hungary? No, I live in... I come from Germany, I live in Switzerland. Ah, cool. Where have you been in Switzerland? Sorry? When have you been in Switzerland? Since when? Since when? Like, it's been already ten years almost. Oh. It's long, yeah. Yeah, I had a... So you were living in Germany? Before I studied there, yes. And I studied here also. Ah. A little bit. And then, I had a girlfriend there and my plan was never to stay, but finally I stayed. Say, if you have a girlfriend, where do you come from? No, I don't have her anymore. I had her when I... Because I... I went to Switzerland because of her. Then we broke up, and I... But I'm still there. Oh, sorry. And you? Do you live by yourself? With my family. Okay. And I have a boyfriend. Okay. Well then, I'm not going to interfere with you and your boyfriend, but... I still wanted to make you a compliment. Sorry? I still wanted to make you a compliment and I hope that university is going to go well for you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Have a good day. Thank you. Bye. What's that face? Ah, too many questions again, I think. The face doesn't help. It just makes this painful. And then it remains painful always because most times out of most times you don't get to fuck the girl. So if every time that happens or every time you make a mistake, which you will every time, even when you do a good pickup you'll make mistakes, come out punishing yourself, then you'll give up because then it's... this is not fun. Okay? So I don't want to see that face. I want to see... It's funny because Shea just said the same thing. Ah, well, we must be from the same team then. All right. Just come out and go, what am I proud of? What are you proud of? I stopped her, engaged her in a little conversation. She was happy to talk. Which is because of what? It's because of two things. Because of her and because of you. Because she's friendly and sweet and because what? Because probably I did the right things to... You made her feel okay. You made her feel fine. Right? That's awesome. She was... She didn't tell you to fuck off. She was just... She had a boyfriend and she still was happy to have a conversation with you because the vibe you brought was good. One thing I would have done was ask to walk with her. Like you just did start to walk with her but it didn't matter. But at first... Because there's this first... This thing where she's just like, okay, and then you start walking and then she accepted it. But it's much... You take out all that, um, what's going on here? We'll say, oh, I'll just walk with you for a minute. Then she's like, oh, okay, a minute. That's cool. And then, you know, instantly girls will relax. Oh, they tell you no. And that's... And you can't be afraid of that. It's just like if they say, no, I'd rather be alone. There's no point trying to like go with a girl who doesn't want to walk and then if the girl is cool with it, then you may as well bring it up. Yep. Yep. Um, so, from what we get... Well, from what we understood, this is maybe her first day of university ever. Yeah, I think so. Right. But, so what could you ask someone about this? She hasn't... She's got her first classes tonight. What could you ask her about that? Are you nervous? Right, because instead you went, moved into what are you studying? Which, okay, we could have got there a bit later. It's like first day. That's her lived experience right now. Oh, wow. First day. How do you feel? Are you nervous? Do you know people there already? Are you good at making friends? Yeah. It's like, uh, you know, do you feel like a grown-up? Like there's so much about the experience of first day uni which you could talk about as opposed to the next detail of what are you studying. Right. True. However, you did ask, and she says, okay, she's doing liberal arts. Then, you said, I know what that is, but you could have been... Why did you choose that? What, what, why are you interested in, in art? Yeah. Okay. Why did you choose that? Yeah, yeah, that would be like the most standard way to do that. But, what would be a cooler way to say that? Um, well, you're an artistic person, it's not, you're a creative person. Yeah, are you creative? Are you arty? Are you liberal and artistic? Um, or you can like, because actually, it's not fine art at all. It's nothing to do with, liberal arts is sociology, psychology, you know, anthropology, feminism, whatever. So, then I would say, oh, what, what's the thing you're interested in? Or, are you a people person? Or, what, what fascinates you about that? Right, so then we get, or if you don't know, say, I don't even know what that is, tell me what it is. If you're not sure, any time you're not sure about what a girl tells you, never try to act like you know. And even if you know a little bit, it's better to play dumb. She says she's into homeopathy, I'm like, oh, is that some health thing? What is that? I know, I know roughly what it is, but rather she tells me. No, no, good point. Um, you said, okay, I moved there, I moved there with a girlfriend, I broke up, and she was so sweet, she's like, I'm sorry. Then we broke up, and I, but I'm still there. Aw, I'm sorry. The breakup, I presume, was a long time ago, but, uh, and then you could have said, oh, I'm over it, but you're so sweet to say that, right? That's noticing the way she's, the way she's communicating with you. But yeah, then you can say, well, you know, I ended up staying there, and it's been something. That's the truth. Like, the Swiss are very, you know, whatever they are, Swiss. Uh, but, you know, it's, it has beautiful nature, and it's a, you know, it's, you know, it's a lot of opportunity there, but, you know, people can be a bit closed. I try to be much more open, um, and it looks like you are too. I know that's kind of advanced conversation stuff, but what I'm doing is I'm taking the topic, I'm giving more about it, and then I'm relating it to myself, and then if I can relate it to her as well. That's a lot, No, it's good. It's what we did yesterday. Okay. Good. Good. Good. Continue. It's crazy how this transformation worked in such a short amount of time. Then just, of course, we have technical issues that we need to work on, which is actually harder than this approach anxiety thing. Excuse me. Hello. How are you? Fine. Good. Are you listening to music, or are you listening to the Illuminati? Are they speaking to you? No. Oh, whatever. I just think you look very interesting. You're going to a photoshoot right now, right? Huh? Are you going to a shoot right now? I don't understand. I went to the photoshoot. I went to the photoshoot. I don't understand. Are you a Ukrainian? I'm Russian. You're Russian. I see. Yes. You have very nice eye contact. Do you understand this? No. Yes. Okay. You are going to a photoshoot now, yes? No. No? You just dress like this always? No. Oh, cool. You're interesting. Thank you. Yes. What's your name? Anna. What is it? Anna. Anna. I'm James. Where are you from? Australia. Oh. Yes. And why are you in Hungary? I'm studying. Do you... Are you new? No. Like, when did you come here? Oh. When two weeks ago, okay. Welcome. Yes. Do you do you know people already? Would you like to know me? I'm very friendly Okay Let's get a cup of tea sometime because I have to go to work But we can have a cup of tea and we can use Google Translate good idea You have a whatsapp What do you what do you communicate most? What's up Viber Instagram But you will reply to me When I write to you, you should be right back You're so sweet Are you a little bit shy? That's okay. I was shy before Now I'm different Okay, we can have tea soon nice to meet you bye-bye Wow, this is like so like Unwavering eye contact but terrified but like so shy and just bits Russian, right? So she's just like I'm still a Russian even though I'm shy and I'm like, are you shy? Yes Do you want to meet? And she's so look like she was all dolled up like she's gonna shoot you're going to modeling should know I always this That's very weird I think I have a date All right, but that was okay. So that was like an example of like She spoke like ten words of English like almost nothing. All right, so so as good Hi hard stop She stops and I told like open and she didn't know what was going on and I had to and I and then I really Softened my energy because I could see she was like very shy, but she was there All right, so I really then I slowed everything down. I made the length language very gentle I didn't like, you know, if I'd said are you uncomfortable or whatever later on when I at the end? I said you're a little shy and she said yes, like it was really about matching her energy you continued in English just Simple but it's what's happening internally. I'm ice. I look like a watch watch me. This is me hard This is almost no change my face, but you can feel a difference This is like the superpower shit. All right, because it's like yeah, don't you because you're like, oh, okay So you spoke slower and use and it's up. Yeah. No, I was wondering also about the language, right? Yeah, but but for the language fuck the language It happens through this is this is the deeper level stuff The reason why almost every girl I speak to even unless she blows me off is because I don't speak English Every girl I speak to if unless she blows me off straight away feels comfortable with me is because I'm Doing this thing inside where I'm like, okay, I'm at sure with cheekiness and fun or in this girl I'm like, I'm safe and I'm really there and I'm warm and it's chill with me All right, or it's like, okay, you can handle it. I can push the banter more and what comes out. Yeah, okay Obviously, I'm way better at saying things because I've said lots of things many many times but the but the margin for error that I have with what I say is massive because my intent is Is readable Yeah, and it so I can tell that from 10 meters away Yeah, so and like look that's a practice It's just as much as going and doing the saying and the running and then stopping and it's up It's just as much a practice. It's like I'm like I'm here with you, baby Yeah, and I'm and I've already let you go So I don't I don't need anything from you we can we can spend forever or never and it's okay And then she much more likely wants to stay did I just do a weird rhyme Well, it's weird a steady coach Hi there, sorry, I just wanted to tell you that you look awesome Why are you going so fast? Can I walk with you now, but I will just slow you down by my What What no, what? Huh too fast too too stressful too fast. What are you talking about? She said yes like you can walk with me She said yes like you can walk with me and then you left are you an old man you could keep up I can Okay, it's not like if I'm moving fast. Okay walk with me walk me fast. I Feel I feel ridiculous. No, no Let me keep walking fast, but let's chill so What's where you're in such a rush for me? I can move fast, but communicate Like I don't have to go. Oh, all right. We're moving faster. We have to talk fast. It's just like, all right Let's relax as we move fast. Yeah, and now let's slow down What's up, I love you Well, this is a serious-looking trio you guys all together your secret agents what's going on can I have your ice cream no, ah What am I doing spreading out some Joy and fun and positive vibes. Yep It's free for me to give away and it makes I mean I get something out of it immediately. I feel good You know, they feel good because they can see that like I'm not trying to give I'm not trying to get anything out of those Interactions right except when I wanted to get the child's ice cream. He said no You see the results right it's like it that that little one minute there Spread good feelings to a bunch of people and And some people and maybe the girls with the love heart. I didn't see men. We went. Yeah, you're weird I don't know. I didn't notice and then I just feel like I'm this is my lounge room What's up? Let's walk like models. Let's walk like models Yeah, bitch bitch Now we can't use this bit because then Eminem it'll like if I can make put a copyright claim on us, right Replacing this with generic rap beats. This was not a song How's the food it's good Excellent we'll be back hard for people to resist right? Yeah Excuse me lady. I can tell you in a rush. I can tell you're late But you look beautiful What's the rush You have to go to work and you're late, okay, what do you do for work? What do you do for work? Restaurant, okay, you're almost there Okay, well I'll go with you and then I'll turn back. Okay What's your name? Nada Sebastian nice to meet you. I know it's strange. Don't be don't be scared. I'm not crazy So you're a waitress You work as a waitress And what do you do in the restaurant No, you're just very good I find that You serve the clients at the table In the bar, okay are the clients nice to you Yeah All right, I can see this is strange for you I don't want to hassle you I'm gonna go for a coffee at some some point You want to change come let's change context and we can write No Bye. Bye Much better like not an easy set at all All right She's in a legitimate rush and she speaks very little English But the energy the open with boom hit it and she was like, oh, okay And then you went along and then she was talking to you, even though she was really really in a rush I realized that changes everything well, it's not the it's the But you have to be you have to go all in otherwise they don't well Especially on a girl who's like moving hard, right? Like I don't need to go all in on on No, no, if you want to stop something, excuse me. Hi. Oh It's okay, I don't want anything Okay going all-in on that girl, well she was freaked out by that one anyway, so good much better energy Like good that when when you asked her about okay what she's doing she didn't really understand you rephrased it Which meant that she kind of understood it. She's like, you know, I couldn't even say that she works behind a bar but then at the end When you said I can see this is making you uncomfortable or see this is it's it wasn't All right, I can see this is strange for you. I mean life's uncomfortable Life is discomfort all the time. We're all uncomfortable all the time. So that's okay It's that it's it's was that she didn't understand that was really the only issue there I mean, maybe there was another issue but you could say I see this is difficult to speak English. Yes. Yes Okay, we meet for tea and then Google Translate and then she may have said no anyway but it's We don't need to make it more difficult by going. Okay, this is uncomfortable for you. It doesn't it doesn't really help Let's just just say, you know, it's just like you as you did you pre friend there He said I'm not, you know, I'm not crazy or I'm whatever. How have you said that? Nice to meet you. I know it's strange. Don't be don't be scared. I'm not crazy And and then she was like, okay cool. Can I walk walk with you? Yes, so it was that was good. And then at the end, I mean it may not have made any difference anyway But just to I got the idea. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. That's good, man. Getting better. Thank you. I Really I feel the difference It's crazy in my mind because I'm trying to approach since almost a year and I did half ass Did it and did not do it so it didn't get many results. I thought the big thing is the approach anxiety the so-called and I thought that's the main thing we're gonna work on on this workshop and They're in pro approach anxiety was done and was gone in like what half an hour first day Okay, that's not a thing anymore. You can basically approach anyone Yeah, as I said people because a bunch of you guys like I just need to get over them Like the thing of being afraid of talking to strangers and like and then what what else do you want? And what else is there because it's there is much more to it than okay If I just can't go and talk to a girl then doesn't magically solve everything. I mean you have to do that Obviously, it's the thing that without that nothing else happens And then we start getting into the the real game the real nuance the real art of connection Which as you're also saying as you've seen, you know, because you've prepared in advance You had sort of research what we what we do or what we appear to do like many of the other guys sort of spitting Out Tino lines or you know having a repetitive kind of process and then I mean that that can still gets results in the sense That you'll get something but it's then you're just crunching the casino, you know just playing playing the odds whereas these these Little aspects and nuances that people don't see on the videos or even if they see them There's a very big difference to experiencing them and or experiencing me doing it in real life you can you know if you can feel the actual energy between me and you or between me and a girl or and you can Feel the difference when you do and don't do it as well. So yeah, this is the last night. I watched another In field video of you, I think it was in Barcelona and I looked at it completely different than before the workshop I saw so many different Things that I didn't even realize before. Yeah, and that's that's common the guys because often my stuff's not fancy like I'm not saying some Incredible lines that people like oh what a zinger and say sometimes people go. Oh, what's with this dude? Kind of just says normal stuff and maybe it's because he's got a hair nice hair or something and used to say well now You've got a more educated eye. You're like, ah, I see what he's doing there. I did a bit of that Yeah, you don't know what you don't know. Yeah All right, let's get it let's go know some more stuff Yo, hi, how you doing you look cool. Yeah, what's your name? Pia Pia Pia with a B. I'm a James with a J. Yeah, where are you going now?
