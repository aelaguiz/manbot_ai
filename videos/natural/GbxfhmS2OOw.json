Open your legs now. Nice. That's one in. One in. Okay, so welcome to your first bondage class. So today we're going to be using the silk tie, which is a deceptively simple but very multi-use item. So you all have one. It basically is pretty simple. It just has two loops on the end, which allows us to do all the fancy tying arounds that we wish to do. What's good about this as a BDSM tool? Feels nice. I'm off on a date. I'm ready. Yes. It doesn't look scary, so it looks cute. But I can do almost anything, any restraint that you've seen, you know, neck, wrists, tying to things and many others you can do with this. So it's very easy to introduce to a new lover. Like someone who's never been tied up before will usually happily play with this. So the first thing I want you to be aware of with this is that we want to use it as a sensual tool. Right. So I'm not with any of these things. I don't want to think of it like tool separate from woman. Right. Because if I'm there, I'm just doing my things. You know, I'm not really not really present with her. It doesn't feel sexy. It feels like this is a mannequin that I'm doing something to. As I'm starting to apply this, it's sensual from the beginning. Right. So even if I'm just placing it around her. Right. There's a whole lot of nice sensation that feels good. Yeah. Right. So just that part of it is sexy. Right. I don't even have to do any. Come here. I don't even have to do any rope tying to for it to already be a restraint. So I can start to imply the restraints like so. Right. So if I'm saying come here, she knows what to do. So the first thing we're going to start with is this neck tie. The way we do it. So from here I have contact. And so from here we have that. And getting this this moment. Which is a sexy thing to do. All I'm doing is this. Right. So I'm not yanking at it because I mean I could break her neck if I did that too hard. Which would be very bad. So I'm just there and it's like that. Or maybe I'm going to do it like this. Lift your hair up. And the slowness of it allows me to do it properly. And with certainty. I want to be aware of how this tightens. Now if I go to this side now I'm tightening it around her throat. Whereas if I go to this side I can put pressure on it. There's no pressure in the front of the knot there. In the middle it's going to create tension around the neck. Which feels nice. Right. So like this is a type of choking really. It's a compression around the throat. So I mean some women don't like anything around their throat. Most do. So having a bit of tension on there is all right. And then you're going to lead the woman just by saying it. And with your eyes as well. And then what I want you to practice is moving it around to the back. I'm going to practice just maneuvering the tie around her neck in different directions. Getting her to come over here. Go down on your knees. Stand up and I'll put a little pressure. So she gets the sense of where I want her to go. And I'm additionally using my vocal commands and my icon. So don't walk until you get the command. Come here. Stop. Go down. Look at me. Stand up. Like it's dominant but it's gentle. All right. So now we're going to look at two harnesses. So we'll start the one from the back. This is one you'll use most often. So the way this works is I reach around and I take the tie. Now turn around. Now what I've done at the back here is I've created this little L. And that's important. If I have it over here it will mess the tie up. So I put it right in the center of her body. Then I wrap the silk around the waist. And I just pop it over the top. And then I pull down. This right now is good because the pressure in the knot is here. It's not so much in the neck. So even if I pull that tight, which is quite a dominant move, and it feels sexy, the girl's all packaged. But in that way I can have a startling kind of knot. Now we can do that from the front as well. So from here I reach around. Now I've created the L at the front. Just over like so. So it's the same tie. I've just done one from the front and one from the back. And when I'm removing these I want to be aware of, again, being comfortable for her. So I take the pressure off the knot. I open plenty of room because what I don't want is this. Sorry. This. Yes. Sorry about that. You don't want to be scraping the front of her face. So you want to create enough room that it just comes off like so. Cool. All right. So grab a different partner. This one doesn't matter what size you are or she is. And have a play. All right. So now we're going to create a wrist cuff. Hold your wrist. Hold your arms out for me. Hold your hands out. Okay. Okay. So if I want to create a wrist cuff, very similar and simple. Pull it out. Okay. So there we have her in collars, in wrist cuffs. So you can do whatever you want with that. And then we're going to add another cool thing. So lift your arms up. And then you're going to put your back harness on her as well. There you go. I often do it like that because I get a little bit of the impact there. Okay. So and then I'm going to run it once under. That's enough to, I mean, maybe if I really want to make sure the restraints clear, I'll put two. All right. So now she is quite. So now I could tie her onto something. All right. Come here. Good. Plenty I can do with her from here or here. Better probably. Okay. So very easy bondage without needing complex ropes and, you know, don't worry about knots. Just that. Yeah. Cool. Excellent. So that would be great for, you know, a flogging or a thanking session or a humiliation session. Get the girl on the knees. So on all fours. Yeah. So on your hands and knees. Yeah. So usually when I'm first applying it, it's, I'm usually doing it from here. So if I'm putting the neck harness on from behind, what I want to make, what I'm going to do is, I just had a tilted joke on me. Good. If her head's down right now, it's not so good because I might get it over her nose or eyes or something like that. Right. So I'll usually just say, lift your head. Right. And then I place it over. So I know that I'm getting it around her neck as opposed to around her face. Okay. And then, so from here, we've got our neck harness. Okay. From here, you can practice your, this is most commonly how I'm using this. It's awesome. I can do it with one hand. She's completely tied up and restrained. And I don't, I can just hold, I can, you know, you're still doing stuff here whilst maintaining tension there as well. Right. And then the other cool one we can do from here is this. Yeah. Which is hot. So let's say I, I'd have, you know, I'd applied that here. Essentially I can do the same thing here. Like so. Okay. Like strong physical restraint and pussy stimulation. That's awesome. And simple. All right. So the simple one hand restraint here. So a good thing about these is they're easy to get in, easy to get out. Now, when right now she's putting her body weight on one arm, which is fine for some time, but it's not a, it's a distress position, right? So there are certain sexual positions or BDSM positions, which are really good for moments of high intensity. But if I leave them there, that it gets really uncomfortable. This is one of those. And you see how I like I'm guiding her hand. So she knows what I'm doing there. All right. So then I'll hold it in this position for some time and I'll hold my teeth just for, for theater. Okay. So we can also do this one, two hands against it's distress. So right now her body weight is on her neck. All right. So we won't stay there long. If it's on a bed and a pillow, we can stay longer, longer, but it's still just for hard intensity fucking for this moment of complete dominance. And then I'll release it. Okay. Okay. I've learned a number of these setups. Open your legs now. All right. So this is great for everybody. So lots I can do here, you know, spanking, fingering, fucking. Now I can get it to come up on the knees. All right. So they can have her in that position as well. All right. Cool. And then to undo her is as simple as that. Like that will be a memorable moment. So you do that without like a quick, you have, you're not explaining to her what's going to happen. That's a surprise. Yeah. I would usually do that with a girl that's either knows she's coming to do a bit of the same thing with me or I've been, or I've been with her once. Yeah. All right. So she trusts me already. So she knows that what, even though she doesn't know what's happening right now, she knows that what, that I know what I'm doing. So ideally we, until the moment when she opens her legs, she doesn't really, I mean, she knows, okay, I'm being tied by the legs. What's happening. And then this moment. And then it looks, I mean, she looks fucking sexy, right? Especially with her gorgeous little legs. So then you tell it and girls like, you know, she knows she looks sexy in that position. And because as opposed to like, you know, trying to do the wrists as well, which is not much I can do. Someone's tied starfish. Yeah. I can flog her and I can finger and stuff, but it's not, I can't fuck her usually. And she's too restrained. And often girls will feel really uncomfortable being restrained by all four limbs, but having either both wrists or both legs. I feel like you could do with some time. Absolutely. Good. So lie down and just spread your legs. I want to do all the time. All right. So there's from issues tied there. And I can also, yeah, I mean, I can add this to it. Right. So I could then, yeah, like have full restraint, although it's very easy for us to get in and out of. So from here, cool. And I could tie that off. Cool. So then she's fully restrained and now I've got plenty of room to do whatever I wish. Gentlemen, James Marshall back at the farm. I just got back after an epic coaching week in Barcelona.
