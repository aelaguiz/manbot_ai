I'm getting the social retirement from, because everyone doesn't have a lot to do, I'm getting contacted by, and I contact a lot of different people, and I'm having really powerful conversations and reconnecting with people like David Tian, and Zan Perrion, and Hayley, and a lot of my high-level clients who've run Fortune 500 companies and whatever, they've got a bit of time now, so I can get on the phone and we're chatting and we're rekindling these things. I'm getting the retirement value of the social effort that I put in. And of course, once the doors open and people are allowed to move freely again, then I instantly have all the stuff that I wanted, whereas most other guys have to walk out and go, with their shopping bag and start going, and harvesting, and meeting new girls, and starting working hour for dollar, or hour for phone numbers. So if you don't start planning for your social retirement, and what I mean by that is not when you're 65, it means any time I don't feel like going out and approaching girls or I want to just chill at home and read books, I can still be getting the benefits. I can take breaks from all that stuff, I can do nothing for long periods of time, and it still keeps yielding. I would say that's a more effective, more fun, and a better way to run your seduction life and your social life than just going out, meeting a girl, bring her into your life, and then she stays or leaves, and then you lose her. Or friendship circles. I have my five friends that I've been friends with since whenever, and occasionally I meet a new person from a new something, but it stays pretty static. So when the music stops, what have I got? My five buddies. Maybe they're awesome buddies. I'm not saying you've got bad buddies, but there's only five of them and they're usually homogenous. Most social groups are the same type of guys, different personality characteristics, but all gamers, or all techie guys, or all into this type of sport, or all study this thing, or all into finance, or whatever. And so you only get the benefits. You can't leverage anything much out of each other because you don't have complementary skills. You have the same set of skills, or the same personality traits, or the same networks, and maybe they're awesome and you all benefit, or maybe they're just average, and then you just all get a very average return. And being friends with those people doesn't really benefit you much in terms of lifestyle engineering. I'm not saying that they're bad people, and they may give you lots of emotional support, and have great times, and all sorts of stuff, but I'm looking at more or less, not everybody, but most people in my life, there's some form of us backwards and forwards, throwing resources backwards and forwards in order to build something together. Not all, but most. And those are the guys that I trust and trust me. Those are the guys that will back me up. Those are the guys that I know I can borrow money off, or they can borrow money off me, or I can, if I need a favor, like on Sunday when I'm forcing Liam to film me having a threesome, I asked Alex, Alex, do you want to film me having a threesome? He won't do it. He's done his time. I was like, is it that hard to convince your employees to hold the camera while your boss fucks a couple of girls? Come on, what's wrong with these people? Fucking hell. You want a ping-pong table? Is that what you guys want? You want a ping-pong table? Okay, I'll get you a ping-pong table. The most effective and fun way to get what you want in your lifestyle, your dating, your social life, is not to have to do every single step alone. The hyper-individualist myth is something that I don't really think is the best way to do things. The best way to get what you want is to build a collaborator team, an x-men team of multi-skilled, loyal, and proactive people in your life that want to work on projects together so that everyone wins. And that's what I've done for you, is built this tribe, this network, the Lifestyle Design Academy, which is my most popular ever online course, is relaunching this Sunday, the 14th of March. It'll only be open for seven days, and then I'll be leading a select group of men through 12 months of mentorship as I help you to deconstruct your current lifestyle, do an autopsy on your social worlds, the people you hang out with, the way that you're spending your time, and then we, season by season, custom build for you the ideal lifestyle plan and put it into action. If you'd like to see a sneak peek inside this course, all you need to do is click the link below, put your email in, you'll receive a free video immediately. You'll also get an invitation to a private Q&A webinar where you can ask me any questions you'd like, and first access to the course coming this Sunday. See you in the next video."}
