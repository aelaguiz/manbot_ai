Yeah, I'm looking forward, who's looking forward to Miami? It's just like, oh, it's gonna be so good. \u266a\u266a There is a lot more flexibility in your reality than that old-school philosophies would suggest, because who was told at some point, if you don't go to university straight out of high school, if you don't, you know, find a secure, stable job, if you don't get a woman while you're still in your early 20s, that there are gonna be dire consequences. Yeah? I was certainly told that. What were you told? What was gonna happen? Failure, die alone. Oh, the shame of the family. Oh, that's a harsh one. You know, he's not even smiling. He's like, oh, that was serious. All right, yep. And that's, I mean, that is definitely, we're gonna be starting to look at, okay, how do we unplug from the matrix? And I'm going to be talking to you guys about some of the lifestyle design aspects of that. People who are interested in or curious about or planning to or about to step outside of that lane that was allocated to in order to try and carve out a different path. And I don't know if I'm gonna disappoint you, but I'm not gonna talk about seduction much this weekend. In the Q and A's, as much as you want, just fucking lay it on me, whatever you wanna know. But for me at this phase in my life, I'm so much less interested in that. And because it's my show, I'm gonna talk about what I want. And so I'm gonna talk about, and then if you don't like it, don't come back next year. I'm going to be taking you guys on a bit of a thought journey on what are the other possibilities in life? What are the other metrics for success and happiness that perhaps you haven't thought about, or you've kind of just assumed that would sort of figure themselves out? Because in the old dream, the old American, Australian, European dream of work, work, you know, get a job, get a house, get a chick, get some small creatures that share your genes, and then do that and do that. And then when you're 65, you can go to Miami for a couple of years and then die, and that's it. I mean, yeah, I'm looking forward. Who's looking forward to Miami? Oh, it's gonna be so good. What year will that be? 20 something, 50 something? No, I'm not, I'm old enough. That's soon for me, actually. I've only got 20 more years. Okay, so if we want to look at lifestyle design, which is essentially the theme of my talks, both of them, and overall this company, and it has always, he's like, yes, that does, I love that. It has always been the message of this company. We started out as two dudes trying to get paid to get laid to go out and pick up some chicks, but very quickly with the addition of all the different coaches, and particularly because we didn't just learn how to get good with girls and then go back to our nine to five jobs and have that on the side. All of us in our crew and our extended crews, which now extend into really bizarre networks across the globe, from the most highbrow blue blood to the lowest and weirdest, that constantly throughout the last 10 years of running this show, we have been working on our individual and our group, and then our intergroup lifestyles. And the truth is that the leverage and pleasure and advantages that you get out of that dwarf anything you can do from just learning to cold approach girls in the street. However, you must learn how to cold approach girls in the street. Because there are the people who've worked solely on lifestyle design, but they don't actually know how to go and engage and draw people into your reality, right? So essentially, if I wanna give you the most powerful formula for social success, it is the ability to be excellent, or at least competent at cold approach, and to be able to build, enter, and then negotiate between high value social groups. This video was filmed a couple of years ago, and my assertion that the world has changed, that your parents' and grandparents' strategies for success are no longer so relevant, well, that was an understatement. The truth is, if you want to succeed in the post-corona world, you will need to be nimble. You will need to be adaptive. You will not be able to do things the way they were done in the past. The guys that succeed will be the ones that band together with other men, use leverage, networks, correct intel, are willing to move to the right locations if their location is tanking, which many, many will. Let's be honest about this, economies around the world are going to fracture, and people are going to need to adapt. That's part of what the Lifestyle Design Academy is all about, which is coming in May. This is my template, my blueprint for how I've lived a completely free life, where I've got to do exactly what I want pretty much all the time, where I've got to network with and then become friends with very high-level operators, as well as the sexiest, funniest, weirdest, whoever I want to hang out with types of people, and that I get to have more opportunities than I can actually handle, right, which is a point that you get to in your seductive economy lifestyle, where you just have more choice than you need. For many men, they just don't have enough choice, and if you want to have more choice in your location, in the people that you date, in the type of work that you do, then all you need to do is click the link below, and you'll get the free full 90-minute lecture, which explains the foundations and the principles of my seductive economy method, and then stay tuned for the launch of my academy coming in May. It's gonna be epic. I'm gonna be coaching you in real time how to get through this shit, come out on the other side, and succeed. Peace. Peace."}
