What do I do with your card? You can message me, follow me on Instagram. What is your business? I'm a full-time model. Ah, I like models. Is that right? It was nice meeting you. Do you also have Instagram? Wait, before you go, how will I text you if I don't know anything about you, except you're from Ohio? Right there. Okay, you're a model, that's beautiful. No, my number's on there. But, are you cool as well? Yeah! Hey guys, it's Alex here. We're in New York City. Just had a 7-day workshop going. I, today, before we're doing this, I visited the Natural History Museum in New York City, which was amazing. I love science. I love the... There was one thing about the dark universe and one thing about the deep oceans and the human evolution. So, let's push the human evolution frontier a bit forward and talk to some chicks here. So, we'll see what happens. Excuse me, miss. Excuse me. Hi. Hi. You sound strange, you look so cute. Oh, thank you. Before you go into... Thank you very much, that's very nice of you to say. I just had to jump double to, like, no! Oh, thanks! What's your name? It's... Alex. Nice to meet you, Alex. Are you... Yeah, yeah. Do people call you... Mm-hmm, everyone does call me... Wow. Yeah, well, thank you so much. Well, before you go, I'll take one step back. What are you up to? I'm going to class. I'm actually getting food before I go to my acting class. So, I'm in a bit of a rush, unfortunately. Okay, I'll make it super short. Do you want to be an actress? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Are you a good actress? Yeah, I am an actress. I'm an agent and everything. I'm doing the thing. So, when I look you up, you pop up first. If I Google... Maybe, if you Google... You might find more, but yeah. Do you... Okay, now you're stressed, I understand. I will actually go as well. That's okay. Do you want to connect and we go for a tea sometime? I can't, I have a boyfriend. I'm so sorry. But it was nice to meet you. Thank you. I made you very happy, that's cool. Yeah, have a good day. Bye-bye, see you. The old jump before the store approach. One of my specialties. Shut up. Hi. Hi. You have such a strong presence. Oh, yes? And then you looked at me and I'm like, oh my God. Just you were walking, so yeah. What's your name? Alex. Nice to meet you. Where are you from? From Russia. No, no, it's based out here. \u041f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0442. \u041f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0442. What are you doing? I'm just chilling in New York for one month. Oh, chilling in New York? Where are you from? Austria. Austria? Oh, nice. So it's just like vacation? Just like hanging out? It is. More work, actually. More work? What do you do? Photography. Oh, okay. Filming. Perfect place for that. Other stuff. It's a bit confusing, whatever. What? A bit confusing? What do you do? Because it's every day something a little bit different. Yeah, that's true. That's why it's always good to, you know, to make photos and make videos. You always find something new. That's true. Even in the same place. Let's walk off the street so we don't get killed. What are you doing here? I'm going right now. I mean, I live here almost five years. And right now I'm just going to have a quick dinner and go to, listen, one of my sometimes one of the favorite bands when I was a little girl. So, yeah. By yourself? Yeah. I just like always go wherever. If I feel I want to go, I just buy tickets and I go. Yeah. So today's the day. I want to go. That's cool. I like that you don't give a shit. You're just like, I want to do whatever. Yeah. That's Russian, huh? They don't. It's just like, I think the city makes you do things like that. You know, when you work so hard and then you have a good time, you want to just like choose yourself. And like whatever your soul needs, you need to give it to your soul. Something like that. Very profound. Yeah. What do you do that is the hard work that you didn't do? Restaurant. Restaurant? I got the little socks, but I'm going to move from there. I want to move actually to the movie. I want to like make movies. So, you have your own restaurant or you work as Rachel? Oh, I wish I had my own restaurant. Life would be so much easier, I mean, you know. I just wait for it in the restaurant. Maybe one day I will own a restaurant. We never know. That is stressful, I guess. You have to be, especially in America, super friendly, right? They expect very good service. Yeah. I mean, I love my job. When I hate my job, I try not to come to work. It happens once in a while. Because I don't like to give bad attitude to people who came to have a good attitude. So, you call your boss. Hey, boss. Yeah. Today I'm really a bitch. I would be mean to my boss. Once I really called my dad and I said, like, I'm sorry, I can't talk to people today. He's like, are you kidding me? I'm like, no, I just can't talk to people. He's like, okay, feel better. See you tomorrow. So, the next day I was happy and I'm like, I'm ready. He just accepted. Yeah, it happens. I'm honest, you know. I didn't try to say I'm sick, I feel bad. I'm tired of people because it happens here sometimes. Of course. Too many people. It happens everywhere. I worked at Starbucks when I was younger for half a year. Yeah? And, yeah, I was very quick, not in my best mood anymore. In Austria? In Austria, yeah. They give you shit, you know, like, why did you put five pumps or four pumps? Yeah, that's true. I worked, actually, my first job when I lived in Moscow was Starbucks. I thought it's a job, like my dream job, but it wasn't. Because sometimes you think about something in one way and in reality... And then you do it and then you're like, oh, no. No, it's not worth it. I would just better come and have my own coffee, like, and drink it and enjoy it and talk to people instead of doing what I was doing there. It's like machine. Yeah, you are a machine, especially if you show that you are a hard worker. That's it. People start to use you. They get lazy because you know you can't be lazy. So you do your job, like, the best, you know? Exactly. It's good in one way, in another way, it's not good. Too many lazy people around. So you are one of those persons who even give 100% if it's like Starbucks or whatever job? Of course. That's cool. Because that's rare. Like, I feel I'm the same. Yeah? Like, even if it's cleaning or Starbucks or whatever it is, I give 100%. I'm not like, oh, this job is beneath me. Yeah, but this is what you choose, right? People make choices. If you choose something, so do this. If you don't want it anymore, stop doing this and find something else. But do it while you do it. Do it now. Yes. That's what I feel. Nice. Do you want to relax with me one day? Relax what? And go for a coffee and look at weird New York people? Yeah. What's your number? My number is... Wait a second. Like this? Yes. And you use WhatsApp or iMessage? I use everything. Okay. It's MA. You type it in. Yeah. It's pretty... Oh, shit. My name? Alex. Alex. Every time. Well, lovely to meet you. I like your attitude. Have fun at your band. Thank you. Nice to meet you. Bye-bye. Wonderful night. All right. Take care. Bye-bye. How to properly put on a scarf if you... If you know, comment in the comments because I don't. It falls off every time. We got a free t-shirt. We got a free Alex t-shirt. Hey. Sorry. Hey. I'm in a rush. I see. You walk really fast. You really stand out from the crowd. I had to say hi. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. Man, my name is so boring. Nice to meet you. I'm sorry. I wasn't in a rush. I was stuck in traffic. Okay.
