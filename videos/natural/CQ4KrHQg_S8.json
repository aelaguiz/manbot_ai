I received a funny email today from a man that said, Dear James, you're a very brave man to release your product on the same day as the Star Wars premiere. And I thought, that's a pretty funny thing to say. And then I thought, God damn it, he's right. All around the world, pretty much every single man on the planet is going to be waiting in line for the Star Wars premiere instead of sitting at home buying my product. Well, too bad. We're doing it anyway. We're doing the impossible, going up against Star Wars. And that's just the way it's going to be. Now, in the lead-up, I promised you guys some behind-the-scenes clips. And today's behind-the-scenes, inside-the-product clip is from one of the main lectures of the product. And it's all about awareness. And in this clip, I go into extreme detail about why awareness is so fucking important. And without understanding it fully, you simply cannot get good at seduction. Absolutely, it's impossible. And I'm going to teach you guys some very practical ways to use your awareness to particularly open in a much better way. So, it's up to you. You can either watch Star Wars, or you can get good with the ladies. If you want to be effective, what you need to understand is the first principle, which is the principle of awareness. Right now, everyone at home and in this room, please become aware of your left testicle. Just feel it. Just be with it. Ignore that pesky right testicle. Just be with the left one. Now, that may seem like a weird thing to ask you, and I had no intention of asking anyone to do that. It just popped in my head. But prior to me asking you that, you guys weren't particularly aware of your left testicle, were you? Most people are highly unaware of everything. Everything. They're unaware of their posture. They're unaware of their breathing. They're unaware of their physical space. They're unaware of the way that people respond to them. They're unaware of the tone and volume of their voice. They're unaware of their personal hygiene. They're unaware of the basics of style, and everything else. And as a result, depending on the level of unawareness that you have, your life will be shit. The more unaware you are, the worse your life. Because if you're unaware, for example, that you are holding your shoulders like this for decades, which most people are, and I was until I investigated it thoroughly, you will create a whole lot of chronic pain for yourself. You'll have headaches, you'll have sleeping problems, and you'll just look weird. The very action of simply learning how to drop your shoulders and relax into your body suddenly makes the quality of your life much better. Something as simple as that. And there's a whole bunch of these things that are going on in your physicality, in your mindsets, in your breathing, energetically with your diet, with your lifestyle, all this stuff that most people don't really choose or don't really think about. It just happens to them. And because they sit at a computer all day, they get in the habit of holding their arms like this. And because no one's ever really told them or they haven't really been watching carefully to see the way people respond to them, they don't notice that they stand too close every single time. And no matter how much of a nice guy they are, how interesting and whatever else, no girl's gonna give him a chance because they just feel like he's too close. Something as simple as that can fuck your dating life forever. And you can't really robotically learn that because if you have to think, alright, the optimum distance between a man and a woman on approach is 37 centimetres. You have to carry tape measure and then you're gonna have to allow for cultural variation and wind speed, which is gonna mess it all up. So the way that you learn what is the correct distance between you and a girl when you speak to her is by walking up to her and noticing how she responds. Does she lean back and take a step back? Yeah. Or does she seem reasonably comfortable with it? And that requires you to be aware. Does this make sense? The profundity of this? Yeah. So the way that I divide it is there's two types of awareness. Okay, so we have internal awareness and external awareness. Your external awareness is your ability to read everything that's happening around you. And most people are really shit at this. Particularly guys when they're looking at hot girls. Suddenly their ability to look at details diminishes. Suddenly it's just like tits and hair. That's all I see. Or some ass wiggling and everything else just gets blurry. Right? Whereas I, for example, I was on the Euro tour last year. And I was in a bar with a student. And we're walking through the bar, hunting, looking for girls. And I see a girl sitting by herself at a table. And she's got a glass of wine in front of her. And there's another glass of wine. And I said to the student, who's she with? And he's like, I don't know. I didn't see it. I'm like, who's she with? Look at what's going on there. And this guy's just looking and there's a girl. And he's like, I don't know. Maybe she's alone. I'm like, she's not alone. Who's she with? The ability for me to break down that situation meant that I immediately could deduce to a very high probability that she is out with her girlfriend. How did I do that? Anyone? How did I know that? Nope. Right. Precisely. A man would have a beer. Except for me because I like Midori. Yep. So, my guess is that it's a girl. And her girlfriend has gone to the bathroom. And there's two glasses of wine. So I'm presuming it's two girls. Which gives me a certain amount of information and tells me what kind of interaction I'm going into. So it is therefore relevant for one of us to go over open and prepare for the friend to come back. And then for the other one to come in and hopefully she's hot. And if not, then you fall on your sword and you talk to the less hot girl for some time. Turning off attraction switches. So, the ability to check that kind of stuff out means that your openers will be far more powerful. That you'll just be able to play with the social matrix far more effectively. I'll give you a few more examples. If you see a girl who's strolling down the street and she's walking slowly and she's looking up like this. Can you guys guess who she is? Sorry? A tourist. A tourist. She is absolutely a tourist. Because I guarantee none of you, except for unless you've taken some acid or something, don't walk through your own streets at half the pace as everyone else and look at the architecture. Yep. That just says she's a traveller. So, and I realised this one day when I saw this girl and I walked up to her and I said, that's a nice traveller's pace you have there. And she's like, oh yeah, I just arrived. And there was no resistance. There was no sense of, oh, I'm being approached by a man. Because I just got it. I just could tell, yep, you're a traveller. So, I can get into a very calm, casual, natural conversation with her because I took a good guess. On the opposite end of that, I was in Vegas teaching again last year. And we were in one of these horrific casinos, running around chasing girls. And we saw a girl who had a ponytail, wearing all black, flat black shoes. And she's rushing through the crowd. Everyone else is wondering around going, wow, how did they pay us this in chapel in Vegas? And she's just rushing through the crowd. Yeah. And I'm just grab one of the students and just hurl him at the girl as you do. And he runs up and I'm listening in on the microphone. And he goes and he's like, hey, excuse me. Hey, yeah, look, I just saw you. So, you know, which city are you visiting from? She's like, I don't have time for this and just runs off. Because what was obvious to me was that this girl lives in Las Vegas and works in a casino. Because she's wearing flat black shoes. She's got her hair pulled back. She's cute. And she's rushing to work. She's late. No one else in the casino was rushing anywhere. The casino has sapped everything out of them, including their soul. So, going up in that case, the only thing that would have worked would be to run up next to her and say, you're late for work, right? Let me walk with you. And I've done that kind of thing plenty of times. Seeing a girl rushing, working out what's going on for her by being observant. Checking out what she's wearing. Who she's with. What kind of expression she has on her face. How she's dressed. What accessories or things is she holding. Because that's going to tell you huge amounts about who she is and where her head space is at that time. So that when you go to engage in a conversation, you can make an educated guess about who she is and what's going on. \u00a9 The Bulletproof Executive 2013"}
