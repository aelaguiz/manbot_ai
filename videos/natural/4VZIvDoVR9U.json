What is my team? What do you think? Sadness is if not a weakness like because I've been you know reading quite a lot about pre in pre agricultural tribes and And like I always think that's a bit Reductive to just say that people back in the Stone Age had it all sorted out and then agriculture came and screwed humans up I think there's you know, it's more complex than that. Mm-hmm, but certainly Throughout the ages they have been rituals or processes for both initiation and also things like grief You know whether when a tribe would come and grieve ceremony like, you know like a ceremony almost or passages of transitioning from war coming back into peace times or you know that that like In various times and places humans had as a small as a group processes for moving through Some of the traumas of being alive because traumas were inevitable and probably much more so than they are today for most people anyway So what do you think? Like for anyone who's watching this who might feel a bit triggered in the sense of like Well, there's two grown men who are supposed to be you know mentors of men and they're talking about how they both go to therapy and it's like then it's it's like if they have that sense of like That coming close to those kinds of emotions even hearing about them makes me feel uncomfortable Maybe we can give them a bit of a different mental position on why that's even a benefit like Some men would be just like why should why would I want to face grief or like learn to cry or you know? I'm a tough guy. I'm a guy who gets shit done. I don't like to complain, you know I'm not one of those pussies that's gonna lie on someone's couch for three years and talk about my mother, you know So what do you think is like in terms of a practical or like more? Yeah pragmatic sense of what grief is for Mm-hmm. It's so part of it is the stigma of mental health and the stigma against therapy and a lot of achievers are in their grandiose phase or stage or In their kind of like narcissistic personality or narcissistic part and when that's happening then they can't understand why they would need to grieve and The only thing I've discovered is that it kind of have to wait until they present so there's some they come to me with some kind of thing that they want to fix or improve and Almost invariably that has to do with shame And the but well the belief that you're not good enough and that you need to change yourself in order to be worthy that you're not good enough the way that you are or were and that that is good enough for love specifically love and connection and When it comes to the grieving and the sadness that's necessary because what is being repressed is The grief over the incidents or those micro traumas as I call them Perceived traumas in your formative years that led you to that belief that you are not good enough that you're not worthy and In order to access those place those memories those times in your and those neural pathways We want to get more scientific that are associated with that time in your formative years So when a trigger happens and you get triggered and then you basically in a kind of PTSD Pattern you go back into that Anger or that sadness or that? Whatever the coping strategy was back then to achieve or to please or to be a joker or to be a rebel Those are all different responses to perceived micro trauma or perceived trauma in order to undo all those coping strategies, we got to go back to the original the source of that and What you should have been able to do, but you weren't able to do because you were a child is To grief is to see that that what was done to you either you misinterpreted it and your dad Didn't mean it like that Mom didn't mean it like that and you took it the wrong way and and you can grieve the the lost years and you can grieve how sad it was for this little boy to have believed that about himself or It really wasn't egregious wrong. That was meted out on you and that is sad and you have to go and grieve that But when you're a child what happened was instead of grieving it you said you stupid kid You got to be stronger. I'm gonna let this happen anymore And then you went into some other part another part of you arose to hide this wounded child and You said I'm going to now achieve in order to get mom your daddy's attention now because they're ignoring me When I'm this way and I can't be that way anymore. So I'm gonna exile that part of me Well, I think that's a part That's really profound like and I think for most men if they would think back over their histories now just as you're saying that I'm like thinking of Just like and it's particularly when you said like perceived wrongs Like I can think about things that happened to me where I was deeply offended and it really hurt me But it was just that some an adult was being a bit of an unconscious dick at that time You know wasn't like even necessarily the trauma was a objective truth although, you know, of course there are objective traumas, but that that that was something that then made me feel bad about myself and I didn't didn't resolve it and also that I definitely did Try to compensate by Yeah, like proving myself or you're being being a rebel or getting into drugs or you know All sorts of different things too. I mean, I don't want to be like draw two Simplistic correlations, but yeah, you can see how those things over life Definitely affect you and I and I certainly can see that with clients that they have Swung hard in a compensatory direction And I and I one thing like this line kind of occurred to me when I was working with one client a year or so ago, I Don't know if sometimes I have many most of the times when guys come to me there They have a level of self-awareness that they are know that there's something that needs to shift and there because of the fact that they've Come this far To actually ask for help. They're usually ready, but sometimes you'll get a guy who So so so unconscious of the thing that is that that is his schema But when I sometimes look at I'm like the only thing that is holding this man up is the thing that is fucking him up All right. It's like you can see that sometimes that people just put on these defense mechanisms of humor or of I Don't know ironic Fatalism or all sorts of other ways and it because it kind of calcifies into a character and often one that Is not so appealing because because it is a it is it is a mask of some sort and people perceive that as ingenuous"}
