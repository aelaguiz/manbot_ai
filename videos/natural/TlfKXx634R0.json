I'll say this is an extreme and I'll back it off. Rapport is for losers. Big statement. Yeah. If you are getting in rapport and finding, you know, trying to get in there with this great conversation, she's nodding her head, yeah. It's, you might marry the girl, so don't listen to me. Don't listen to me. She might be the beautiful dream and she loves you forever and ever. But in my mind, rapport is that nice guy energy of let's have an interview with each other. You understand what I'm saying? And there has to be mischief. Has to be a little bit of dirty spark in there where you're like, wow, look at you. Here's one from Sean. So you're both exceptionally good at connecting deeply on an emotional level with women. Do you have any advice on doing this well and consistently? I'm genuinely genuinely curious about women, but I still still sometimes have trouble doing this routinely. So yeah, what are your thoughts on that? The art of emotionally connecting deeply with women. You know what? People will read my book and think Ozan's this deep soul gazing guy. You know, he looks at a woman across the table and he looks into her soul. And I don't do any of that. That's not my spirit. I'm fun. I'm dirty. I wink at her and I'm thinking, are you my girl? You're my girl. I'm playful. I'm a hundred percent playful. You know, connection for me is the kind of curiosity I have for growing. Curiosity is a beautiful word. Remember curiosity. Curiosity should be actively chosen by you. Okay. But I'm not curious about her hopes and dreams unless she's my girl. I'm not curious. Now, if you have pets, I don't care about the small talk. I don't. I am not curious at all. Unless you're my girl. Then I want to know everything. All I'm curious when I'm on a date with a girl or I'm meeting a girl for the first time is are you my girl? Cause you sure look like it. I saw you over there. I was standing with James and I look at you. I see over here. You look like my kind of girl. There's something about you. I like why? So my whole curiosity is who are you? And why am I interested in you? Why am I attracted to you? Tell me. So I don't do like deep. I'll say this. I'll say this is an extreme and I'll back it off. Rapport is for losers. Big statement. Yeah. If you are getting in rapport and finding, you know, trying to get in there with this great conversation, she's nodding head. Yeah. It's you might marry the girl. So don't listen to me. Don't listen to me. You might, she might be the beautiful dream and she loves you forever and ever. But in my mind, rapport is that nice guy energy of let's have an interview with each other. You understand what I'm saying? And there has to be mischief has to be a little bit of dirty spark in there where you're like, wow, look at you. I don't know how else to say it. I've been trying to say this to men for years and they're nodding their head, you know, but you have to have a spark of, you have to have this little cheeky mischief, you know, a little, a little bit. You're, you're respectful. You're a good guy of empathy or you're, you're heartfelt, right? You've never hurt her and never say anything bad at the same time. Yeah. You're, you're a little dirty guy, you know, and you like it. And you like the girl to be a little dirty too with you. And that has to be expressed. And the problem is we are always doing soul gazing or just nice guy interviews. We ordered the wine and we sit there. So tell me about you. You know? Yep. Yeah. It's like more. Cause it's something that is often misunderstood. And I've, I was saying, I've been talking about emotional connection for years. And initially when I get guys in on workshops and we, we start to practice this in, in role-playing scenarios, we have, you know, girls come into practice and, and inevitably the first times that they practice connecting, it sounds like an uncle. It sounds like the uncle talking to the girl at the family dinner going, Oh, so what's, how's the university going? And what do you want to do with that? Exactly. And not, and not the right type of dirty uncle either. Just the like, Oh no, it's uncle. Uncle Arthur is going to ask me 10 questions. Yeah. I think it really comes down to much more real time experience of the emotions. And, and, you know, like I think, yeah, as you mentioned with this, with the kind of too much soul gazing is guys think that means some kind of life coaching, staring. That's a hundred percent correct. What does that mean to you? And how do you feel about life coaching energy? Yeah. It's not good as opposed to like actually living the energy together and bouncing things off each other, which as you said, you know, you don't need to know the facts of her life exactly to, to get a better understanding of her than someone who sits down and talks to her for an hour, you know, about all these details. Like my first thing I'll say to a woman in general is like, why do I like you? I saw, I was over there with James and came to why there's lots of pretty girls here. Why am I attracted? There's something about you. I like, what is it? I don't know, but I like you. Come here. Tell me a story. That's good. That's good. And that's many levels why that's good. Yeah. Yeah. It's differentiates her from her, from the rest of the crowd. It is a personal thing straight away and it, and it also encourages her to then qualify herself. And it's direct completely direct without like, Oh, Hey baby, you want to want to show me your boobs? It's direct without being uncouth. Right. Great. Right. Right. Yeah. Oh, back in the day when you could just say, Hey baby, show me your boobs. Gentlemen. Oh, it's a wintery cold day in Budapest. I'm just passing through here on my way back to Australia. Hope you enjoyed that last video with me and Zan Perrion about the dangers of acting like a boring uncle when trying to pick up girls.
