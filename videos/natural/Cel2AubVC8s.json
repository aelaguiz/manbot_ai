So that's the way she wants things to progress. Of course she doesn't wanna just like meet a guy in a park one day and then like go and have a drink with him that night and then go, fuck it, I'm just gonna have crazy wild BDSM sex with him. Of course the girl wouldn't want that, right? Wrong. The number one primary most effective metric when it comes to the thing that is going to improve your success with women is simply this. It is the number of women that you talk to. Nothing else compares in terms of any kind of action or behavior or mindset that is going to increase your chances, particularly in the early stages, right? So when I'm saying early stages, I mean the first year at least of you going from, I've never approached a stranger before, I don't have much experience with women outside that to okay, I got this, I can go and get a date today if I want to. So often men put way too much emphasis on any given girl and this is just as true of guys who are cold approaching as guys who are in the normal world because when men often start out doing this, what they do is they approach a few girls, right? On a Friday night, they might approach a couple of girls or every now and then throughout the week if they see an opportunity which seems really easy for them or the girls giving them signals, for example, then they might take it. And if you're meeting one girl a week, few girls on the weekend, you're doing almost nothing. Really, you're just relying then on chance. Sure, you may accidentally do the right thing and you may hit a situation where the girl just likes you and you may hook up with her. Cool, it's better to do something than nothing, but it's better to meet some girls than none. But if you want this to be a skill that is internalized that you actually have a handle on, then you have to be meeting girls all the time. This metric of going and meeting at least one or two girls every fucking single day is the thing that makes the difference. Now, of course, what you say, how you do it, how you analyze those approaches is very important as well. So you can just mass approach doing the same thing over and over again without taking the feedback and that will not improve you. In fact, that will eventually demoralize you. So I'm making a clear distinction here. It's not just the number of approaches. I need to be able to analyze the approaches, but without a density of approaching women, you will never get good at this. It's impossible. How can you be expected to get good at a skill if you repeat it once a week, a few times a month? So many times men fixate on a specific instance, right? So they go out and they try some of this and they talk to a girl and talk to another girl and then they get into a conversation with a girl and they struggle through it and they get the number and then she flakes. And then they spend fucking days and weeks hating on themselves or really trying to figure out exactly where did I go wrong or what can I send her now? Like what kind of flake busting texts can I use in order to win her back? Or it's like a situation where getting to an interaction and it's quite painful because she rejects you harshly or because you get embarrassed or you think you're getting somewhere and then you totally lose it. And then the guy will fixate on that as indicative of the quality of him, right? So you'll take that very personally and presume that this means that he's a loser or he's never going to get good at this or women always treat him like this or here we go again, my life always ends up like this. Making gross generalizations about himself and dating and women based around sample sizes of one or a few girls, right? So the truth is you can't make any conclusions about patterns of behavior. You can't get any true understanding of women unless you're meeting lots of them. You can't get good at the process of seduction or basing that around one or a handful of approaches, right? So it is vitally important to understand that all the other stuff, trying to learn how to do perfect conversation or dress perfectly, anything that goes beyond actually going and approaching girls, you're simply wasting your effort on it. Things I wish I knew when I was a young man is she wants to fuck you earlier than you think. This is a really important one to understand. Women won't tell you at what pace they need you to escalate on them in order for the attraction to maintain. Very rarely is a woman going to verbalize, okay, buddy, you should kiss me now or now's a good time to fuck me. I mean, it will happen occasionally and when it does, listen. But for the most part, women will not verbalize the way that they need you to seduce them. And a very, very common mistake is to assume that women want you to move at a very slow pace. And this is sold to us in terms of the North American dating model. Because in Australia, when I was growing up, people don't really go on dates, right? They sort of meet in a pub or through friends or whatever and they get drunk and then they fuck each other and they wake up and go, oh, I guess that's my girlfriend then. Whereas when I first started going to America, I saw that, oh, there is a culture here of asking a girl out, taking her out on one date, trying to kiss her on that first date, probably at the doorstep. Oh, don't do that, such a cliche. Then taking her out on another date, maybe a week later. And these are usually formal kind of dates where you're going to dinner or you're sitting opposite each other having coffee and you're talking about not very spicy or sexual topics, you're talking about your hobbies and your work and so on and so on. And then the second date, maybe you get a bit of a grope on the couch and then maybe on the third date, you'll have sex if you're lucky, if she really likes you. All right, so there's this common idea that that is what women want, right? So that's the way she wants things to progress. Of course, she doesn't wanna just like meet a guy in a park one day and then like go and have a drink with him that night and then go, fuck it, I'm just gonna have crazy wild BDSM sex with him. Of course, a girl wouldn't want that, right? Wrong. Because this is all tied in with concepts of the good girl and slutty girl dichotomy. There's a very commonly held belief that there are girls who do and girls who don't. There are good girls and sluts. There are the girls that you date and then there are those other party girls who only want cocaine and money and they fuck DJs or something like that. So that if you're meeting what you perceive to be a nice girl, right? It's because she's sweet and she has a job and I don't know, she dresses modestly or something, that that is a separate species, essentially. This is the type of female that doesn't like having sex instantly. She only trades sex for relationships and she does things in a very good way, in a proper way. And therefore, I need to treat her delicately and I need to move at a snail's pace and I probably need to verbalize if I wanna escalate. I need to actually say, hey, is it cool if I kiss you now? This is completely wrong. It's a complete misunderstanding of female sexual psychology of her arousal state. The truth is that pretty much all women are wired that if they're attracted to a man, they wanna be physically close to him quickly. Now, of course, that may not be the first night. I'm not saying that every woman wants to fuck you on the first date, but that's always a given. But that it is far more common than you expected. That she is very likely that if she had a fun time with you and she feels aroused and you've been touching, escalating on her, you've been flirting, you've been looking her in the eyes with clear intent, you've led her from venue to venue and you haven't sat and had a formal dinner and talked about your job, that it's very likely that she wants to get physical, that she at least wants to have a makeout. And so many men do not pull the trigger on a girl. They do not escalate until it is explicitly clear that she wants you to do it. And by that time, it's usually too late, right? There's so often, guys will go on dates with girls and they go on one or two dates and then it fizzles. I know pretty much 100% of the time, if I get a girl on the first date and we have a bit of vibe and chemistry, I'll sleep with her. If not tonight, the second one. I can fairly much guarantee that. Now, there's a big drop-off point in terms of my like, how many girls I approach. Let's say on a given day, if I went and approached for an hour and I met 10 girls, I might get four or five numbers. Out of that, a bunch of them will certainly flake, right? I may only get one or two dates out of that. But get me on the date, I'm golden. And that's because I had to go through the long process of understanding this clear mistake. I had a number of dates early on where I just waited too long, didn't kiss the girl until the end of the date or not even. And then when I try and see her again, she makes a polite excuse and vanishes. It's because you've got to look at dating as a story, as a narrative that's moving somewhere. And where is it moving? I mean, it has to, for it to be anything at all, it needs to move to intimacy. It needs to move to sexual attraction and to a resolution of this attraction, which is us fucking each other. Of course, unless the situation is that she's from a very conservative society or some religious thing where she has some other conditioned barriers in front of her that doesn't allow her to do what she wants to, in which case, good luck with that. Personally, I'm gonna leave that alone. It's way too much trouble for me. But if she's a girl who's just like allowed to do what she wants, then she wants to fuck you much sooner than you think. Do not put up with shitty behavior from women. Men are a bit dumb when it comes to getting laid. They will, if they think that they have a chance of having sex with a girl, they will put up with almost anything. This is unfortunate because it teaches women that it's okay to be rude and bratty and unattentive and to not invest. Anytime you have a girl who is high maintenance, who is really difficult to be with, it's the fault of all of the men, all of the men, men, men, who've come before you and rewarded her for her shitty behavior. It's not worth putting up with being belittled or treated badly or disrespected in order to get laid and it makes your chances of getting laid harder. So it's really important. And not only does it make it harder, it sets up a paradigm where if you put up with shitty behavior, especially in the initial phases of courtship, so you're going on dates with a girl and for example, she's teasing you constantly. Now it's okay for a guy and a girl to tease each other. That's fun, that's banter. But if she's the type of girl that always prods you, every single thing that you say about yourself, she always makes a disparaging remark or she's always trying to make you look like a fool in front of her or your friends, for example, which these can be common things. And they can come out in just little snarky comments, little passive aggressive comments, little rolls of the eyes, that kind of thing. If you put up with that early on in a relationship, you've set the paradigm. You've set the foundation for the way that the relationship will run. And it's very common for people to end up in relationships where one or other is subordinate to the other person based around accepting the kind of behavior that they don't like. I've certainly seen this with my friends, people who've been in three to five year relationships with somebody who never respected them and at the very beginning tested the guy to see if she could get away with certain things and saw that, yes, she could get away with it. And not only that, she was rewarded for it. Because that's a common thing. Women know that if they start crying or whinging or manipulating in some kind of way, often the guy will not only accept it, he will give her more attention, right? So I remember that, like one of my early girlfriends, the guys, like we'd be hanging out at home or whatever and the guys would come around on their bikes and like bang on the door and say, hey, Jamie, let's go out and smoke weed or let's go and fucking do something. And I go, all right. And then I get up to leave and my girlfriend would start crying and causing a tantrum. One time she even like cut herself in a dramatic way. It wasn't very deep. It was just like, hey, I'm gonna cut myself. And the first few times I was like, oh, okay, baby, sorry, sorry. Yeah, I'll stay. I won't do what you don't wanna do. And I, you know, and then she got rewarded by getting cuddles and looked after. And I quickly realized, hang on a minute. It's like, fuck this. I should be able to go out with my friends if I want to. I'm 19 years old. I'm not gonna stay at home all the time. So I just started saying, hey, look, I'm just gonna go. And one or two times she had a big tantrum and I said, all right, well, look, just you deal with that because I don't see that's a big problem. I'll be back in some period of time. And off I went. And then quickly she learned that having a tantrum was not going to get what she wanted. All right, so it's very important to understand that people will treat you the way that you train them to treat you. The same girl will be a totally bratty little shit to one guy and then will be on her total best behavior with another guy, depending on what he's willing to put up with, right? These days, I have very, very clear boundaries about the kinds of behavior that I accept from a girl. If she shows me clear disrespect, I call her out on it. If she does something that's really irritating to me and she knows that, I will make an ultimatum. I had a girl, beginning of this year, really hot girl, was very manipulative, knew how to handle men, had a lot of guys interested in her. One day she just pinched me really hard on the arm. I said, don't ever do that again. And then she reached over and pinched me again. Why is she doing that? Just because she's used to getting away with whatever she wants to. She's a little brat. She just likes seeing the kind of power she has. And then I said, listen, if you do that ever again, then you can just fuck off out the door and don't ever come back. We're totally done. She's like, what? Isn't that a bit overreacting? I'm just playing. And I said, well, to me, that's not play because I have to be able to have some kind of boundary. If I don't want something, I have to be able to tell you like you would tell me and that's my thing right now. So don't do it again. And then I stood there and I saw her reach out and I didn't flinch. And then I sort of just go, well, whatever, I'll do whatever I want. And a little bit later, we're in bed and she said, hey, were you really serious? Like when you said that, like you wouldn't ever see me again? I said, yeah, I'm dead serious because we have to have some kind of mutual respect. Otherwise, you're just gonna run right over me. I know you, you're a little shitty brat and you get away with murder with other guys. I'm not like that. So don't do it again. She went, all right. And then she never did. It's kind of simple Pavlovian training when it comes down to it. People will treat you in this way. If you accept shit behavior from people, it says to them, you don't respect yourself and it just gives them free license to do it. And it's not that everyone is trying to do awful things to you. It's just that often people lean over each other's boundaries because they're unaware, because they don't know that people find something annoying or they don't like it, or because in a woman's case, she might be really impulsive or emotional in any given moment. And so she's expressing herself. And then so often the man just backs away and puts up with her being outrageously needy or hysterical or demanding. A common one is accusing a man of wanting to do something other than being with her. So like if a guy's got a pursuit he's really into, he's got a passion that's really important to him, he's got work, he's got friends, he's got family, he's got other things going on in his life. And then he tries to do that. And then she's like, oh, you always do this or why don't you go? me enough attention, and then he is apologetic about wanting to have a life outside of her, then he is starting to capitulate his life to her. There's a cool story, I had a drummer in my band, great drummer, and he had this, he played in like five bands, he was a serious professional drummer, he taught drumming, drumming was his life, he fucking loved the drums, man that guy could drum. I remember when we were playing together, he had this girlfriend, and she was actually a musician as well, which is kind of weird, but they were driving home from a show, and she said to him, hey listen, I've been thinking, you're going out like four or five nights a week playing gigs, and you know, that's just not okay, because we're not spending enough time together, so you're going to need to adjust your schedule, and he like stopped the car, and he said, get out, we're done, and she was like, what, what do you mean we're done? He said, I'm a drummer, I live for drumming, there is no way I'm going to compromise and stop drumming for any woman on the planet, so if that's what you want, we're done, and she's like, oh, well, I mean, I just think, he said, there's nothing to argue about, we're done, and he broke up with her then and there on the spot, and I thought, that was so fucking baller, and I would not have done that. He was so clear about the fact that there was no compromise in this area of his life, I'm sure if she'd said, you know, can we spend Sunday mornings together or something else, he would have compromised, because he was not a rigid person, but having a woman dictate the terms of your life to you means that you're not a man, right, that you're not actually stepping into your power, and it is kind of a common thing that a woman can be attracted to a man who has a clear purpose, but then she can be, once she's with that guy, she can be threatened by that purpose, because if the man is really focused on his career or on his artistic pursuit or some area of his life that's really important to him, this makes him attractive because he's living in his truth and his power, but at the same time, it says to the woman, you're not my primary focus in my life, and so often a woman can either subtly or obviously try to pull you off that path, try to get you to choose the safer path and the path that's going to spend more time with her in a predictable area, in a place where you don't keep getting more attractive, because that can be threatening as well. Don't put up with that. You won't get rewarded for it in the long term, even if she's, you know, she stops crying and then says, oh, I love you, that short-term gain means that you are constantly capitulating to her needs, and they're not her primary needs, they're just her wants, and you won't have respect, and that relationship will not be healthy. Do not put up with shitty behavior from anyone. Tinder sucks. Waiting for a hot girl to enter your social circle and then try to be friends with her for some months or years and then make an awkward move on her and her say, let's just be friends, also sucks. You know what doesn't suck? Being able to have the balls and the skills to go up to a woman that you like the look of and make a good impression and ask her out.
