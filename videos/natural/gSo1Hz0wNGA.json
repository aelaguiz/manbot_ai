You can't both do it at the same time. All right. Gentlemen, what's up? James Marshall here. Why am I doing this? I never do this. James Marshall here reporting for the Portugal Lockdown Podcast. And today I've got a very special guest with me from the other side of the world, all the way from Miami, USA. It is the one, the only, Mr. New York himself, John Keegan. What's up, guys? Great to be here, James. Yes. Thank you. Great to see you. Thank you. Great to see you. And thank you for being here. Great to be here, James. Thank you. And thank you. Great to be here, James. Great to be here, James. Great to be here, James. Great to be here, James. Thank you. Thank you. Great to be here, James. What's up, guys? Great to be here, James. Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Great to see you. Great to see you. I was saying earlier that because my Mac is a bit fucked and I'm just hearing this kind of crackling version of you coming through, to me it's like you're a war correspondent from like 1942. I'm like, coming in from across the Atlantic, we have Mr. John Keegan reporting from Miami Beach. I'm over here. Things are not so bad, but could be better. So we haven't talked in like properly, not since The Great Escape, really, right? That's right. That's really the last time I had a great conversation, right? Right. So I just thought the first thing that we should do, because let's address the elephant in the room, or the Madonna on your wall, which is... Oh, yes. Yeah. What is the Madonna on your wall? Well, this is... I'm in the Mondrian Hotel, and after my Great Escape, I came here, because New York wasn't the place to go, and I only left a beautiful woman and a group of cool people in this amazing island in Thailand, and I left because of the situation. And I just didn't want to get... You guys made a great point, which is you don't want to get trapped there if everything goes bad. So I got out of there and I came here, and I'm one of the only people in this amazing hotel called the Mondrian, because they closed all the hotels and Airbnbs in Miami Beach. But this is a condo unit, and I rented it long term. So there's like me and maybe five other people in here who I purposely don't talk to. Even though they're trying to talk to me, I'm like, I don't know why you're trying to talk to me. Stay 30 feet away. Right. But the thing is, Keegan, because when you told me about this situation, my immediate thought was, this is a great like Hitchcock movie. It's got five people stuck in a huge luxurious hotel, and the staff is still there, right? Because they have to keep the place running. Yeah, they have some staff here. Yes. Right. So you still got the bellboy going around. So the bellboy could be in on the murder. And, you know, I've got the one cleaning lady, Chiquita, what's she doing? And then you've got you, John Keegan, you know, stuck suddenly in here. And then over there, there's a man with a monocle, and then there's, you know, there's like the spy or whatever. So you haven't interacted with any of them yet? No, I mean, I definitely, I interact with, there's some very pretty women that actually work here at the desk, and I do interact with them, with the mask on, whenever I go down there, I have the mask. As soon as I leave this room, I put my glasses on and the mask. But once I go outside, I just take it off. But it's just, I just, I just figure who knows who's breathing in the hallway. So that's how paranoid I was or how cautious I was. I think now over time, we see it's maybe not that. I actually thought when I first got here, like, is it going to come through the air conditioning? Is it coming through my toilet? You know, I was reading stuff you're reading online. Is it that some guy fart in the hallway and it's coming under the door? I don't know. Is this is this crazy lady on my wall? Is she if she have if I touch her, am I going to have it, you know, this kind of stuff. And you were telling me that in this that this is this hotel has a colorful history where recently a local governor was found passed out with a couple of gay rent boys and a bag of meth in the same building. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. The guy who lost the governorship by like two votes, you know, it was like the closest governor race in Florida history. And two months later, they found him passed out in one of these rooms in this hotel. You know, incoherent and on meth with two gay, basically escorts, male escorts. That's awesome. He took the the loss of the governorship pretty either pretty hard or he was just like, fuck it. Yeah. Yeah. Well, first he tried to he's married with kids to a woman. And first he tried to deny it. And then he said, Oh, and then of course, he checked himself into rehab. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Rehab check. Yeah. Rehab. Redemption. All right. Cool. So do you want to just talk because you you glossed over what was quite an exciting story, which is that you were in Copenhagen, Thailand, right? Yeah. Copenhagen. I was there for two months. I still can't say Copenhagen. Yeah. Copenhagen Island. And then you were with Shay and his girlfriend and and Dominic, you know, that's his real that's not his real, you know, what we call him. Yeah. Right. Dominic. Yeah. Our BDSM friend. Mentor and interesting personality. Very interesting. Everything Dominic says is like literally, it's like this guy needs to have a staff of writers around him all the time capturing it and make just turn it would turn into an instant hit series. You got to get him out to Hollywood. Yeah, exactly. Every word he says, every word he says, it's like, I mean, he doesn't even know he's saying it. That's how good it is. Yeah. I know you. I'm always reeling in awards. I'm like, Dom, did you realize? He's like, No, fuck. I don't have time for that. The next thing I knew, and then he launches into the next one. We can't even do it justice because we can't. Well, we can't do it justice, but just to give the guys an idea, for example, here's a guy who's a BDSM master, right? He's a BDSM master who, uh, yeah, to come to his home and, uh, and have them, have them do whatever they want to, you know, I mean, hardcore shit and, uh, he lives next door to his old parents who are of Mediterranean descent, right? So they're of a particular type of, you know, you know, they like having the olive trees and then the mama looks after the parents and the, you know, that, of that kind. Yes. And he's very close to them and they don't know what's going on over there, why he has so many friends coming in and out. But he's, you know, the best bit is that in the evenings at 7pm, no matter what he's doing, you know, you're there with him in the middle of some psychotic rant where he's explaining about how to use an arse hook tied to a pulley system, you know, with a gerbil fucking swing here or whatever. And then he's like, Oh, hang on, I'll be back. And he goes and he comes back and there's a plate of lovely Mediterranean food that his mama's cooked for him and he just sits down and he's like, Hey Tom, it's time for dinner. Oh, that's awesome. They have no idea what goes on next door. No, we don't. Uh, they don't. Yeah, we could keep going. We could, we could talk for three hours about him, but yeah, he's a character. I was there with him and some other people and I met a beautiful woman. I mean, stunning. One of the, of my life. One of the, one of the best. That's saying a lot. And we're at, we're there blossoming romance, what's happening. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Yeah. Now when, when Keegan says this, everyone says this, but I've, I've seen videos of this girl and what the one that he sent me, which was like, there was ones of her being gorgeous in other places, but there was this one where once she got sent back to her country, which I don't know if I should say, but wherever, um, yeah, which is, let's say it's a tough kind of Eastern European country. Um, she's then sends you a video of her out of the dacha, like out of the family kind of farm, trumps out in boots and this kind of like horse lady get up, you know, like a country lady get up and she has these two fucking curved, um, what are those not gherkin knives? She has these two fucking gherkin knives and there's this hole of fucking pine stuck in the ground. And then she just goes to work on it like a Ninja and just hacks the shit out of these fucking poles, spinning around, slashing, whilst wood chips is like spitting off. It was amazing. It was like, like, like what do you call her? Tomb Raider, Laura Croft. That's exactly what it was like. And then it's like, uh, and at the same time, she's, that's a bad-ass, right? And she's sweet and she's hot and she's fun and sexy and all that. Yeah. And we were having that and we both had that, you know, it's a real interesting story. I think in the history of time, you can imagine, uh, it's a world war, you know, the world went to war and world war one and people being torn apart and, and all of us were every single one torn apart from what we were doing. And there, there we were with like the pulse. They're going to lock the country down. They're going to stop planes. They're going to stop it tomorrow. Not now. And then they do. And you're like, Oh my God, they really fucking did it. They just blocked the country. That's it. And you're like, every hour it was changing. This country, this country. And it was like, we got to go. We got to go. Yeah. Because the thing was that me and, me and Dom were on this very early because we, he's deep into the like conspiracy rabbit holes and I'm into the like rationally dissecting those whilst listening to him and bouncing ideas. So he and I were ranting and raving backwards and forwards as we saw the storm clouds building. We're like, hang on a minute, where are all our friends? And we're like, well, there's a bunch of them over on an Island in Thailand. And there's, you know, where are we? We're in fucking Kiev in Ukraine. And we're like, what if stuff starts locking down, where do you want to be? And we're like, not Ukraine. And that's why I got on your case and look and, uh, Dom on your case to get the hell out of here. Now the real question is, are you a bit mad at me because I made you leave Thailand and you could still be there because some of our friends stayed and they're having a great time and you could still be there with your girl having this every day. And that's kind of my fault. You know, there was a moment when we were there and it was a bit like Seinfeld, you know, Seinfeld. I was like, or Larry David or something. It was there and it was like, Hey, you could be stuck here in paradise with this girl for months. But then I was like, yeah, but maybe I don't want to be stuck. I only know the best. See you. So, yeah, I mean, honestly, it has, it has been a hell of an adjustment, especially being alone in a time, you know, being alone somewhere in a time where you can't meet anyone. And, and even the people I know here, nobody wants to go out of their house. So it's like, uh, yeah, it was a hell of adjustment because I really was relaxing in a paradise situation and really enjoying myself. Um, yeah, and those guys, even though they're on lockdown to a lockdown, there's totally people are, the vibe there is still high, you know, so I'm sure it could be nice, but I think, uh, everything's working out. Everything's working out. Yeah. Well, look, reality is this thing's not over and it's, I suspect the worst is to come in some wave down the future. So I think there's going to be a lot of more adjustments for all of us as time goes on. And that's what I want to talk about actually, because thank you for the catch up and guys, I hope you enjoyed just, that's just like a little fraction, glimmer, fractal of a piece or of the day in the life of John Keegan. It's a, it's a great ride, but that brings up an interesting point because I suspect you don't have many regrets. No, I mean, we have regrets about things we should have done or like we shouldn't have bought that stupid Bitcoin thing that we did, or we should have sold when it was that, or we should have something or whatever, but overall, yeah, but yeah, okay, all right. I mean, I bought it even after that, when it went up again, I always buy at the high. Even just like seven months ago, I bought it at the high. Keegan's, Keegan's, buy high, hold, hold, buy high and just hold. I don't sell though. So maybe one day, you know, I'll pay off. We'll see. We'll see. That's one. I think that's, if anyone was to ever ask me financial advice, I would say allocate 5% of your net worth to just gambling. And then they're like, what about crypto? And I'm like, put that under the gambling bit. Exactly. 5%. You're right. Yeah. All right. Well, anyway, the point is, aside from a few fuck ups with, well, a number of fuck ups, I was thinking about this when I was out digging the other day, I was thinking, what makes a good lifestyle? And I thought, is it that, you know, you don't make mistakes, you don't do these fuck ups, you don't get into messy relationships, you don't get into that business thing that ended up blowing up in your face, you don't travel to some place and then it don't work out. And then I thought, no, because you're going to have to make mistakes and you're going to have to fuck up. So what would be really good is if the mistakes were enjoyable and interesting, and or interesting, right, then it's still worth it. Because like when I think back over, I've done lots of dumb things in terms of business or in terms of a friendship or in terms of with women. But even when I had some messy, crazy thing with some psycho chick, I was having a great time. I was banging a hot chick and going on a wild adventure and having a screaming match with this like hot chick when she was 23 and she was like, fuck you. And you're like, well, fuck you. And I'm like, I get to do this? Cool. You know, but with all the, with all the shit that that entailed. Now obviously if I repeat that same thing over and over and over again, then I just screw my life up. But it's like, I think back and I'm like, a lot of my mistakes, it doesn't, it's not I'm saying that I should have done them or a lot of my dead ends were still great adventures, right? Like, and would you say the same? Because I, you know, I know your life story pretty well in terms of you made a lot of mistakes or went down dead ends or had something that you really wanted, but it failed or how to, you know, a girl you love so much, but then she ended up fucking ripping your heart out with a spoon or whatever. But it's like, would you not want that? Like, would you not want to be in that story? Well, yeah, that's, I mean, you're a hundred percent right. And I think that's the, you use the key word. Both of us have great, amazing stories that people, other interesting people are riveted by. Right? So not just like some bored, boring person's like, wow, that's interesting. But people who've lived life are like, wow. Even though the story didn't turn into, hey, look at my Lamborghini and look how rich and look at me. I'm Gary V or whatever. It's this amazing, you know, it was a life journey. And I know for me, a lot of those stories came from, because I wasn't even concerned about a worldly success. I thought it was assured to me somehow anyway, but it was more just, it was more, I was more interested in the emotions. pursuit or the I always was especially when I was younger or even now I would just say I've always been a romantic so I was following the impossible to me that's you know I wanted to be an actor for a long time every romance I had anytime I really fell in love when I look back it was because it was impossible not something impossible. You needed the drama to create the theater of your life. Yeah and to overcome some crazy fucking obstacles like when I was 20 I fell in love with a French girl for the four days I was in France and then I then I moved to Paris with no money and no job and don't speak French and no visa whatever no way work papers and I moved over there and into her apartment which was the size of a shoebox and three weeks later we broke up and then she left and I stayed in her apartment for the rest of the summer. Heartbroken, heartbroken you know but I had her apartment. You got to have that summer heartbroken in Paris because you'd met this French girl and she'd broken your heart and then you were the down-and-out in Paris. Right and I wasn't like Gary Vee at home working my dad's liquor store 60 hours a week that wasn't my story my story was more like I was which is his story is great but my story was more like that I was following my joy following my bliss following my emotions following that especially when I was in my 20s you know. Yeah yeah well look there's definitely there's a trajectory of time and you've got to think about it like well actually you don't have to people don't but it's like starting let's say you as a man you start the life in your 20s more or less and you know much earlier what are you gonna do and if it's much later well then you're really being stunted if it's if you're not really becoming independent moving out of home you know fending for yourself having some something you're doing in your 30s well then you're fucking things up and or if you're able to do it down and out and be a bum musician graffiti artist who also gets by by fucking selling DVDs at the local construction site or whatever cool but it's like if you haven't figured out a way to manage your life whether it's on a small level or down a hobo level or a boss level then you're fucking things up but it's like the 20s and then into the 30s is the time when a man actually should have the luxury to explore to fuck up to go on adventures that in a way lead nowhere in terms they didn't give him a degree or they didn't give him some certain amount of money but they gave him that great love or that adventure where he got ripped off in Mongolia or that time when you know he started that prog rock band that got so far which taught him this thing but then it all fell apart or you know all the other mistakes or wandering pathways that when you're a family man who has to work 70 hours a week to pay the bills the mortgage and keep the wife up and look after the kids and at the same time keep up with the Joneses and and keep a stiff upper lip and never show weakness and so on when you're that guy you know you're never gonna have that time ever again to be a guy that wanders right yeah and and really I think the key word is it builds character that's how you build character because you find yourself and you're also like you know and I don't want to limit people by their age either like you should always go out and be exploring your bliss and your joy and not be confined by because I know one thing I owe a voice I often had in my head all my life even when I was a teenager oh I'm too old to do that for some reason I was already too late to start you know although there's always that idea like I should have started playing the guitar if I'm 18 let's say when I was three like that guy over there who's a genius you know I'm like oh it's too late for me it's always too late I don't think it's ever too late for you for us to follow and get and just start getting into something that we want to get into and and not think about the outcome it's only when we think about outcomes and comparing ourselves that we stop living life all those things build character and and they make you who you are and adversity makes you who you are like you know like the years that I lived in a hoarder's lair you know like we talked about before you know like that's that we've been rotting in group houses and we're in tiny shoebox with a psycho girlfriend and with a band out in out in the suburbs in someone's garage trying to make it in the city to living in it in multiple Airbnbs all around Europe constantly on the road Jesus what fun we had yeah we had a great time I mean what amazing times like we were talking before the call we were talking we were talking about the Serbia days you know the Belgrade days the early early 20 teens so beautiful really I mean now you look back because there's space and that's the thing about it this is when you're in something you just don't oh you don't just say oh next year it's gonna you know we all have plans and dreams and goals but it was we were living something awesome at that moment and it wasn't like I can't wait to get somewhere else it was like I can't wait for the next one I can't wait for next year I can't wait to come back but it ran its due course that you know and other things were working on will too and they'll evolve in this and they just we just keep evolving but it's when you really look back it was like a beautiful time and then also from where we were in our own way of seeing the world and what we wanted to experience and we wanted to experience the women there we wanted to experience the culture there we wanted to get to know people we wanted to to make friends there we wanted to dance on a table and have a trumpet band going down it and with the Serbs going hey you guys aren't faggots after all okay I was there I was there at that time that's right and it was like we were in the Soviet Union it wasn't anymore but it looked like it right that's what it felt like and we got to be experienced that but it was also like that it's actually the crossing point of you know where you've got ex-Yugoslav communism mixing in with capitalism mixing in with fucking Eurocentric stuff mixing in with American fucking hip-hop like these those are those those first points where all these memes would be hitting right and we were we were we were and are often at the forefront of where that's happening in the world you know in terms of how we how we've designed our lives right because this is something that you and I I think more than most people and there's there's only a few of us that I know that live like this and of course like whenever I'm talking about this I'm I realize not everyone is gonna be a traveling dating coach not everyone's gonna be a traveling digital entrepreneur it's not like we're advocating this one tiny niche lifestyle where you know you you get to move from apartment to house to whatever and live these cool lives right like that's a choice that of a type of work that we've chosen we're also there's luck involved you know there's whole lots of things that meant that we got to do this and not somebody else but the principles that we've used are applicable to people because I always I used to bang on about this before Corona so much you know how guys take advantage of the fact that the world is a global village you know take advantage of the fact that especially if you're in Europe you can pop over to another European country especially if you're in America you can you can get down to South America not too hard or you know go to go to New York or go to a cool city you know it's like once you have a basic level of you can pay your rent you can pay for cheap flights and you can stay in whatever level you can afford and you've got your wits and your charm about you just like you rolled over to Paris with no money in your pocket just your balls in your hand and and the love of a woman and you were gonna make it work and it didn't fucking work but it fell into a funny something and you'd made it sort of work and then you went home you know same when I went to India when I was 18 ended up getting kidnapped by jewel smugglers went on this insane adventure where I you know got deeply involved in the Indian mafia whilst getting ripped off and jerked around whilst having a cool time getting smoking opium and going to parties and helping them ensnare other people into their trap and all this other wild shit that ended up costing me all my money was one of the greatest stories of my life at 18 years old I was in India doing that you know as opposed to what you would be told you should be doing at that age or a 21 or a 24 or 28 is that you should be on track to probably avoid as much adventure as possible really and just and go I mean okay or have it in certain doses that's four weeks a year or whatever it is but it's like that vagabonding that down and outing that like being a traveler or an adventurer even it doesn't have to be all over the world it might just be in your own city even but better but but seeing that there is the option at this time and place in history or there was up until very recently is it is an incredible privilege and gift and why don't more people do it because it does it builds character it builds fucking amazing experiences memories like I don't have regrets I have regrets of some things I did but I have no I have no like grand regrets of life like I don't go look back on a period in my life and go fuck that like three years when I hated myself doing that with or like when I was with that chick I fucking didn't even what couldn't get it up with for you know that kind of regret yeah yeah right yeah I definitely had that you're not getting it up there it's interesting wasn't an age thing but not getting it up that was like that was a stressful time. Oh yeah I remember those early days. You didn't know how to your body was why is my body not working what's going on you know I mean I met a stench that was coming out of my armpit the smell of failure you know coming out you know I'm not rich I don't have anything now my cock's not working horrible a horrible moment in time oh the girls just they're like I've made a terrible mistake oh no yeah yeah this boy okay I'm gonna go yeah that was it okay talk about building character you know yeah listen guys that's just a word out there that's part of learning how to fuck is is you're gonna have something like that level of awkwardness to deal with at some point so you may as well get it done as soon as you can that's my advice yeah go out now and don't let your penis work yeah well it's just like you know yes you don't avoid getting good at sex because it's awkward yes it is and and and it pretty quickly becomes fucking fun and eventually gets to the point where it's second nature and it's always fun except for the few times where it's where it's awful because of some other weird thing that happened because that chick had some weird thing and then you come back in you and then you tell an interesting story to John Keegan about it and then you go off and have excellent sex forever so getting good at and also through communication great lover yes and you become a gear of one of the world's great lovers I feel like I'm a great lover too and I'm always learning like that's the thing like never stop learning you know like I definitely like like say for example like those couple experiences I had where all of a sudden my you know my the main that jackhammer didn't work it was like I had to learn how to use a screwdriver you know I'm saying I had to start learning how to be a lover besides just a guy who comes in and you know and just whips it out you know so you learn and you know it's in a non-stop process right you were spending you were spending time with with Dom on the island recently and so like you're aware of the Australian BDSM tradition aren't you yes because I have lived with you and many apartments around the world including my old Lower East Side apartment where the walls are paper thin and there's something called the Australian ass slap and it's you know at one time you were in one room it's a three-bedroom I was in my little room like an old man trying to sleep underneath my underneath my sheets you know with earplugs in and then Liam was in another room and then this was just basically what was like and it's not just like that one slap for good measure it was like you know it's like 20-30 minutes of slapping back and forth and very joyous moments very excited about it you know I'm like really that she's very happy you know and then loving you and so yeah I'm very I'm familiar with that that and now I'm also familiar with much more right yes was there any was there any one thing that you that Dom passed on to you on the island of Copenhagen that kind of set things to a new level yeah just something interesting or just something sick you know you always has something nasty well no he because he was he gave a demonstration with the with a live girl to the guys we were coaching because I was just you know it was a very that course wasn't just all about sex but that was just that was obviously one of the and it wasn't all the dumb teachers but it was one of the aspects that that he was working on and he brought this girl in who was not a girl that he normally works with and she completely loved it first of all what he did but what I got what I really saw from it was is you know it's really you're it's just you know another level of creating this amazing view like even though it's like sounds scary BDSM it's just a you're creating an experience for yourself right of course but you're creating it for her and for her it was exciting and for her it's unique and for her like Dom always says he says can we use a little bit of his personal life oh yeah they say just that yeah he said I worked in he he worked as a musician in a gay nightclub for many years a DJ a DJ yeah for many years in a gay nightclub the top gay nightclub in Australia and they and he said not once did any of the gay guys hit on him that's how ugly he's that ugly said that he says and he says women they don't like this but now they come now they come to him and they pay him and and they want to be with him because he creates an amazing experience for them a unique experience"}
