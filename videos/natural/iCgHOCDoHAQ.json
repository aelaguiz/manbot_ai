Ah. Like, I mean, if you think about it, everybody enjoys having sex, but everybody hates to talk about it. Don't worry. Or, I mean... Yeah, in the normal world. You guys will be the judge of that. But like, I mean, yes, we don't care, but most of the time, whenever you talk about anything like that, you can see people get uncomfortable. So why is that? I mean, I understand it could be a religious perspective to it. Well, I mean, there's multiple threads going on there, I think. Yeah, I would say you could say religious, but you could overlay cultural instead of religious because, I mean, sometimes it's religious, sometimes it's cultural, sometimes those overlap. And we have thousands of years since basically Mesopotamian civilizations appeared where in order to control large populations, you need to have a unified belief structure. It's just the way it has to be. Otherwise, it's tribal. Right? So at a tribal level, then people can be, let's say... And I don't want to be too noble savage about it, but theoretically, at a tribal level, you can have more autonomy. But once you start not being able to know everyone in the tribe because there's 1,000, there's 5,000, there's 10,000, then we create city-states. And so then belief structures have to be in place. And so that's where those types of organized, top-down hierarchical religions have formed since back in Sumer. And then in order to control societies, you have to use fear and guilt and shame primarily. And almost all societies do that in varying degrees, in all sorts of different ways. All sorts of taboos are created that keep people in line because it works on a societal level. Right? It's like everyone does what they're told, more or less. Then it can function. We have to go out and do the crops. You have to go to war now. Everyone has to do their thing. The priests, we listen to them because they know what they're talking about. And so it functions. Right? And so then the repression of sexuality, because sexuality is a wild and untameable force in humans. And so you need to put a fucking cap on it if you want to control populations. So that's happened all throughout history, mostly on women, but also on men in differing ways. And particularly controlling female sexuality is really important if you want to keep a lock on a society. Not that I'm into that. So yeah. Okay. Maybe. That's a theory anyway. I just made it up. But in terms of where we're at today, this is based on a Judeo-Christian society, even if none of us consider ourselves Christians. We have that morality of some sort sewn into us from childhood, from Christmas songs to whatever. And there is, particularly with women, there's a, and again, I'm mansplaining, but- Tell us if we're wrong. Yeah. Please do. But in my opinion, there is, like women have to live this two-stroke life in general, where they have to pretend to be nice and sweet and virginal and good, which they may well be partially that, and then they have to repress the fact that they're horny wild devils as well. And so they have to lie. Women have to lie. I'm seeing some nods here. And most men have to lie. I just don't have to because I'm out of the matrix and I get paid for this shit. I'm not quite out of the matrix. It's about as far out as you can get. And so, yeah, like there is massive, the Madonna-Whore dichotomy and there's variations in Hindu religions and whatever, which basically states that there are two types of women. One has worth and one has no worth. And so women learn that pretty early on. I'd be interested to hear your guys' experiences. Like they're blossoming at their sexuality in their teenage years and they express it in some way or someone near them expresses, another girl expresses it and gets harshly judged and punished for it. She blew a dude at a party because she felt like it. And then she's a slut and that ruins her reputation. And then all the girls notice that and go, I better keep quiet about this shit and pretend I'm not that. Right. And then they have to hide it. And then men don't know about it. And they presume that there are good girls and sluts. And so when they're with a good girl, girlfriend, they never get to see the slutty side of her because it's too dangerous for her to let it out. I think what's interesting to me though, I think there is teachings and there is aspects in certain religions and certain ways of life that do teach these things and have taught those things, but they're still kind of keep it quiet. When you look into the tantric stuff, if you find some of the Daoist practices, some of the Hindu practices, even the smaller sects, which do actual sexual practices, they still keep it quiet. Of course. Those are mystery schools that they managed to exist. And the same in Christianity and some other more Western religions, they still have some schools, but it's always kept quiet in a way. Do you think that's a good thing? Not everybody can have this power, should know this stuff, that maybe it's a good thing to keep some things quiet or you think everyone should have access to that? I don't think everyone should anything, but it's not about should or shouldn't. I think we just happen to now live in a time and space where all information that has ever been produced by humans, except for what was burnt in the library of Alexandria, is available. All of it. And amazingly, people choose to go, I'm going to box myself into this, I listen to that podcast, and I like this guy, I don't like that guy, that'll do. Like, okay, dude, school, how about the rest of it? But it's all out there. So it's now it's then it's a matter of like, educating yourself in order to be able to go in pursuit of knowledge if you choose to. And if you don't want to, then just watch the fucking telly. Did you girls have an experience with that? Like, maybe a situation that you saw like a girl you knew, like had something come out and then it made you like, repress something? Like have you had an experience with repressing your own sexuality or, you know, that kind of thing? Yeah, it happened to me, like, so I'm coming from Kazakhstan, and there it's so suppressed, like being sexually anything. So when I moved here, I'm like, okay, I think here it's more open. But I still had this resistance. But I had a friend of mine, she's very explicit, like, when she tells stories, what happened last night, every single detail she was telling, I'm like, I could never say so to anyone. And I was never open about any of my experiences to even to my best friends. But I wanted to embrace that. And when I heard that, oh, there's the job description, I'm like, okay, let's try that. It was called account manager. But then it turned out to be a webcam industry. So I was like, okay, I'm watch porn anyways. And I can just quit at any time. So but meeting those people, without being judgey, without being judgey towards them, it made me learn so much because they talk about sex and experience so openly. And it's like weather conversation, you know, and I learned so much from them. And the resistance came down, because I've heard so many topics and so many stories from them. And it just now I'm more open about it. And I think that's why I'm here today, as well. Yeah, sorry, do you mind if I just make a little interjection? Sorry, I'm just a ranting machine sometimes. Put the mic a bit closer to you. All right. And push the wind thing down. You see, it's like poking out. Right in front of your mouth. Just push it. Yeah, there you go. And put the mic closer to you. I'm still on that trip. You're going to wake up soon. Yeah, I know. I'm going to wake up. I'm like, Oh, no, not another layer inception. Come on, let me out of this. I had this dream today where I was like in five. I kept waking up. And then I thought I was awake. And then another one. It was five times. And now I don't know what's real. What was the question? Oh, no, it wasn't a question. I was going to interrupt. And then I forgot. No, what I wanted to say was, I was going to say, I'm going to interrupt. And then I thought I was awake. And then another one. It was five times. And now I don't know what's real. What was the question? Oh, no, it wasn't a question. I was going to interrupt. And then I forgot what I wanted to say. No, what I wanted to say was, many times I've had the experience where, you know, I coax it out of a lady, like what she's interested in, right? So she gives me a fantasy, which I think is so cute because it's like, she's like really worried about it. She's like, I have a fantasy to be spanked or something, you know, something which I consider pretty like, you know, pedestrian. And I always say, you know that that's completely normal, right? And so many times that's that in and of itself, like changes the life, which is like, oh, what? I said, humans are freaks. You like what you like. And that thing you just said is really common. And sometimes I'm like, and that one, not so common, you know, so actually having it acknowledged and knowing that, oh, I'm normal or I'm not a freak, whatever that means can be enough to just like let someone actually experience what they like.
