And today I'm hitting you with a infield breakdown. So this is the second part of my infield day that I shot in Barcelona last year. And I thought, okay, should I just release again a couple of infields, which is cool. And thanks to everybody who was commenting and liking and even direct messaging me about my first infield. I got a lot of positive feedback. So thanks for that. So I asked myself, should I just release another couple of infields? But then I realized I really want to give a lot of value to you guys. I really want to firstly educate you on day game, pickup, relationships, social dynamics. But I also really want to encourage you to do it yourself, to really go out there and make things happen. Because in theory, day game or whatever you call it, cold approach, is not that hard. All you have to do is get off your chair, leave the house, find one girl that you're somewhat attracted to, walk up to her and say, hi, my name is Alex. You look adorable. So why is not everybody doing it? Of course, there's many, many reasons. I think one reason is because people have a wrong idea of how hard it is or how good you have to be to then continue a conversation, to then maybe get her number, go on a date, make things happen. People have the wrong attitude, the wrong mindset. And I think one reason for that is because a lot of other dating companies are only putting out very selected content. They would only put out videos that they know it's the perfect shot, it's the perfect infield. It's the thing where the approach was smooth, the opener was great, the girl stopped right away, she was totally into the guy and everything just flowed and fell into place straight up. Okay, so he gets the number or even crazier infield videos where the guy proceeds to touch her to take her home to maybe have sex the same day. But is that the reality of the daily grind of day game and seduction? No. The reality is to get to a good level, to get comfortable, to be situational aware, to really feel into girls, you just have to do hundreds and hundreds and thousands of approaches. And is that so bad? No. It's a huge topic, there's a lot of knowledge to be gained, it's an amazing opportunity to develop yourself by pushing your comfort zone, by talking to strangers on the street. So why not give it time? Why not give it a lot of effort? Because if you figure it out, and I can speak from experience, your life is going to be better. Your life is going to be happier and you become a better version of yourself. So what I'm going to do this time is, firstly I'm going to show you every interaction that I had that day. So this is basically the second part of my other Barcelona infield. So those two together, those are all the interactions that I did on camera that day. So I'm not cutting out anything, even the little awkward ones, even the ones where I don't look great, even the ones where the girl was like, no thanks, not at all. I will keep them in and I will show them to you. The other thing I'm going to do is, I'm going to comment a little bit on every approach. Even when it's a little short one, I will give you a little bit of an understanding, what did I do, why did I do the thing that I do, why did I behave the way, what words did I use, and maybe what would I do differently today, you know, it has been around a year ago, so maybe I'm not even that set on some of the things that I was doing back then. So let's get started and look at the first approach. Okay, first approach, I'm stopping this young girl on the street and I'm not using any opener, I'm not using any pre-frame, all I'm saying is, hi, I'm Alex. Very relaxed. Then I realized pretty quickly, she's like, okay, my name is X. She's a bit shy, her body language is turning away from me, so I keep the distance. I'm not like stepping in, we are standing quite far apart of each other, but I'm just like reaching my hand out, I'm very relaxed, and I'm not getting too much into her space, I'm not putting too much energy on her, because I already feel like this is not really normal for her, seems like she doesn't get approached a lot, she doesn't really know what's going on right now, so I'm empathizing with that. Are you late? Are you late? Yes. Okay, can I walk with you one minute? Beautiful. Thank you. Thank you. I need to go. Okay, we go one minute. We walk together one minute, then I go back to my seat. Okay? Yeah, that's fine. So what's my job here? My job is to make her feel comfortable. So it's not to like beat a crazy seducer or overwhelm her with a lot of words, or try to get a lot out of her straight from the beginning, no. It's really just relaxing, speaking slow, making sure that she's comfortable. How am I doing this? As I said, I'm speaking really slowly, because maybe her English is not as good. I am keeping distance, I am not moving straight to her when she moves a little bit, I'm keeping my ground, I'm basically communicating, I'm here, I'm settled in, and you can come to me if you want, but if you don't, it's fine, I'm not going to enter your space too much. I feel like she's a little unsure, she's still moving away from me, so I'm like, okay, I'm asking her, are you in a hurry, are you meeting friends or something? She's like, yeah, okay, let's walk a little bit. So it's another technique of, okay, seems like what I want to do right now, which is stand here in front of you and talk to you, is not really the thing you want. You want to get a little bit away from me, okay, I'm acknowledging that, and I'm creating a solution by walking with you. Thank you. Same. Tell me, are you Spanish? Yeah. Okay. You're a very shy girl. Yeah. And you never meet people on the street. No. Okay, I see. Well, I'm not dangerous, don't worry. Okay. I'm from Austria, but here for three weeks. Ah, it's good. What are you doing in Austria? In what? In life. Maybe study and study. Maybe study? Yeah, study and only. I need to go. Okay. I know, it's strange, it's very strange. We text, okay? You give me your number, I text you one message. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I text you one message. You have... You have internet? You have internet. I don't have. Ah, I turn on. You like Instagram more because everybody can add you on Instagram. I don't know about that. It's not so strange. Oops. On the camera. Yeah. How old are you? Okay. Eh? How old are you? Eh, 19. Ah. Okay. I need go. Bye-bye. See you. Bye-bye. So, I walk with her, but just for like two or three steps, then she becomes more comfortable. She's facing me more, and I'm again releasing a little bit more pressure by saying, it's okay, I'm not dangerous, and I'm checking in with her like, this doesn't happen too often with you, does it? So I'm showing her, I feel you, I know your situation, I'm not a threat, let's be comfortable. So I'm doing a good job, she's relaxing, she's now facing me, and I can move on to putting a little bit more pressure now on her to create some pressure and release cycle to create some emotional impact. So I'm asking her, what are you doing here, do you study, or whatever I said, what are you doing here? And she's like, study maybe, and I'm like, maybe? And I look at her. So with just one word, with like an uptone tonality, like as a question, and just staring at her, I'm already now creating a little bit more pressure. I'm leaving longer pauses. So this is where it becomes a little more seductive, you know? And I'm figuring out, okay, she's not gonna give me a lot right now, you know? When I ask her, what do you do, and all she gives me is like two words, I realize I have like now two choices. Should I like bombard her with a lot of questions, trying to get something out of her, or should I just open up about myself to create a connection that way? So I'm telling her, I'm actually from Austria, but I'm doing projects in Spain, I'm staying here for a few weeks, it's really beautiful. And she's like, yeah, beautiful. And again, I'm putting a little bit of pressure, I'm like, Barcelona, or me? And then she's smiling. So it becomes a little more seductive. But then again, she's like, oh, I really need to go. So she's kind of in a hurry, or whatever is going on inside her. So I realize, she's not giving me much, she's not reacting too much to what I'm doing, probably it's going to be really hard to get into a settled zone with her to really make an impact right now. So I'm just going for a close. I'm like, okay, cool. Before you go, let's exchange contacts. I think she's suggesting Instagram, again, because she's not 100% comfortable with what's going on, she's new to this. And I'm flowing with that. So that's it. It's just a two minute interaction, but I think there's some good lessons in calibration that you don't always have to be that strong guy who like, pushes through, like, have empathy with the situation of the girl. Hello. Finish the picture. I don't know. Can I take a picture? What? Can I? Or not? Russian. Hi. Can I take a picture? Can I take a picture? You take a photo. Can't I? No. You're pretty. I don't understand. Two? Yeah. How do you say? I don't know. Can you speak a little English? No. Do you have a translator? Okay, wait. Is it English? No, it's Spanish. Spanish? I won't give you my hand. Okay, next approach. I am walking up to this girl who is taking a photo with her phone, and I'm like, I don't know. Can I take a picture? Can I? Can I? Can I? Can I? Can I? Can I? Can I? Can I? Can I? Can I? Can I? Can I? Can I? And she's taking a photo with her phone of some beautiful building in Barcelona. So instantly I know, okay, she's a tourist. She's not a local. She is probably here just for a short amount of time. So she's clearly on a tourist photography mission, whatever she's doing. So I'm coming in. I'm like, finish the photo. Don't worry. No, no stress. So again, very relaxed. And very quickly I realized, okay, this girl speaks zero English. Everything I'm saying, she's responding in Russian to me. I'm trying, like, saying \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0442, and that's pretty much all I knew in Russian. And still that's kind of all I know, which is embarrassing one year later. So I realized really quickly, I won't get anywhere with English words here. Okay, that's where my little computer in my pocket comes in, you know? Why not use the amazing technology that we have? So I'm starting to write really simple sentences in English and translating it into Russian to her. And actually a tip that I do, because I do spend a lot of time in Kiev now, or with Russian girls, or with people in Portugal or whatever, you can actually download the translation packages in Google Translate. So even if you have very slow internet, or you don't have a SIM card in right now, or just to make it faster, you can download the packages and translate instantly in Google Translate app. So that's what I'm doing. So let's see what happens next. Google Translate. Always have it on your phone, guys. English, Russian. Um... I wanted to say this... Wait, you have... Instagram? Yeah. Add me. Who will translate this? Do you have a contact on Instagram? How long are you in Barcelona? Tomorrow Tomorrow? A year In German it means cocaine Are you cocaine? You work? Ok, bye-bye That girl spoke zero English, nothing at all So always have your Google translator on your phone ready Because you never know what happens Maybe she's really into you And you end up on a date with her You just do Google translate But you start making out after two minutes It can happen So don't just say Oh, ok, she doesn't speak my language If you're into each other you'll figure it out And just be persistent And be very easy with your English Like you, me, walk, Barcelona, how long? Like don't make those full sentences Like, oh, what do you suggest we might do Tonight is evening for dinner Like, we two eat tonight So I'm keeping it really simple I'm saying things like You're beautiful And you have Instagram And then I'm suggesting Let's go on a Google translate date So I'm very straightforward I'm not trying too much to get to know her there Because I'm realizing Do we really want to get into A really long complex conversation About our purpose and desires And really interests And what drives us And what's our three year plan And what was our last relationship like And so on That's all cool topics Maybe for a date or for an interaction Where you're really flowing with a girl And you can have the time and space to go deeper And the language skills But this is not one of those girls And a lot of guys would just think Well, she doesn't speak English Therefore I'm out So that's why I'm showing you this interaction Will I marry this girl? Probably not Will I be in a relationship with this girl? Probably not But I could still maybe have a fun date I could still maybe sit next to her Do a little bit of Google translate And then touch her within one minute Maybe she kisses me within two minutes Maybe we have a fun photo mission together Maybe I meet her downstairs at a bar Have a glass of wine And then we walk up and have amazing sex You don't know until you try to find out So basically what I said Don't have this attitude of Oh, if she doesn't speak really good English Nothing will happen And I don't want anything to happen Because blah blah blah Just try it anyway, you know But be really direct Don't waste your time, of course Don't waste your time trying to translate Or don't waste your time Trying to make complex conversations happen Just be very straightforward You're pretty, you're beautiful, you're sexy Let's go on a date What are you doing at nine o'clock? Be very straightforward If it happens, it happens If not, no problem At least you tried How are you? Alex Super Very beautiful Thank you What are you doing today? Today I'm walking around the house Where are you from? From Vic From Vic? What is that? Cerquita It's a city in... Yes Spain And you? Because I thought you were Colombian or something No, I'm from Morocco Hi Alex How are you? Well Do you speak English too? No French French I tried to speak French It was too difficult It's okay Shall we do something? I'm going to be here for two or three weeks Two or three weeks? Yes, doing photography I work here, but... You do photography? Yes You can see my Instagram I'm going to take a picture Reveal Shall we? I'd love to Yes, I like it a lot Do you have WhatsApp? Yes, I have it What's your name? What's your name? What's your name? Well, wait Plus 64 Yes Here, no? No You don't speak any English No English Spanish Spanish? I forgot your name Very bad No, I was very nervous Very bad Your name? Do you remember? Alex Okay, I'll write you my Instagram You can see it And we'll do something Okay, yes Okay, I'm going to write you my Instagram Okay, thank you Have a good day Bye So, next girl Again, a very direct approach Saying Hey, how are you? I'm Alex And I'm shaking her hand I remember This was based on eye contact I was walking through the street She looked at me I looked at her And I made the move instantly Okay? So, based on that eye contact I didn't then have to also walk up And then be like Hello I saw you And I thought about coming over To say hi Because you look interesting So, I wanted to introduce myself So, hi, I'm Alex You know, I'm just doing it Instead of like doing all those things That was already in the eye contact She already knows I'm interested in her I know she's interested in me She knows I'm coming over to introduce myself So, why not just do it? Why not just walk over and be like Hey, I'm Alex How are you? Then, another interesting thing with this one is I'm kind of ignoring her friend For the first 20-30 seconds I would not recommend doing that Usually Here, it's fine Because it was so clear for both That I'm approaching them Because they both looked at me But the one was looking stronger So, like her friend knew what's going on You know what I mean? When you approach two girls Like out of the blue Really please acknowledge both of them Otherwise, you might have trouble later Because the dynamic gets really strange Because her friend The one you're not talking to Either gets a bit irritated A bit jealous So, he wants to drag her friend away Or the one you're talking to She feels really obligated to her friend So, she gets really nervous And she doesn't really get into a conversation So, by acknowledging both At the beginning Being like, hey ladies Looks like you have a cool shopping day together You both look wonderful But you're really my type What's your name? Hi, I'm Alex Hi, how are you? Okay Now, I'm establishing this try dynamic And everybody likes me Everybody's okay with me And there's no weird pressure Gonna develop that fucks me up Later in the conversation Then, I'm sharing a bit about myself And I'm telling them straight up I'm here for two or three weeks And she's repeating it Oh, two or three weeks I think that was actually a mistake by me She didn't ask me anything She didn't ask how long I'm gonna be here for Which would be a good time, by the way So, there's no reason for me to really share it Because what it did with her I think in that moment Is like, oh, I really like this guy He's cool He's handsome I looked at him He came up He has the balls to walk up to me But, oh, he's leaving in two weeks Hmm Maybe I should not meet him then Because even if we have good sex Maybe we only do it once But then he's gonna leave And I feel kind of like this pump and dump girl And I had that with the last three guys And I don't want that to happen again So, if the girl is not asking you How long you're gonna stay I would not really recommend doing it like I did So, I think that was a mistake So, the vibe is really good I'm closing her WhatsApp Because I know she likes me So, why not go straight for the number And I'm like, oh, I forgot your name And she's like, oh, how could you forget So, I'm making a little joke I'm like, I was so nervous Because you're so beautiful So, I forgot your name And she's laughing She's smiling I'm asking her, well, did you remember mine? And she's like, yeah, it's Alex And I'm like, oh, damn, you won So, I'm making a joke out of it I'm making no big deal out of it And please never do, you know Our brains are not designed to remember names It's not a survival skill So, it just happens all the time That we forget each other's name So, just ask, what's your name again? Or I forgot your name Or make a funny joke Like, I was totally nervous when you said it So, please say it again Whatever you do Do it your own way It's no big deal at all Don't make it a thing as Oh, my God, I fucked up I forgot her name You know, she doesn't care She forgets your name as well And that's pretty much it A nice little touching, floating goodbye in the end And a nice interaction And I was actually texting with that girl later on So, the next one is also interesting What I said before That I'm letting girls feel how I feel Or I'm letting them see my soft side It's a good example now as well So, let's just take a look and then talk about it Excuse me Hi One second The sunscreen Don't worry But you look really cute Thank you That's nice My name is Alex Emma Emma? You're German? I'm German In a hurry, obviously Well, I'm here for like two weeks To work And I was just exploring I love the vibe of the city Du Bois I was thinking Because I'm from Austria And I'm I think Vienna is boring And I was just enjoying the vibe here So I went And I saw you Do you wanna Never get tired? Do you wanna go for a walk someday? Because you don't meet strangers Because you don't meet strangers I'm afraid I'm gonna cry right now I understand That's fine Well, at least take it as a compliment That I think you're pretty Have a good day Bye bye So the next approach I'm not a big fan of I'm saying it straight up I'm approaching this girl I'm trying to get in front of her It's not the best stop I seem super nervous When I'm like You look cute You know I don't really know what to say And in the end It turns out she has a boyfriend anyway But I still Wanted to show it to you guys Because it shows That Firstly The approach doesn't need to be perfect For her to stop Secondly You can still Give really good vibes Even when she has a boyfriend Which I really did It still made both of our day better Is my point And thirdly It's a really cool example Of Kind of my style Or my technique But I don't really like calling it technique Of really letting the girl feel How she's affecting me We'll see that in a set later as well In the last one But this one is a great example My face is like What am I doing? Yeah, you're pretty This is a bit strange I am showing my emotions I'm not Acting like I'm this pickup monster Who is just going through one approach After the other And this is really important You have to give the girl The feeling that she's special She's obviously aware You might do this more than once She's obviously aware You might be a lady killer Or you are Not that innocent But in that moment She at least needs to feel like You are her number one You are She's your number one That she's special That you really had to Push yourself And that you Walk through your day And then she was the one that you chose She needs to have that feeling So I think I'm doing Although the whole interaction Is a bit bumbly And a bit nervous I'm still doing a good job In conveying that feeling So let's take a look Looks like an intense text I like your outfit Jeans on, jeans on Spanish? Yes Right Espera un poco Es que Are you in a hurry? Un minuto Es que Me gusta No se si hablo ingles Okay Well you don't have time now No Do you want to get a coffee sometime? You almost said it Add me on Instagram And we talk there No, no, thank you Ciao Bye bye Alright, I'm seeing this girl She has a cool style She's very Focused on her phone So I'm calling both of those things out I'm doing basically a situational opener I'm aware of her situation I see you're texting Looks like you're Intense in your phone I like your style What's up? She's like okay, thanks But she's not really giving me anything She's walking off As the light turns green And even in the middle of the road She's already like Okay, bye And I guess a lot of guys would be like"}
