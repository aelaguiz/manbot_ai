Adam says, how do I go about introducing a girl to anal sex? Oh, I know nothing about, oh, actually I know everything about this. I'm mainly interested in tips about when and how to bring this topic up. Not at dinner, not at bar mitzvahs. When do we bring it up? So, so, funny you should ask that because I have been an anal specialist a great procurer of expert anal for many, many years and I've made all the mistakes and I know how exactly how it works and what not to do. So let me go through it and as best I can using my anus here and my cock here. Now, heads up that in the upcoming Master Lover Method online sex course, I actually have an entire module on anal sex where I demonstrate it with a real live butthole and show you exactly how to do it in real, in the reals. So keep that in mind for early next year but let's do the charades version now. So the way that I almost always introduce anal sex, I don't discuss it. What I do is when I'm banging a girl from behind, at some point when she's like loosened up and wild and horny, right? I'm not doing this early because, I mean, it depends if you have a partner where anal is part of your relationship and that's a different thing but what I'm doing is as I'm banging her, here's the butt, right? You have to excuse the scale. As I'm banging and I'm grasping and kneading and jiggling and spreading in amongst other things, at some point what I do is this, I lick my thumb and I put my fingers down first and then I place the thumb on the butthole, straight on it. Because what you don't want to do is like kind of worm towards it. Like do it now to yourself, just wriggle a finger up your leg and then try to worm into your ass and you'd be like, oh, get out of there to yourself. So any like tentative like, or like just suddenly poking into it or like kind of tickling around it or something feels irritating, it's not gonna be useful. So what I do is I just place my thumb flat right over the asshole and I've licked it first so that then when I place it, butt vision, then I start doing these like circles around the sphincter but I'm not penetrating. Now, at this point, you'll be like, but what about the old communication? Here's what happens in this situation. The moment I put my finger on a girl's butthole, if she doesn't want it, she'll reach behind and she'll swat the hand away or she'll say not anal or not in the ass or something like that. In which case you swallow your disappointment and you'd have a discussion with her later. All right, so when I place the thumb on, sometimes girls swat the hand away. Sometimes they swat it away later when I've started probing, like they might allow it at first and that feels nice and then when I start to probe, they might then swat it away. Okay, so that's how I gauge that. But basically the compliance is, okay, put it on and she's fine with it, right? So I start massaging in little circles. I might reapply the saliva and then I will start to dip, right? So I'm not gonna get the knuckle in if I'm using my thumb, for example. I'm just gonna curl down using the pad of the thumb. So it's like, does this work? Yeah, so I curl in like that, right? Cause I don't just stab it in cause I can stab with the nails. So I slide in like that and then I'll just do a little dip like in and sometimes I'll just like put the thumb in and then grip the rest of her butt and then fuck her whilst kind of holding her by her asshole with not much penetration, right? So these are like introducing, starting to open the area up, starting to stretch it. Cause the thing you need to understand is the sphincter muscle is like a coil and it stretches this way. Not like the problem, what most guys think is if I get it in and out enough times, it'll loosen up. I mean, it will to a degree, but less so. Cause what we actually wanna do is get it in finger or thumb or cock or toy in about three centimeters ish so past the head of the cock, for example. And then I'm gonna actually stretch side to side up and down, right? So I'm gonna hold my cock or the toy and I'll actually stretch side to side up, down a little bit of circles. Cause this starts to open the sphincter out this way, right? Cause that's what we're aiming to do. Cause it's just getting past this first inch or so of coiled muscle that's the hard bit. And once that opens up, the rest of it is pretty easy. So that's to keep in mind as we start dipping, dipping I'll do that like every, I don't know, 10 seconds or something as I'm fucking. And then I gauge it because girls buttholes are all different and the same girl can be different depending on when she last took a dump or how relaxed she is or how turned on she is, right? So if I go and I feel like that the finger like kind of just gets in past the knuckle like I'm kind of going two in, one out, two in, one out two in, one out, get to the knuckle or the crest of the toy, for example. And then it just kind of pops in. Okay, cool. Then maybe I don't need to pull out toys and do a whole big anal preparation thing cause she's just loosened up. And so, you know, I get in, I stretch a little bit. Now I need to make sure I start applying lots of saliva slash coconut oil or lubricant if you prefer because the anus doesn't self lubricate. So I need to make sure that both surfaces are really lubricated. At first I'm just using saliva cause I'm not doing much penetration. I'm just getting there, right? Now, if she's got a really tight ass and I'm like, I can't get my, like if I try and push past here it's probably going to be uncomfortable. This is usually when I'll bring out an anal toy. One second. Alrighty, so this is the type of anal toy that you want to have. It's basically beaded and it increases in size as it goes down. This one's glass and glass is actually the easiest surface to penetrate with, right? So, I mean, obviously it could be dangerous. Like if it ever gets cracked or chipped throw it out, right? But I've had this for many years and it's still glass. I mean, glass lasts for a thousand years if you don't break it. So, and I'll be buried with this and we'll prove that. So has it been changed by the shape of asses? Is it like been worn away? So this will slip in really easily. It won't stay in though, right? So I have different plugs. I have ones that are made of silicon which are a bit harder to get in cause it's just the nature of the texture. Like glass slides really easily, right? Any kind of plastic will have a bit of friction on it. But I usually use this one to like warm up. So I'll put it in like, cause the good thing about the beads is it's difficult and then it's easy. It's difficult and then it's easy, right? As opposed to the cones that just get harder as more difficult as it goes in further, right? So I can, this, anyone can take this, right? So I just swivel it around. I'll put a bit of coconut oil. Well, quite a lot actually over the whole surface. If it's cold, which it is right now, I can feel then I'll, you know, jerk it off, warm it up. Yep, whatever. Cause you know, it'd be a bit startling having an ice cold piece of glass in your ass. I mean, maybe that feels good, I don't know. All right, so coconut oil, oil it up and then twist, dip, dip, and then first one goes in. Then I'll give it a semi, like a quarter turn just to spread the oil. I'm not going to twist it around, but just a semi circle, a quarter turn, then dip, dip, dip, second one pops in, twist, same thing. Okay, and then I've got the three in. Usually then I'll hold it in with my thumbs whilst I'm banging. So I've got it in their ass. I can't really demo it now, but like it's in her ass. I'm holding it and then I'm banging. And then that's kind of probing in and out a little bit. Then I can take it, move it a little bit side to side. And I do it like, it's kind of fast cause this doesn't feel awesome. It's just like, get it done, this bit, right? So it's side to side, up, down, around, that would stretch it, then go in and out again. Cool, after, you know, you do that enough times that maybe two, three, four times of like going the full way in until it's kind of going in and out pretty easily, then that's when I'll put my dick in. Right, so same thing, I've got to oil up my surface. So my whole cock, cause don't just put on the end cause that'll like get spread and then it'll dry out. So you want the whole shaft, lots of coconut oil, not just around her butthole, but like the whole kind of 10 centimeter area so that there's no skin that gets caught as your cock's going in, it all slides going in. And then when you're going to penetrate with your cock, I recommend don't do it in a doggy position, right? Where she's on all fours bent over because her sphincter is like bent then and her butt, like all her muscles are under tension. So it's better that she's, I mean, I'll do the probing first like that and make the toy maybe doggy and then I'll get her to lie down. So I'll say lie down and I'll put a pillow underneath her hip. So she's lying flat, but her hips are elevated a little bit like that, right? From there, I can hold my body weight on one hand whilst eyeballing it and you need to look directly at it cause it's very easy to miss, right? I can be just kind of there, like, you know, one centimetre away in the wrong and pushing and then it's just pulling and painful, right? I need to be right there. So I make sure, and sometimes if the girl's got a fat ass, I'll get her to reach back behind and spread. And how do I do that? I say, give me your hands, put them on. I say, spread your ass, right? So I got clear, there it is. That's what I'm aiming for. And then I put, aim the cock so that I'm right on it. And then I'll basically go two in, one out, two in, one out. Until we get to the, you know, the bulb of the head, which is the hardest bit to get in. And then, and sometimes it kind of gets a bit caught. And so I might need to put my thumb a bit more oil and just kind of like unstick it around there until the head gets in. Once the head's in, I leave it in. I'm not going to pop it in and out like you see on porn where they're gaping cause that is like a champagne cork. All right, you can imagine what might happen if you just keep plunging your cock in and out of an asshole. Can you imagine? I can tell you what happens. That's not what you want to do. So once it's in there, it stays in, right? So now we're working the shaft, however long your shaft is. And then more oil around, two in, one out, two in, one out until the ass gives up. At some point it's tight, it's tight. And then it just kind of lets go, right? And sometimes I'll get in with the cock. I'll do more of that, like side to side, up, down, circle just once or twice. And often I find as soon as I do that, it just relaxes a bit and then it slides in. Once you've got like penetration and it's going okay, then I'll start to idle. So I don't want to stop, even if like it's kind of tense for the girl because if I stop, she'll clamp shut and then it can basically be hard to remove yourself. So even if it's just this like millimeters in and out, idling kind of thing, keeps loosening the area up until you feel that it starts sliding a bit, idling again, sliding. You know, then I might start to take these slow strokes but I need to really check in with a girl and anal is a journey that can take 15 minutes at least to go from first touch to, you know, actually getting some proper movement going on it. And if you rush it, it'll hurt and that's it. It's over and she probably won't ever want to do it again with you. So you really have to be patient, take it at the pace that she needs it. And then it's awesome. Then like I have anal sex with 80% of the girls I'm with because I always try it. I'm like, I always try it. And so yeah, like 20 ish percent girls swat the hand away, no. 30 ish percent of girls in my experience anyway, love it. And the rest will be willing to try it with a guy that knows what he's doing and will learn to love it if it's good, right? Cause the concern is most girls have tried anal at some point badly. Guy in high school, whatever, just tried to shove it in and didn't work and it was extremely painful for moments. And she's like, screw that. That's, I'm like never doing that again, right? So if she's had that experience, then you can retrain her. Now, if she does the swat away, usually I'll discuss it with the girl if I want to see her again. So, you know, after we've fucked and showered and hanging out or whatever, I'll say, so what do you, how do you feel about anal sex? Or I noticed you didn't want to do anal. Have you had, have you had bad experience with that or you haven't tried before? Right, so I give you those options. Bad experience, haven't tried before. She says bad experience. Oh yeah, like I tried once with my ex-boyfriend something and I say, yeah, good anal takes skill and patience. And when it's done properly, it not only doesn't hurt, it feels amazing, but the man must know what he's doing, right? So obviously I'm the guy that knows what I'm doing, skill and patience, right? And then if she gives any like indication, like sometimes I go, yeah, I know, yeah, I know what you're doing, don't even try. And other girls are like, okay, I'm listening. And then I'll say, how about we try it one time? We'll do it really slowly with oil and with toys. And I can promise it won't hurt, which is true. I can promise it won't hurt if I do it. I mean, it might, it will feel uncomfortable possibly at some points, especially getting the head in like, but not a pain, let's say when done well. So yeah, I'll say that to her. How would you feel about trying sometime? And then usually they say maybe. And then a lot of times I've had girls later on then hint that they want to try it. Or next time when I go for, I say, let's try a little bit of butt play. And you can just phrase it in that way. Cause I don't always like start playing with the butt and then I'm going for anal. I'm now working my anal train and that's it, right? Sometimes I do a bit of anal play and the girl likes the caressing, a little bit of dipping, thumb in, grabbing the butt with the rest of the fingers dominantly, right? So that's like a, and then I might not, and then we might, and I might stop and then fuck her in some other ways for some time and then reintroduce that a bit later, right? So ass play doesn't always have to end in anal. And especially with a girl who's new to ass play, then it's good to like give her some taste of it and for her to not be stressed about, oh, I'm about to get fucked in the ass. No, we're just having a play and see how you like that. And we'll try it again later. So that's some important stuff on anal. Let me, the final thing I want to add is when you finish. Right, so let's say she was lying flat and you were fucking her flat. Now, once she's, if she gets really loose and like there will be like a lot of women, once you've loosened her up, you can fuck her as hard in the ass as in the pussy, but only when the butt has given up and there's, and you know, the girl's saying fuck my ass basically, right? But whenever you finish, come or not, what I'll do, let's say I was in doggy because we pulled her up into doggy now because she can take it, I banged her for whatever, 10 minutes and then I come or we're finished or I say, because I will fuck a girl in the ass a while and then I'll check in with her and say, you can take it. Right, and often they say, oh yeah, I'm fine. Or she's like, I'll say, can you take a little more? Or have you had enough? Like I'll know if the girl's like was into it, into it, into it. And then I can see it's kind of fatiguing. Like she's maybe the expression is she's zoned out a bit or there's a little bit of grimaces or something. Then I'll check in and I'll say, have you had enough? Or you can, can you take a little more? Right, so the implication is I would like a little more but I'll stop if you've had enough, right? And then, yeah, then I mean, often I get both responses. Sometimes the girl goes, yeah, I've had enough. Cool, stop. Or she's like, what, fuck my ass more. Cool, so either way we finish. Then what I'll do is I'll lie her down while I'm still inside her. So I take her by hips and I'll say, lie down and then I'll lie down with her. So I'm lying flat on top of her now, right? Cock still inside. Then. See if I can do this. So I'll reach around to her hip and then I'll roll both of us onto the side. And that's how I reach. So I'm lying on front, I grab by the hips and then I roll both of us. So now we're lying spooning side by side, cock still inside. Then I just let myself get soft, right? So I just wait for a while until I'm softened and then I start to remove it. Now, I've talked to girls about this and I've noticed this. Almost every time you pull it out the last time, it's a really weird sensation because it feels like you're pooing out a dick, right? Like, I mean, try to imagine it's like you've got a big dick in your ass, which you don't, like your body feels as if it's a foreign object like a poo, right? So then you're pooing out, it feels like you're taking a big dump at the end. And I've seen like no girl has ever enjoyed that last bit from what I've seen. It's just not fun. So the way I do it is I let myself get, you know, medium soft and then I hold my cock and then I start to pull it out and then I let it go. Pull it out and let it go. Cause it'll be stuck kind of, right? So you're like kind of pulling a tapeworm. Stretch, relax, stretch, relax. Then move your hand up, hold closer to the butt. Out, out, out. I don't know how long your dick is. And then at the end, we don't, again, champagne cork it out. What you do is this, as it's coming out, you then like tilt your cock like this and then let it just come out like this. So then the butt seals behind you, right? This will minimize chances of getting mess and poo, mainly poo, all over the place. And it feels easier for the girl, kind of just see it's like a poo sliding out. But just know like, yeah, you will have to just take command of this moment. And if the girl's like, ah, it's okay, don't worry. I'm taking it slow. It'll be out in a moment. Cause I had girls just take it out. And then you pull it out and poo comes out. It's not good. And it feels doesn't, that seemed to be worse, right? So, eh, eh, eh, and then seal. Then make sure with your aftercare, okay, you lie together, whatever. It's a bit messy for a while. Get up, get her a towel, come over, wrap her in the towel and say, hey, I'll show you where the bathroom is, right? Or if she, or send it to the bathroom, right? So your aftercare is to make sure you've just fucked a girl in the ass, opened her up. You know, it's messy, it's dirty. Even the cleanest anal is not clean. And then you need to make sure that she feels like, cause that could easily be like a wild, hot experience. And then you like pass out or like you go to the shower and leave her there and she's got a bit of poo and she feels weird and doesn't. And then she reconsiders the whole thing, right? Instead, it's like, cool, towel, clean to the bathroom. She showers, if you jizzed in her ass, she can poo out the jizz. And then come back, she's clean again, good girl. Good reference experience.
