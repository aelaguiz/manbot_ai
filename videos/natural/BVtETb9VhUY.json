Now I get messages via various types of digital media fairly regularly asking, do I ever get blown out? Do I have a hundred percent strike rate? Every single woman I speak to immediately has sex with me. And the answer is no. Firstly. Okay. That's, that's what the video is about. And then I have other guys saying, I bet you get blown out all the time and you just only you film for like six months to get like one number on film. That's also not true. My strike rate is pretty high, but yes, I do certainly get blown out. And what I thought I'd do is show you guys a bunch of videos of me getting blown out so you can laugh at me and you know, I get a bit of schadenfreude. Um, no, what, why this is important I think is firstly to show that I'm okay with getting blown out and I'm okay with people seeing me getting rejected by girls. Um, but I wanted to show you guys how to have a good blowout because the primary fear that most men have in terms of approaching women is that she's going to go, I don't like you or she's going to reject you in some way and then you're going to feel shit about yourself and everyone's going to laugh at you. And I wanted to show you guys that when you handle it well using such aspects of natural seduction as the response rule, being able to respond well to her reactions, um, and also being able to develop a, an internal state of calm and confidence that even when a girl does blow you out in front of her friends, as you'll see happen in a moment, um, it doesn't really affect me very much. And I'm not saying I don't have any feelings and then I don't ever feel anything. Uh, certainly I sometimes get shaken by a situation, but because of my meditation and because of my understanding of, of principle based game, I'm able to just move through that pretty easily. So sit back, relax and enjoy the James Marshall failing with women special. Sexy, please don't pass. Stop. Stop. Stop. Where are you guys going? What's happening? Oh. Blown out. In field. James Marshall. Fraud. Next. Stop. Stop. Stop. Please. Can I talk to her for two minutes? No. Why not? Is she your boss? No. She's my girlfriend. Prove it. Kiss. Prove it. Kiss. Prove it. Kiss. No. I don't want to. Not your girlfriend. You're going to have to come up with a better excuse next time. What's your name? Um. I don't speak English. Why do you? Why do you? Why do I talk to you? I don't speak English. Why do you? I don't speak English. Why do you? Why do I talk to you? Yeah. Because you're sexy. I like your freckles. And I want to take you on a date. Okay. But I have a... Dolgova. Dolgova. She is busy. Sorry. She has a... She has a boyfriend. Okay. Is that really true? This is really. Yeah. This is really true. Alright. In that case, that's totally fine. But in future, if she's single, don't pull her away from attractive boys because we might be soulmates. Aha. And it's her decision, right? What would you want that... Okay. You know what? If she learns English... Yeah? I will let you to speak to her. Okay. And then you will... She will find out if you are in her soul. Okay. So, in that case, how do we do this? You're going to get my Facebook and then when she learns English... No. In the future, if we see each other. Okay. But it's the same thing. Like, imagine a guy came up and you liked him and she went, oh, if I can pull her away, it wouldn't be nice, would it? Destiny. If the destiny wants you to meet her... Ah. Destiny. If the destiny wants you to meet her... Ah. Destiny. Destiny. Destiny. Destiny. Destiny. Destiny. Destiny. Destiny. So, if the destiny wants you to meet her... Alright. Then you will... Okay. So. Okay. We'll just have to wait for destiny. So give me a hug. Goodbye. Bye. Aww. Alright. Bye. See you later. Bye. Keep filming. Yo. You're in a hurry. I can see that. Can I walk with you for one minute? I can see you're in a hurry. Yeah. Alright. What's your name? Jessica. Jessica. What's the... You got to test or something? What's the rush? Excuse me. Hello. Hello. You look like you've had a long hard day. Am I right? Yeah. Why? Why? Because I wanted to come and chat you up. And so I thought I'd do that. And so I'm going to make it quick because you need to go home and have a bath. Alright? Okay. But actually I'm not going home. I'm going to see my friends and play with them. Okay. Well can I introduce myself and say hello? Are you a bit confused what's happening right now? Yeah. I am. Okay. I thought you were sexy. I wanted to meet you. Oh. And I'm introducing myself. Oh. Okay. Well that is really... Now it makes sense. Flattering and... Good. Good. Alright. So we're on the same page now. Yeah we're on the same page. But actually I'm meeting my boyfriend and a friend of his. Alright. Well that's totally cool. But it was really cool to meet you. Yeah you too. And actually my day was really bad and now it's a little better. Awesome. Well I'm very happy I could make your day. What was your name? Sorry? Dorothea. Dorothea. I'm James. Yeah. It was nice to meet you. Yeah you too. So go and relax. Have fun. Maybe we'll see each other sometime later. It's quite likely. We could be Facebook friends if you wanted and then I'll leave you alone. I won't be doing anything weird. Or we can save it for destiny. Alright well I live here so we probably will see each other again. Okay. Alright. Bye. Have a good night. Take care. There you have it. They didn't like me except for that last one. I just thought I'd throw that in there just to show you that some of them do. Important takeaway point from this video is the following. This is what I do every time I pull a student out of a set that didn't go well or I'm in a situation where it didn't go well is I step out and I find somewhere private and I sit down, I close my eyes for a few seconds and I just allow myself to feel whatever it is I'm feeling. Because often after a blowout guys are beating themselves up. They're being negative. They're being reactive. They are projecting antagonism against the woman or whatever it is that they're doing. And this is not helpful to you in any way. This is not going to make you a better seducer. It's not going to develop your compassion and understanding of women and it's not going to make you feel very good. So the way to deal with a bad set, a set that didn't go the way that you want it to, in my opinion is the following. Sit down, close your eyes, observe what's happening on internally inside yourself, the physical reactions, the mental reactions. Think to yourself, what am I proud of? Because you should always be proud of yourself if you've gone up and spoken to a girl cold because it's a brave thing to do and not many people do it. So you should never walk away from a set going, Oh fuck, I should have done this and I fucked this up because you're just giving yourself negative reinforcement to not do it again. So congratulate yourself for all the things that you did that are difficult and that you don't usually do or you've never done before. And change your markers of success because if you feel like every time you go into a set and you don't get a number that that was a failure, then you're not really going to be motivated to keep doing this. If you go in and you think, all right, well firstly I went and approached her, which is fucking awesome. And then I delivered a direct compliment and I told her what I felt, which is also awesome. And I was trying to connect with her and then I tried to get a number or whatever it is that you did, the steps, each one of those is a success. And then the fact that you didn't get a number is much of a muchness. It's just like I went through a series of successes and then I wasn't unable to go any further. So the first thing you do is you congratulate yourself. And then you do critique yourself. You think about what was it that I did that I could have done better. And that's where your analysis comes in where you look at, okay, well in this position I spoke too quickly or I cut her off or I was too needy and agreeable and this or whatever it was, you take note of that. And of course you think about what you could have done differently and then you let that go. And then you think about the things that you did well. Okay. The fact that the way you delivered the compliment was slow and relaxed and you held good eye contact and you take note of those things as well. And then you keep your eyes closed, you breathe it in, you breathe it out, you breathe it in, you breathe it out and you let it go. And then you move on to the next set. In that way, every single time you approach a girl, whether or not she savagely blows you out or blows you on the spot, will be something that is leading you to grow, progress and get better at this. So please feel free to make lots of comments like you suck or good on you for trying man below. And if anyone wants to send in one of their own blowout rolls, that'll be amusing for me to watch as well. Go out there, get blown out heaps and deal with it well. And I promise you, you're going to get laid. Thanks guys. James Marshall signing out. Are you sure? Because I know tomorrow when you're feeling better, you'll go, hang on a minute. I was in a grumpy mood yesterday, but now I'm feeling better and I should have talked to that guy. I'll walk with you for two minutes. What's that? Woo! You're disgusting already. I'm disgusting already."}
