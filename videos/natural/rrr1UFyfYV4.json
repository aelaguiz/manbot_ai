Now the basic idea here is that we register the way we operate in the world through our feelings much more than our thoughts. So it tends to be our thoughts get overridden by our feelings. Now I'm sure you're pretty familiar with what it's like when you're trying to positively motivate yourself and say, I can do this, or I shouldn't feel like this, or I want to feel this way, but you're very attached and identified to a certain kind of feeling in the body. This is often what happens when guys feel a kind of contraction inside their chest or inside their solar plexus, and they start telling themselves, I'm anxious, or I'm afraid, or I can't, or I feel blocked, or I'm stopped by something. Now what happens is the body starts to create a feedback loop with that sensation. So basically the sensation happens for whatever reason, usually it's triggered by some external event like you want to go and approach a girl, and then you start telling yourself negative things like she's not going to like me, or I don't know what to say, or it's going to be embarrassing, or this is going to be humiliating, etc., and then that contraction starts to really kick in, and then you start to feel like that contraction means that you're anxious. It means that you can't do the thing that you really want to do. Now that then keeps going, following around and around, and you get trapped in this state, trapped in a negative feeling of not being able to break out. So what's the solution? Well the solution is we need to get into a level of your biology, basically, we need to get in underneath the feeling and change the feeling, and there's a lot of different ways that we can do that. One way that we can do that is by, first of all, tracking how do you create the tight feeling in the first place. For example, maybe you feel a contraction in the chest, and then it starts to feel a contraction in the throat, and then it just feels like a very tight feeling in the chest and throat, and it's very uncomfortable. Now notice how you do that. Now what you do is you start to reverse that, or start to generate a different kind of feeling. One of the things you can start to talk yourself out of is thinking, what would it be like if I could experience the opposite? What would it be like if I could start to feel what it's like when I'm happy, or when I'm relaxed, or when I'm really calm? When you do that, what starts to happen is your body and your mind start to create a different kind of pattern, and you can start to discover a different way of flowing energy through the body, a different kind of energy and motion or emotion. Now for example, if you've got that contraction in the throat and in the heart and the chest area that's creating anxiety, then see what happens when you start to spin it in a different kind of way. So for example, start moving the energy in a way that opens up your heart and opens up your throat, and starts flowing in your body as if you're in a happy state, or a relaxed state. For example, that kind of pattern might start lower down in your belly, or maybe it starts in your chest as well, and then it flows up into the throat, and then it flows up into your head, or down through your arms, and down into your hands, and then you can basically flow that energy around and plug it back into where it first began inside the body, and you start spinning the energy. So as you start spinning the energy through the body, then the nervous system and the feeling levels of your body start to think like you're feeling relaxed, start to think like you're feeling really good. Now as you spin those feelings faster and faster, and you can add something like a colour to help you visualise it, then you go into that state more effectively. So the state is then reinforced by the vision of the colours, and the colours are also helping you go deeper and deeper into that sensation. Now spin that feeling round and round, you can do this right now while you're watching this video. Start to feel a good feeling in your body, and feel it moving into the next place, and the next place, and the next place in your body until you create a circuit, and it's flowing in a spinning kind of way. Plug it back into where it begins, give it a colour, see it glowing bright and clear and strong, spinning, spinning, spinning, and as you do that, start to think about all the times that you'd like to feel relaxed, all the times that you'd like to feel really good and energised and at peace. So for example, when you want to go and approach a girl, or when you want to stand up and give a talk, or when you want to be confident in front of somebody of authority, start spinning, spinning, spinning that energy, and you're essentially teaching yourself at an unconscious level, you're teaching your body, this is how I feel when this thing happens, this is what I would like to feel like when I approach a girl, this is what I'd like to feel like when I stand up in front of authority, or do a talk, or do something that you need to do with confidence. That's a very simple hack, so basically find how you run the patterns of contraction and reverse them, do the opposite. Or explore what it's like when you create other four positive patterns of energy flow in the body, and don't just run them through the body once, plug them back into where they began, flow them through the body, cycle them around and around and around in a really fast kind of way with lots of light, lots of visionary special effects in your head to experiment about how you can really amplify those states, and then keep them spinning as your future pace, they call it, so it's like imagine how you can implement this in the future in different ways, different scenarios, different circumstances, so that you can feel really really good. I'll guarantee you, if you do that for a few minutes, you're going to start to feel fantastic and it's going to start to reprogram your brain, it's going to start to reprogram your emotions so that you don't feel those negative contractions of anxiety and fear anymore and instead you start to feel energy and excitement and spontaneity and possibility, or at least just neutrality and relaxation.
