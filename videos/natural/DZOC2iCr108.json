The first thing is to make sure that her body is aligned well for me to penetrate and for it to look sexy and for us to have a good time. \ud83c\udfb5Music Playing\ud83c\udfb5 So some women will do this where they have their pelvis is tilted and sometimes you'll even get this kind of turtle back thing going. Now women do that for a couple of reasons. One they're not super flexible in their hips, two it can be to try and stop you from penetrating too deeply right because if my cock's too big for her here or the positioning doesn't it's like it's a deep position. So if I'm like hammering in here and it's hitting her cervix and then I notice she's tilting her hips like this in some way this usually means my stroke is too deep right. So to alter that so when I know if I notice that she's she's tilted her hip this way to kind of protect herself so that I'm not getting as deep penetration then I'll then I'll just tell her say is that too deep and if she says yes a little bit then I'll say okay relax your hips and then I'll tilt them down right so I can create with the pelvis tilt like that or I can take one and put a hand on the sacrum tilt your ass okay and then I'll I'll work out so I'll take my cock out like 50% and then I'll go in and out 50% and then say is that depth better is that the right depth is that good and then when we figure out where the stroke is that she can take whilst being in this butt up position okay that's the that's the depth I'll go. As we get more warmed up her pussy stretches more then she may take it deeper and she may end up pushing back hard on that right so I'll set that as a guide and then later maybe I'll do a really slow stroke deeper and then see if she pushes back into me right then I might do these deeper strokes from this position here in which case cool right so that's something to be aware of so either she's just a bit inflexible or she's not used to being in sexy positions so being able to take the hips so if she's there I grip the hips tilt your ass up or stick your ass up right or again it's here and I'll put a hand on the sacrum here grip the pelvis tilt her ass down okay. Other things to be aware of in your positioning in doggy style now depending on the length of her legs your height her height we need to be able to get the the right height positioning here so let's say if she puts her knees up together closer so bringing these closer together okay so not just just this good yep yep yep cool all right so with her knees now closer together she's too high for me all right like if I was inside her now I'd have to kind of lift myself up to get into the right position right so if her knees for example are too close together her butt's too high then I'll just reach to the inner thighs so it can I'll do it probably from behind and just say open your legs a little bit there all right so I take the thighs and I'll again I'm saying it as I'm doing it right because if I just start doing this she doesn't really know what I'm trying to do all right just put your knees together a bit more okay so I want it to be clear I take hold open your legs stop all right so then I put her in the right position now let's say I opened her out too much right now so now her legs are too wide and if my cocks here it's too high for her right so right now her butt is too low for me so to adjust that I'm gonna reach around take the pelvis take the actual hip bone and then in one move I just go like this all right so I just tucked her into me so I just lift her up this one I don't need to give a verbal command because she can't really do much anyway all right so open your legs open your legs wider okay so now she's too low grip grip tuck her in all right so it's like I'm just pulling her into my pelvis which lifts her up to the right height now if she then ended up in the wrong pelvis position then I'd okay so from this position now I can feel that I've got good penetration height I'm stable on my knees here right so my body weight is down my midline which means that I'm free to use my hands I'm not leaning over trying to hold the body weight with my back and so on right so this is the position I ideally want to be in now what can happen is some women will push back right and then can you bounce up and down so like bounce up and down yeah so you'll have this situation where you're having sex with her and then she's pushing back right so what she's doing is she's going beyond this line here and now she's leaning her a lot of her body weight back into me now this is okay for some time but this is not a comfortable position for me to hold for a long time because every stroke I have to push her body weight away from me and if she's strong and she's bouncing back then this is really tiring because I have to see how much of my body I have to use to get just normal penetration depth it's going to get very tiring in the legs but lower back right so if you notice that a girl's like leaning her body weight back pushing it into you sometimes what I'll do is like I'll hold it I'll hold my position and then she can bounce on my cock right because generally when we're having sex we want one partner to be active one partner to be passive if both of us so you bounce at the same time as me if we're both she's bouncing and I'm fucking at the same time yeah we might be able to get a cool rhythm and get like the right rhythm which we have right now right but it's hard for me to maintain consistency and it's it's not going to be ideal for either of us to come right so it's better that I hold her in position I work doing what doing my stuff for a while and then at some point okay maybe she then takes over right now she's bouncing but I'm holding a pressure sit like so I'm in one place and she's the one that's using my cock essentially to fuck herself with right so she bounce so she's bouncing on me like so right so I can guide from here but she's doing the work then if I take the hips or the butt and I hold her in position you can see here the legs so her basically as I penetrate I can I can just do this just with the pivot of my hips here right so you can see my upper body is pretty much stable I'm not using any strength except for clenching my butt and rotating my hips so and then if I open out the pussy by gripping the butt I can just get my tilted hip and I can get quite fast actually I could get like very fast penetration without much effort at all right I don't have to do this thing that a lot of men are doing because they're not very flexible in their hips they have to create this hinge and so every stroke requires all of my body to be involved it's tiring and unnecessary as opposed to this yeah where I've secured her in place and I'm tilting my hips okay sure I can get longer strokes if I want to come in and out and do bigger bigger strokes like that and then I can come in deep and get these tilted strokes like so obviously plenty of room here to be working on the butt to be doing all our different spanks our grasping all right so if I'm doing slow strokes it's not that I never want any movement here right like now how she's moving here this would be great for us to if we're coming in we're doing these deeper slow strokes where she's rotating her hips I'm rotating mine so we're working well together so it's not like any either of us is super in charge here we're just working together okay so I'm getting these all right I might lift her up come up here all right so we see from this we have the nice curve in the in the hips here she's at the right level for me from this position I can my body weights on my knees I'm perfectly comfortable here for as long as I need I want to lean forward put my body weight onto my fist here so that I can have deeper and more intimate touch here okay so what I can do now to adjust things is I can get it to lie down so wait so how I'm going to do that I'm just going to place my hand on her mid chest from behind and then guide her down lie down right so again I'm not like pushing her down or she's the one that's moving and I'm just guiding it down into that position right so from here this increases the tilt in the hips opens the pussy out more right so we get we can get deeper penetration here getting into the butt easier right working on anal if we were going in from here okay so this position like so can work on I can even like put her head down and like compress her head into the mattress a bit I'm not pushing over the ears which is there because she might have earrings or it's just she can't hear what I'm saying so I make sure if I'm just compressing for this dominance here I'm not like smearing the hair it's just place the hand and press a little right so she's held into the pillow into the mattress and that can transition from like this dom so she starts from come up all right so if we're here right lie down hold her in place there for some like intense working here all right and then maybe that transitions melts keeping in mind our different holds holding around the hips digging into the butt here or digging in both heels of the palms digging and gripping going from one here taking come up okay so I can reach around get my holds in my hold or reaching around here into the waist okay so we're interdispersing so even though we just have this one kind of basic position which most people look at like this you know just pump away give the odd spank okay it's fine you know that's most sex out there but you see that within this one position there is so much that we can do with it all right so we can transition from this position into variations on doggy so in this case my knees on the inside of her leg but we can put my knees on the outside so for this I'm just going to walk her forward a little bit okay making sure she's in my right position now I'm going to tell her put your knees together as I put mine at one two outside and then she sits back like so so I should be able to stay inside her while transitioning to this position so this position has a different feel it's deeper penetration for the woman I'm sitting back onto my haunches here so I'm comfortable come up here all right so now with her butt tilted out this one doesn't work if her tips are tilted the wrong way so two hips forward that way I won't be able to get in so I need to make sure her tips are tilted she's pushing her ass back onto me right so from there I can get this kind of penetration where again I'm tilting my hips up because I don't have much room to like do big strokes so it's tilting of the hips here which is going to be what we're doing this is a good one because opening legs I can open her legs out here and then obviously I can rub her clip from here and hold on right so I can be caressing inside of thighs rubbing the pussy she can also touch herself from there right so good position and then from there I can tilt into a similar type of doggy as we're doing before but now her legs are open wider right so now I'm getting deep penetration here and it's easy for me to reach through to get hold of her breasts or to wrap around her stomach or to hold on to her right and then from that position then I can lift up a little and then tilt her down to get make sure she's at the right height for me and then I can have sex with her from this position and then I could easily transition back to putting the knees on the inside and then back where we started.
