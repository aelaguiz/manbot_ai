I don't mean to be weird or anything but... You said you were drunk. No, I didn't say that. You've been drinking until now? Where are you from? Norway. What's your name once again? My name is Sylvia. Sylvia. A pleasure. Do you wanna go for a coffee maybe tomorrow? There we are. Wow. Okay. Nice to meet you. Get a hug. A pleasure. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Have a lovely day. Thank you. You too. We talked a little bit. You feel excitement. You feel tension. How are you doing? Before you were like, oh, I'm about to do it and now you're just like smoothly getting used to it. Yeah. I'm very surprised that I managed to first go from getting on a date tomorrow to tonight. You already made plans? Yeah. Amazing. Was it like the cold water? Like once you're in, it's not that bad. So the next exercise I want you guys to do looks like this. Hello. Excuse me. Uh, I totally don't want to be weird or anything, but, uh. Working. Gotta go. Thank you. You're gonna hear it. Come on. Come on. Come on. Uh. Uh. I'm sure it's gonna be weird. Uh. Yeah, this is weird. Uh. Yes. Yup. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Are you okay? Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Are you okay? Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Are you okay? Uh. Uh. Okay. Uh. Uh. Uh. I know this is a joke. Come on. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. It's really hard. Can we please? Uh. The next exercise is the following. It's an exercise to learn to acknowledge her rejection. There will always be a no. There will always be not yet. There was some kind of rejection. And we want to train ourselves to be able to read why she might say no. There's always a reason, right? No. No. I'm really interested. Of course not. No. No. No puedo. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. I'm sorry. No. How was that? It wasn't so bad, huh? Everybody feels warmed up? Yeah. You're approaching a stranger not so hard anymore? Doing freedom exercises like going like, uh, or just saying hi, giving simple compliments. And still, sometimes, doing that, you could still get her number. It's like, it switched my whole attitude. So it's an eye-opening, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. "}
