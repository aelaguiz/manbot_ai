If you want to date a girl long term, if you think that she's like, you know, quality material, she's like, she's a keeper, look for a girl that is a giver. What I mean by that is, I mean she wants to give, she wants to serve, she wants to please, she wants to give you herself and her time and her energy and her femininity. Why is that important? Because it's one of the most powerful things a woman can do and can share with a man is nourishment, blessing, femininity, you know, her feminine essence. Now there is an exchange here because in a healthy dynamic between a man and a woman, when you have a very giving woman, what she's often really lacking in the man as a result and a reflection of that is that he is also giving to her but in a different kind of way. So it's often more like the man is able to lead and take care of and create a kind of a clear container, a clear strong space for her to feel comfortable, to be vulnerable, to connect with herself so that she can allow herself to want to go into that feminine sort of state. Now in my experience, I mean there's a ton of different people out there doing different things, there's a lot of different styles of women and I warn you, some women are selfish, some women are narcissistic, some women are immature, some women have had a lot of things in their life given to them for free and they never really had to work for anything and they don't really care about taking care of anybody else or wanting to give or wanting to share or wanting to be really feminine for a guy because they don't have to and they've never learned that lesson and maybe they never will learn that lesson. So you need to also realize if you're with a girl like that, how much do you really want to spend time with that because ultimately, that kind of girl is going to be a big investment. I mean she's going to take a lot of time, she's probably going to be high maintenance and ultimately, you're going to end up in a position typically where you're the guy who's always trying to work hard to make things work because she's not really willing to meet you halfway and to give in return. So make sure you're looking for somebody who's a giver, somebody who's nourishing, somebody who's a good person, a good, sweet, nice girl, a girl that wants to share and that's also going to pay off in places like the bedroom because she's going to want to please you, she's going to want to explore, she's going to want to give you good experiences and learn. So if you're able to give her your masculinity, create the space, make her feel safe, make her feel okay to be in her vulnerability as a woman, then she's going to want to open herself to you, she's going to want to give herself to you and that's a blessing, it really is a blessing and as a man, it's very important that you respect that and that you acknowledge that and you take care of that so that you're not damaging her and also hurting yourself in that process. Now that is something that takes a bit of practice, it's something that you need to develop emotional intelligence about and then it helps to have things like sexual skills and physical skills like learning how to like touch and lead and all these things that will happen through dating and that's also why it's important to have a broad experience of dating with lots of different girls, with lots of different tastes and different needs and you know, sleeping with different women at different times will show you so much about different women. You know, some women are really sensual and they just want to be constantly affectionate. Some women are not particularly sensual and even though they might have a very high sex drive, sometimes it's only in some moments for a short period of time. Other women are not very sexual at all and some women have a high need for affection but they don't have a high sense of need for sexuality. There's all these different dynamics and also as a man, you need to learn how to navigate those things and understand the different natures and the different codes, the different languages of different women and for example, something to check out which is a powerful thing for every man to understand in general and I wouldn't say it's the complete answer but a useful model to look at is the five love languages and the five love languages explain that different people connect and love each other based on their primary love language. So for example, from memory, the five primary love language is quality time, there is physical touch and affection, there's gifts, there is praise and acknowledgment and there's one more that I can't remember off the top of my head right now, it'll come to me in a minute but the point is that depending on what those languages are, you're going to start to work out like how are you connecting with this girl and what are yours? For example, my primary love language is a quality time and physical touch. So I know that I'm having good quality time with a girl and she's giving me a lot of physical affection, I feel loved, I feel connected, I feel good whereas if I'm with a girl who needs to hear constant praise and gifts then I need to be aware of that because if I'm trying to make her feel loved by giving her quality time and affection but she's feeling unloved because I'm not buying her gifts and giving her praise then they've got a problem there but if I understand that then that's going to make a big difference in making that relationship work if that's something I want to do and also it can be very useful and is very powerful if you have a partner that at least has one of your primary love languages because we have at least two and oftentimes more and in some ways we could say, yeah, we all like them all but we often have one or two that are really strong primary ones and when we have those, we feel most met, most acknowledged, most appreciated so be aware of that and how you're matching on these different love language kinds of levels. The next thing which is also important and it is related to that is find a girl that can love you. If you want to be with a girl long term, you want to settle down, you want to create something, you're not sure whether that's a good idea or not, make sure you find a girl that can love you. Now, this is a complicated topic to a degree because what is love? Well, love is a big interesting thing and yet again, we learn about love over a lifetime. It's something that is not easy to put into a box because there's many definitions, many perspectives, many variations on what love is and how we can relate to this concept of love. Now, in my view, as I'm sitting here right now relating about that idea of love, I look at it as if love is an ability to meet somebody as they are, to bless them in who they are and to wish the best for them to be all that they are without judgment, without constraint, without control, without possession. Now, we've got a bit of a paradox here because on some level, you could say, well, that's what idealistic love is. But on the other side, you've got conditional love, romantic love because in some sense, I could meet a girl and think, wow, she's amazing and I really hope that she's happy and I wish her all the best and I really want to spend more time with her and I hope she gets to be all that she can be and then she might be out hanging out with other guys or fucking other guys and I need to make a judgment in that moment. It's like, am I okay with that? Is that within my boundaries and rules of what is okay for me? And if it's not, which for a lot of guys it's not, for example, then I'm going to have to deal with that. I'm going to have to come to terms with either creating a negotiation with her to say like, I really want to bless you and be with you and share this amazing journey of love in an unconditional kind of way. But for me to be intimate and feel safe and feel connected on a romantic level, then I'm going to need you to understand that there's some kind of rules that are most effective for creating this relationship, for allowing us to work together. Now, the thing to realize along with that is a relationship is, it's a container. It's a series of negotiations and rules that allow two people to share time and energy and ideally get the best out of their time together. Now the thing is, not a lot of people are aware of that. They just fall into the unconscious habit patterns of like, oh yeah, we're in a relationship and what often happens is people turn this thing, which is actually a dynamic, living, constantly changing negotiation, they turn it into an object as if a relationship is something they can put into a wheelbarrow or that they can somehow produce and go like, yeah, I'm in a relationship, like as if it's like a piece of toast or something. No, it's not. A relationship is not an object. A relationship is a process that is constantly being negotiated and the more that you're able to negotiate and understand your terms of negotiation, the easier it's going to be for you to be able to stay in a healthy sense of relationship.
