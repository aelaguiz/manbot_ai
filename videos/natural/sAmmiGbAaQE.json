Right now all the life coaches, business coaches, performance coaches, optimization coaches and coaches coaches are doing what they can to stay alive, right? So I'm on everyone's mailing list as you should be when you're looking at your competitors and everyone is going for the same marketing position at the moment and I know I have been doing this as well, which is essentially to be asking you to look at what are you doing with your lockdown time? Are you wasting that time by, you can write the list right, Netflix, jerking off, jerking off to Netflix, freaking rolling around your bed eating Doritos or whatever it is that you're doing to fill your minutes and hours and the suggestion from most coaches is that of course you shouldn't be doing that, you should be optimizing this time, you should be getting into an awesome workout routine, you should be figuring out what you're going to do with your career if you've lost it, well then you should be starting a dropshipping business or online coaching business or you should be doing something to hustle to make shit happen so that you're ahead of the curve when the doors open, something like that. Now I don't disagree with those sentiments, right, that's not bad advice, okay, so if you are stuck at home and you have just spent six hours a day playing video games and you know, I don't know, getting in Twitter wars, is that what people do? I've never used Twitter, then yeah, that's not the best use of your time, sure there's lots of other better things you could do, you could learn a language, you could learn a musical instrument, you could learn how to start a business, those are all things that you could do and why would you not? Because that's better than wasting time, right? So I'm there with all these coaches on that perspective and I will no doubt in a week release another video where I talk about that as well, how to optimize your time, how to not waste this very odd and unique time in history when the world pauses, which I don't know about you, but for me at least, one of the benefits, I know there's a lot of downsides to this, but I don't have a sense of FOMO anymore, like I'm not missing out on anything because nothing's happening and so I know myself and Alex and the crew when we're in like really intense crazy cities like New York, we don't really feel like staying inside writing marketing copy, we want to be out there experiencing life and that is part of modern life, right? You're scrolling through people's Instagrams and you're like, oh, that lifestyle, I want that one, I'm missing out on something. Right now, no one's really missing out depending on, of course, not like Madonna said, this is not the great equalizer, I've got a fucking mansion with 30 acres luckily and some other people are stuck in a 30 square meter, what's going on today? The traffic is just going bananas today, what is going on with this, peak hour and that's a pretty funky van, yeah, it's not the great equalizer, many people have an awful situation and other people have a pretty good situation, so I don't want to be the person that's saying that we're all in the same boat but we are all in the same boat in the sense that things have stopped, right? So no one can really move too far ahead of where they are, I mean, there probably are some people but most people cannot. So what this time does give us, aside from some time to think about what's next and that's definitely what I'm doing, I have to, right? My business has totally changed, I was a live coaching business and now I'm not, so of course I'm moving into being an online coach more than I used to be and starting an organic farm and doing other stuff, right? So yeah, of course you will need to be able to pivot and use your time effectively but what this period in history gives you or forces you to have the opportunity to have is some time for healing, some time for introspection, some time for allowing yourself to feel certain emotions that maybe you've never allowed yourself to feel and these will not all be positive ones, right? This is not a motivational video in the sense of like, I want you to be positive all the time and hustle and be productive all the time and always see the silver lining on every shitty cloud. What I want to look at here is what about the other parts of being human such as being sad, such as being lonely, such as looking into your past, maybe into your childhood and looking at traumatic events or patterns that were given to you probably by no fault of your own, maybe by your parents or by your social conditioning. That's why I think that you should, yes, hustle for sure. Mind if we head up into the forest over there? Nice. Yeah, sure, hustle, get shit moving, get buff, get ready to approach girls when you can, learn skills that you haven't had time to do for sure and I advocate that and I will be teaching that on my upcoming Lifestyle Design Academy but I will not only be teaching that. I'm not just a hustle monster and there is this like addiction to hustle culture and hustle porn because you probably know what I mean by that, right? Like Gary Vaynerchuk, he's hustle porn. He's awesome. Like I check in on him every now and then and every time I'm like, where does this dude get the fucking energy to do this? You know, he is just so positive, so on it, his information is good, it remains to be good. How's that going to work for you going up hills? Alex is alright. It's like, you know, any time you look at one of these Steadicam videos and it's me gliding through city streets, there's always someone and it used to be Alex and now it is again because we don't have a media team anymore. There's always some guy who has to go do this for an hour, so, you know, let's get some, send some, send him a pizza, I don't know. Anyway, hustle porn, right. So there's all sorts of these coaches, right, where they put out a lot of information. Some of it's very good, some of it's shit. Some of it's all hype and, you know, glamour and some of it's very good. So that's up to you to discern what's useful and not useful, but it can be as addictive as any other form of high stimulation content in that you get a little hit, right? You watch a Gary Vee video or some other optimised super positive dude and you're like, yes, that's it. I should do that and I feel good. You got your perspective. I feel and I get a little spike of adrenaline or dopamine with the feeling that, okay, I'm doing something. But often you don't, right, like, and even Gary will talk about this. He'll be like, stop watching content and start executing. So it's not, I'm not singling him out in any way, but there is a tendency to absorb this kind of information and you probably do it with me, right? Like people binge my stuff or any other coach that they like and they have a feeling by absorbing this information that they are making progress and they are making progress in some sense. You're rewiring your mind, you're maybe questioning old beliefs and replacing them with better ones. There's, there's lots of, obviously there's a huge amount of value in getting good information, getting good wisdom, internalizing it, processing it, and then executing on it, right? If we don't execute on it, then it just becomes theoretical knowledge and you become an armchair hustler. But I can tell you because I'm one of those guys, right, I'm a positivity, motivational mentor coach dude. It puts you in a strange position where you can't show weakness, right? You're not actually allowed to do anything other than positive things, right? In terms of what you're presenting to your audience. Because I think most, most guys, does it, firstly, does anyone notice that I say because in a really weird way? You do, right? I, I know. I don't know why I do that. It's, it's because, because, because. Not sure why. It's just that one word, it just comes out like that. I'm aware of it. I'll try to change it, but it's going to keep coming out because I'm a weirdo. Anyway, you're, you're put in this funny position where you, you have to always be like hustle, positivity, grind, you know, don't waste time. I don't have time for any of your, you know, insecurities or any of your issues. It's like, that's all excuses. Let's cut through the bullshit. Let's get to the point. Let's hustle. Let's grind. Let's get shit done. Let's execute. Let's make fucking money. Let's get, increase all metrics and blah, blah, you know, that kind of shit. You just have to do that forever. And that's not really true. I don't think so for most, most coaches out there, because I presume they have bad days. I presume they feel depressed sometimes. I presume they try to do something and then it fails and they feel shit about themselves because they did their best and it didn't work. Right? So all of these things, I presume they have childhood issues or things in their past that they probably need to clean up and that still affect them today. I assume this because I know that's true for me. And what I want to talk about more in detail today is this essentially is about healing and therapy, right? This is a time where, yeah, okay, you've got time to do stuff that you should have done. But I would say just as importantly, and maybe for a lot of guys out there, much more important, probably much, much more important is to use a good chunk of this time to actually heal yourself from wounds that you have either created yourself or have been created in you by other people or circumstances, because if you don't clean that stuff up, it will remain with you throughout your life in some form or another. And it will tend to calcify, like as we get older and we tend to get less adaptive and more stuck in our ways, our histories start to get ground in, like at first they're like a line in the water and then a line in the sand and then a line carved in rock. And then it becomes, you know, these habit patterns become very rigid. You know that because your parents have them, your grandparents had them, all the people around you have them. They have these habits that they don't seem to be able to shift anymore. And you can see probably looking at your parents, do you have this clear issue, dad, mom, that I can see if you just did something, anything, like talk to somebody about it, went and meditated for 10 minutes, took some MDMA or something, that you'd probably get some kind of breakthroughs. And that can be frustrating when you're a person that wants to evolve and seeing, you know, your parents that you love being unable to evolve even if you offer to help them. I know that that's been a case for me. So I want to say today that firstly, it's okay to feel sad, especially now. It's okay to acknowledge that you're lonely, right? Like if you're alone, like I'm very good at being alone before, I'm actually less alone now than I was before the Corona thing, ironically. Before all this went down, I was here by myself for six weeks, literally by myself. I mean, I saw Augusto and that counts for a lot for sure. And I have a cat, uh, which I don't like cats, but now I do because I need the affection. So like, I'm very good at being alone. I'm not an extrovert. I don't need people around me all the time to, you know, to express myself like some people do. However, it doesn't mean I don't feel lonely, right? It doesn't mean that being alone is the thing I want to do for the rest of my life. And for a lot of you out there, you're alone in an apartment or you're, or more or less, you know, okay, you might have a housemate, but it's some dude or girl that you've sort of ended up with in your college group house or, you know, that's, it's not necessarily your best friends. I'm lucky because I have very close friends and collaborators living with me now, but they're not necessarily your best friends, not necessarily the greatest lovers of your lives or, you know, close family. People are just put in pods and units all around the world and they have to deal with it. And that leads you to feel lonely because we're humans. We need people around us that we, not all the time for everyone, but in general, we need people around us that we love and care for and can communicate with. And a lot of people don't have that right now. And so what I, what I think would be a better use of this time than just beating yourself up because you're not achieving enough, right, because some people can't achieve fuck all right now. Like if your reality is that you had a job, you worked hard at it, and now your job is gone. All right. Like that happened to my stuff. I had to fire, or at least temporarily fire half my team. That's not their fault. It's not my fault. You know whose fault it is. Ask David Icke. Don't ask David Icke, don't, don't do it. Okay. It's the fault of some little microbe that has splintered around the world and has caught, wreaked havoc on economies and communities and led to millions and millions of people being laid off and a hundred thousand plus dying and all sorts of other shit things. So allow yourself to feel those things, to feel sad, to feel robbed, to feel cheated, to feel that this is unfair, to feel like all that work you put in for all those years and that thing, which has now just been ripped away from you, that that's a, that's a tragedy, a personal tragedy for you. Right. And, and also don't feel guilty that your situation is not as bad as other people's. Right. Like I, I'm struggling with that too, because I, you know, when I have days where I'm like, Oh, this sucks. I lost, you know, my business is tanked and you know, I'm away from people that I want to be from. And I'm like, well, I've got it fucking sweet compared to everyone in India or, you know, the 20 million people in the United States who just lost their jobs or, or the people that are fucking dying. Right. all the people that are directly living, you know, have had family members or close friends die. I haven't had that happen in this situation. So you can have a bit of survivor guilt where you're like, Oh, I shouldn't, I shouldn't feel any negative stuff because other people have got it worse. Now, I'm not saying don't have empathy for other people and don't, if you can help others, you know, you can donate money or you can help in some kind of way. You can get on one of those things where you talk to a granny in a, in a, um, retirement home, uh, to make her feel like someone cares. Like, yeah, sure. Don't be selfish. Give if you can and in ways that you can, but at the same time, you need to allow yourself to feel your own personal tragedy and not just now, right? I want this video is okay. It's happening in the middle of the Corona crisis in 2020, but I would hope that in five years, I don't know. I mean, hi there five years from now, please tell me what like the very old, the very young and the very infirm tastes like when you put them in a smoothie because that's the dystopian reality you guys living in now. I don't know what it's going to be like, probably not that bad, but my hope would be that you could watch this at any point and, and, and even if it means taking a weekend to yourself to actually maybe for the first time, acknowledge your own pain, acknowledge your own sadness and loneliness, acknowledge the fact that your parents fucked you up in some way, which most of them did, right? Because they weren't given the perfect handbook on how to do this. Um, you should, right? Because hustling and pushing and working does not solve those things, right? It solves other things, right? It solves poverty sometimes, you know, if you get to get it right, uh, it solves a feeling of like not, not achieving things like, of course, hustling and hard work and smart work, uh, is very important, but you don't hustle your way through therapy, right? You don't, you don't grind your way through a, uh, a meditation retreat. You take time to sit with yourself and when, and if necessary to sit with a therapist of some sort and go through things. And that, and that's what I really recommend that you do. Recently, I did an interview with Zan Perrion. It was a really wonderful chat and, uh, we liked each other a lot. Yeah, I guess you guys could tell. And we intend to hang out when we can. Um, and we talked about a lot of stuff, but one, there was one thing that when I was watching back the video later, I thought, I think I need to expand on that a bit because I think the way we presented that was a bit too blunt and maybe not kind enough. Uh, I don't think it was untrue what we said, but I think it wasn't as nuanced as it could be. And we were talking about, you know, I was saying, I'm fucking sick of answering this question. How do I get over the fear of talking to women? It's like, in a nutshell, I paraphrase myself was, you know, I'm like, at some point you realize you either are going to do it, like you must do it. There's because the reason that question frustrates me and let me clarify that. So when, you know, every day someone writes me the question, what's the best way to get over approach anxiety? Or like, you know, how, like as, because what they're asking is the problem is in the question. I don't have an answer. I don't have a, I don't have 47 words I can say to you that will solve that issue for you. And nobody does because there is no piece of information, right? There is no, there is no hidden secret that is being withheld unless you pay X amount of money, right? When, when, when men come to me on workshops, when they used to back in the day, when they, when they, when they did, they did once, people used to pay me a lot of money to come and help them through this, the old, that back in the 2019s. When people come to me in the, you know, on the workshop, essentially they're saying when they rock up on the first day, how do I, how do I get over the fear of women? Because they're there and they haven't talked to women. And I don't give them an answer. I give them some tools, right? So there are definitely tools that can help using meditation tools, using mental reframing tools, using physiological anchors. And there's lots of other, there's lots of things I can do that will assist me. Yeah. That'll make it easier, but I don't give them any answers. I just take them out and walk them through the process, right? So yeah, on the first day, one of a workshop, I teach them some meditation that will help them to calm down a bit and to be more present, more in flow, more in their body. Cool. And then we just go and we do it, you know, and if I have to, you know, I'll physically make them do it one way or another. And that's the answer. You know, the answer is how do I get over my fear of women? I'm like, let me show you. Come over here. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe he's like, what are you gonna do? Okay. Calm. Stay. Okay. See that woman over there? Go and talk to her. But how do I get over my fear? I'll show you. Just keep walking, keep walking, keep walking, walking. Now open your mouth. Now say hi. That's the answer, right? Like, and then he does that on a workshop a hundred plus times or more. And then he knows the answer then, right? The answer is how do I get over my fear of women? Oh, I go through the process of approaching women and then I see what the fear is like and I see how it affects me. And then I learned to process it and then it becomes something I can do, right? So that's what I meant by that. Like, that's why I'm sick of answering the question because the question is wrong, right? It's not a question I can answer. It's something I can show you how to do, or you can just force yourself to do it in whatever way that you can. And that's when I said, you know, really at the end of the day, it comes down to that there are some men who just know that they must, right? And that was the case for me because I knew that if I, it was just so abundantly clear the difference in life was way better if I could meet women than I wanted to, way worse if I couldn't. So therefore I had to do this thing and it was uncomfortable and scary and so on. But I went and did it and then I'm like, oh, that felt, whatever it felt like, I got rejected or I didn't, or she liked me or she didn't like me. And then I started to see, okay, the answer to how do I get over my fear of women is to go and talk, say hello to a woman and feel that fear and then process it, right? The other thing that we were talking about, this led into this conversation, was we were talking about childhood trauma. And I think Zan said something along the lines of prior to recent history, nobody had a good childhood, right? And so if we think about that in terms of what we would perceive to be a good childhood, two functioning, well-adjusted humans decided to have a love child born only of pure love. The child had all its physical emotional needs met. It had all the opportunities that it could ever hope for. One of those uber childs who they play Beethoven to in the cot and then they teach it three languages from the age of five and they allow it to learn in its own way. Whatever, all of these modern parenting tools and the parents love each other and everything works, right? So the child from zero to seven, which apparently is when most of your traumas happen, most of the wiring happens, it's all perfect. So you get to come out as this golden child that then experiences the best out of life, doesn't carry any baggage and then is able to pass on this wonderful loving thing into the next generation, right? So Zan's point was that nobody until recent history, and how many people had that out there? Anyone in the comment? I would just like to see what you look like. Do you shine in a special different way? Is your cock bigger? I want to meet one of those people, but I haven't yet. Liam had it pretty good. Liam's a decent example of coming from a good background. Liam shines, right? So his point was that prior to modern history, where let's say at least health and safety were a thing that you could be assured of, but of course that doesn't happen in most places in the world, does it? Right now it doesn't. Really what we're looking at there was 1950s, 60s, 70s in the Western world when employment was high, when economies were growing, when populations were lower, when opportunities were everywhere. I remember my mother saying, back in the 70s, if you wanted a job, you just went out and got a job that day, right? There was no such thing as unemployment. It was just like, do I like this job or not? Nah, I'll go and get another job, right? That was the situation in Australia in the 70s. If you were intelligent and able to work, then you could work. Right now that's not the case. Plenty of intelligent, hardworking people out there who can't work. Okay, and sure, corona will pass, but the unemployment won't. Companies will stay lean. People will be cautious. Consumers will spend less. Whether or not it's going to be a recession or a global depression, time will tell, but things are going to be tough for a lot of people for a long time, and maybe for a lifetime for some people in some places. So the point that Zan was making was that, back in the day, like we're talking tribal societies, early agricultural societies, feudal societies, childhood sucked because, firstly, you had a 20 to 50% chance of just dying at birth anyway, so that wasn't very good to start with. You didn't even get to start. Fairly likely your mother might die in childbirth because that happened a lot back in the day. Also very likely that you or at least one or more of your siblings would get horrendous diseases. Things like a toothache was a death sentence. Things like an infected abscess was a death sentence because they didn't have antibiotics or they didn't understand germs. And then, of course, periodically, plagues, warfare, raids, natural disasters, crop failures, droughts, all that stuff would just roll through your environment definitely at least once in your own lifetime. So you would experience situations where a disease would wipe out half your village, or where the crops would fail and people would starve, or where the king came in, sent his men in and said, I would like every man from the age of 14 to 40, here's your stick and please run at those knights because that'll slow them down for about eight seconds, which will allow us to send a catapult of burning pitch over into you and them, which might mean that I get to take a little bit more of Wessex. Oh, that's how I imagine kings did it back in the day. So there was all sorts of fucking nasty horrors that you had to deal with. So therefore, a happy childhood was not really an option in the way that we would understand it today. And then the extrapolation we made from that was, well, how did people deal with that? They just fucking did. They didn't get to lie on therapist's couches. They didn't get to whinge about it on Instagram. They didn't have a government giving them handouts or giving them healthcare. So none of that shit existed. It was the libertarian paradise that you libertarians want. Everyone for themselves, look out for yourselves. And if the village starves, then cool, the village over the hill will move in next spring and take it over. So life was hard, brutish, short, and people just dealt with it. But the question of how did they deal with it? We don't really know that. I mean, in recorded histories, we may know some experiences, but remember that most recorded history is recorded by the elites. And recorded history only goes back several thousand years or depending, you know, China, some 5,000 years and Mesopotamian tablets that showed taxation records from wheat around from 5,000 years ago. But we didn't get a diary from a peasant working on the Nile in 6,000 BC talking about how they felt about their childhood. We don't know. So we don't really know how they dealt with it. But I would say the guess that people just processed things and just had stiff upper lip and like, cool, all right, sister died, you know, mother raped, father off to war, you know, cool, I'll just, I'm a man in the like primal sense of the word, and I'll just get through that. And I will not only survive that, but I will be a worrier about that. How do we know that even happened? I would guess that things happened in all sorts of ways. There's a, one of my favorite books, and people are like, how to, how to, no. One of my favorite books is called Plumes and Arrows. And I found this book when I was lying on John Keegan's floor one day, because John Keegan didn't get a couch until last year. He, every year I would go to visit Keegan, he'd be like, do you think I should get a couch? I'm like, yes, get a couch. But I don't, you know, I don't even sit on the couch. I don't watch TV. I'm like, you know, I just like to get up and go for a walk and have tea. I'm like, yeah, but other people, like, if you want to bring a girl home, which I know you do, I've seen you do it. And I know you've managed that without a couch, but it's a good place to transition to sex. And it's also a good place to hang out with your buddies. And, you know, Keegan would be like, yeah, yeah. And he'd think about it, but then he wouldn't do it. Last year, he got a couch. Looks nice. We hung out on it. Works. However, a couple of years ago, I was lying on the mattress on the floor in Keegan's place and I was stoned. And I, and I just reached over and pulled, there was a bunch of books and I pulled this book out, Plumes and Arrows. And I started reading it and I got sucked in and, and then he gave it to me. So it's here at the farm, signed by John Keegan. He got it off some dude left it there. He'd never looked at it. And what it was, was a book written by a, I think it was a geologist, an Australian geologist or surveyor or some kind of scientist who went to Papua New Guinea, which is the, one of the big islands North of Australia. And what had happened was most tribes, right? If we look at like original tribes, tribes that were Stone Age tribes, tribes that have been untouched by Western civilization that haven't been influenced by them. Most of those had been discovered from the, you know, from the age of exploration, which is actually the age of conquest, right?
