Today is the very final day of our Black Friday through to Cyber Monday sales where you can still get up to 50% off the mark price on all our online digital training programs. Now we've had a few guys contact us about paying with crypto or doing payment plans and yes, this is available. So you can contact us directly support at the natural lifestyles.com. The emails in the description, hit us up, we'll work out a deal. And now a little clip where I take Hayley Quinn on a disastrous day where I decide to just go and be really nice. See how that works. Enjoy. So you said you were in advertising, right? Yeah, yeah, I am. So cool. Oh, thanks. Yeah. I mean, and I mean, I don't actually don't know much about it. But like, seems cool. Yeah, it is. I mean, on the cutting edge of things, right? Oh, I guess so. I guess I do more of a sort of support role. Oh, right. Wow. Thanks. Does that mean social media support or sales or what is it? It's more when someone has a sort of creative vision. I'm the person that sort of probably helps sort out some of the administration stuff around that. Oh, that's fascinating. So like you're right in in there on the ground making it happen. Yeah, I guess so. I mean, I quite like it. Wow. It's great. Yeah. I mean, I must say you're choice of blouse is beguiling. Really lovely. Yeah. Matches earrings, which matches your hair. It's lovely. Yeah. So anyway, what's the plans for the summer? You got any exciting things happening? Not really. I think I'll just be chilling mostly and just hanging out. Yeah, that's cool. Really nice. I can imagine you being good at that. Yeah. You know, I mean, yeah, I mean, for me, it's like I find chilling. Yeah, not as probably not as good as you. Yeah. I mean, for me, I don't have anything crazy planned either. I'm just doing a bit of work with some nonprofit organization in Africa. Oh, OK. Do you like Africa? I mean, do you? I've never been. So I don't really I don't really know. I don't I like to travel more like in Europe, I guess. I understand that. Like, it's not for everybody. It's I mean, you know, not everyone's cup of tea, so I can totally understand if you would be into it. Yeah. For me, it's not that important. It's just I mean, I've been doing it, you know, full time for the last eight years, but it's it's just a side thing. Yeah. Anyway, well, it's really pretty. The ring. Oh, thanks. It matches mine. It does, doesn't it? Yeah, it's lovely. Was that a present from someone special? It's actually from my ex-boyfriend. From your ex-boyfriend? That's wonderful. Lovely guy. Lucky guy. I mean, maybe. So I would say eagerness, willingness to please like this by you know, where I see it a lot, actually, with guys is when they're doing the initial approach. They do what I call the compliment bomb, which is I just want to say you look really attractive and that is a great shirt and you seem really chilled as well. And I like what you've done with your hair. And the woman's just standing there kind of perplexed as to where this compliment bombardment is coming from. And it comes across, I think, is kind of sycophantic, like someone actually on the down low wants to get something from you. And so in order to do that, they're trying to kind of massage the situation by giving you as many compliments as possible. And really, that actually, you know, bit of a controversial phrase here, but it objectifies the woman, I think, in a negative way where she doesn't feel understood. She doesn't feel like she's getting recognition for anything she's actually contributing. It's just like whatever she does, you're just going to compliment her and be a great guy because you ultimately want something from her. Right. So what they would call like covert contracts where I'm giving with the apparent idea that it's free, but really what I'm trying to do is accrue credit here in some way or another. I'm trying to and it ties back to what we were talking about, like the need to impress to if I've got to do something performative and give this woman positive feelings and agree with her all the time and not rock the boat, make her feel super comfortable all the time, because that's what might make her like me as opposed to their sense of like, okay, I'm interested in you, but I need to find out you need to qualify yourself to you to me and vice versa. The other thing that happens there is it's just such a constant release of pressure. It's like if I'm nodding and smiling and agreeable every moment, then you never get the sense of like, did that guy understand me? Or do I need to invest more in this? Or is he really listening to me? Or there's a bit of tension, a space just to create mystery. I think the most, one of the most attractive things is feeling like genuinely understood and dare I say it's seen by somebody else. And that often doesn't mean that the other person thinks you're like this perfect goddess that's just walked into their life, but actually they appreciate something of your humanity or how you're showing up that day. So I think to be much more responsive, cut down on the compliments and instead of just compliment bombing, just go for one very specific piece of validation, specifically around something that she's actually bringing to the table. So notice how she's talking about things, notice what personal qualities she's exuding and just say, you know, I actually think it's really interesting, or it's really attractive, or it's pretty unusual. I like how you are, blah, blah, blah, whether that's like confident, easygoing, ambitious, kind of sneaky. It doesn't even have to be crushing your competition. Yeah, it doesn't have to be super, super, super all 100% positive, though. The most important thing I think is it's something that she is actually contributing within that moment, rather than you just praising, you know, her earring hair color combination.
