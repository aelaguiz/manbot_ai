That's really all it is. Okay, David. When using the tongue to please a woman, which areas of the body are good to start with to escalate properly? Okay, my note on this is be very judicious with licking. Because licking is... Like no slobbery licking. Yeah, licking can be a really irritating sensation. So in terms of using the tongue, don't lick someone's face. Do people lick people's face? Yeah, I've had girls, I've had bites, licks, like really annoying stuff. Don't lick inside the ear hole. That's an annoying one. Very annoying. I don't lick girls lots. I might give her one, maybe occasionally one lick on the neck, but again, if it's a slobbery lick, it's bad. I'm usually using much like wetter kisses or a little bit of a bite, not usually licking. Obviously the genitals and the nipples and the breast, yes, but I think also if I was like licking the nipple for a long time, that might not be great. So I'd say that's one of those things which is like a spice, which you'd use occasionally as opposed to all the time. Definitely find erogenous zones. They're going to be different for different people. The inner thigh, because there's, I was explaining how the nerves that make the vulva really come alive. They do stream into the inner thigh area. Then a little bit of light licking or nibbling can bring that on. But too much there also isn't great. Definitely skill, like even don't use your tongue like you see it in porn. You want to be able to make out with the pussy versus like doing tongue actions that can be captured on camera because those hard, weird, jutty tongue things usually are not wonderful. But if you're making out with the pussy, like you're actually like French kissing, it's usually a much more effective use of your tongue. Be very aware if you're spiky on the face like me, you got to like put the lips on and be very aware. Cause if I get that and I'm stabbing that into the clitoris, that's yeah, imagine someone like... But sometimes it's lovely. So you could, it just depends. Yeah, a little scratch. Cause I know there'd be many times where I'm just not aware of it. I'm just like... And then I feel a scrape, I'm like, oh shit, I forgot I'm covered in bristles. There's just a couple of days left for you to join the Lifestyle Design Academy with enrolments closing this Sunday, the 17th of April. So if you'd like to join me, Dr. Sayeeda and many other of my elite mentors and collaborators for the Lifestyle Design Academy, click the link in the description and we'll hope to see you on the first day of the course, which is next week. Back to the video. When talking about refraining from satisfaction and then rewarding, so orgasm denial for example, or command command reward, you mentioned that it increases the dopamine release. Will hedonic adaption to sexual experience occur over time? So I guess that means that you reach a baseline, a new baseline, or do we just trend towards BDSM or more intense sex? If so, can you attenuate our pleasure baseline down over the course of a session, days, weeks, months? Okay. That's a really interesting question. I wasn't sure that meant, and I'm sure that I know what it meant. So if you have like, you know, a smorgasbord of amazing sexual experiences, does that then become vanilla or normal, normalized, and therefore you need to add hooks and chains and whips and all sorts of other intense stuff gearing towards maybe BDSM in order to get the same kind of hit, I guess is the question. Well, that is the general path that has been mapped out is that, and that's, there's supposedly no such thing as sex addiction, but whatever that thing is that makes a person less and less satisfied, need more and more intensity, which is basically the entrainment of pornography. Then you go to more extreme porn and then you go into like forbidden things and basically developing even maybe a pedophilic habit because you've, you've, you've gone to that extreme. Yeah. That, that is like one pathway, but it's, it's not actually the only thing that's available. So ancient traditions say like Tantra, real Tantra, not the Neo Tantra, but the actual practice of that, what you're doing essentially is understanding that, yes, there's going to be peak external experiences through many things that make it, so your system needs more and more stimulation. So what you need to do is actually at times almost cut that off, go inwardly and amplify pleasure from even just feeling like the breeze on your skin or just a little scent and you start to re-sensitize your body and becoming aware, paying attention to more subtle cues and that variety of stimulation, so it's not always external and more extreme. Sometimes it becomes more subtle and you have to pay attention more. That helps modulate and then it's kind of like you just get to have the whole spectrum instead of just one direction in the spectrum. Yeah. Yeah. That's why when we're teaching, we teach like subtle arts, tantric arts, frequency type of sexuality, as well as like the, the friction based or more and more stimulatory sexualities. Yeah. Cause I've seen that certainly with people in the kink scene where like, yeah, they need more and more needs to get wilder and more violent in order to get a rise out of them because yeah, I think they are getting desensitized, but yeah, if you blend that in with these more subtle re-attunement then like, yeah, I mean, I, I think I'm kind of intuitively doing that cause I, whenever I then go back into the extreme stuff, it is, feels pretty fresh. Yes, exactly. From Calvin, how long, regarding pauses, how long are you talking about? Two breaths, half a minute, two minutes, 10 minutes. Okay. The length of time is not important. Don't, what you don't do a pause. Like the guy said, good girl, right? Which would be to just stop and just be frozen, immobile for some amount of breaths, right? That's, that's not what I mean by a pause. Like think of it more like idling. If you had a boat or something, the engine was still like chugging, but it's not going anywhere. So yeah, if I'm pausing with a girl, I'm still, I still have like a gentle amount of like little bit of hippie undulation, right? So this may be a little bit of rock. So that means the end of my cock is maybe just doing that gently inside her. So there is still some contact and some movement, but it's, but I've minimized it to the point where I'm, I'm not in danger of coming, right? So I can, I can gain control of my arousal state and I can, and we don't have our, we're not distracted by all the moving pieces. So now we can both bring our awareness back into our bodies or into our genitals. I would also say a nice pause, if you're not pulling out and you're still in, is if you breathe deeply with the pelvic floor, then what happens is the head of the cock expands and contracts with the breath. And that can feel really nice. There's not a lot of movement, but you're using that pelvic floor to push blood through the cock and, and that creates almost an electrical pulsing inside, really lovely experience. And it, it kind of settles the nervous system as well and builds arousal. So that's something I often do when I'm first, as you call it seeping, and I call it docking. Like when you first put your cock in for the first time, even if I'm going to move, maybe let's say we're having a, it's going to be a really passionate fuck in the back of a toilet or something. The first stroke still, I will take that moment, five seconds maybe to enter and for her body to shift and change around me. And if, if we have like, then I might move into hard fucking or I might not, but there's always that. And then, so once I, that first entrance stroke may take me a minute or so. And then when I finally push it all the way in, then I flex and then I swell the end of it as well. So she get that, she's getting that sensation of gradually filling it. And then the last part of it is expanding and swelling, which seems to go down well. So don't worry about timing the pauses. Like you'll feel it. Sometimes it's just a moment and sometimes it is a longer one. Yeah. Actually, when we were in the class recently, there was a guy, one of the students who'd done a lot of tantra training, he was quite good with that stuff. But what we had one session where all they were doing was they had the girl's blindfold and they were taking them on a sense journey, right? So they were touching them and leading them and so on to like immerse them. And I could see with him that he was so in his like tantra zone. He was so in his like pace that he didn't notice that she was bored. He was doing like a really, like he was, it stopped everything and it was going for really subtle feelings. And I could see for a while that she was okay with that. But then he was stuck on the pace and decided that it had to be this pace. If you decide that it's two breaths, two minutes, whatever, you'll be wrong. You need to be able to like have a pause and undulate with the girl. And then, you know, after some breaths, you find that she's getting aroused and she starts pushing back. Okay. Maybe it's time to increase. What we're saying here with everything we've shared today is sexual mastery is the art of deeply listening and responding to what's emerging moment to moment. That's really all it is. So just if you can start trusting yourself more and really allowing yourself to listen with your body, watch for the signals and relax into what you're receiving and following that. I think we all have erotic intelligence. We just think that we need techniques. So we can bring that erotic intelligence online a little bit more through the listening and responding. It's kind of like a good dancer. Instead of like being locked into a certain technique and moves, you start listening to each other's bodies and the music and then you dance. Thomas says, I have a vibrator and my wife almost always asks for it. Is there a married man on here? Get out. No. We like the married man. But she only wants to lay on it while I penetrate her from behind. She never lets me use it on her. And she does not seem to enjoy that. I wonder how I can introduce that in a way that opens more types of play. So I've seen this before where women have a very particular thing that gets them off their life lab or something where it's like that's their position and their mode. I think if you decide together as a couple, this isn't going to be quote unquote sex. We're going to do like a pleasure exploration and you frame it in a way that we're just going to play and just see, you know, I just want to explore your body in different ways and I don't need you to have an orgasm. And if you want one, then we can do what works. But for now, it's to see what, especially if you're married and you have sex with the same person over and over again, it is really good to expand the erotic landscape and to frame it that way because we get into ruts and routines sexually, especially women, like you said, have a very particular way. And if a woman's addicted to a vibrator, it's almost impossible for her to break the routine. So it's actually important that she does because it's really limiting her ability to have a wider spectrum of pleasure. So would you say as a self tool, women, it's not great for them to be using a vibrator every day? Correct. I have some self pleasuring flows that I teach women and there's a variety of them. Some are just external flows where I'm guiding them to open their bodies in a very different way externally. Some are internal masturbation flows where I'm having them explore. And a lot of women have no idea what their erotic landscape is. They just from the, you know, all they know is the vibrator on the clit and that's it. So it's really important if you are with someone you care about and you do want to expand erotically that she also starts to be willing to expand her own self pleasuring because that does translate. Yeah, I think that's a good way to put it like that. It's not about because her counter to that, I guess if she was, if it was a debate would be this works, this feels good. This other thing doesn't feel as good. So I think that that phrasing in that way that it's not about like us doing the one thing we like, but let's explore and give it, giving it a chance to, right? Exactly. And you can, I guess like some of the things you could talk about how that affects you as well. Like I hope she cares about that. Like in terms of it turns me on to watch you or I really want to, you know, understand your body better. Um, and that's, I think that's a cool way to bring it up as like, this is an experimental play session. Yeah. And I mean, honestly, there's no limit to pleasure. So as you start to explore more and you expand land landscapes, you suddenly discover something new. And I have clients, like I said, all the way up into their mid seventies, having the best sex of their life because they're continuously exploring and expanding with their partner, what's possible. So I love that because it just means you have a lifetime of what's, of pleasure versus thinking it's reserved to young people and very specific acts. I noticed the navel also sends off an odd tingle when pressed or lightly itched. Could this be incorporated into fingering? Maybe. Yeah. So the navel, not so much, but there's an area between the navel and just above the pubic bone. There is like some sensitivity of it for some women, they don't like it, but if, if you're inside and you're pressing down on the belly and kind of contacting your fingers, it can create a bit of a current and it can be very, very sexy that way. But don't forget that the labia are very sensitive. There's um, all the pleasure nerves even go into the inner thighs. They go into the perineum down around the ass. So don't be afraid to actually play more with a wider range of experience. And a lot of times guys forget that women can come through their nipples. So they almost avoid, like they ignore the breast after the foreplay and it's actually nice to include them. Yeah. I think with the breast, you need to really communicate with women. Exactly. Some don't like it. There's so much variation. And some, sometimes you have girls with huge tits, they can't really feel anything, sometimes vice versa. So I usually will, I'll ask the girl pretty early, I'll say, how do you like your breasts touched? And she might say, I'm not sure. And I'll say, okay, do you like this gentle crescent? Do you like the grasp? Do you like the nipple? And I'll squeeze it and I'll say, you tap you in. That's about right. So you can get these little gauges within a few seconds. It depends on the time of the month. Yes. Of course. Immediately before her period, she's usually going to want beast sex. So what she can tolerate pain wise goes up quite a bit right before she gets her cycle. That's just a hormonal thing. Have you tracked that in yourself? Yes, absolutely. It's when the walls shake from the screaming. So I think it's also, I think it's great if you know somebody or you understand the female cycle a little bit to even find out where she's at because there's emotional sensitivity at certain parts as well and less in other parts.
