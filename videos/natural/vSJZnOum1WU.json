So we're going to have a kind of a psychological preparation. What's really important, and I mentioned this yesterday a little bit, but I'll reiterate it in a different way, is when you have shadows come up, don't fight them because you feed them. So one thing that you can do instead is you can accept them with love. Once again, it sounds like a cliche, but don't resist in the sense that you are judging yourself or criticizing yourself and making it more difficult for yourself because that's basically just creating a habit pattern of attention that is not necessarily productive for what you want to do. So representations become very important in how you understand the world and how you understand yourself. So there are five primary senses. We actually have a kind of a sixth, it's not really sixth sense, we have a sixth faculty, which is our interpretational faculty. So we could call that like the meaning layer. So I see, I hear, I feel, I taste, I touch, but I also talk to myself. I tell myself things. So internal representations, they happen to us all the time. You're doing it right now. You're looking at me, you're thinking of things, you're thinking about how this affects you, how it affects what your position is right now. What does this information that I'm sharing with you mean to you now related to the past? How might you apply it to the future? So there's all these different functions going on inside you that are trying to answer two really primary questions actually, two very important primary questions that are always sort of churning over in the depths of your unconscious, which is like, how does this work? AKA, how does this moment work? And who am I in this moment? And if we can sort of safely, sanely, securely have a sense of like, how this works is it's basically under control and who I am as someone that has a position within it that's not under threat, then we tend to be chilled out. If we have this interpretation of reality where it's like, how this works is I don't know, and I'm out of my depth. That's why a lot of you guys have trouble with cold approaching women, for example, because like, I don't know what to do. Like, what do I need to say? What's gonna happen in the unknowns? Like anything could happen. So that's where that kind of unknown fear can come into us. And it happens in multiple domains of our lives. So if we can't understand how it works and who we are within it, then we tend to go into primal brain responses to try and like, understand how reality works. So we come into contact with reality and then we have these internal representations. Internal representations have a massive effect on your nervous system about who you feel that you are and how you think things work. One of the most primary, powerful internal representations that you can create for yourself is a vision of yourself in contact with your resourcefulness. Now, once again, that's a bit of a trippy thing. What does it mean to be in contact with your resourcefulness? So think about that, feel into it. What does it mean to be in contact with your internal representations, your sights, your sounds, your visions, your smells, your taste, your internal meanings? What does it mean to be in contact with those things in a positive sense, moving you forward into the future? So what does it mean to see yourself strong? What does it mean to talk to yourself with respect and with power? What does it mean to feel a sense of like ability inside yourself? If you're gonna go and talk to a woman, you can run an internal representation like she's not gonna like me. I can start talking to myself like that. I can start creating a vision in my head that I'm gonna get rejected or I'm gonna run out of things to say and people are gonna look at me and be like, oh, idiot, or whatever. And then, or I can see that she's gonna have a weird look on her face or something. So I create this internal representation which means something bad. And then I'm in the reality, there's the woman, but I've created this internal representation of I'm uncomfortable, I don't wanna do that now because I've already created an enemy inside my own reality by creating a negative internal representation. So I can create a positive internal representation. Whatever you envision yourself to be today might not be what you envision yourself to be tomorrow, but you just take your best step forward now. So keep feeding that vision of yourself moving forward. There's three stages to transformation. The first thing is that you suffer. And mostly because you suffer because you don't know what your causes of suffering are. There's just stuff going on that's not really within your awareness. It's not really within your power. And that's often the way when we're kids, right? We just grow up in an environment where we're just exposed to difficulty and we have no ability to do anything about it. So we just get exposed to this thing. That sets up a kind of a pattern of suffering which becomes a habit and it lives inside the subconscious mind and it starts to play out in all these different ways in our personalities, et cetera. But at some point, if you're lucky, you'll start to become aware. You'll start to see the patterns. You'll start to become aware of what was causing suffering. And at that moment, you start to shift into awareness. You start to shift into ability to be able to have choice. And that's where the focus piece starts to come in. And when you start to have awareness, then you can start to redirect your focus somewhere else. And this is one of the core teachings of Buddhism, for example, is like you suffer, but if you wake up to the causes and conditionings of your suffering, you can do something different, which brings in the final part of the puzzle, which is you can liberate yourself. You can learn to be strong. You can learn to be powerful. You can learn to create a better world for yourself and for others around you. You can be a positive contributor to a changing reality that's moving away from suffering and moving towards liberation. So it's really good to have that kind of simple three-step process. It's like, notice where I suffer, become aware of it, make better choices to liberate myself. Rinse and repeat forever. My next plan was to dive into the subconscious mind with the power of trance. Do you guys wanna go into like a trance journey? So welcome to this journey of yourself. You are the innocent child, the magical child, and you are an expression of your own creative being. Imagine as vividly as possible what it would be like to start to see and sense and feel this future perfected self coming into contact with you. As you begin to imagine and sense, feel the IntelliKey aware of you, here with you, holding love and affirmation for you. It has absolute knowledge, absolute knowledge of your greatness. You are coming into consciousness, dreaming yourself awake. Feel the IntelliKey opening a doorway to the cosmos, to the greater self of the cosmos, feeling you're connected to all space, to the stars, to the galaxy, to the universe, to the mind of God. Whenever you need to feel connected, all you need do is remember, you are whole, you are present, you are free. Allow yourself to join with a larger universe of powerful, grounded, creative being. Welcome back, gentlemen. Well done, I'm impressed. You all did a great job, actually. It's a lot, it's a lot. We went a long way. Okay, all right, well, if anybody needs me, I'm here. Otherwise, let's go and have some food and ground ourselves a little bit, huh? What does it mean to look at the world through different perspectives and different filters? Because something that we all do as human beings is we use our focus, our attention, of being able to look places and understand things. And then from that focus, then we tend to place meanings and understandings on things. And depending on, let's say, the paradigm in which we're placing our focus will depend on the kinds of reality that we're experiencing. So I introduced guys to the basic paradigms of understanding the world as a spirit paradigm, as a psychological paradigm, as an energetic paradigm, and as an information paradigm. And they're all kind of part of the same thing, in a way. Like, they're all different ways of looking at the same basic experience, but they're all very different in the sense of how they apply themselves to the world. So that was the beginnings of that. And just starting to set up some ideas of what does it really mean to use your focus and to use your attention in terms of your paradigm and how are you stuck in your reality and how can you change your reality in some way. The next thing that was also really important in that class was I wanted to introduce them to their own inner sanctum. So their own inner temple. And this is an old idea in some ways. It's an idea that you see in many different traditions, which is the idea that we can go inside and we can work with this internal landscape. And there's lots of ways that people do that. But one of the ways that I was presenting is the idea that you go in and you create this inner temple. And inside this inner temple, you have elemental gateways. And inside of those elemental gateways, you have archetypal representatives. You have, let's say, masters of the elemental energies, which are archetypes. So you have the warrior, you have the lover, you have the king, and you have the magician. And you wanna get to know them as representations of your deep psyche because they represent elemental forces. They represent characters. They represent skills. They represent mindsets. And depending on how strong or weak you are, any of those kinds of archetypes can have a big effect on how you represent yourself in the world and how you feel about yourself. So it was a very profound exercise for the guys. And I got a lot of really positive feedback from it. It really brought stuff up for them to see where they're strong, where they're weak, and where they'd like to focus a little bit more. So definitely a very powerful thing. You'll notice that a lot of these exercises, there's a huge focus on the spine. And in most people, this area has a kind of amnesia. There can be blockages here that can interfere with a lot of things. But I'm gonna give you some basics, some fundamentals, some things that you won't be able to access on YouTube. The reason I've picked cup wear and why I do cup wear just as my own personal practice is that I like to see all of my physical practices play. If I enter a mindset of I've gotta go to work out, I've gotta go to work, I go into the mindset of I gotta get it done. One, two, three, four, done. And I shut my mind off from creativity, from curiosity, from wonder, from expression. So if you come into it with a mindset of that playfulness, you'll get something out of it new every single time. And every single one of my physical practices is a form of expression. What I'm taking through today is going to be a lot of non-linear movement because probably in every single gym you walk into, everything is linear. Most of the common practices, running, swimming, everything's very, very linear. And the thing I love about cup wear is that we have quite a fair bit of control of our hands, like quite a fair bit of finesse. But when it comes to our feet, most of us are just dead trunks. They can move forward and backwards and that's about it. So a lot of cup wear is creating that control with your feet as well. And it just gives it an overall awesome dynamic. Let's get into just a few basic warmups, then we'll get into the fun stuff. Let's see if we can all get this. So this one, so coming here, twisting your body, and then coming, that's it. Now twisting and behind. Good. \u266a Upbeat music \u266a \u266a Upbeat music continues \u266a In, defend. In, head low, head low. Good. One hand on the floor, and back. Good. Sweeping the leg around, and back. \u266a Upbeat music continues \u266a You're encouraging them on, but you're also creating a form of expression, a rhythm that they can dance to. \u266a Upbeat music continues \u266a \u266a Upbeat music continues \u266a Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. \u266a Upbeat music continues \u266a We're going to take control of somebody else's body and we're going to start to, it's quite similar to what we're doing with James on the ground the other day with being rolled over with your legs but now we're going to be working the upper body. So tense your arm and resist me a bit. At first, if I want to move him around, not quite as much, but I can feel that he's holding the weight and I'll feel tension in there and see that his muscles are engaged. He's not letting me, he's not giving me his arm. So I can move it but if I let go, he's basically got it stabilized. So some people are practiced at letting go and others find this quite challenging. So if you're with someone you can feel they're holding it, take him by the shoulder and loosen it. And they get that real sensation, that's what it's like to let go of my arm actually. So once I have the arm, I'm going to just hold it in a way that's comfortable but what I want to start to do is I'm going to start looking at the range of the motion. Now obviously if I move it in the wrong direction too far, it's going to be bad. So I don't want to push his shoulder out of its range of motion but as the shoulder goes there, it's got more motion here. Where else can it go? And you'll feel like sometimes I can feel he engages for a moment and then I take the weight again. Now he's loose. All right. So what else can I do? Now if I wanted to isolate the scapula, I can take him by the shoulder here, so the elbow and now here, now I can feel he's moving that. So when you feel them engage, let them loose because the point of this, I mean it's for you as a partner to understand the body better but it's for the receiver to really get this sense of looseness in motion. Through working with men over the last decade, I've seen that one of the biggest issues that they have is stiffness. Stiffness in the body, in emotions and in thought processes. And so I decided to try and attack this through the body, looking at a whole range of different movement technologies from Shaolin Temple through to Ido Portal type of movement culture as well as Taoist systems of martial arts, so that the guys could experience a totally different way of embodiment. And there's obviously a direct correlation between our body, emotions and our thought processes. And as the guys start to learn to become truly loose, spontaneous, improvisational, to actually have fun with their physicality, this then reflects through their emotional and mental states as well. So now you can very slowly start to investigate the range of motion, you know, I mean the shoulder has a lot of range, right, so you can do big circles. I felt he was a bit tense but maybe it's because I didn't apply the pressure correctly. Doesn't matter. If it feels tense, wiggle it. If they let go, good. If not, keep moving. Very similar to what we were doing yesterday with James where we were leaning pressure into the person and then they were getting into their state of water and resisting, right? So what we're going to start to do is you're going to move around the body and I want you to do the same thing to start with, right? So we're just picking points. For all of these next series of exercises, it's really important as the helper that I'm really conscious because if I'm just kind of like doing this and like not really aware that's not enough pressure or that's too much, right, especially when we start getting into rippling through the body, it's not going to work, right? So always make contact, be present, feel my hand and then really consciously lean and I'm doing it at the same intensity as he's increasing his lean and I can feel, okay, you can take that. We don't need to go to his absolute limit and then I'm going to slowly back it off and he's going to slowly back off as well, right? Because we don't want to have this, where I'm jerking. We're in unison. We're combining pressures because later we're going to be climbing on each other using this kind of stuff, right? So you need to be able to be really responsive. I'm not just like, oh, it's not my turn so I'm just doing the pushing. This is just as important. Okay, so we're going to start, you're going to see contact, listen to the body, apply pressure for three seconds-ish, release over a second or two, move into different points. What does it mean to truly relax? It's not sitting on a couch with a beer. It's actually quite a complex and advanced skill set and I remember my days back as a massage therapist when I would pick up somebody's arm or an area of their body to start manipulating. Often I would feel that they were holding it and I'd get people to try and let go and they didn't really have a concept, not all, but many people didn't have a concept of what actually it feels like to be truly relaxed. So what we're looking at in this class is ways to really get a sense of the difference between tension and relaxation because so many men are holding all these different points of stress which exhibits in weird postures and weird movements and which then creates a whole lot of tension in their face and in their emotions and thought processes as well. So with these exercises we're getting partners to assist to take control of your body so that you can really get this sense of surrender and letting go which is incredibly therapeutic and wonderful sensations. So you can see with all these different exercises that guys are playing with the differences between complete tension, complete relaxation of yielding and relinquishing control to somebody else so that they can get this experience and really internalize, okay, this is what it really feels like to be upright, not slobbish and not lazy, to be upright and graceful but at the same time truly relaxed and really enjoying being inside this sack of bones and flesh that we live in for our entire lives and realizing that there's a whole lot of work that they've been doing they don't have to do, which you shouldn't do any more work than you have to. Life is pain and suffering and work and we do have to deal with a lot of physical hardship so when we don't have to we want to be able to enjoy and relax and embody and then out of this comes all forms of interesting and wonderful expression and here at the warrior training we've been showing guys that what it means to be a man, masculine, to be a warrior is so much more expansive than toughness, than just resilience or power. That actual complete power comes from the ability to move between fluidity and strength, to move between grace and explosive power and in this way you get this really well-rounded experience of what it means to be a man and then that reflects out into your life because you need to be able to be gentle, you need to be able to be sensitive with your lovers, with your friends, with people working under you, with your family, you need to be able to be empathetic, to be able to read people, to be able to be sensitive to the present moment not just being strong and having linear movements which make you tough but to be able to be flexible fluid in all areas as well. What's going to happen now, so James is going to do the same thing, he's going to apply pressure points to me except what's going to happen, so just pick one to start, okay so what's going to happen instead of me only maintaining my structure he's going to dial up the pressure and then I'm going to lean into it and then he's going to start re-yielding and then at some point he's going to vanish and I stay in this position. Now he's going to do another one, see where this is going, alright so he's going to yield until he creates me into a shape. The fact that you end up in funny shapes is cool but the actual lesson here is in terms of contact and force being moved between people, so it's the active person makes contact, dials up the pressure from zero up to five whilst the other person matches it, then the person over the active statue overpowers them and the other person dials down to a three and then a two, one and they both relax, okay so that's where the real artistry of this comes in. In this exercise we call pressure statues, the guys are learning to isolate certain areas of their body because often men experience life physically as a box on sticks, so their torso is kind of one unit and this reflects badly in the sense of not being able to have fluidity in your hips, through your shoulders and meaning that when you walk you look very stiff, when you dance you don't look very cool and when you fuck you've only got just the fist motion going on instead of being able to isolate the hips and get the whole body involved. As we start to speed things up and loosen and get much much more sensitive with the application of pressure meeting it and then moving towards it, overpowering, yielding, it starts to form into a very interesting kind of hippie style improvisational dance which as you can see the guys are having a lot of fun with. So I'm just going to introduce this idea, we're going to do a lot more on this in the next class. So what I'm going to, I'll just face you this way, I'm going to break James into nine points, so shoulder, chest, shoulder, we're in the solar plexus, two, four, five, six and then hip bone just below the belly button, yeah below the dantian, hip bone, right so one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine points that we're working on. In the same way that we've just done, I'm going to be pushing these points, essentially that's what the game will be. But I'm not doing this, anything like that, right, that won't help him at all. So in the same way, I make contact and then I'm going to lean, I'm going to push my body weight through, so do it for me, okay, so what I'm going to do is I'm going to yield with this part and then I'm going to let that force ripple through my body and then come back up. So I'm like one of those things at a car wash, knocked over and just goes or one of the agents in Matrix. So he picks any of the nine points, so he's going to just lean the pressure through. Now along the midline, we don't have as much space, but can we yield, for sure. We sink the chest, the chest empties and then we let it ripple back up, stomach goes in and then ripples up. Okay, so I'll just do a few points on James, so make contact and then he lets it ripple back up. As you saw when we were trying to do the rotations here yesterday, this is the most challenging part, right, so how do I yield from here, can I, you can't, right, so it's that I'll collapse the upper body and relax the intercostals and then it'll move. So we will turn the hip, but let's get as much shoulder action first, let the shoulder yield, yes, much better. We planned this workshop so that there will be a lot of overlap between the different coaches. They all have different specialties, but as with all areas that we teach, we're looking at underlying principles. We didn't want to just give the guys a whole bunch of random exercises that would be a confusing toolkit, not being able to glue them together and make something coherent out of them. So in the lead up to this workshop, all of the specialist coaches got together and we saw, okay, here are the principle overlaps between our different work and so we looked at how we can start to stack and build on each other's training methodologies. One of the big things that came up with all of the physical coaches is rotations, right, so being able to isolate different parts of the body and to be able to rotate the spine, the joints, because this is vitally important in terms of health maintenance and obviously as we get older, we get stiffer, we tend to move into rigid movement patterns, the physical environment around us is flat and concrete, everything is square and edges and so naturally this has led human beings to become more linear and rigid in their movements. So we, at this retreat, most of the time it's barefoot, we're working on different planes, whether it's crawling, rolling, upright elements, which are looking at all of the different ways that the body can isolate, rotate and move. Again, this keeps coming back to the effects of grace, of expression, of coming across as a truly embodied and relaxed man and it's not a, we're not trying it on as an act, it's not like, okay, look at that guy and then try to put on the suit of what that guy moves like, this all comes from internal precision awareness. So we combine the aspects of internal work, meditation."}
