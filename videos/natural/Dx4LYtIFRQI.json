Are you up to Matilda? Are you done with your day? Sorry? Are you done with your day? Are you chilling a little bit? Came to New York for a seminar, just walking the streets? Excuse me.

Because we are the authors of the music. It is constantly new to us, and we get more into it. I am a musician from Germany. And I do music from Greece, Germany. Where do you have the most contact? I am a professional musician. And we create great songs. We wrote songs when we were still poor. And that is our tradition when we create new music. And that's where our calves appear to play. So when we write songs, we find something Vai told us. I appreciate your encouragement. Without encouraging me, I would never have done it myself. Yes, thank you so much. I am putting a lot of importance on strategy and decision making. Keep eye on the road. Thank you."}
