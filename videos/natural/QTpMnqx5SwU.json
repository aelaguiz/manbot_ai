I'll give you 20 You know how much a hundred gribner is three euros Yeah, I see how that more fun and that's what the gypsy lady said. That's what he thinks you're worth. Oh Did you know that's because that when she said oh she said you this now that what she was translating was the gypsy said? Oh, that's all he thinks you were 20 gribner I'm gonna have to listen to that again because I I missed that. Oh my god, that's so bad Hi there girls, sorry for Now you have to talk to me Don't you speak English? No, no Hi, you're very cute. I would like to meet you. What's your name? So I don't speak Russian this is the Russian you speaking or Ukrainian Russian Should we do Google Translate? All right, well you're very cute and I just wanted to say hi so You know, I'm gonna let you go enjoy your evening You blew yourself out Yeah, I ejected yeah, which you didn't have to I Know. Mm-hmm. I mean, it's fine. I mean it was a judgment call in this situation I was like it sounded like they basically knew like one English word. Yeah, cool So what the way I would be viewing this is like you're gonna have these situations and the attitude should be How can I make this work? Right, not that. Oh, this is getting all complicated. Yeah, it is getting complicated. Cool. How can I make this work? So the simplest way is like they're like because they were they were curious and not curious They were like teenage girls who were like, I don't know you this what is this? I'm Jana This it was kind of cute right where they're like, no, actually maybe yes The thing is they had walked past me for and they had both like checked me out. Okay, so Yeah, of course there were sort of like some Yeah, I mean I was actual tension, you know, they were curious about this and at the same time Oh, we don't speak this but we want to be here. So right So remember if they're there these girls don't stick around if they don't want to and they didn't you know They were there and then you're the one who like, all right, I'm gonna leave and they're like, okay. Bye, you know I'm gonna let you go. Enjoy your evening So if you if it's all getting all tangled up and I don't know what to do then you say listen you're really sexy Let's go out give me your Instagram Right just to do that you sexy Instagram. So yeah, like just just go for a close if If only to practice doing that under difficult circumstances whether or not you follow it up is irrelevant. Mm-hmm Oh, yeah, and don't jump to Google Translate straight away Right. So if the girls like, oh, we don't speak English or something and say, okay, I speak slowly My name is James your name She's on this mess. Okay, cool. You girls very sexy and you bad girl you maybe good girl I like it I'll keep it simple and then when I if I then when I reach a real like language roadblock where they just can't get a word they don't like I hang on translate and then I'll do it because as you saw when you said I'll Google Translate they were like I don't know because that's all too much trouble straight away. Should we do Google Translate? Yeah, whereas once we're in a conversation and then we can use it to back up things and yeah, sure but start with let's start speaking Slowly I introduced myself I just keep it moving with very simple English and then you find out how much English they speak because some girls speak it But they haven't practiced it and they're nervous and it takes a little while for them to do it and others like those I don't think really spoke much at all, but you would find that out as you start to talk. That's all I'm Jonas do you speak English what you do know one word? No, no All right, so did I just repeat it Well, basically if you ask if they speak English, it gives them an easy thing to say No, like you just start talking in English and then you start talking in English And then you start speaking in English and then you start speaking in English and then you start speaking in English It gives them an easy thing to say no like you just start talking in English and then they say no English Then you say you speak a little bit because if if I say hey, do you want to talk do you speak English? It's very easy to say no. Whereas if I say Excuse me. What's your name? And they're like stop funny male. You say then I say, okay, you speak English. Yes Little okay, let's start and then I Because otherwise I'm asking her to fix the problem as opposed to me going. All right, we can deal with that problem Here's my name. What are you doing right now? And then we just go from there. Yeah, that's it What a cute girl if you're enjoying this series about what goes on behind the scenes in a natural lifestyles workshop Then you might want to consider joining one I will be running a limited series of live workshops this year starting on the 9th of may in budapest for our first seven day residential This is around the clock training in lifestyle design in a game Seduction lots and lots of infield where you're mic'd up to get precise feedback on your specific issues To make sure that you can master the dating game and make 2022 Epic if you'd like to get on a call with us obligation free click the link below We'll arrange a call and you can chat to one of our team about joining and now back to the video So In these sessions with me We're going to do quite a lot of different things, but i'm going to be focusing in on the relationship with your body The way that you assess that internally and the way that that interfaces with the outside world particularly when we're dealing with Socializing and women so we're going to be looking in these classes primarily at the first principle, which is what? Okay, so awareness Let's do some So we're going to look at awareness With the in terms of orientation of focus with this thing which is the most obvious thing that we can work with this is all complicated and And may not be real who knows what even is that is So this seems to be as real as anything that I can get my hands on right now. So we're going to look at Embodiment how that how you hold yourself In your body, let's get into what I would call optimal Awkward posture that puts put a lot of intense awkwardness into the face Hold that posture keep it and now freeze into it And remember the last thing that pissed you off the last person that pissed you off All right now shake that out how did that feel all right, this is this is my body Let's do this is i'm present Yeah, the way like this is still the james marshall there's a version of me that's this and then sometimes it is this Uh, but that one's not going to help you and it feels awful All right. So let's look at what might be better than that. So let's look at a better posture feet flat parallel knees slightly unlocked if anything's changed or adjusted then Readjust it hips tilted slightly forward spine elongated shoulders relaxed, but not drooped Okay now close your eyes And listen to the sounds you can hear around you and keep them closed because i'm going to come around and just do a couple Of adjustments on you or check on your posture So while i'm coming around your job is to feel what this feels like Just kind of move your attention around the body feeling this new alignment Whilst also listening to the sounds the subtle sounds like the birds or the kids playing in the park Try to try to get those ones as opposed to the uh traffic see if you can pinpoint more subtle sounds Keep doing that while I come around Okay, relax your head let me stretch it up see your hands are holding out a bit slip and drop Drop your drop your arm drop the weight into my hand Drop it drop it All right, so stand up straight up drop the shoulders open your legs a little bit wider Okay, relax today Okay, excellent. So you can open your eyes now. What is meditation? There's all sorts of ways to meditate But really technically they're all redirections of focus an awesome meditation to do, you know, one up one down you can do it seated lying Standing doesn't matter so my awareness Moves and so I feel toes feet ankle and so kind of like a ring or two rings moving up It doesn't matter what order you're going through. It's just i'm Moving fairly meticulously through okay the front of the body the back of the body Up one arm up the other arm. All right, doesn't that doesn't matter? It's just okay i'm observing the full physical structure slowly as I investigate through then the other street version Is the one we did at the end where it's feet Head head feet This one's really good for infield. That's what I do Right where i'm like i'm going to talk to that girl feet Because i'm just like check oh, yeah i'm here here inside this again, this is the best I got so Let's be be in it, but this will be your first infield Intergame tool and it will make this much more pleasant and it means also when you if you come out of an interaction where it didn't go, well, or you felt weird or She told you to fuck off or something and you and you feel all tense and activated and you're up in your head again Then cool just back down All right, here I am again, I'll let that girl go and then I move on to the next one So the key takeaway from that is However, it is that you are feeling Objectively in terms of like the sensations and whatever that's going on. It's fine That's good. That's the space i'm in right now. I don't need to be high energy. I don't need to be Alpha direct energy or whatever it is. This is the experience I have right now when I go to do my interactions I'll roll over from that space Things will happen My body and my mind will really react to those and I and now I have a tool to start stepping back More objectively each time and going okay, this is not personal. This is this is A body and mind in time and space transitioning and changing all the time and then bouncing off other ones as well That's what it is Hello Hi there Hi there I'm Jonas You look very lovely Are you you're looking like you are eagerly waiting for your date to show up Why No, no, I mean for someone to show up you're looking like you're waiting for someone. No, i'm just walking after a massage Oh Yeah, was it a good massage? Yes, do you feel like you can feel all of your body now? Yes I just thought you looked lovely so I had to come and say hi No, thanks. No, thanks.

Oh, okay Are you like in a hurry to go and meet them? What are you like in a hurry to go and meet them or? No, I think I will drive a taxi Fancy I'm just kidding. Just kidding. Is that usually how you get around in kiev? Do you often just take a cab when you need to go where sometimes sometimes I take subway sometimes Depends i'm asking because i'm i'm completely new in kiev and i'm trying to sort of get a feeling of let me guess. Where are you? Yes, yes, no More to the east a lot more to the east Yeah, you have to cross an ocean But not us not us europe Getting warmer England, no No, I mean england. They were you have you heard about brexit? They're not part of europe any longer uh sweden Very close. I'm from denmark. I'm from denmark Wow You did well, you just have like a bit crazy accent. So I started thinking maybe you are from us because many people from us have like crazy accent so What do you say we go and uh, what do you feel like grabbing a a cup of coffee right now? Now yeah only if I have like Not much time like so it has to be like an espresso like like this No, no You know what an espresso is like right? No, I just have like 40 minutes. 40? 40. That's that's and then you have to take a cab in 40 minutes? Yes. Let's go for a coffee then. Are you up for it or whatever you like? I mean maybe tea or? No, I don't know. I think I want smoothie. Smoothie? Wow, okay. Yeah, yeah. Well, you'll have to take the lead because I'm new in this town and I have no idea where to get a smoothie. We could walk and know some like kind of this place. Should we go there? Yeah. So you're from Denmark? Yeah, I am. What city? Copenhagen. Oh wow. Do you know Copenhagen? Sure. Have you been there? No, but I would like to go. But I can't now because of corona. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hopefully soon. But in the meantime you can ask me any question about Copenhagen and I'll try to make it sound as sexy and as adventurous as possible. I think I still haven't really found out that oh I'm in Kyiv. I live here now. So you live together with your friends. Are you all studying or are you? No, I'm studying. So what do you do now? Working. In like in that profession you studied for? No, no, completely no. Okay. You wanna guess? You're a dentist. There you go. Thank you. No, no, that's fine. So you are a dentist. No. All right, you work in a bank. No. All right, then I don't know. You are a tourist guide. No. And you're actually working right now. I have no idea. You have to give me some hints. I gave you some hints as well. I said like you know we have to cross an ocean. It's an art profession. Oh, art profession. So are you working in an art gallery? No. Are you a painter? No. But you're an artist. Yeah. Oh. I'm a dancer. What's your work? I work in a bank. You work in a bank. Yeah. Oh, cool. So who has the most exciting job of us two? Huh? Who has the most exciting job of us two? The least boring. To be honest, I think it's more like it's a job that gave me money, but I don't love it. You know what I mean? So what do you like to do? I think I, to be honest, I'm actually playing around with the idea of starting DJing. DJing? Like disc juggling. And you know, like with these black around vinyl records. I do that. I have a video I can show you, but it's no, let's not go there. It's nice. It's fun. At least it's super fun. You should try it one day. And I think you would find it have like nice, nice to understand music. Yeah. So what should I see in Kyiv while I'm here? I mean, besides you, of course. It's the main street. This one? Yes. Okay. It's the main square, like Maidan Square. Okay. The, the one that's just up there with the corner of that building. What do you like about dancing? I just dancing since I was five years. You dancing in what word did you say? I didn't hear you. But do you find it kind of like exotic or exciting or like is it sometimes new experiences that you didn't expect? It's nice. I like it. Like my hobby become my work. So I like what I do. Do you go to clubs? Not so, really not so. Okay. Well, don't you like them or is it just too much noise and too little ability to talk to people? Sometimes it's annoying, like too much crazy guys look at you. Are there many crazy guys at the club? They just like watch like who I will fuck this night. Why is that something they're sitting looking for? Oh shit. Oh, sorry. I, I think maybe I have to get going. Okay. Okay. Should we see if we can meet each other in the weekend? Should we see if we can meet each other in the weekend? Okay. That'd be nice. I think. How about I, how about you enter your number into this computer and then I will, do you have one of your phone numbers that you want me to call you? And then I will, do you have WhatsApp? Is this correct? Yes. Yes. I understood. Should I hold your drink? So yeah, I could ride that. Hey, I'm the crazy Viking. Super nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. I wish you a good evening. You too. And enjoy. You want a hug? Okay. See you in the weekend. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. She's nice. She's nice. Yeah. Follow that up. She's sexy and smart and actually very decent conversation and she seemed really pleasant. Yeah. Yeah. Great girl. Good. Like overall great interaction. Yeah. It worked. It worked. It did. It actually did work. She was, that was not a flaky number. She, you know, that was, that was good. So now let. I felt like I was pushing it by, you know, saying, okay, let's go for an Insta date, which I think this is like the second time I've done that. So yeah. Worked totally fine. She was happy to do it. And, and like, even if I hadn't pulled you out, that would have been a good time ish to leave anyway. Right. Cause it's like, yeah, you, you done what you could really in that interaction. You had a little date that would have been a good time to end it. So it wasn't breaking it. Okay. So, and then the back post, I mean, I got a bunch of things. Well, I'll start from the end back. The way you closed is you said, should we see each, should we maybe see each other this weekend? Which was a very weak delivery of a close. Should we see if we can meet each other in the weekend? By then it didn't matter because she was already like, yeah, but it should, it should have really been more powerful. Like, all right, well, I want to see you. You're awesome. Tell her one thing that's cool about her. You want to see the girl again. You tell her something. And especially when you've got a girl like that, who's awesome. You can tell her something that you like about it. Listen, you're really friendly and fun. Uh, let's, let's hang out soon. Can I get your number? I'm just going, or, or how about I give you, how about you give me your number or whatever it is. I just make it clear. Cause if that was a girl where it was any, like she was on the fence, she would have probably said no because you gave her the option of like, should we see each other? And she's like, Oh, I'm a bit busy. In that case, she was invested anyway. So it didn't matter, but keep that in mind. So a good structure is I like you. You're awesome. Compliment her on something. I want to see you again. Not necessarily in that order. Yeah, that's yes. In general. That's a good thing. It's a good thing to tell the girl something that you noticed about her aside from her looks towards the end. That's a good general thing. And that's a, a, a legitimate reason why I want to see her again. Listen, you're sexy and you've got such cool energy. We have to hang out. Give me a number. I'll call you. Let's go out tomorrow. It makes sense. Right? It makes sense to her that, Oh, stranger thinks I'm hot. And he's seen something about my personality. That's a good enough reason for me to give him my number. Um, be aware of guessing games. They get really childish, really quick. So what do you do now? You want to guess? You are a dentist. You work in a bank, tourist guide, art profession painter, but you are an artist. As a rule, if it gets, if she, if the girl says, guess something, I'll do two guesses and no more. I've noticed that, right? Cause they, you're like this, this. And she's like, no, you're like, well, is it a, this is a, that is it? It's like two guesses. I'm like, all right, I'm not playing anymore. Tell me. I was sort of playing it by ear and my gut feeling said that, okay, we don't have to like, go straight to me, like revealing the correct answer. It's not a, it's not a thing I've never done. It's just a, like, it's one of those things that guys tend to get into habits of doing, like, especially with their country. Guess where it is. Is it here? Is it over there? Cause like someone starts doing it to me, I'm already irritated, right? They're just like, just tell me, or, you know, they, I might, okay. But they, you asked, they asked once guess where I'm from. All right. Madagascar. No. All right. You got me. What is it? When you talk about, when people will ask you where you're from, you're from Copenhagen, tell them something about that place and what it feels like to you. Cause otherwise, instead of you're like, have you been there? No. Would you like to go there? Maybe something like instead go, Oh, well, Copenhagen is a, this and that city. And it's got this type of vibe and it's different because of that. So I reveal something. And that's, that's the main issue that you had there, which is one of the most common issues that every guy does in the first days is you reveal very little about yourself. You did, you did say some things, but there's, there's, you were, it was mainly question, answer, question, answer. And then there was only a few points where you gave any information about yourself. So it's just an example of avoid fact exchange and go for how does this feel or how, what does the fact we may exchange facts to orientate ourselves. Where are you from? You're from Denmark. Okay. That's a fact I need to know that fact is useful. Oh, what are Danish people like? Now that's a personal, that's not about that. You can't, I can't look that up on Google so much. I could, but then now it's like, what are they like? Or are you a typical Dane? Right. So that's a, that's a personal question as opposed to a detailed question, right? We're going to work on that a lot. So you're just, I'm just going to throw something to do with emotional impact. That's a way to get into that, isn't it? Everything is a way into emotional impact. Cause guys get stuck on this, like, Oh, there's that GSP thing that does emotional impact. Yeah. But so does this. So does, you know, everything that, where an emotion is triggered. Right. So, uh, many things will get you into emotional impact, but yeah, it's, it's like, if I'm just staying in exchanging details, that's hard for me to feel or think much about that aside from remembering the detail. If it's like, Oh, so do you miss home? Oh, now I have to think about, well, do I miss home? Now that's, that's emotional, right? As opposed to, you know, how many square kilometers is Denmark, which come on. What is it? Oh, you don't even know you're terrible Dane. All right. If you want to get rid of a beggar coming up to you, you, I watched how you do it. You went, Oh no, no, no. And now they've got, they already know they're looking for people who say like, the way you do it, you go not and blank them. Right. Cause the moment you go, Oh no, I, something they're like, Oh, I can work with this. Yeah. But the thing I actually, I was thinking, fuck it. I'm going to buy these flowers, which is, which is why, which was once you did that and then you start trying to bargain them down on price, it fell apart. You know how much a hundred Gribner is? Three euros. Oh shit. Yeah. I see how that, Oh fuck. And that's what the gypsy lady said. That's what she said to her. That's what he thinks you're worth. Oh, did you know that? Cause when she said, Oh, she said you this now that what she was translating was the gypsy said, Oh, that's all he thinks you were 20 Gribner. I've got, I have to listen to that again because I, I, I missed that. Oh my God. That's so bad. Can you, can you tell me how much you want? I'll give you 10, 20. Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter. She'll get away with that as, as foreign. It doesn't understand how things get happened here. But, but yeah, like if it was going to be like how much a hundred, three bucks. All right, cool. There, there you go. There's a few, that would have been a baller move. Generally better not to ask any girls, tourist questions. Like, so what's good to do in Kiev. Cause you saw her go, Oh, you walk up the street. I don't know. So what should I see in Kiev while I'm here? I mean, besides you, like no one wants to like, think about that. Someone comes to Copenhagen and talks to you and says, so what sites should I see? You're like, Oh, I don't want to go read a guidebook. No one wants to like take you around and show you the sites, right? So it's a very common mistake. I mean, guys do it all the time. They're like, Oh, so what's good to do now? The only thing you can do with that and say, so listen, I have, I just arrived in Kiev. I don't know much about it. Tell me something about it that I wouldn't find online. What's a place that you love that's like crazy or fucked up. I think actually that was my intention, but I didn't convey it clearly enough. Yeah. I mean, usually I don't do any of that, but if I'm going to ask something about the city, I'll only do it in relation to what's her personal, like, what does she know about it that other people don't or what, where would she, where would she take, uh, you know, a stranger that wants to see the underbelly or something like that. Right. It's like, we don't want to get into a tour guide conversation because immediately she's going to be bored. You don't want to know it's takes the energy out. You say that in general, you, you try to avoid going to that. There are more interesting things to talk about. I could ask you what she loves about the city, right? That's different to like, because the moment I say, so what's good to do or where's good to go out, they'll just be like, Oh, what do you like? Clubs? Yeah. Clubs or there's streets or something. No one wants to, it's not going to make anyone interested. I don't know if it's notable, notable on me, but I certainly have a certain aspect of, you know,"}
