Being in the present moment is all that's needed to be in flow and so when you're in gratitude, when you're in awe, you're present, like you're present with all that is in it and it grows. Just watching a sunrise or a sunset is a flow state because there's a sense of timelessness. It slows you down, you access timelessness, you're accessing a sense of awe and beauty and most people don't really do that. Even though I only knew him for a very short period of time, he impacted my life in ways that I couldn't even possibly have imagined. The work that he did with ancestry and the love and appreciation that he had for nature and just what he showed by his example has just... I know the shifts and changes that it's caused within me will go on for the rest of my life and besides being just an absolutely beautiful human with the most amazing chuckle, I think everyone who knows him will always remember his beautiful laugh and just so so grateful for the example and the humility with which he lived his life but also just how genuine he was and even though he's no longer with us, he's my ancestor now and I'll do my best to carry on his legacy. I love you James Kogos, you've always been in my heart. It's very very saddening to hear of your passing and you're one of my best friends, you are one of my best friends and we've shared some amazing times together in pursuit of of the mystery, pursuit of life and pursuit of exploration and sharing and together we've been no strangers to hardship, we've been no strangers to transformation, to learning, to bringing our gifts to the world and I wanted to thank you for your presence in my life. I wanted to thank you for being there along the way over the last 10 years since I first met you. I've seen you grow and learn and transform so much into such a capable, virile, powerful, grounded and resourceful man and you were never a stranger to the edge of reality, you were never a stranger to finding your way in the unknown so I have trust and faith that wherever you are and whatever's going on for you that you're on your way and you're part of the great beyond now, the great mystery and I just wanted to say that may you be blessed, may you be protected, may you be guided, may you be whole in all of your greatness and may you be all that you are in your infinite form and may we all carry you within us, may we honor your legacy and your memory and may you live on through us. So thank you also for bringing what's important into clarity, for helping us to remember connection, fragility, love, beauty and the importance of friendship. So yeah, many blessings my brother and good luck on your journey and lots of love and blessings to all those that you loved and are part of your world as well. He said something like, grief is a way of loving something that's no longer in your life and love is a way of grieving something that is still in your life and it made so much sense to me then and it makes more sense to me now. He was much more than a teacher to us, he was our brother, he was our friend, he was such an exemplar of what a beautiful man can be, you know, a real warrior, open-hearted, seeking, powerful yet supple, humble yet strong, you know, like what a beautiful man. I see him whenever I walk through the forests or the land here, I just see him, you know, in his wizard hood and his didgeridoo and I'll always see him out here. That workshop was more than just a workshop, it was a creation of a myth. We were all present with that wonderful man, we were all infused with his magic and we need to carry that with us for the rest of our lives. Much love to you all. Hot town, ooh, let it out on me. Hot town. To see you guys kind of come here in their kind of shell and really deepen in their relationship with who they are and being really okay, just being really, leaving really satisfied with who they are, leaving with a sense of being supported by life, by their ancestors, by the elements of nature and just feeling like a sense of belonging and a sense of tribe. I think what I said at the beginning of the week of them having a sense of, leaving with a sense of purpose and a sense of destiny and self-love and freedom, freedom and to do what they want and not necessarily what people around them want them to do or culture wants them to do, but really what they came here to do on this planet and to be in kind of a sacred relationship with life, very fulfilled and nourished myself that this went super smooth and yeah, I'll be doing more, we'll be doing more of these. When you have a why, you're more likely to pay attention. I have like a mantra that I repeat over which is like with all my heart, all the activities that I do out in life are going to be done from that place."}
