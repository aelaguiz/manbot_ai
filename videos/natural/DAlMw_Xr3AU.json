She can talk in English. Yes, I'm here picking her up, exactly. Because you were late, she had to deal with me. It's your fault. You can thank her later. All right. COVID pickup diaries. What date are we? September 8th, 2020. The end of the world is nigh, so we may as well go and make some people feel a bit better or weirder. Let's go talk to chicks. This looks very serious. Good book. It's good. Hi, dear. How are you? You look very dainty. You guys are nicely matching, looking slick. Hi there. How are you doing? What are you doing today? Nothing. Don't be suspicious. I'm an Australian. We're very friendly people. Yeah? Yeah. And you're very cute. Thank you. And so I want to see if you're also interesting. Interesting? What? Interesting. Oh, interesting. Not interested. I don't know. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Are you doing that because of me? No. I had a test today and two days ago. Really? I'm not interested. I'm not interested. I'm not interested. I'm not interested. I'm not interested. I'm not interested. I'm not interested. I'm not interested. I'm not interested. I am definitely healthier than you in that respect. It's been proven. Oh, no. I didn't know that. I thought it was you. Yeah. It's not very fun. They stick this thing up your nose and twist it. Oh, yeah. I've heard about it. It's not very fun. What's your name? Sorry? Name. Funni. Funni. I'm James. Nice to meet you. Oh. Nah, nah. I'm not paranoid. You know, in Australia right now, they've locked the whole fucking country. You can't leave. There's 8 p.m. curfews. If you go out after 8 p.m., the police arrest you. Because of the virus? Yeah, but they have, like, here we have something like 500 cases a day. In Australia, they have 50. But they're just super paranoid. Very paranoid. So, I'm locked out. I'm a refugee. What are you going to do? I'm just going to be a weird refugee. Yeah, it's fun, actually. Yeah. Are you coming or going? I'm waiting for a lot of my friends. Mm-hmm. Any plans? Um, we are going to have a piercing. And then... Nose, nipple, clit. What are you piercing today? Nose. Just the nose? Yeah, just the nose. Yeah. Um... Wow. I'm going to start somewhere. Are you into pain? Sorry? Do you like pain? No. No. You don't like needles? I don't have any problem with needles. Yeah. Who likes pain? Uh, masochists. Do it. Oh, they love it. They pay for it, actually. I've got a friend who's a professional dominant. You know a dominatrix? Yeah, yeah, yeah. But a man is called a dominant. And so his job is that women pay him to do unspeakable things. That's weird. And the story tells me, holy fuck, people are into some weird, weird shit. Like getting hung by hawks and all sorts of nasty shit. So yeah, there's people who like it. Yeah. But most people like being spanked. That's for sure. I once... How open-minded are you? Where do you want this conversation to go? You want to keep it on the weather? Just stay on the weather? Or you want to go somewhere? No, no, no. Tell me everything. So... It's okay. I'm definitely like a dominant in bed, but I wanted him... Basically, I said, all right, show me what this is like. Because I was like, if I'm going to do this to people, I should understand it. And so he got a cane. You know what this is? Yeah. And he's Australian. So he's like, all right, fucking lie down. Pull your pants down. Like a doctor. He's like, all right, okay, here we go. I'm like, okay. And then he goes, all right, you've got to breathe in three times, and you need to eat the pain. And I'm like, okay. And so he goes, fuck, with this thing on my ass. And it was these three phases. So the first one is this like sting, where it's like a little whip, right? So it really stings. And then you're like, okay, I can deal with that. And the second phase was like a sheet of fire burning from the inside out. Like extremely bizarre. And then the endorphins kicked in, and then it felt like I was on MDMA. Like a... Yeah, and I was like, whoa. That was a journey. Like 10 seconds took me through all of human experience. I know. Very weird, but now I know. Now you have to know that. Yeah, well, you can't forget it now. Anyway, that was the, I just told you the vanilla stuff. You want to hang out sometime? Sorry? Do you want to hang out sometime? I don't know. I don't know. I know. What do you want to do next? What do I want to do? What's your plan? You mean with you? Yeah. See if we like each other. If we can go for a walk, have an adventure. Make out. Who knows? Oh, okay. That's bullshit. People are... I can see it in everyone's... Haven't you seen it? You're looking everyone's eyes like, fucking give me meat. Give me meat. I can tell. Especially with the mask, because everyone's just like... Yeah. Tell you what. I'll get you something, and then we'll go for a walk sometime. You're fun though, I can tell. Sorry? You're fun, I can tell. Like you have a personality. How do you communicate? WhatsApp, Viber, Instagram, smoke signals? Everything. What's the most likely? I don't know. Instagram maybe. Oh, then you have to see my Instagram, then you might not like me. Alright, you add me. Yeah. Hello. Hi, how are you? Hi. Have you done that with my dad? She can talk in English. Yes, I'm here picking her up, exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Because you were late, she had to deal with me. Okay. It's your fault. It's your fault. You can thank her later. Oh yeah, I wrote my name, that's right. Listen Alice. Your mum. Your mum. What if I, maybe I understand Hungarian, then you're fucked. Boo. No. Alright, that, and then... The weather. Oh yeah, are you getting your nose too? No, you already have your nose. Yes. Oh, you're just here for moral support. Yeah. I getcha. Alright, that's yours. Alright. Which way are you going so we don't awkwardly walk the same direction? I'm gonna go this way. Alright. See you soon, bye, have fun. Bye. That was pretty good. Sometimes I'm really good at this. Why that was good was I got irreverent with her, so when we talked about the piercing and she said who likes pain, these are these little crossroad points where I'm using, I'm listening, it doesn't happen all the time, but I'm listening to see if something within the conversation allows for something cheeky. Also, she was cheeky, right, because I could, she had good eye contact, she was smiling a little bit, and it got me in a vibe where I was bouncing that back and it was a cheeky thing where I said things that I probably wouldn't say in other interactions. But the point where it turned naughty or risky in a good way was that point where she says who likes pain, and then I take that as an opportunity to go, because I could have dealt with that in many other ways, right? Who likes pain? Oh, well, you know, yes, you're right. No one likes pain and the human condition is to avoid pain. I could have talked about that or I could have said, oh, well, different people have different pain thresholds, and I could have done all sorts of boring things. Instead, I went to masochist, she laughs, and then we get into the BDSM discussion. Where do you want this conversation to go? You want to keep it on the weather? Just say on the weather or you want to go somewhere? All right. And then I, for some reason, tell her about the time when my dom friend spanked me with a cane and went into excruciating detail and it all worked and it was all good. So I dare you to write those lines down and try and say them to them, girl. It's not going to be good. So what's the answer? Come to the workshop and learn how to do this. It's subtle. All right. That was fun. I like her. Hi there. How are you doing? Hi. Is he friendly? Yeah. Is he a support? Is she? Hello, puppy. Hello, puppy. What's your name? I have a boyfriend. It's I have a boyfriend. She's like, well, actually, how do you know I even wanted to date you? I don't know. What are your intentions? Well, my intentions first is to see what you're like, because I have standards. You are pretty, but there's more. I require much more than that out of a lady. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Just like I have a boyfriend. So what's the point of this? What's the point is that you're a human. I'm a human. And we get to have this human moment. So just give me a fist bump. I'm James. Bye. Bye. All right. So going out to approach people, there's two ways you can do that. You can go, all right, I'm going to work. So, all right, I'm going to walk around. I'm in my space. And I'm going to go and then I'm going to practice the pickup. Hey, what's up? Yeah. Or you can treat the world like it is your living room, like it's your party. Hungarians are grumpy fucks. No offense to my Hungarian friends, the fans, you know that. They're not particularly social people to strangers. But when you blast them, hey, gentlemen, how are you? Looking good. When you blast them with a good energy, hello, lady. Excellent. And have this sense that I'm just reaching out. And I don't want anything. So far, I don't want anything. I'm just like spreading good vibes. Nice smile. How are you doing? I have the attitude like I am a king and I'm riding through my realm. And I'm flicking coppers and pennies and farthings and other types of ye olde currency out to my subjects. And I'm like, yes, you go. And they're like, oh, thank you, governor. Oh, thank you, squire. Oh, they're like, oh, fuck that. I don't want that. I'm like, oh, well, you don't want it? Well, that's all right, because I'm rich. And I should just spread it far and wide. Instead of this like I'm in my space and I'm trying to take, I've got to get a number. I need to do approaches and I need to crack out of my little bubble and then go and do that and then scurry back in. I'm out. I'm out. We're all out. You can't go back in. Well, we can. We can choose to like get inside our own little space and feel separation between us and the world. And then when you, hello, how are you? That's a nice T-shirt. What's it like living like that, guys? I don't get it. Because then what people feel is the lack of separation. Because I'm not, I don't have any particular outcome that I want, which is except just to see if I can connect and give something nice to the world. And of course, if I see a hot babe, then I want to, you know, I have an agenda. I want to share lovemaking. I want to make my life better, her life better. I want us to both come together and give each other amazing orgasms. So I'm not just like, I'm not pretending that like I'm just a nice person who's just like, oh, I'm just a saint who gives for no reason. I get something out of this. It's purely self-interest as well. Because I feel way better now than when I left the house. But if I'd gone, all right, we've got to go out and film infield, so I've got to prepare myself and get all my mad lines together, then it would get all awkward and weird. So now I feel kind of warmed up and now I'm going to go hunting. No, I'm just going to keep doing what I'm doing. Hi, how are you? Do you mind if I walk with you for one minute? I can see you're a little bit shy. But I'm not a dangerous person. I'm not selling anything. I just think you look adorable. Thanks. Yeah. What's your name? Dori. Dori. My name is James. We're actually matching today. Did you notice? We could be in a Benetton ad. Do you want to stop for just two minutes and I'll let you go. You're not in a big rush, right? Everyone has to go somewhere, but you're not going anywhere particular. So what's your story? I'm an art historian. An art historian. Yes. I worked over there in a gallery and now I'm going to buy some wine for the evening's event. What evening's event? It's going to be a finissage event. A what, sorry? It's a finissage. I don't know what that is. It's like the end of an exhibition. Oh, okay. So not an opening. A closing. A closing party of some sort. Yes. It's just some fancy French word for it. Right. A finissage? Yes. Okay. Thank you. Now I have a fancy word to use if anyone asks me. I'll say, oh, is that the finissage? Is there a fancy French word for the opening? It's a finissage. So one is finissage and one is finissage? Finissage. Finissage. What's going to happen is I'm going to say it wrong and then they're going to think I'm way more of a dork. That's the dream of every art historian is to work in a gallery. No, actually I want to work in a museum, but now I'm just working in a gallery because, yeah, this is what I got. But, I mean, you're still in your field. Yes, yes. Which is cool. Because, I mean, I would imagine a lot of artists and art historians, it's like not that easy to get positions, right? Did you get your position because of your excellent skills or also because of your wonderful charms? Yeah, I don't know. Probably both. I mean, in my experience, the people that succeed in life are the ones that are both good at the thing and also good with people. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Nice. That's great. And what else? What else? So do you have some contrasting skills or contrasting experiences or are you really all about the arts? No, actually I like flowers too. Yeah, I'm doing some DIY projects with dry flowers. So you mean you press them? Like in a frame or something? A wind chime? Like a dreamcatcher? Is it like a North American Indian thing? No, no, it's like just a... Stained glass? Stained glass. I don't know. Like in a church? The glass that's... No, no. It's just a... I don't know. It's just a... It's on your door. Okay. I know what you mean. Okay. When you come to the door, there's... Like at Christmas when someone would put a thing like this. Okay. That sounds lovely. Flowers and this DIY stuff. That's good. Like I'm glad you have a skill. Like an interest that's actually tactile and real. Yeah, so many people today are just only on the screen. Yeah. I have a farm in Portugal. And I started to grow wildflowers there. So that's... And vegetables and fruits and like... Because I've always worked with my mind. Always worked with people and with my mind. So I'm really getting into being much more in nature these days. Yeah. It's wonderful. Yeah. I have this old man who works for me. And whenever I arrive from the city, I'm always moving at like city pace. And he's worked there for 30 years. And he moves like very slowly. And then he goes, James, James. And he takes me for a long walk through the forest. And then he comes and he'll show me like a mushroom. And he's just like... And I go, yes. Yes. He really gets into the zone of like be here with that mushroom. Be here with this olive tree. It's very good for the soul. Yeah. Yeah. Sounds great. Yeah. Have you got a boyfriend? Yeah. I could tell you did. What? I could tell you did. Really? Yeah. That's great. Yeah. I mean, it's kind of a fresh thing because I was single for four years. And now it's just happened all of a sudden. That's a good break. Like you needed that break for yourself or... Did you choose that or it just sort of happened like that? No, really. It's just happened. And I don't mind it. So it was good. But now I'm just fine. Just fine? What do you mean just fine? No, no. I'm really happy. I mean, I don't mind if I'm not alone anymore. Yeah. So it's good not to be so alone anymore. Yeah. Humans need touch and love and intimacy. We do. Yeah. Well, I'm very happy for you then. Yeah. It was really nice to meet you, Dory. Yeah. You too. Bye. I will. See you. So right now I'm teaching a workshop. This is my day off. And what I've noticed is as I get more famous or as guys watch more of my videos and when they come to workshops, often they're actually fairly well prepared compared to back in the day where guys would rock up and go, what am I doing? These guys, you guys have been studying my stuff for quite some time. And so what happens is guys come in and they're like, they go out in field and I hear them saying James Marshall words. Right? I hear them saying, oh, hello, gentlemen. I'll show you from over there. And what's your story? And saying things that I might say. And guess what? It doesn't fucking work very well. I mean, it can still work. It's better than saying some other scripted silly line. But what ends up happening is guys want to learn natural game and instead they learn a natural inspired 3% infusement of natural TNL game, which comes across as forced, as not real, and it doesn't seem to stick. And the guy's like, well, I said what you said. Why didn't it work? The reason is I'm me and the way I say things is a product of my personality, my expression, my lexicon, my use of the way I think. Right? And so it comes out in the James Marshall way. If you see any of the other coaches, it comes out in the Alex Leon way or the John Thompson way or the, you know, any other way. The thing that maybe you can notice from this interaction was what was happening here is really subtle micro calibration. And this is really where the artistry of seduction comes in. And this is why guys come to the workshops is not to learn, okay, say this XYZ that we say, which is the natural script. You can do that by watching the videos and you'll see that, okay, it doesn't stick so well. They come to really understand the nuance. And this was quite a nuanced interaction. That girl was instantly very shy. And I could, I read that from, from a distance. I took a read on her, you know, she's got her head, head in her hair. She's, she's her hunch. She's hunched a little bit. She's walking along in her own little world. And my feeling by, by getting, by taking a read on her and not running up going, Oh, what am I going to say? What's, what's the right thing to say? My read is like, okay, I want to be there with her in a space. So my opening was very gentle. I can't even remember what I said, whatever. It doesn't matter. It's a gentle open. And then she immediately closed and she would have just walked off. If I tried to say, Oh, you know, some big ostentatious thing, she just would have said, Oh, I'm busy. So instead I, I walked along with her. I matched her a little bit. I think I, and then I did use some kind of pre-frame calling out that I'm, you know, I'm not dangerous, but, but it's not the words. I'm not dangerous. It's the, it's like, I'm a, I'm a girl whisperer, right? You say to her, you say to a dog that's scared, I'm not scary. Don't worry. The dog's going to nip your heels. Whereas if you go, Hey puppy, Hey puppy. And that was my kind of sense there. And I don't want to belittle her by comparing her to a puppy, but the vibe that she was in required me to, to get in sync with her. Otherwise she would have just blown me out in, in whatever polite way she, she could have. Now I could see that as we're walking along, she still didn't have her attention with me properly. So I asked her to stop politely. So do you mind to stop? You don't, you're not in a big hurry, right? And then she said, uh, uh, no, I said, Oh, everyone's going somewhere, but we can talk for a minute. Right. And so then I settled her. She still kept looking around almost the whole time. I don't know if she saw the cameras or not. What do you guys think? Maybe not. These guys are ninjas. Okay. So she wasn't cause I thought maybe she saw the camera, but no, she's just kind of looking around cause she's breaking pressure because this is intense for her. I'm super confident. I'm super clear. And she's an art historian who works in the museum. And you know, and, and I, uh, I got the read early on that this girl's not single because even though we had quite a good conversation about the thing that she's into, I related to her. I was vibing at the same, uh, intensity as her at the end. I didn't just say, Hey, so you don't hang out and get a coffee. Cause I just had a feeling. Have you got a boyfriend? Yeah. I could tell you it did. I said, you're not single. Are you? And then she was very honest and then explained that to me and cool. I'm very happy for her that she's been single for four years and she's found a nice art historian lad to keep her warm at night because I'm not that guy and best case scenario, I'm going to take her on a whirlwind romance and break her heart. So better to let her go back to that lovely lad that she's with. Um, that's all I got to say about that. Oh, what a dream she was. Hi there. Are you okay? Don't worry. Uh, I was just filming with my, do you want to talk for a second? Good. Uh, I was just filming with my friends and I saw you and you look smashing. Do you know, do you know how that, you know that phrase? Oh, good. And uh, so what's your name? Who are you? Oh, I want to go on a date with you sometime. So I wanted to see what, why not? Bye. Hi. How are you? Good. Uh, don't be confused. I think you look very nice and uh, adorable and possibly interesting. And so I want to say hi. What's your name? What is it? Johanna. Johanna? Johanna. Oh, I'm James. Hi James. Hi James. Yeah, you too. Uh, are you a Norwegian? Sorry? Are you a Norwegian? No. Oh. Oh, you just said Johanna, like, a bit like a Nordic person. Yeah, and uh, you are obviously very healthy. I know. You're drinking water. Is that a filter bottle? Can I walk with you for a minute? Yes. Sure. Uh, do you do yoga or something? Sorry? Do you do yoga or something like this? I don't understand. Oh. Sorry, my English is not good. It's okay. It's my Australian accent. It's not so easy to understand, so. You are from Australia? I am, yes. Uh, but I try to speak more clearly. So I said, do you do some yoga or something like this? Ah, I'm, uh, my husband is running. Uh-huh. You know, I, let me guess. I would say you're not very extroverted. Not really. It depends on the people. Yes. I am basically. Yes. But with my friends, yes. With other people, not always. Right. But sometimes. So it depends on the situation also. Depends on your moods. Yes. The environment. The weather. Yes. The moon. Yes. The stars. Yes. But what I mean was, like, I, my, my feeling about you was that, yes, you're not, like, super extroverted, but you're also, like, quite a open person. Like, you're not trying to hide. Uh-huh. Maybe. Is that correct? Yes. Okay. That's good. Well, that's a good mix. What do you read about me? Uh, I think you are really open-minded because you have just asked me that I like you. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Is that, that's unusual? Yes. It is. But it, it doesn't happen, it happens with me too really, so it's. Okay. Is it nice? It's a bit weird. Yeah, but so what? Your noise. Life is. But it's okay. Yes. Two people meet each other and then they talk and. That's true. I see. Life is. Not a big thing. Life is, life is weird. I think people try to make it not weird, but actually life is incredibly chaotic, and I like to surf the chaos. That's my job. Um, stop for one minute, because, what are you, where are you going now? To work. What's, what's your working? Um, I'm working at Gulta Institute. What is that? But I have, I'm in a hurry. Okay, well in that case, do you want to go for tea sometime? Um, not really. Tell me why. I have no ego, I have no ego. You went too wide for me. Ah, okay. To be honest. All right, thank you very much. But you are nice. I'm not nice, but I'm fascinating. Okay. All right, bye. Bye. Enchant\u00e9. So, all right, turns out old man Marshall's too old for that lady. Uh, this is a, this is an issue that a lot of guys who are over 30-something worry about. They're like, okay, what's going to happen if a girl, if I talk to a younger girl, I want to date her, and do younger girls want to date you? Yes, many of them definitely do, and some of them absolutely don't. So, in this situation, I just, because we had a, we're being very honest with each other and good rapport, I asked her very honestly, and that's why I said, I've got no ego, just tell me the truth. And she told me totally the truth. Tell me why. I have no ego. I have no ego. You went too wide for me. Ah, okay. To be honest. And if you're going to be, like, you're going to have to put up with this for all sorts of reasons. Women are going to screen you out for all sorts of arbitrary reasons. Too short, too tall, too old, too young, too fucking not cool, too whatever has the wrong kind of hat, whatever it is. And if you're, like, the fear of having a girl do that to you is the thing that stops most men from doing this. All right? Whereas for me, I know that from my experience that for her, I'm too old, for another girl who is four years younger, I will be just the right age. And so let's see if we can go and find her. Excuse me. Hello. I can see you having a coffee and studying, but you look so lovely. I was wondering if I could join you for 60 seconds. Just to see if you're a nice person. I'm not trying to sell anything or steal anything. Sorry, but I'm just trying to learn. What are you learning? It's German. Ah. Is it difficult? It's an essay and I'm really bad at this, so I'm just trying to concentrate. I can see you concentrating there in the German zone. Yes. You have a nice smile. Thank you. Very sweet. What's your name? Laura. Laura? Nora. Nora with an N. Yes. Nora. Nice to meet you. Can I make one guess about you? Yes. You are a gymnast. No. Close, right? No. It's very far. Dancer of some sort? No. I'm playing tennis. Uh-huh. We don't have that in Australia. I'm just going to sit down for one minute and then I'll leave, okay? Okay. And I just had a corona test two days ago, so I am so safe. Oh. I'm not sure if I'm safe. No, you're the dangerous one. Yes, probably. Yeah. Yeah, we don't actually have that in Australia. How does that game work? It's like throwing a ball to like six people against each other. It's kind of like on a small soccer court? Yes, I think it's like half a soccer court. Yeah. Yeah. You just need to throw the ball into a goal. And it's very fast and aggressive kind of? Yes, it's very aggressive. So you can push each other and touch each other? Yes, yes. Have you broken anything? No. Because you are the most aggressive and you cause the damage? Yes. Because when I saw you, I noticed you had like a very good posture. Do you know this word? Yes. Yes, like you were sitting with perfect back. Yes, it's from kindergarten because they forced us to stay like that. Or they would whip you or something? No, they just always say yes, that we should sit up straight. Wow. That's amazing because in an Australian kindergarten, they certainly weren't making us sit up straight. Did you go to like some kind of Catholic school or something? No, I didn't. I don't know. It was a thing for my teacher."}
