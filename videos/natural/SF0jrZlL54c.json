Check it out. What I'm going to do today with Teodora is we're going to give you guys some basic conversational hacks, some very practical tools that will allow you to go from having these stilted, boring conversations to having something which is alive and interesting. But first, I want to talk about what are some of the common mistakes. Now, as I said yesterday, a lot of my job involves putting a microphone on a guy, sending him out, listening to the conversation, right? So, especially the first couple of days of a workshop, I get to listen to... I'm like, oh, boy. Okay. And I have to cringe with him. He's cringing, I'm cringing, the girl's cringing. We're all sharing this. She doesn't know that I'm involved in this. She just sees this guy over in the corner going... So, it's a weird experience. But I get to listen in on these conversations all the time. And so, of course, I've seen these patterns reoccur countless times of common mistakes. It's very rare that I hear a guy do something, a mistake, where I'm like, whoa, that's a new weird thing to do. It's like, yeah, okay, seen that before, seen that before. And there's a bunch of them. So, let's just demo some of them. All right? So... Hi, there. How are you? Hey, I'm fine. Great. Awesome. Yeah, I'm really good, too. And what are you doing for today? What are you doing today? Actually, no plan. No plans? We will see. Okay. Yeah, we will see, won't we? Yeah. The good thing about later is you see what happened when you get there. And then, so what else? Do you have a pet? Any pets? Don't have a pet? No, no, no. Dog, cat? I don't like those kind of pets at home, you know? No, I don't either. No, I hate them. I fucking hate pets. Yeah. What's your favorite color? White? Actually, I really like white, yeah. Good. Great, great. White's great. I'm wearing white, too. So, you know what they say? What do they say? That's what they say. They say, I like white, too. You read that book, too. Great. All right. So, pretty good, huh? All right. What was I doing wrong? Speaking too fast. This is the primary mistake here. And often when a guy comes out of an interaction and I'll say, okay, listen to this. This is what you sound like. And then I do that. And I just tell him and he's shocked. And he's like, whoa, I didn't know that I was speaking that fast. Because in that moment where your blood is rising and your heartbeat's accelerating, you don't notice this. And this is a lack of awareness. Because most people don't talk like that when they're talking to their best buddies. This is a result of you being tense, getting up into your head, trying to think of the next thing to say. And as a result, I start tripping over myself and not listening. And then it accelerates the whole pace of the interaction. I just start to burn it out faster. And she has no real choice but to either increase the pace with me or start to collapse under the weight of me just bombarding her with too much information too fast. So, it's a technical mistake, but there's an underlying issue. What do you think the reason is why I might be doing that? Aside from me feeling nervous. Anyone? Overcompensate. Yeah, it's too vague. What else? Yes, I cannot hold the pressure. That's an issue. If I allow silence to drop for a second, suddenly a pressure builds, a vacuum is created. And that's awesome if you know how to sit in that pressure. That's a big part of my game is just being able to sit in the pressure, hold the girl's eye contact until she finally just goes, all right, have sex with me. Yeah. But, okay, that's still not what I'm looking for. The thing that I'm looking for here is my own answer, which I'll tell you, which is that the implication here is that I need to convince the girl to stay. Right? It's like, just hang on, don't leave. Don't leave. Please don't leave. Just give me a chance. If I get all these words out really quickly and hopefully you'll think, okay, are you going to stay with me? What's that? Right? This is what I'm doing. I'm trying to get the girl's attention and any person that's a good street hustler doesn't do that. In New York City, there's some amazing street hustlers like beggars and people who are just coming to get money off you. And that's the thing about New York. Everyone's fucking at the top of the game, even the beggars. They kick ass. And I've had an old black man come up and he says, you want to know what I did when I was a young man? Yeah. Comedian. Really? Yeah. Got a dollar for a stubborn artist and he's got me. I'm like, yes I do. And then he lays out five awesome jokes. All right. So he didn't, those people don't come up. If they're good, they don't come up and start scrambling and trying to get your attention. They draw you in with a little hook and then you're interested. Right? So that's the first thing that you need to be aware of doing. Because if I, if I just go, Hey, excuse me, and hold clear intention on a girl, I want it to say something. These little vacuums, these little moments of pressure, as long as I hold intensity are the things that will tend to get a girl's momentary curiosity, not the me scrambling to get her attention. Okay. So that's the first mistake. Stop it. All right. So in, within that example, there was some other ones as well. Anyone notice any other issues that I was doing? Yeah. Repeating back the thing that she said. Yeah. It's really weird to listen in on. All right. So we'll do it again. Uh, so what, and now we've now finally I've got it to stop. Great. Um, and what do you do with yourself today? I know. What's your job? I'm a nurse. You're a nurse. Right. And, um, where did you study that? Uh, at a university. At a university. Cool. Cool. And, um, do you like that? Yeah, of course. Of course you do. Okay. Um, that sounds really fucking weird. And she notices after you do that twice, she notices this, unless she's totally often in with the fairies. Why did people do that? Same, same issue with not being able to handle pressure. That's right. So she says something and you are trying to fill, fill all gaps because the assumption here is that if there is a moment silence, she's just going to drop you and leave. All right. So what should you do instead of repeating back the thing she said? Shut up. Just shut up for a second. Take a moment so you can think even if it's a bit too long, just stare at her for a little bit longer. She's like, I've done it before. I'm like, and you hold, you can hold people's pressure. If you get the timing right and you go, what's it like being a nurse? And then we move on to the next thing. Okay. There's another thing that I'm doing here, which I'll demonstrate again. Um, so, uh, do you have any brothers and sisters? Yeah, I have a brother. I've got three brothers. Yeah. And, um, who's your favorite? I know you're not supposed to have a favorite, but do you have one? No, I have just one. Oh, you just have one brother. All right. Okay. Is he your favorite brother? Yeah, of course. Oh, good. Great. Great. Um, and do you have a, a mother? Yeah. I've got another two. Yeah. Right. Cool. And she, she, you know, um, and do you prefer your mother or your father? I wouldn't say any of them. No, no, you wouldn't do that. No, no, no, never. I wouldn't ask that. I didn't ask that. Uh, what color is your hair by the way? Naturally. Is it natural? That's great. Mine's brown. That's great. Yeah. Great. Thank you. All right. What am I doing wrong here? All of that probably. Letting her talk. Yes. What I'm doing is I'm clipping the ends of what she says. So as she is finishing the word, I'm jumping in before she's even finished. All right. And as a result, I'm not listening. Obviously I'm not listening. I'm screwing myself up and asking how many brothers and she already told me, and this is a common thing. Guys don't listen to the answer. And so they get in those situations where they're like, fuck, I'm just, I'm tripping over myself. So it has that effect. But worse still, it has the effect of training her to shut up because when you're having an argument with somebody, that's what you do. You try and shout over each other to force the other person to back down. And if the other person is invested in the argument, they will fight back. All right. So then there'll be these opposing viewpoints being thrown at each other and you're trying to cut each other off and clip so that until finally someone gives up. In the situation where you have a girl you've just met on the street, she's not invested in winning the fight. She doesn't care. All right. So if she feels that pressure, you ask a question and she goes, and then she feels that clip and she goes, oh, okay. And then you do another one and then she responds again and then you shut it down again. After a couple of those, she'll just be like, all right, buddy, whatever. I'll shut up then. I'll just wait for you to finish hammering me with these stupid words for a while and then I'll make my excuse and I'll leave. All right. Now, interestingly, I'm not trying to do that. That's not my intention. My intention is not to make her shut up. It's not to win an argument. It's actually to show her that I'm acknowledging her, that I'm encouraging her. That's what I'm trying to do. I'm like, oh yeah, cool. Right. Oh, great. Yeah. Oh, I've got one of those. I'm jumping in because I'm trying to encourage her to say more, but it's having the opposite effect. It's making her want to invest less. All right. So a really important one, don't clip the ends of the girl's sentences. And even if you like, don't do it directly at the end either. So if she finishes the word, don't then jump in at straight away.
