So the man grabbing her and kissing her or looking hungrily at her, eating bits of her body like it's a meal, showing the fact that he is affected, that he's attracted, that he's turned on. This creates this feedback loop where that ignites that in her. Not all the time, it's not like a law of nature, but it's a very common thing for women to feel that. She feels sexy, slutty, wild, wants to give herself to the man, wants to do all sorts of naughty, nasty, experimental things when the man activates that in her without judgment, saying things to her like, oh, that's a bit weird, or you want that kind of thing, or, oh, that's what you're into. Anything where I shame her for wanting to express her sexuality, same goes, you know, if a woman did that to me, shamed me for wanting to do something slightly kinky, I would say, well, perhaps you need to go and find men over the road at the church because I'm clearly not the guy for you."}
