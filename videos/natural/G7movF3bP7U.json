And one of the ways you can make sure that you don't get too obsessed with one connection is... Next thing we're going to talk about after you understand your values and what's important to you is your focus. Where are you putting your focus and how is that then contributing to and affecting your relationships? Because you have a choice at every particular moment in your life every day about what you want to do with your time, where are you going to focus yourself, what are you going to put your attention onto, what are you going to give power to in terms of your emotions, your thoughts, your opportunities, etc. And when you're dating a girl or you're sleeping with a girl on a semi-regular basis or more, then there can be a tendency to start to fall into the, you know, the kind of romantic narrative, the fantasy of culture that is, you know, you sleep with somebody multiple times so then you should start to, you know, be with them more long-term because that's the right thing to do or there's something that naturally evolves out of that. Now the interesting thing about this focus piece that I'm talking about is that it's very natural that when you sleep with somebody that you can become biologically attached. Now women have a tendency to do this a lot more than men generally but nonetheless men still get chemically bonded to a woman over time because they're sharing all these things, pheromones, experience, pleasure and that stuff becomes powerful. It's where we build relationships, it's where we build meaning and it's important to recognize that if you sleep with a girl, you know, a couple of times even, then there can be a strong sense of connection with her and one of the ways you can make sure that you don't get too obsessed with one connection is you can see multiple women. Now that might sound a little bit harsh and some people might be against that but the idea is that once you open yourself at least to seeing other women, you don't even necessarily have to be sleeping with lots of other women but be open to talking to other women, be open to dating other women, be open to allowing your masculine energy, your masculine sexuality, your masculine expression to be shared with other women so that it doesn't get all put into one basket with one girl. And that can be difficult because sometimes girls, if you're sleeping with them on a regular basis and they're attached to you and they have an idea that they're going to turn you into a boyfriend, they might be very offended or hurt or upset or defensive about you sharing your energy with other women and rightly so in some sense because they're just trying to protect their investment, they're just trying to protect their emotions, they're just trying to protect their identity and what they believe is good for them. So it's important to acknowledge that and to understand that in them as well but also stay true to yourself because otherwise you're going to end up in this difficult position where you're trying not to piss her off by not being true to yourself and when you do that then you're going to come up against something very powerful which is called the law of lesser pisses. What's that mean? Well that means that if you're going to piss somebody off, it's better to piss somebody else off than piss yourself off because at the end of the day you've got to live with yourself and if you're not taking care of yourself, if you're not clear on what's important to you, if you're not doing what really matters to you then especially over time you're going to just grow in more and more resentment, unhappiness, frustration and basically feeling repressed because you're not able to express yourself effectively. A big part of being able to do that with people in the world is negotiation skills. It's about knowing what is important to you. So for example in my journey where I used to be a very monogamous kind of guy who was having typical long-term relationships and that was good for me at the time and maybe that will happen again at some point but in those times when I was having those kinds of experiences, I really wanted to have a deep and meaningful connection with one girl. Then after a time I realized that I wanted to do different things so then I became much more open and flexible and able to go with the flow of this big ocean of adventures and experiences and now that means that I have a fairly fluid relationship cycle. So I might see a girl for weeks, months, maybe up to a year or so depending on what happened but I'm also open to other experiences and other relationships coming and going within that time and this is something that is always negotiated step-by-step. So obviously it's important for me to know who I am and what I want first. I need to say to myself I want to be the kind of guy who's open and fluid, has a dynamic sex life, has multiple partners and is cool and honest and leaving women better than when I found them but at the same time being honest with myself about what's healthy for me. Now because I live a very dynamic lifestyle it's more applicable for me to have this kind of relationship set up. So it's important for you guys out there if that's what you want to do to work out why is it important for you to set this up for yourself if that's what you really want and get clear on your own philosophy, get clear on your own model of reality, get clear on your own beliefs about that. Practice communicating that because that's going to become something that becomes a part of your identity. It's going to become something that is effectively communicated especially when it comes to negotiating with the women that you're seeing, the women that you're sleeping with and they need to hear this too because you've got a kind of a choice. You can either pretend that you're the good guy, you're the boyfriend type but actually be going out and doing other things like giving your attention to other women and sleeping with other women and having another thing which some would say yeah you could do that and get away with it for a little while and maybe that's easier because then at least you're not like creating a drama because some girls can't handle it and obviously also guys do that on a regular basis because they just don't want to face the possibility that if they tell the truth to a woman that she might not like them, might not be interested or wants to get away from that kind of situation and once again rightly so but the interesting thing about that is that there is a grey zone inside female psychology that is to be negotiated and even though in terms of the mainstream there's often like only really black and whites like people that are in long-term relationships and people that are basically single or you know dating there is like I said a huge space in between and I mean James Marshall goes on about this stuff a lot in terms of like the dating cycle and which cycle that you're in and how this kind of all lines up and by all means check out some of the other videos that he's talked about that because he goes into a lot of really good detail about the psychology and the ideas behind that which I tend to agree with all that stuff. Now the idea though is that you want to really get who you are what you want and where you're at in your cycle and then being able to effectively communicate that and what that looks like in practical terms is you are much more honest and upfront with the women that you're sleeping with which then also prepares you and protects you to a degree from getting overly connected because if you are in a stage where you want to be free and you want to be fluid but at the same time you're allowing yourself to be act like and become a kind of a boyfriend then it's incongruent. It's incongruent for her and it's incongruent for you and it ends up becoming this kind of messy situation. So this is where the second piece of managing your focus is really important. Maybe for example you sleep with a girl okay it's cool it's casual it's normal then you sleep with her again it gets a little bit more serious and then then a little bit more gets a little bit more serious and before you know it you're hanging out a lot you're going on dates you're spending time together and if that's really what you want to do and you want to have that kind of more intimate relationship that's more of a boyfriend girlfriend kind of thing then cool and honestly if you're moving into that kind of space then maybe you either need to look at negotiating if you actually want to be monogamous with her or if you want to negotiate some kind of polyamorous arrangement that's going to be good for both of you guys but if she's the kind of girl that you're just happy to have basically in your rotation she's there she's somebody that you have nice times with you share pleasure with but she's not relationship material she's not girlfriend material she's not somebody that you want to have as an intense you know connection all the time then make sure you're not giving her that kind of attention and focus make sure that you're not leading her into an experience and an expectation or leading yourself into the experience and expectation of being there all the time so what does that mean it means don't get caught up in lots of emotional text messaging it means don't be showing her a lot of boyfriend kind of traits like buying her chocolate or flowers or taking her out to dinner or holding her hand or showing her lots of public affection don't introduce her to your to your social circle and make her a part of your regular life and then and then make it a thing where it's almost like that's who she is she's part of your life you're framing her as a partner you know don't put photos of you and her up on social media that are kind of projecting this image that you're with her when you're actually not really wanting to be with her and the interesting thing that I also said before which is a very important part of this is keep your keep your focus open and available to meeting and connecting with other women along the way so that you can detach some of that energy and this can be quite a bizarre experience if you have if you're not used to it because what I've experienced anyway is that if I'm with a girl for a period of time I become bonded I become chemically attached I become emotionally attached I become mentally attached to her and it's almost like we could say that's the process of like falling in love that's the process of having an infatuation having a connection as I also started to keep myself open to creating connections with other women and I would spend time with them and have the same kind of thing happening what would happen is that my biological attachment and the mental focus and the emotional meaning would move from one girl to another so whoever I was spending the most time with and whoever was the the girl who was taking the most of my attention was the the one that tended to become the target of my biology the target of my chemical addiction and it can be quite weird when I'm jumping between one and the other in days you know or you know might spend one week with one girl and sometime next week with another girl or I'm moving countries and I'm with different girls so that can be a bizarre experience but what I learn over time is that there is a higher level of awareness that happens out of that there's a secondary part of me that starts to learn oh this is normal this is how my biology works this is how I create connections and it's a dual-edged sword this thing it's a two-edged thing because in some ways it makes me really appreciate connections with women when I have those connections more yet at the same time it also makes me able to see those connections as biological and more or less a reflection of the investment and the time and the energy that I've been giving that particular girl but ultimately different people will have different energies different people have different alchemies different people have different resonance with you so it's almost like when two people come together there's like two entire universes of of being you know like experience beliefs you know backgrounds culture everything coming together to create a unique synergy a unique relationship and that's something to really focus on to and appreciate that and enjoy that and make that part of your understanding part of your philosophy part of what it is to be a romantic adventurer is to enjoy and to appreciate and to you know make the most out of those connections while you've got them but simultaneously recognize that you know there's there's a time and a place for different kinds of connections at different times you might be with a girl who's really sweet in some ways and you can have a great intellectual connection with her but you feel like she's not emotionally very good for you or you might find a girl who's really emotionally good for you but you can't have any real interesting conversation because maybe you speak different languages or she's not interested in the same stuff you're into or she's much younger or she's much more you know she's in a different place in her philosophy and where she's at in her life you might have a girl you're very sexually connected to and it feels amazing you have this this strong desire to be animals and you know to share sex together but at the same time there's no emotions or there's emotions but there's no intellect so these things can all match at different levels depending on where you're at at the time and where she's at at the time with different partners and the interesting thing is to be aware of that as part of your frame as well so what is the match of the different levels within you that is then aligning to create the kinds of relationship that you are having in that particular moment.
