One of my viewers says, so I started a new job with a startup company and one of my few other co-workers is probably the most amazing woman I've ever met. Don't worry, I don't plan on seducing her. I need a job more than her. I'm glad that wasn't the question. How do I seduce my co-worker? She's a Californian blonde with blue eyes and an amazing body. She went to an Ivy League school and she's a black belt in karate. I'm not making this up. She's 24 and hot and probably way smarter and socially adept than most people in the room. I'm kind of a bit in love too. She sounds great. All right, well, let's get working on this chick. For me, it's fascinating to be working alongside a woman of her caliber. I haven't honestly spent a lot of time with women like her. So even working together, you learn a little about her experience and possibly how you might relate to other girls with a similar background or hotness level. So my question is simply, as I go out and try to seduce women of her caliber outside the office, what should my mindsets be when I'm talking to someone who objectively speaking has way more value than me on the sexual marketplace? I'm a decent looking guy with developing game, but a hot blonde who's smarter than me seems to have an affluent family and some level of connections. I'm objectively not on that level. I don't mean that in a way to demean myself. It's just an objective reality. In addition to improving myself as a man to try and bridge the gap, how should I think about going to talk to a woman who is just flat out better than him? I'm not going to be on the same level as girls like my co-worker, but I don't want that to be a deterrent from being successful. Okay. So recently I put out another video, similar topic, talking about sexual marketplace value and looking at things, trying to look at things from the attractive female's position. When guys are getting irritated that hot girls are flaking on them, it's important that you understand what it's like to be a hot girl, how much opportunity you have, how many options you have, and that the objective reality, as this gentleman is talking about, is that if you have a woman who is like this chick, right? She's blonde, she's 24, she's hot, she does karate and all of the other things. She's awesome, of course, and she's social, right? So she's, let's just say that she goes to some parties or goes out sometimes. She has friends. She's not some hermit. She's not an agoraphobic. She's a chick who's going out there and enjoying life. Well, the reality is that she has a massive amount of choice when it comes to which men she decides to sleep with, flirt with, date, marry, take to court for half their shit. She's got all sorts of men to choose from. And if you are to put yourself in line, you have to be aware that just because you like you and you're a nice guy and you're pretty good at nunchucks, because girls like dudes with nunchuck skills or whatever, that it may not count for anything in her mind, okay? So it's not that you are invaluable. It's like, okay, you go for a job interview and there's one spot available for a job and there's a hundred people who want to go, and they're all qualified in different ways, okay? So some of them are more charming. Some have more experience. Some get the boss's humor. Some of them kiss ass like a motherfucker. We're just going to quickly trot across the road so we don't get steadicam murdered. Are you going to put that video out when I get hit by traffic in the middle of it? You are, aren't you? You're going to put it out. It's going to turn into a Logan Paul kind of debacle. All right. Well, I survived that one. So, okay. Amazing job. A hundred of you lined up. Everyone has different skills. The hirer or the boss chooses based on the things that they're interested in and then rejects 99 of you. Like throws you out on the street, doesn't give a shit if you're destitute and you never work again. You die alone. Doesn't care, right? So now, does this mean that you're a useless piece of shit? I hope not. No. Does this mean that you'll never get a job? No. Does this mean that a different employer may not have chosen you because they liked your personality or your skill set better? Okay. So you start to see the parallels here. The woman is in a, if she is one of these very high value women, she is in a position where she has a lot of choice and she can't choose everyone. So she's going to choose the person she likes the best or that triggers her in some way or that gives her the most gucci. That's what we're all getting at here, isn't it? It's all about the money. No, it's not. So in the previous video, when I was talking about this, there were some comments, like one guy said in the comments, something like, you know, well, we'll put the comment up, but it was something like, this makes me more depressed. Now, I think this is impossible because people were at first like, well, it's hard to approach chicks and like, you know, get into a conversation and stuff. But then if you have to have this idea that on some metric scale of sexual value, that you're low in that or you're not even in the race, then that can be a very demoralizing thing. And you think, fuck, well, okay, I'm 20 something years old or whatever age, and I've just started learning pickup and I'm trying to improve myself. This guy's talking about it. He's a young guy. He's improving himself. He's very self-aware for his age. I mean, for any age, really. I think he's, the question is, has no bitterness in it? No. Like, how do I trick my way through this? And it's also not like fatalistic and depressive. He's like, not like, oh man, I'll never get these chicks. He's thinking, okay, as a young guy who he sees, he looks around and he says, well, objectively on certain metrics, I don't have a whole lot of stuff. Okay. So let's say if he's young, he's not established. He maybe doesn't feel super confident about what he's doing in life yet. As a young guy, you haven't had time, unless you were born into wealth or you became super famous by some, or like super successful by some anomalous thing that most people don't do it when they're young. That's the disparity between a man and a woman of the same age, especially when they're young, right? So a woman who's 24, in this case, your blonde karate kicking bombshell, is in her peak in many ways, right? So she's in her peak beauty and she's also very aware probably of that because she's not 18 anymore. She's had enough years to figure out the game and see, okay, this is what a player is. This is what a fake dude is. This is a guy who's too needy. This is what is available to me, right? So this is, oh yeah, I could have this type of lifestyle. I could go for the like boats and cocaine and glamour lifestyle, or I could find a really, you know, solid, amazing alpha guy, or I could date around and fuck a bunch of people if I wanted to, or I could have a lesbian affair. She can do whatever she wants. Whereas the guy that's 24, like when I was 24, I mean, I was doing stuff. I was, I was still an ambitious young guy and I was doing things, but I was not established and I was in no way in my peak. I am now, have been for some years now. Men tend to peak if they plan it well, right? So you don't just peak as a man just by getting old, right? So yes, women are generally attracted to older, slightly older or much older men, and they tend to be attracted to men who are, it's not about a specific amount of money or a specific status level, although some women give a shit about that. If a, if a, like I would never meet a woman like that because she's not going to look for me. I'm not looking for her. So yeah, but women are still affected like, okay, is this guy a leader? Does he know what he's doing? Does he know how to master his environment? Right? Because that's what a woman's looking for in a man. When we talk about the status, she doesn't really care about what letters are after his name or what bling he's got on his wrist, only if that affects her life positively. All right. So if he's a, if she's with a man who is confident without being arrogant, who is a leader and is also able to look after people under his leadership, because that's a difference between a tyrant and a leader. A tyrant just uses their population. A leader takes the population, takes its clan or whatever, somewhere where they benefit. They get more food, they get more resources, they get more fun, they get more experience, they get more opportunities, right? So a good leader takes people into places where they all benefit, right? So usually a man who is older or more established, if he's built a lifestyle that works with that, he's going to be, he's going to have more to offer than maybe a much younger guy who's not really, he's trying to figure out life. Okay. So that's, that's the one side of things. However, does that mean, and this I think is the crux of the question here, does that mean you should not bother? Like this guy sees this girl, now he's intelligently decided he's not going to try and hit on that girl, right? Because he works with her. I guess he instinctively knows that women are attracted to men pretty fast or not at all. It's fairly rare for a woman to grow affection for a man over time. It happens within social circles sometimes over time or on sitcoms, it seems to happen a lot, like the nanny, you know, how many seasons did it take for Mr. Sheffield and Nanny Bryce to get together? I don't know, all of them. You know, the bubbling sexual tension over time occurs sometimes, but usually that occurs when people were both attracted to each other, but there was some reason they couldn't get together, right? They worked together, they both had girlfriends or boyfriends or something, and so they were attracted, but there was a Romeo and Juliet barrier in between them, and so that sexual tension is kind of there, right? So it still exists, and maybe it expresses at the office party three years down the track. But most of the time, women are instantly or within minutes or an hour attracted to a man, and I've talked about this before, it's not about building attraction, it's about attraction being released, the potential. She's potentially attracted to men if she's open to something with a man because she's single and she's horny and she's out there, and then some man or some number of men release the walls and the attraction starts to blend, right? And that happens usually fast because otherwise, if it doesn't happen fast and you are really friendly to the girl and a nice co-worker and a buddy of hers, then she tends to put you in that position and it's hard for you to get out. We all know about this, the friend zone. However, does that mean this guy should not hit above his weight, should not be looking at a girl and going, well, I guess on a bunch of metrics, maybe I don't stack up, so I shouldn't try. I should only go for girls that are way less in demand or less attractive or ones that are easier for him to get. So what's my answer to this question? I think you need to view it in two ways, with audacity and with humility. And that's kind of one of my linchpins of the way that I operate in life. I've done a lot of audacious things in my life. I rocked up at Shaolin Temple without an invitation. I've just went to and talked to Anthony Johnson and invited myself to go and speak at his conference. I've sought out different people that I've respected or interested in and went and offered them a deal or asked them for a favor. I've jumped to the head of many queues, but I've always, let's hope, mostly done it with a sense of humility. Because if I'm jumping lines or I'm asking someone to do something that doesn't make sense in the normal stepping stone of moving through life, then I have to be aware that I'm being a cheeky cunt and that people might say no. Or they'll be like, okay, why is it that you think that you get to jump to the head of the queue? Or why do you get this thing that other people work harder for or work longer for? When I went to Shaolin Temple many years ago, I rocked up without an invitation. And then I met the teacher that would be my master later. And he asked what I wanted. And I simply said, I would love to learn with you. I just asked. And I fully expected he would just say, no, that's not how it's done here. Fuck off and come. But he wouldn't have said fuck off. He would have said, nicely Buddhist, fuck off. And come back when you go through the orthodox channels. But he gave me a shot. And so I repaid that chance with humility and gratitude. And I worked very fucking hard, tried to follow the instructions as best I could. And so I was welcome into that family. Same with people who come to me. A lot of people want to come and work with me as a coach or an intern or camera guys or whatever. And the only people that have gotten through are the ones who, yeah, came to me and said, the guy behind this camera right now sent me a bunch of emails asking if he could involve me in a documentary. And I ignored them as I do because there's just too much stuff in my inbox. And I remember reading the email and going, that sounds like a good idea. And then I just forgot about it. And he kept on gently reminding me, sent me a video, inviting me. And then eventually I was like, okay, cool, come over. Let's do this thing. He put in a lot of work, made a great piece. And then, so that's the person that I'm now going, all right, we need another guy on staff. He's the person I'm going to ask to join. So, whereas a lot of other people write to me and say, hey, I want a job. Or I heard you're looking for interns. You know, when can I start? Or how much does a coach get paid? That kind of stuff. I'm like, what? Fuck off. Seriously, because you haven't approached, you've approached me with audacity, but no humility. You've using assumptions and assuming that you're going to get something when you haven't earned it. So on the one hand, if we take that and we put that into the seduction sphere, seduction, the seduction industry can certainly foster and encourage an extremely high level of entitlement for men that haven't earned it. And a lot of the marketing, it's like, you know, how to get a 10 into bed tonight and keep it forever. Or, uh, you know, how to make any girl do what you want. Or these kinds of clickbaity titles and methods, which say, you know, you're going to get the top tier women on all metrics just by doing these techniques, right? Or watching this video or whatever. And I think that's misleading. Most people who are discerning, I think would look at that and go, okay, that's just hyperbolic or exaggerated marketing, but a lot don't. And a lot of guys think, oh, cool. All right. Well, I'm just a dude. I've never, I haven't had much experience with women. I've never approached them. I'm not involved in a social scene where there's women around. I'm not versed in the language of like hanging out with girls and partying with them and having a good time with them. And I'm expecting to go out cold and use these three tricks and pull that stunner, pull that 24 year old karate blonde bombshell who's got plenty of options off the market and keep it. That's not realistic. And that's where I think you need to be, where you need to look at yourself and see where you need to improve. Right? It's like, okay, the reality, like I think back, there was a, there was one girl. I remember this was, uh, just before I got into seduction. So I was a guy who was working as a massage therapist, playing music in a not famous band, struggling to pay the rent and eating lentils. Okay. And I met this girl who was a friend of a friend and she came to me as a massage client and she was a belly dance teacher. She was really, really funny. She was a couple of years older than me. I think she was 26 and I was 23. Um, really interesting, sensual, spiritual person, really kind. And she used to come to me, uh, once every week and I'd give her massages for some time and I got a little crush on her. Right. And I mean, I got a big crush on her. Let's be honest. She was cool. Like this chick had a belly dance school. She was in with all the Fitzroyalty, all the hipsters and everybody loved her. And she was so sexy and earthy and natural and my type at the time. Uh, and I told her friend, the friend of the friend, I said, I'm actually got a bit of a crush on, I can't remember her name. Um, what do you think? And she kindly said to me, listen, Jamie, I don't think you should pursue that. And I said, okay, why? And she's, she's got a lot of. going on. She's got a lot of different guys interested in her and this was in her kind way because every hot girl's got guys interested in her. This was her kind way of saying, don't know if you are what she's looking for. And shortly afterwards she hooked up with this guy who was an acrobat in some kind of burlesque circus, very cool tattooed guy that made sense to her. It was in part of her scene and he was obviously attractive but attractive and fit her idea of what she was looking for. At that time, I didn't. I was a guy that she was friends with that gave nice massages and that was it. So the friend gently told me this and I took that on board and I realized yes, she was correct. Not that I'm saying you shouldn't go and take moonshot goals. That's a different thing but you do need to have a sense of realism about where you are at currently. So what does that mean in practical terms to have a sense of realism? It doesn't mean hide from women until you become awesome. It means sure, go about and approach whoever you want and I definitely encourage you to approach women that you perceive to be out of your league. You think she's too hot for me or maybe she's too cool for me because you need to find out because otherwise you make assumptions and that's where men put themselves in boxes of mediocrity throughout life, especially if they settle in their twenties or early to mid-twenties. If you shack up with a girl or get married or have children in that age, you're doing that well before your peak probably. So that means that you're probably going to get somebody who is not representative of where you could be at in the future. Now, that's not always true. Of course, you may date someone that is beautiful and lovely and then you guys grow together and you become more and more awesome with each other over time. It's not impossible. It certainly happens, but I work with men who on the other end of their decisions. So most men that come to me are in their thirties, forties, some of the twenties, mostly thirties and forties and they've been through relationships, marriages. They've settled for women that they weren't amazingly attracted to or inspired by and then they've stayed there because they presume they had this thing that, okay, well, I can't overshoot my boundaries. I can't get anything better than this. So this is what I should put up with. And that's what I highly encourage you not to do that. So I'm not saying, all right, figure out that you're a six, date sixes and that's the end. No, I'm saying you need to be aware that over time with experience, with more women, with more life, with success, with business, with career, whatever, as you get better and bigger as a person, then you will become more attractive, right? You will have more options and you'll have different types of women available to you that you previously didn't. Or even if you did, it was very difficult to access those types of women, right? So if you enter certain kind of echelons of social worlds and you reach a certain level of ease with yourself where you do feel like you're valuable, that you have a lot to offer, that a woman would be wise to be with you because it's going to be great, then naturally you are going to be able to attract a higher caliber of woman. However, going back to our friend in the situation who's in his early twenties and he's thinking, all right, I'm on this journey. He sees it as a long-term journey knowing that this is a 10 plus year thing, particularly if you're in your twenties. Not necessarily that you need to go and approach girls 10 a day for 10 years. I'm not saying that seduction should be your obsession for the rest of your life, but that you are working on, this is a critical decade, let's say 25 to 35 and then the next decade after that as well. It's critical because that defines how much wealth you will have throughout your life, the social worlds that you're going to inhabit, what country and what position you play in that society. All of that stuff is built in your twenties and thirties, right? And then it's extended upon in your forties. Okay. Some people totally reinvent themselves at 50 and totally change their lives. Cool. But for the most part, these are the critical decades. So therefore you can either let them slide past with shitty jobs and drunken weekends and average girlfriends, and then you reach 35 to 40 to 45 and you are not the silver fox, sexy older man that younger girls are dreaming about or drooling about. You're just some old dude who kind of wasted his important decades. Don't be that. So you see yourself, okay, one of the longterm payoffs of improving yourself and making your mark on the world is that you will get better women in your life and they will treat you better, right? So that's the other thing is like you can get an amazing woman, but she may not treat you that amazingly if you don't train her to, or if she doesn't see, she doesn't respect you or hold you in high esteem. If she sees that she can get away with all sorts of bratty or manipulative behavior, which is certainly something that I experienced in my early relationships, not that there was really anything wrong with the girls. I'm still friends with some of them. I mean, there was things wrong with both of us. We were cunts in both ways. We were young and dumb, but like it wasn't that there was anything inherently wrong with the girl. It was that I couldn't manage her at that time. I didn't know how to handle a woman's moods or outbursts. Um, I didn't know what it meant when she was crying about this, but she really wanted me to comfort her about that. You know, I didn't really understand all that. So all my relationships had a lot more drama and turmoil and, and I didn't feel super respected. So in your position, what can you do overall? You work on this longterm goal of improving yourself, but in the here and now do what you're doing, which is like you're hanging out with that girl to learn about what it's like. Try to get involved in social scenes where there are just women in general, right? So having women around you is a good idea because the, what, trying to learn about how women are just by cold approaching them, that's pretty difficult, right? So it's like running up to any specialist on the street and saying, tell me about what you do in five seconds. Um, before the person says I'm busy, I don't want to talk about this, right? That's a hard way to learn about, about women. It is an integral part of it because it's the way that you will get to meet the most women and you'll get to do it on your terms and you'll get to go into interactions with a clear intention rather than it just being, you know, you're next to someone at a university course and you get chatting and things develop over time. You are shortcutting that and going straight to the crux of I'm attracted to you. I want to see if we can start something. So continue to do that and do that with women that you think are really cute and adorable and you could imagine that she would want to hang out with you. And then also do it with women where you're like, Oh my God, that woman is terrifyingly beautiful from the looks of things or from my brief discussion with her, she seems to be in a social echelon that I'm unfamiliar with or I'm unversed in or I don't know what to do in. So then the assumption that, Oh shit, I'm not good enough for this girl kicks in. Now this is the point, main point of this video is I want to look at the, what is it that you actually do have to offer, right? Because if you're saying, okay, at this point I don't have these extra bells and whistles of what I think it is that a woman's after. Does that mean I don't have anything? And the answer is absolutely not. You definitely do have amazing resources at your disposal, which are in high demand by women. What are those? Any ideas? Do's are like, Hmm, do I? Well, look at it like this. What's missing from many women's lives? Now what's not missing if you're an attractive female is attention. You get all sorts of attention. You get validation, you get compliments, you get wolf whistles, you get people trying to start conversations with you all day. You get people trying to do stuff for you, help you across the road as if you're an old lady and give you free shit and give you drugs and jobs and all sorts of stuff, right? So that's not what they're in short, uh, in a, in a short supply of. And, uh, you don't want to try and compete on that level because you don't have as much as the club owner or the drug dealer, right? You don't have that much stuff. But what is it that is, that is missing in her life? What's missing for a lot of people on this planet where there's so many things trying to draw your attention and shiny screens and likes and swipes and all that, uh, is a sense of connection is a sense of being heard is being able to come into the present moment. And if you're someone who is calm and aware and gives a shit about connecting with people and hearing them and understanding them, then you have truly priceless thing to give them. Because even if a guy is super rich and successful and confident, whatever, he may be arrogant. He may be, uh, completely self-absorbed. He may, uh, just be spoiled, right? So he just doesn't have to put in as much effort anymore because he has many options. Um, so for, or it might be that he's just really egotistically involved in his, in his status, right? So he's really invested in being cool and successful and so on. And if you're, uh, you know, a beautiful woman who's looking for a relationship, sure, you may be looking for a guy that's well-connected and that you can take to parties and, uh, has those kind of external bells and whistles. But what, what does that, where does it leave you when you go home at night? Right? Where does that leave you when you guys are hanging out when it's when, and we're not hanging out in glamorous, uh, situations all the time. We're just, you know, going for a walk to get a cup of coffee. The person that you're spending that time with, uh, the reason she's going to choose to do that if she's not, you know, if she's, unless she's a total gold digger who's cynically just using men only for, only for status and money. Okay. Some women do that, but that's a really sad position for a woman to be in because she's saying to herself, I would, it's not worth getting emotionally involved with a man. It's better because maybe she's had bad experiences or, or she doesn't care. It's like, it's better to just get the stuff out of him. Okay. I think that's a pretty depressing position for a woman to be in. And if you're the man who's providing that stuff to her, it's pretty depressing for you too. I don't think anyone's coming out of this very well when no one's interested in that. That comes to me anyway. So the thing is what she's missing, if she's not has, doesn't have deep connections, is the sense of being heard, being listened to, having a masculine presence that's based around, uh, his, his actual core of who he is as opposed to the watch he wears and the bling that he has that says he's that. All right. So, I mean, when I was first starting seduction, age 26 plus, uh, I was very broke. I was like just barely paying the rent broke and living off. I cook big lentil curries at the beginning of the week and lived off them for days at a time and that kind of stuff. So I was about as broke as you could be in the Western world. Um, and yet, and that was when I was out approaching a lot and lifting my, my game. I started to date or be with women who just months previously, I was sure out of my league because they were out of my world, right? Before I cold approached them and I could only see them on the street. They just were these apparitions. I had no way to talk to a girl who was a glamour girl or a club girl or a corporate chicken, a tight corporate shirt. Um, and so I didn't have any access to those women and I, and I had all these assumptions about them that I couldn't get them because I didn't even have that world. So my way of dealing with that was to justify it. And so I would just judge those women. Are they superficial arts? That's the thing. It's like, if you want those really hot glamour girls, then you have to put up with all their high maintenance drama or whatever. I, I created stories that insulated me against the reality that I wasn't able to access certain women. I just did not have the skills or the, or the access. So over time, a short amount of time, as soon as I started going out and cold approaching, suddenly I was meeting them and I had access to them because I was just like, Oh, Hey. And, uh, of course, uh, you know, many of them just, um, blew me off and it didn't, it didn't work, but I started getting access to these types of women. And as a result, I started learning about them, particularly when I started going out to glamour clubs, which I was terrified of and judgmental of. And I started going out to whatever VIP type of nightclub places, talking to the girls, noticing how my judgment was based around my fear, letting that go and starting to get to know these people. And so over the first two, three years of my seduction career, I, uh, immersed myself into a huge range of new social scenes. I put a lot of effort into going out day, night, social events, cold approach, uh, practice, lots of different stuff so that I was getting access to a whole range of different women of a variety of like coveted, you know, super cool and super hot and dorky and hippies and all sorts of different girls. And I started learning about what makes them tick and what it is that they really, really resonated with because they could see from the way I was dressed and it was obvious that I was not, uh, a rich or cool, well-placed dude. I was just me, but I had the confidence to be there, right? And I had the humility to, to listen and to understand and not be trying to be pushy and, and, uh, be resentful to women when they rejected me and write them off as snooty bitches or anything like that. I did that a few times, you know, I had times when I fucking think you're so cool, bitch, uh, which is a very reactive thing to do. If you're ever doing that, you know, you're on the wrong track. Okay. It happens occasionally. Just feel bitter and then let it go. But the thing that I was able to offer women's fairly soon once they, once I got past the initial, like, how do I approach and what do I say? I just got the basics of a natural approaching down was what I had to offer was that I was really present when I was with a girl. I was there with her. Yeah. I listened to her. I asked real questions and I absorbed the answers and I responded. I had an opinion. I didn't like just go, yes. Oh, that's so cool. I would challenge girls if I thought they were bullshitting or, or I wanted them to justify something or explain themselves, right? I was able to play with the tension of the masculine and feminine dynamic, even though I was living in a shitty share house and, uh, you know, I didn't have anything to offer in that sense. What I had to offer was I was a young guy who was full of curiosity. Uh, I wanted to learn, I wanted to grow and I wanted to be really great with women and not great just to validate my ego. And that was definitely part of my early, uh, early motivation. But it was that I really wanted to, uh, like become masterful at communicating with them because I was really drawn to gorgeous women. I wanted to spend time with them and have sex with them and get to know them and, and not just have sex. I wasn't like, just, I just want to pump girls and then throw them out and get the next one. Uh, you know, I wanted to get involved in their lives and create something, maybe not a monogamous relationship or a super serious one, but something that was real. And that's where I suddenly started to"}
