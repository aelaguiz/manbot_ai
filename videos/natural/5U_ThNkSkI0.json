Get moving! Like, what I would say to guys is that firstly, let's be fucking real here, guys. You had your chance, now everything's locked down. It's all being taken away, you don't even have the choice anymore. Feel that burn for a minute. Feel the regret because I've got none. I don't think you would either. No. I wanted to go to Georgia, and I will soon, but I went and did every fucking thing I wanted to do. Experienced the many things. If it was all taken away from me now, I'd be like, I had a pretty good one. No complaints. On your deathbed, if your plane was going down and you have three minutes before it hits the ground, you could sit there and say, you know what? This sucks because I'm going to die, but at least I did that. I'd be like, just give me four minutes so I can remember it. Oh, that was a good one. I forgot about that one. But anyway, now what we're doing is we're like memory flexing. It's like, dudes, my memories shit all over your memories. But anyway, what I want to say is like, okay, it is good to do that, and it's not about beating yourself up. It's about being clinical and going, all right, this is the life that I led. These are the decisions I made, and it had these consequences, and that was the best that I was going to get out of that life. Was that good enough? And I think for so many men, the answer is obviously no. And so then the question remains, well, when the day one of the lockdown opens, and I think in some ways that is an important day for a lot of people, it'll be different in different places. Yeah. But because everyone, I know everyone is probably having a sense of like, well, all right, this time I will go into, if I get another chance, I'm going to go and do it. Well, I hope so. But I would lay money on it. I would lay, what's the currency in Romania? Lei. 50 lei. I will lay, I'll put down 50 lei that if you don't- It's about 10 bucks. Yeah, okay. Look, my business is not doing as well as it used to, so, you know, all right. That if you don't do that, the things you said you were going to do or thought you were going to do on the first day, you won't do them. That's my prediction. Oh, that's not, maybe that's negative. Maybe that's like I'm putting people in a negative trance there, but- No, no, no, no, no. It's a challenge. It's a call to action. Absolutely. I don't know about you, but I have this thing that follows me throughout life, which is a sense of urgency, not about like going and doing this something or getting the next thing or whatever, but an urgency of like, shit, am I living life right now really well? Really well. And that's kind of my benchmark. Not like perfectly, not like absolutely optimized. Did I do every single push-up correctly and take every micronutrient in the bag? Did I do every single push-up correctly and take every micronutrient correctly? No, I didn't. But did I live today pretty damn well? And enough of those consecutively that I'm not wasting my life. Like I have a sense that if I'm not doing that, and I notice there's times when I've come out of numbness, where I like, well, I zoned out for a day or, you know, I was irritated. I was thinking about that conversation. I was having an angry conversation for three hours. And, you know, I'm like, really, that's three lost hours of my life that were wasted. I can snap out of it, go and do some gardening or jerk off or whatever. But for me, that sense of urgency plagues me daily. And I don't think a lot of people... I don't see evidence that everyone else is having that because they seem to just be chill, letting days and weeks and months and shitty relationships pass and go, oh yeah, was that five years of my life? Yeah, I just thought I'd let that go past. You know what? I read an article, I think it was in Psychology Today or something. Somebody sent me this article. And it was this... The idea is this concept, which is remarkable when you think about it. And this article said that there's a percentage of people who have no inner monologue, who never look out the window and wonder. They just eat, get a raise, get a job, and they just exist in life. And which is nobody here who's listening to this because you wouldn't be listening to this if you were just one of those type of guys. So that's remarkable, that driven energy that you say that you've had since you were young, you're driven. You want to find, you're a seeker, you're a treasure hunter. And that's... And it's mainly... Sorry, go. No, no, no, go ahead. And to me, it's like, I don't even have a sense so much that I need to have a legacy that I composed something that's going to last. Or a conclusion, yeah. Yeah, that I did something that lasts the test of time and people will always look back and go, well, James Marshall sure did know how to whatever. I just have this sense of like... Because I feel like I'm 20 and I know I'm not. The facts are I'm 40. Even though I feel like I'm still young and life is... I'm like, okay, time is moving. Life is passing. I will die. And the humans are really bad at conceptualizing their own death. And especially Western men, like Western humans. Like I'm sure in other times and places, people had a very good concept of death. Whereas, and they came to peace with it. They discussed with it. They had a relationship with death. Whereas, Western civilization is terrified of and ignores it until the last possible moment. And so therefore you get this weird Peter Pan sense of like, I'm always here and I'm here and suddenly I'm dead. And another thing when guys ask me, oh, you know, how do I get over my... I'm like, dude, you're 28 or you're 35 or you're 21. Yeah, you have no idea. Like this, you've got like this block of time from around 20 to around 40-ish, give or take when you can be free and do these things. You don't get to do it like much, much later. Much less likely, right? Now is the time. Every year you spend pondering the question of like, oh, what's the best way to get over? You've just stolen. What's the percentages on that? If you only live for 20 years and one year is, then what percentage of your life? You just blew 5% of your life thinking about whether you should talk to a girl, you fucking idiot. Get moving. If this clip resonated with you, especially in terms of when I was talking about a sense of urgency and as I said, I'm not talking about an urgency to achieve the next goal or make the next million bucks. Not that that's a bad thing. I'm talking about the urgency to experience your life, to really actually enjoy it, to be able to be present, to be able to spend time with people that you really wanna be around. To not have to defer your gratification or your pleasure or your sense of mission until you retire at age 65 or until you reach some certain marker of success, then this message is for you. For many years, I've been using a system that I call the seductive economy in my own personal life. And this is a quite strategic way, even though it may look like on the outside that my life is total chaos, it is a bit of chaos, but I have actually a method to my madness. I have systematically moved throughout the world connecting with the people that I wanted to, building projects, artistic ones, creative ones, musical ones, financial ones, and ones just for fun by using sets of principles that allow me to leverage what I have in terms of my own personal gifts and those of the people that I collaborate with. And that's when I'm talking about an urgency, I'm looking at you have to get the best out of your life most of the time. You can't wait until the end because then you missed it. It's a very common mistake for men, especially high achievers or hard workers, workaholics, is to think I will just hustle for the next 10 years and then I'll get my rewards. Yeah, sure. Okay, you can't just sit on the couch and eat Doritos and only enjoy yourself in kind of a lazy way, that's not gonna help either. But you must be able to enjoy the process as you move towards your goals. So my Lifestyle Design Academy is coming out mid-May. So very soon, I'll be inviting a select group of men to come in and be mentored by me in real time so these will be live lectures weekly as well as accountability systems, lots of missions, a whole like dozens of hours of extra material which has never been released before. But the point of it is not just to like sit there and watch videos. The point of it is that I can help you to deconstruct your current lifestyle, your friendship base, the way that you spend your spare time, your hobbies, all of the elements that make up your life and work out what creates joy and what creates distraction. What's toxic, what's positive. And to learn to cut people and things out of your life that do not serve you and will continue to bleed your energy into over time and to invest them in ways that yield, yes, financial rewards, yes, success in career and all of those external markers. But just as importantly, yield a sense of purpose, of mission, of enjoyment, of relaxation and of presence. So if you'd like to find out more about what I mean by the seductive economy, you just need to click the link below, put your email in, you'll get a 90 minute video where I explain the foundational concepts and then you'll be kept up to date with the launch of the academy coming mid-May."}
