To get that fluidity and flexibility of thought and feeling, it has to be echoed in the body. There's a big aspect that you've mentioned over a number of times here of feeling, right? So, and you mentioned earlier on that a lot of men don't even know how to feel. And I see that a lot with physicality, right? I work a lot with body movement, with rotations, with, you know, Chinese internal martial arts, things that I give to guys, because I see that so often my demographic is physically locked. They may be very strong and they maybe have, you know, good, strong bodies, but their lack of movement in joints, in musculature, in like creative non-linear ways of moving. And then the way that they lock emotionally, because it's, you know, it's a physical, I don't know if it's, it's not all physical, but it's, you know, there's a physical representation of being locked and not being able to open your heart, for example, or not being able to feel your gut, or not being able to express your sexual desire through your cock and balls. And you see that, right, with clients where you can almost see the issue is in the tissues. The issue has changed the way they move or has meant that their face is kind of frozen, or, you know, in all sorts of subtle and obvious ways. So I approach that by looking at meditation and what I would say like movement with awareness mixed in with it. So learning something like a swimming dragon, or a Tai Chi, or Ido Portales type of movement mixed with very, yeah, precise Vipassana style awareness, I found, you know, gives guys an actual experience of what it can be like to feel, you know, because have you find that too where a lot of guys like, that's the hardest thing is like, they don't know, they don't have the pathways yet to feel certain things. Yeah, oh yeah. And even as I've been scaling my reach, I've found guys who aren't achievers. And we're talking about this just before we hit record. And some who have very different political views from mine and just different backgrounds. And discovering that even accessing the achiever warrior in them, that's not even there for them either. But then dealing with an achiever who knows how to get into work mode, where he can do an all nighter, you know, at the office and get the thing done and then collapse and heave later. Even just getting there, that's amazing. And that's something that we should start with gratitude for that part of you that's able to do that. But then what it will result in is a really stiff musculature or just a rigidity of the body. And in therapy, for my practice anyway, and in IFS therapy, we're trained to always start with the body. So as the eyes are closing, the first prompt is to discover or to locate where that part that you wanna make contact with is located in, on, or around your body. To just get the client in the body, not into the worries and the thoughts and the ideas, but into the physicality of the body, just to be aware of where the tingling is, where the tension is, where there's like this throbbing somewhere, it doesn't feel comfortable, you know, all that. And sometimes it's just because they've fucking injured it or they're just really sleepy or something, but often it's something deeper psychosomatic. And there's a great book, Body Keeps the Score, Bessel van der Kolk. He's a massively well-known, he's a renowned psychotherapist and neuroscientist. His book was published in 2014. I read it like 2016, around there. Changed my life. And it's amazing that it's now New York Times bestseller number in the first position. 81 weeks, I think, as of this week, consecutively on the list. After like five years after it was published. So it's one of those perennial bestsellers. Yeah, and it's now kind of outdated science, but everything he says in there is true. It's just that we've gone, you got even more evidence for everything he's saying in there. Maybe that's why it's resurging in popularity. And as you can tell by the title, Body Keeps the Score. So any perceived trauma is going to get stored as lactic acid or some other kind of biochemical process in the body. And it will calcify, is the word you've been using. It's a great word for that. And undoing those kinks and getting to those parts of the body, and even just mentally attending to them, to have the brain send signals down to go check on what's going on there. Just even that attention to it, helps it, well, helps do all kinds of things for your psychology. You're remapping yourself in a way, right? Like remapping the actual tissue. Because that's what I saw in my first Vipassana retreats, when I first started going and doing heavy meditation, was that it was the action of not doing things and allowing the body to just take over, that started making very subtle, but very profound changes. When I first started sitting, I found that I would get these tremors up my spine, like involuntarily, that once I let go of the tension in my shoulders and I made my spine upright, and I focused on my breath, that then my body started doing stuff, twitching and unraveling, and numb areas would get really painful, and that pain would change. It's like there's so much that your body is intelligently doing, if you just let it do it, right? Instead of compounding stress and compounding tension and putting your body in very linear movements and in shoes all the time, and exercising only in linear ways and so on. Yeah, before I did the therapy training, I was doing that Ido Portal style movement training. I just got a one-on-one coach, it was really expensive in Singapore, like the one guy who was doing it, Lauren Pert, who's a really fun guy, and it was amazing. I was doing like the lizard walk. I was doing a lot of, there was a lot of handstands at first, and then just all these muscles in the body, and I didn't know I could get stronger there. And I was just doing the old-fashioned deadlifts, chest press, you know, the old bodybuilding thing, and it puts you in a plane of motion that is really just one-dimensional, and it's great for building strength for that movement. I still do all that, deadlifts and squats and things, but to get that fluidity and flexibility of thought and feeling, it has to be echoed in the body. Otherwise, you're gonna hit that limitation, and you won't understand how to go there. Gentlemen, firstly, this haircut sucks, doesn't it? They just don't know how to do long hair in Kiev. Anyway, if you'd like to learn how to get loose, relaxed, and in flow with your mind, your body, and your spirit, then you should consider joining myself and an incredible crew of movement, spirituality, and masculinity coaches at the Natural Warrior Training, coming up very soon at my personal farm in Portugal from the 14th to the 22nd of August.
