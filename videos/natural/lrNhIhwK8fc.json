People are always asking me, how do you meditate? Just be here right now. Meditation is going to be the whole thing. First thing you're going to do is your hands are going to come up as you take the breath in. I almost do all of my meditation earlier in the day. Which is awesome, because meditation is fantastic and life changing when done well. And the more people that are becoming introspective and self-aware, the better the world becomes and the better the lives of those people become. However, with this explosion of spiritual capitalism, there is of course endless amounts of wannabe gurus out there peddling all sorts of waffling hippie bullshit. Particularly the ones that I dislike the most are the ones where they talk about the universe and how much the universe cares about them. I love energy. I love chi. I love prana. I love life force. I love auras. I love chakras. It's all vibration. So, what I want to do in this video is debunk some of the myths around meditation to make this whole topic a bit more understandable and simplified. Because in my opinion, meditation is only really useful if it's practical. If it changes your life right now and continues to change your life for the better. I'm not really interested anymore in what happens after death or if I become an enlightened being. I used to care about that. Now, what I want to know is what are the tools that I can use and go about a normal life and be more at ease, more calm, more present and living in more joy and flow. So, what I want to do today is slash through some of the common misconceptions or myths around what is meditation, who it's for and how to apply it. So, here we are. The five myths about meditation. Number one. Meditation is for spiritual or religious people. Now, the fact is that most meditation systems originated within a religious structure. So, primarily within Buddhism, Taoism, Hinduism, although there are certainly meditation techniques from other traditions. And so, even though technically Buddhism is not really classified as a religion because it doesn't believe in a deity, although many Buddhists do believe that the Buddha is a god when he was just a man who was kick-ass at meditating. Although these techniques originated within these disciplines, they are not necessarily needed to be connected to. So, with some meditation techniques, yes, they have a very specific religious connection. So, for example, if you're doing some higher forms of Tibetan Buddhist meditation, you may be imagining and trying to manifest a goddess or a god and infusing them with your awareness and trying to do all sorts of essentially magical or alchemic processes but within the structure of Buddhism, believing in certain deities or aspects of the mind which are represented as deities. So, this stuff certainly exists and there are quite a lot of Western people who get involved in, deeply involved in a spiritual tradition. You see that with a lot of Western, often rich Westerners who get into Tibetan Buddhism or into Tantric traditions or Kabbalic traditions and so on. And they get, you know, they have all the thongkas on the wall and the Buddha statues and the incense and all the bells and whistles of that cultural aspect of the religion. But in my experience, because I hung around with a lot of those types of people throughout the years, particularly when I was a hippie back in the day, I noticed that most of those people didn't do a whole lot of actual practice. Some of them did, some of them were deeply immersed and they either became monks or nuns within a certain tradition, which is committing yourself totally to a tradition, which I dabbled in. I never became a disciple of a master, but I certainly went to Shaolin Temple and Indian ashrams and lived the life of a monastic for a short period of time, for a month or so. And so there are certainly people who throw themselves deeply into a tradition and they identify with that and it becomes really powerful for them and then they follow the practices. So I certainly respect that kind of thing. I've seen people in China when I was in Shaolin Temple, guys who were Spanish or from other parts of the world and lived there full time, had taken monastic vows, shaved their heads, burned the holes on their scalp, taken vows and were living that for life. So that's a deep commitment to spirituality as a daily practice with a lifelong commitment. Now, for most people that is not desirable, highly impractical, doesn't fit with this, doesn't fit with having a job and having friends and getting laid and being a person in the modern world. Throwing yourself deeply into one spiritual tradition. And it's completely unnecessary if what you're looking for is not a defining identity, which I guess a lot of people are doing when they're searching for, when they join the Hare Krishnas or they join some Buddhist group or whatever. They're looking for a sense of community and identity and belonging as well as the actual spiritual practice itself. Hey there, chill, relax. Someone translate that for me. Was that a gentle insult or was that a next time I will just kill you? I don't care. This is Hungary. Who the fuck do you think you are? So anyway, it's totally unnecessary to be part of these traditions. If you want to learn to meditate, it is a very practical and I would say scientific tool. It's not about, well, the types of meditation that I'm interested in are not about transcendental states. It's not about bliss. It's not about turning yourself into a god or a goddess. It's not about really even what happens after you die and whether you're going to get reincarnated and are you getting good karma. To be a good meditator, you don't need any of the paraphernalia. You don't need to have Buddha statues in your house. You can be a Christian. You can be a fucking anarchist. You can be anything. There doesn't necessarily need to be an ideology or a belief structure attached to meditation. And that's why I was always attracted to it because I don't believe in things. I really don't believe in anything. I don't believe in any ideology. I don't believe that there is one right way to do things or one cultural overlay that's going to suit everybody. I believe in practice, experimentation, seeing real results and adjusting those practices to deliver better results. And so if you want to learn to meditate, you just need to sit down or stand up, close your eyes and start to apply a basic meditation technique. I would recommend if you're not trying to become a spiritual person or you're not trying to join a tradition that you stick to the simpler non-sectarian meditation systems such as the ones that I teach in the martial meditation. Things like breath awareness, body scanning, abdominal breathing, embodiment exercises where you combine your meditation as in your focus and your movement, your body, your breath. So you're combining all aspects of yourself into one to create some unity, to create some balance, to get out of the white noise and all the stress and anxiety that's going on inside your mind and learn to chill out and investigate yourself at a deeper level. So in order to do that, you don't have to identify as spiritual at all. Most of the time, those people make me sick because it's usually based around a sense of arrogance. It's actually like spiritual superiority. I remember one of my best friends told me about a girlfriend he had who was very spiritual and there was a time when he was doing a lot of practice, like he was doing a lot of yoga or meditation and he changed his diet or whatever and then she one day said to him, I'm going to have to lift my game, you've become more spiritual than me lately. Like it was a competition where she was like, well he's doing four different spiritual things a day and I should do five because I'm spiritual. And obviously there's a lot of ego attached to that which is quite ironic because ideally if you're a good meditator, your ego is dissolving. You're becoming way less attached to your ego, way less attached to your identity and who you think you are and what people should think about you and so on and you're becoming more at ease with yourself. Whereas unfortunately, a lot of people use it to then identify as being more superior because they're more spiritual than their neighbor. So that's myth number one, don't need to be spiritual, don't need to be religious, don't need to believe in fuck all. You do not need to believe in anything to meditate. You just take the tool, you apply it and you see, does it work for you? Now you do need to take time with it. If you just meditate once, it's like going to the gym once, you probably won't get much result. It is something that you need to repeat daily or regularly because it's a practice that develops in depth and in efficacy but it's easy to verify that it does something. I've tried some traditions where I've used a lot of imagination which I'll talk about in another one of the myths and I didn't get much out of it. I got a lot out of sitting, observing, breath, body, mind and learning to become self-aware and unreactive because those two things in my mind are what make good meditation. Awareness and equanimity or objectivity, allowing things to move through you without reacting to them because that's how we develop our most egotistical and destructive tendencies is because we feed patterns of behavior within our mind and emotional and physical structure every time the stimulus for reaction comes. An example is if you get really angry when you're driving along and you're stuck in traffic, that's a thing that's happened but the way you respond to it or react to it is different because some people will just put on a podcast and hum and wait for the traffic to change and other people will be reaching for their gun. If you want to change that behavior, that reactive behavior then learning to be observant and unreactive is the way to go about it. So that's myth number one. Second myth about meditation is that the point of meditation is to empty your mind of thoughts. This is a commonly held idea that to meditate you need to stop thinking. Stop thinking. Don't think about stopping thinking. Stop thinking. Now you're thinking about stopping thinking instead of stopping thinking. Stop thinking. Stop it. Don't think. Now you did. How hard is it to stop thinking? To force an end to the flow of this lifelong stream of mostly nonsense that you've been ranting to yourself? This is not the aim of meditation. And it's a really very, very difficult thing to try and do. Now, if you deeply meditate, you may have experiences where for a moment there's no thoughts or some moments. But usually the moment you notice that, you're like, Oh, I'm not thinking. Ah, now I'm thinking again. And so it's something that may happen when your focus is directed. And we do experience this when you're in flow. So sometimes people who are doing intense physical activity or extreme sports or you're deeply in an intimate space with your lover. There's all sorts of things where you get into a flow. And there may be periods where for some time, there is no narrative running in your mind or very limited narrative where you are so present in that task or whatever it is that you're doing that you don't have the narrative running. Cool. That's lovely. That is one of the beautiful side effects or benefits of meditation is that sometimes you have these experiences where it's silent. Finally, because the truth is most humans never experience silence. There may not be noises coming in their ears, but there's still the chatter going on in their mind. So it is actually a really blissful release to just have emptiness for a little while. However, it's very difficult, if not impossible, to maintain for longer than seconds. If you could spend an entire minute without a thought going through your mind, that would be pretty impressive. Or you're just so dumb that you just don't have any thoughts, which would also be impressive. But the reality is this is not your intention to try and force thoughts. In fact, trying to force anything is the antithesis of meditation, trying to force yourself to be in a specific way. Now, there are differences between types of meditation, many differences. And I would say one of the major distinctions is there are meditation systems which are based on pure observation, as in it's simply witnessing. And that's in the martial meditation method. I emphasize this type of meditation based on vipassana, insight, awareness, mindfulness type of meditation, where you simply observe things as they are, or as they appear to be anyway. So you're not trying to affect anything, change anything, force anything. You're just sitting there, ideally with your back straight, and observing what is happening within this physical structure that you inhabit. So you're observing the feelings, the sensations, the actual physical sensations. You're observing the emotional responses. You are observing the way thoughts move through your mind. This is where we start to look at how can we deal with thoughts. Because if you are sitting trying to meditate, but you're imagining things, it doesn't matter what it is. You can imagine a Buddha, you can imagine anal sex, it doesn't matter what it is. It's still imagination. That is not meditation at all. And imagination is a fantastic thing. It's an amazing thing to sit there and imagine things, and out of that we can start manifesting realities, because we can't make something until we've imagined it. And being an imaginative person who can start to look at the world in oblique ways, or who can make connections that other people wouldn't make, who can bring ideas out of where someone would see something that's just mundane and pedestrian, you would see, ah, I can imagine that this would be something else. So fostering imagination and creativity is awesome, but it is not meditation. Not at all. So to meditate, as I said, there's different techniques, but the main techniques which I use are ones where I'm observing things, and I'm not trying to effect change in them. So that's where you may end up having space in your mind where you don't think as much, for sure. When I'm deeper in meditation or I'm doing more practice, there's much less of the ranting and raving going on. And more importantly... It doesn't really matter if there is or there isn't. What's more important is that I'm not following it. Because we have different ways that we can experience our thoughts. The most common way is to be inside the thought, looking out through the thought. It's like there's a little you inside your brain that is thinking this stuff and you essentially think that that is you. That's like, okay, this is me talking to myself and that's important and I'm with that. I'm deep inside that. I'm like, I'm blah, blah, blahing to myself. Now, when you're in that state, you are very unaware. You are very locked into your identity and your ego because you don't see any difference between the narrative in your mind and you. You think, my thoughts are me. They're an expression of me. Now, they are an expression of you, of course, but they're not you because they come, they do things and they leave. So did you leave with the thought? Where is the thought you had three days ago now? Is it still you? If you haven't thought about it for a year, is it still part of you? So I think what's more important is to understand that all sorts of things pass through this structure that we're living within. All sorts of physical sensations. We know that your cells are dividing and dying and being recreated and your entire body is being rebuilt over and over again. So there is no permanent, this fingernail doesn't last for my lifetime. It gets replaced and changed. There is no permanency. There is no me that is like, okay, I can put this in a box and say, that's me. There's this ongoing experience being rebuilt, dying and then being rebuilt again from a cellular level or even an energetic level up. So really, the way you want to view your thoughts in meditation is they're not your enemy. They're not things you're trying to crush, destroy, force to stop because you won't, you will not succeed. You go to war against your thoughts. They keep popping out in all different ways. Instead, the idea is to, rather than being inside the thought, looking out at the world, you step back and you observe it as another phenomena that passes through you. Just the way an itch, you know, you feel an itch, it appears, it stays for some time, maybe you scratch it, it goes away. Thoughts do that. They enter. Where do they come from? How are they manifested? That's, I don't know. I don't care. They just appear and then we have a choice of just like stepping back and just observing and going, okay, that's doing its thing. It's just like a cloud passing in front of a window. I can see it's there, but I'm not going to pay attention to it. I'm not going to put my focus into it. In this case, anyway, when I'm meditating, my focus is going to be on my breath, on my belly, on my body or whatever I'm directing my focus to, but I'm never directing my focus towards my thoughts because that is getting back into imagination and cognition and just that aspect of my mind, which I spend most of the day using. I want to just step away from that and observe something else. This idea that meditation is designed to remove thoughts, I think it puts a lot of people off from meditation because they're like, and I've heard many people say this, I've tried meditation. I'm not good at it. My mind is too, I'm thinking too much. I'm over-analytical. I'm really in my head. Those people, when they sit down, they try to stop thinking. It doesn't work. They can't even stop it for a second. Then they go, okay, well, I'm shit at meditating. I don't like meditating. I want to, and I'm kind of proud. You can justify that by thinking, I'm really, when people say, I'm not the type of person who's good at meditating, no one's good at meditating. No one, I don't think so anyway, is born good at meditating. When I did my first 10-day retreat, I was boiling with rage for seven days straight. I wanted to kill everybody and myself included and the monkeys that were jumping on top of the roofs because it was in India. I was not good at meditating. I don't know many people who are just like natural-born meditators. You get better at meditating by practicing it and not expecting that you are going to come into a blissful state, that you're going to just sit there and it's going to feel amazing and that some people do that. Maybe some people do. I'm certainly not one. Meditation for me, for the most part, has been fairly grueling. It's been unpleasant. It's been boring. People are like, okay, and why would I do that? Because as well as those things, it's been completely transformative. The one thing that I can, without a shadow of a doubt, attribute most of the big changes in my psyche, my personality, my behavior over the years for the positive has been because of a base of meditation. You can forget about that idea of trying to crush your thoughts. You sit, you do your meditation, thoughts come, they go. Sometimes they'll loosen and there's more space in between them. That's lovely. You may experience points where there's just silence for a moment before you go, wow, it's silent. It's not silent anymore. Don't worry about that. Myth number three is that it takes years to get results from meditation. Luckily, this is not true. I guess on the flip side, there is also a bit of a myth out there, especially when people are selling products, that it takes no time at all and that the results are absolutely instantaneous. I'll deal with that one first. When you hear about these systems where you put binaural beats or some kind of theta waves or whatever by plugging something in or listening to something that is apparently going to allow you to have the same results as a monk who's been meditating for decades, then I believe this to be bullshit. Because even if you have something that somehow changes the waves in your brain so you settle into whatever more conducive meditative brain waves, you are not looking for a specific state in meditation to settle into. You can. You can take drugs which will make you be in a blissful state. You can take MDMA or LSD and these things will have effects on you where you will settle into certain types of states and they can feel amazing and they can also be terrifying. But that is not the point because the Buddhist monk, the Zen monk who'd been meditating for 40 years, if you told him, we can make you feel what you feel after 40 years on day one, if he was a good practitioner, he would say, fuck you, I don't want to do that. Because it is the practice of meditation over time that develops a whole lot of aspects of yourself. So learning to sit for up to an hour, I mean that can be very difficult for people, but let's say 20 minutes to start with is a challenge. It's a physical challenge, it's painful, it's sometimes boring. Your mind gets distracted and goes off in different directions and tries to convince you that you should be doing something else like looking at a YouTube video about meditation instead of doing it. And so it's easy, very easy to get distracted and demoralized and it is difficult. So instantaneous massive results I think are unrealistic. But on the other side, the myth that okay, it's going to take you many years of meditating, you're going to have to become a monk to get results is not true. Because although the massive changes in your life don't happen instantaneously, there are instantaneous results when you meditate. They're not necessarily immediately apparent. So if I was to get you to sit down cross-legged, don't have to do crazy lotus postures and say focus on the touch of the air touching your nostril as it comes in and as it comes out. So you're trying to bring your point of focus to just the nostrils and feel the air coming in and out and that's it. So that is called anapana, it's breath awareness, it's a very good samadhi meditation or a meditation that helps you to concentrate your mind. Now if you try and do that, you may feel like you may be thinking that okay, this is not doing anything, I'm just sitting there kind of snorting and trying to feel my nose as I snort. But the truth is, and so that feels like okay, what is this meditating, is it like I don't feel blissful, I don't feel relaxed, I'm just like bored by thinking about my nose. Now if you do it like that and you start to rationalize your way out of it, then yeah, you will stop meditating. The moment I'm sitting there thinking about how this sucks and I'm inside those thoughts, I'm not meditating anymore, I'm just thinking. However, if I step back and allow those thoughts to do their thing, okay, they do their thing and then I focus on my nostrils, now I'm meditating. And what do I get out of that? What I get is not necessarily what I want, but I get a piece of what I need, which is that if I manage to do that for five minutes, I've developed five minutes of discipline. I am able to sit still more or less, maybe I fidget or whatever, but I have committed to having a physical and mental discipline, okay, and I'm developing that from the very first time I sit down. Also, I'm getting to experience what is my mind like, because most people don't know what their mind is like at all, because it's such an untrained animal and it's just going in all of these different directions at once and you're lost inside it and you're imagining, you're worrying and you're feeding it with constant stimulation from media and gossiping and the world around and so on. And so it's very rare for people to actually sit down and observe their mind in captivity. What does your mind do? How does it operate? What thoughts does it ping around to? How does it try to distract you from doing things that you actually want to do? How does it manifest in physical sensations? That's a very interesting thing to start to understand, is that our thoughts can create feelings in our body. It's true, you can just think about a really sad thing or a thing that makes you furious and your body will be involved. Fury is not an idea, fury is a full body experience and you can ignite it by thinking certain things. Or a feeling can turn into a thought, an emotion can turn into a feeling and so on. So you start to sit down and observe, okay, how do I operate? This is very, very important research because as you get better at this and as you delve deeper into it, this will start to give you the keys for transformation. You can't really transform yourself without first understanding how you currently operate. And there are patterns, we're not as complex and as interesting as we think we are. We follow patterns over and over again with slight variations and different costumes and whatever, but we repeat the same things. We are the way we are and then when this stimulus happens we get angry, we get sad, we get excited, we get horny, whatever. It's pretty predictable how we're going to react once you start to sit and observe. So that is invaluable information, that is amazing research. So you get that instantly. And then in your early days, if you did 20 minutes of dedicated meditation per day as well as learning how to do micro-meditations, which is what I teach in the martial meditation method, which is a way to use a present moment to reset yourself back into presence. So if I took this moment now and I stood and I just really focused on my feet and feeling the sensations of the heat and listening to the bum talking to himself on the bench over there and immersed myself in this situation just for a moment, that affects me. That's a little number of seconds where I've decided to rally my attention and my resources internally to observe myself and it's those kinds of things that can mean the difference between being stressed out all day and being chilled. And I do those kinds of micro-meditations dozens of times a day. I just take one breath and really focus on it. I spend 10 seconds observing the sensations in my body. I do a mini version of a stretching routine and so on. In these ways I'm bringing meditation practice into my daily life. Whether or not I end up sitting down on a cushion and doing hardcore real meditation, of course we're accelerating things and you're going to get a lot more results, but learning to integrate aspects of meditation into your daily life starts to make your life a meditation. And what does that mean? It means that you actually get to experience your life rather than thinking about it. You get to experience it rather than remembering what it used to be like and thinking about what it might be like. You get to be here now, which is the only place you can be, but you get to experience it at a much more vibrant kind of frequency. So meditation, yes, it delivers results from the day that you start and they're not the blissful wow and one with the universe usually. They're like, I've got pain in my knee and I get irritated when this thought comes up in my mind and now I'm observing how that process works and now using meditation I'm allowing myself to step back from it and not react so much. Because let's say you're someone who is prone to irritability. You get irritated easily and you're meditating and something irritates you. If you can step back and observe that a little bit and notice that you instead of going to a tent of irritation where you want to write a mean comment on a YouTube channel or punch an old person or whatever, instead it's a nine or it's an eight. The irritation is lessened because you're not feeding it so much. You're not in there with the thoughts going, yeah, fucking things make me irritated. You're just like, okay, I feel the irritation and I'm not even going to call it irritation anymore. I'm just going to observe it as a bunch of sensations and there's some correlating thoughts and a feeling or something, but I'm just going to sit there and let it wash through me as if I'm like a sea sponge and things are just moving through me. Then it doesn't have so much power and that's really powerful. That's where your meditation is worth its fucking weight in gold. It's not about becoming a Buddha and feeling blissful. It's like, cool, I can change things about myself that are not effective. I can be not so angry or so impatient. I can actually learn to relish and enjoy my life at a much simpler and more wonderful and enjoyable level. Number four, meditation is self-absorbed escapism. I remember when I first came back from my first 10-day Vipassana meditation retreat and I told my mom about it. I said, I went to this retreat center in the forest and for 10 days we were silent and just practiced meditation. She said, oh, that must have been a nice break, like as if it was a holiday. I said, no, it wasn't a nice break at all, mom. It was actually really, really difficult. I think probably a lot of the reason why people don't dabble in meditation is because they perceive it to be a waste of time. It's like if you've got that much time to sit contemplating your navel and thinking about yourself, then shouldn't you be doing, helping starving children or something, doing something more effective with your time? And isn't this just all about you? It's like an ego thing where I'm just so fascinated by myself, I just have to sit there with myself all the time."}
