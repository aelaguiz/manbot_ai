And she went, oh yeah, it's good stuff, huh? And we went, yeah, that porpoise went very good. Here's the story. I met a girl at a dance club about seven months ago. Remember that, seven months ago. I enjoyed talking to her, but she was very shy. At the end of our conversation, I tried to get her number. Good, good for trying. But she said she doesn't give her number to people she doesn't know. Fast forward to about a month ago. So this is six months later. I ended up going to the same dance club, and by some chance, I ended up seeing her again. While I was there, one of her friends came up to me and said I should go and talk to her. That's cute. She was more receptive than last time, but I was hesitant to ask for a number, so I just asked her on Facebook, and she said yes. The dance club where I met her is in my home city. I don't live there anymore. She doesn't live there either, and we're only there on holidays, right? So they don't live in the same cities. But coincidentally, I have to go to the same city that she currently is in, in two months to do some work. So two months later, he has to go to the city where she lives. When I found that, I suggested that when I arrive at her city that we could hang out together along with her friends. I think I may have made a mistake in saying that when I should have just been up front and maybe asked her out on a date, but I was concerned she would decline because she was uncomfortable last time. It's going to be at least four months until I go to that city, and I'm not exactly sure what I should do in the meantime. Should I message her on Facebook and try to build some rapport? The thing is, I don't want to get friend-zoned by chatting a lot. Also, should I tell her right now that when I go to the city that I would like to take her on a date, or should I bring it up when I'm there? Before I answer this question, let's imagine that I was a fitness specialist. I mean, it's not that hard to imagine, right? Just imagine that I was known for being jacked, and that people wrote to me asking questions about getting jacked. Imagine some guy wrote to me and said, Hey man, I heard there's this exercise, and it's a really good exercise, but it's in this place that I can't get to for six months. So should I wait around and think about the exercise for six months? What do you think I'd say? Imagine if I was some financial planner entrepreneurship mentor, which I probably will be at some point, and some guy wrote to me and said, Hey man, I just started my business. I found a customer who wants to buy my thing, but they can't buy it for six months because they're out of country. And so I probably won't be able to sell it to them for six months. So what should I do? Should I wait around until they arrive in six months time, and see where I'm going with this? The whole premise of this question is completely flawed. The answer to your question, like, how do you deal with this girl, is fucking forget about it, dude. Forget about this chick. You met her six months ago. You're going to see her in another four months. That's 10 months of nothing happening except getting a flaky Facebook. The issue here, and I don't want to be down on you, because I understand you haven't been on a date before. You're starting from dead zero. And that's difficult, right? So you don't have any experience. However, the way that you're operating mentally, and the way that you're investing and planning in this girl, if you continue with this kind of pattern, you will end up wasting years of your life on things that are never going to go anywhere. The most likely thing is that nothing will happen with that girl no matter what. And even if it did, the fact that you've spent 12 months of your youth talking about her, thinking about her, trying to figure it out. Like you had one conversation with a chick in a club once. Who do you think she is that she's that special? What is it that you know about her from one conversation that makes her that amazing that you should mortgage a year of your life waiting and pining and plotting to get to her? No woman is that awesome. She really isn't. The girl of your dreams is not that awesome that you should waste a year of your life waiting for her. That's the first thing you need to understand is that the problem here is your scarcity. And this is not an uncommon issue for men. Maybe it's an extreme example. But I've done this before as well. It's like men have a little experience with a girl. I remember there was one girl that I got on way back just before I had started doing any cold approaching. A girl got on the tram and she sat opposite me. And she pulled out a tube. I don't have it here now. I usually do. A tube of this thing called porpointment which is this like little lip balm that most Australians seem to have in their pockets. She pulled it out and she put it on and I had a tube in my pocket. And I was like, oh, cool. There's an opportunity here. This is fate. There's something special. And I pulled mine out and I like sort of unscrewed it. And I went, I think I blocked out what I said. There was something along the lines of, it's fate, huh? And she went, oh yeah, it's good stuff, huh? And we were like, yeah, that porpointment sure is good. And then I asked her, somehow asked her for her email, I think to come and see me at my band. Like I was using my band as an excuse back then. I got her email and then I wrote to her inviting it to my band and she didn't come. And then I thought about that chick for fucking months. And I think I sent her another email trying to use some other excuse to see her. I never saw her again. But I did, I can remember her vividly. Well, I can't remember the last four girls I approached today. But I remember that girl because I invested so much mental energy in her. She was so cute. When I think back on her, she was just a normally cute chick. But back then I was like, that's the cutest chick that I have met outside of my social circle in God knows how long because I don't have any way to meet girls. The only thing that, the only way I met her was through this amazing chance I had where we both had poor appointment and I could use it as some clever little in. This is a major problem that men have if they don't know how to cold approach. This is why you hear me harping on about this skill all the time. As if it is one of the most important things you ever need to learn. Because it is, right? The ability to go and make something happen with a stranger, to go and start something with a stranger, means that these kind of questions that you've sent me and that other people concern themselves with for weeks and months and possibly years are totally irrelevant and redundant. No one that I've trained would write to me with a question like that. They would simply go, they would think, okay, I met a girl at the club, she didn't want to give me the number. Cool, I'll go and approach five more chicks tomorrow or now. And then six months later, I bump into her again at the club and I go, oh yeah, cool, I might as well give it another shot. I asked for her Facebook and she's like, yeah, I'm a bit shy. Okay, here's your Facebook. All right, cool. Now I've got her Facebook. And then whatever I figure out that I might be in the same city as her in two months, cool, I'll note that and I'll write it, maybe I'll write it in my diary. Write to that girl one week before. All right, this is like, the question here is like, how do I maintain something bubbling over distance for months? You can't really. Even if you were able to get on chat with her every day and build this great rapport, that wouldn't lead to anything. I did a lot of that in the early days of internet dating. 2001 or something, I broke up with my girlfriend and I got my first shitty dial-up connection where it took about four minutes for one nude photo of a girl to appear. So you would just sort of sit there waiting with your dick limp in your hand for the photo to gradually appear. And often it would be a great photo. You'd be like, ah, that's not a great one. Now I have to wait four more minutes to jack off. It was a terrible time, the early internet. But back then, people used to write letters. You would write a long email to the girl and she would write back a long one. And I had these exchanges with girls that were 30 long letters before I met a girl. And often they would just flake anyway. And then other times we would meet and we'd be like, eh, okay. We've invested all of this energy into this stranger and we don't really have any chemistry. There's not really any point in putting much effort at all into maintaining long distance seductions. And especially not at the detriment of going and meeting another girl right now. So many times I have certainly had a girl that I met somewhere because I travel a lot. I didn't get to see her. And then some months later I come back around to the city and then I hit her up again. Do I stay in contact with her a lot before that? Absolutely not. I might flicker a couple of messages after we met and then I'll go. And then about a week before I'll say, hey stranger, I'm gonna be heading to wherever. I'm heading to Prague soon. What's new in life? And then she either flakes or she goes, oh, hey, yeah. And then we have a chat and I say, well, let's meet up and grab a coffee when I'm there. No big drama, not planning a marriage. I'm just like, cool. And then sometimes something can happen. That's the only way that you should be dealing with girls where there is a big logistical distance or time that means that you can't hook up with her straight away or you can't continue the seduction immediately. Other than that, you must forget it and literally go out tomorrow and go and talk to another girl. There's so many issues that debilitate men based around this simple thing of scarcity. It means you're needy. It means you will be needy. If you've got one girl that you have the phone number of and that you're kind of interested in, how can you not be needy? How can you walk into that situation or go on a date with her and be chilled and relaxed and easygoing and take it as it comes and like, yeah, this would be great if we hooked up but if it doesn't, it's no big deal. So it's vitally important that you have other options going. Even if you are working on a complicated or slow-burning seduction with a girl that you're really into and even if you started kind of dating and maybe you're even sleeping together and you're angling towards getting into a relationship with her, even more reason to be seeing some other girls. I think a lot of men can be quite idealistic when it comes to this particular phase in the dating where the girls, you and her are hooking up and maybe you're sleeping together and there's some romance building and you assume that if you like her and you're investing that she's doing exactly the same. The reality is often very different. You don't understand what it's like to be a hot girl. You never will. I never will. If you're a hot girl, you have that, but it's about male sexual energy. On one, any given day, if you dress up nicely and you walk down the street with a little swing in your hips, you will get constant male attention. You will have all your co-workers hitting on you. You will have your best friend's dad fucking giving you sleazy winks. You will have dozens and dozens of digital validations and likes and fucking dudes poking and giving smiles and writing you're hot on the photos. Pretty much any man that is not totally committed to a relationship that gets a chance will try to get in bed with you. In that position, the woman is buried in options. That girl, even though in this story that the guy sent to me, he says that she's very shy and she doesn't give her numbers to strangers. Maybe that's true, or maybe it's just simply that in that context of the dance club or whatever, she doesn't feel comfortable, but maybe quite likely that she's not sitting there for six months waiting around and being shy. It's quite likely that some dude in her social circle that she has a couple of glasses of wine with at a party and ends up sucking his dick in the fucking garden. It's very, very likely that she has a fuck buddy. It's very likely that guys are hitting on her from all different sides and at some time she just goes, yeah, okay, well, I'll do it. Even if I'm a shy girl, there's no reason to assume she's not doing that. We've all been there. That one girl that you pined over, thought about and planned for many months, had some long distance nonsense with, got a flaky Facebook of and then planned your wedding out and all that kind of stuff. I've been there too. I know what that pain's like, but this is essentially a symptom of scarcity of women in your life. The reality is men who get the woman that they want are choosing from multiple women. They have the ability with women in general in order to be able to choose one when they want to get into a relationship. If you'd like to learn the skills to have a choice, to never live in scarcity again, to never be wasting months and potentially years, pining after one girl, then now is your chance and your final chance for the year. I have two more live seduction workshops running. One is the Euro tour coming up in Kiev very soon next week from the 1st until the 12th of September and then we've got one a few weeks later in Barcelona, which I'm excited to get back to. We haven't been there for a couple of years. And then that's it for the year. Then we'll be off on our other adventures and you'll have to wait until next year. So if you want to get this shit sorted in 2021 and become a badass motherfucker who has choice and gets the ladies of his dreams, click the link below, get on a call with us. Don't waste any more fucking time. If you've been sitting on the fence about this for years and I know there's guys out there, time is passing. Join us. We'll see you next time."}
