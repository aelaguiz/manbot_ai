Master approach skills, particularly in a day because that's most relevant to most people. And secondly... James, I'm a fairly good-looking guy and a thoughtful person. He's a catch. When I'm alone, like walking down the street or entering the bus, etc., a good number of women check me out. However, when I'm with my friends, three or four other dudes, I feel like I'm losing my power. I feel like I'm just another dude in a big mass, mass. Girls don't look at me or if a girl comes to our company, she may or may not want to learn about me. Is this normal? Could someone project in a group as well as when he is alone? With regards to the second part of your question talking about, can I project something? I guess you were saying, you were referring to, can I project attractiveness within a group of men? The answer is absolutely yes. And the best way to do that is to make sure that the group is working together, right? So I roll with a group of very interesting, powerful seducers. You know them. And we're all different looking. None of us are like absolutely technically beautiful, but we all have a cool style. We all have confidence. We all have our own thing going on. And when we move around together, whether that's out at night, in the day, hanging out with our girlfriends, someone bringing a new girl into the group and so on, we don't have competition. We don't have one-upmanship. And most groups of men are not very good at assisting each other. The best way to get really good at seduction is to do two things. Master approach skills, particularly in the day because that's most relevant to most people. And secondly, to be able to pull together a group of men, and women if you can, that's even better, a social circle that works together. Because you blend cold approach with good social circle, and good social circle doesn't just mean cool people. It means people who are actually working together for each other's vested interests. Then you have the ultimate combination. And so that's the way that the TNL crew and our extended groups of male friends and wing girls and people we know work, is that if Liam or whoever brings a girl home or to a social event, all of us immediately start shifting the way that our roles work. Immediately he's the alpha, and all of us move to make him look good, to support him. There's no jostling. There's no one-upmanship. There's no trying to prove that we're cool. We meet his new girl, and we are polite, and friendly, and charming, and silly, but we are certainly not flirtatious. We're certainly not trying to make him make ourselves look cool, or in any way trying to be the alpha dog. We immediately shift our roles to adjust, to assist the person that needs the assistance. And this is very, very rare in groups of males. But when you work together in this way, it means that everybody wins. It means that over time, everyone is going to get laid more often. Everyone gets to play the role of leader and support structure. Even though I'm the boss of this company, consistently I change my role and shift it to the needs of the situation, which is that one of my brothers needs me to be a dork, or needs me to deal with some logistics, or go and grab the drinks, or make him look good in some way or another. And this is vitally important if you're starting to look at what's the social group that you roll within, and how are they assisting or not assisting you, then start to take stock of that and recognize, am I with a group of males that make each other look good, that support each other, or am I hanging around a bunch of douchebags who are invested in one-upmanship, in being the toughest and making their friends look like fools, right? So if you're in a group of dudes like that, then yeah, it's not very easy to seduce girls whilst you're in that group, and it's better than to just lone wolf it and try and find some guys that are actually cool. However, confident men can bundle together and not have to worry about whether they are the coolest man in the group, or the most attractive man in the group, because girls don't see that. Girls have a kind of a cheerleader effect thing the same way that we do. If we see a bunch of fairly attractive girls, we've suddenly perceived them to be much more attractive than they are. If you are hanging around a bunch of guys that dress well, that are fun, that are confident, that are having a good time together, then girls want to be a part of that, because girls want to come into social worlds where there are interesting things going on. If a girl dates one of us, she doesn't just get to hang out with the person that she's chosen, she gets to hang out with an interesting social circle, do interesting things, and be around a variety of different characters who have different things to offer. In our group, we've got guys who are really funny, the guys who are serious, the guys who are spiritual, the guys who are artistic, the guys who are organized, and within that, being a girl within that social circle is awesome. You get to experience all sorts of things within one kind of group. So ultimately, the answer to your question is to develop enough self-confidence so that you're not intimidated by being around your friends. That's ultimately an important thing, as well as having a clear bro code and understanding between your friends that you don't step on each other's toes, that you don't try and flirt with each other's chicks, that you're not trying to ever make one of your friends look shit in front of his girl. And if that is the case, then you need to sit down with these guys and actually explain the situation to them, because most men don't know inherently how to wing, and winging is not just talking to the fat chick when you're picking up girls in the bar, it's all these things that follow. And if the dude doesn't hear this advice and is not down with it, then move on and find some new friends. Or just hang out with those guys when there's nothing to do with girls. So that's the answer to my question, stop fucking worrying about whether you're looking good or not, dress well, hold yourself well, groom yourself well, and then forget about it and go out and pick the girls rather than waiting for them to pick you, because that is a loser's game.
