So now we've started our wonderful date. Hayley and I are going to demonstrate to you a whole bunch of ways in which the man... Really screw it up. Yeah for both of us. Yeah. Both sides equally capable of screwing up a date. All right. How to have a bad date. Number one. So how's your week been? It's been good. It's been pretty busy. I've just been doing a lot of work with my business. I've been doing a little bit of dance lessons as well. What dance do you do? Something called Brazilian Zouk. I don't know if you've ever heard of it. It's like a partner. Whereabouts in Brazil is it from? I think it's originally from the Caribbean but then went via Rio where it kind of mixed with Lombarda and stuff. How long have you been studying that for? About three years. I don't know. Have you ever done any? Do you go to like a school or you have a private coach? Both. So I have a private coach. How much does he cost per hour? It's not too expensive actually. It's maybe like 60 pounds or something an hour. So it's okay. But what I really love about it is you just get that good physical connection, a bit of fitness. I really like learning the skill and the technique. Lots of moves. You got fancy looking moves or what? Yeah, I've got some fancy looking moves. How about you? Have you got any fancy looking moves? Not so much. And do you have any pets? No, I'd love to have a pet though. I noticed. What books are you reading lately? I am currently reading a book called So You've Been Publicly Shamed by John Ronson. So it's all about how people deal with... Long book? How many pages is it? It's around the 180 page mark. And what was the author sorry? John Ronson. What else has he written? The Psychopath Test. Yeah, I think... I wasn't gonna say I think you'd like it, but I almost sounded like a failed insult. But it's really cool. I don't know what you're referring to. Just because I said I thought you might like it. And so did you have any brothers and sisters? Yeah, I've got one younger brother. How about you? How's your family? Are they all based in Australia still? Yeah, I don't really want to talk about them. Okay, so what happens is I think when you stack too many detail based questions together, basically, the conversation just gets narrower and narrower. And then there's absolutely no space for anything interesting to come out of it. We reach conversational death. Long book? How many pages is it? I'm trying to find out facts about you. I know, but those facts don't make me feel understood. They don't make me feel emotionally connected to you. Instead, they just end up being a bunch of stats. And I feel like that would be a point where the conversation no longer becomes relatable. So instead of going on a fact finding mission, or trying to ask any question that where the answer is a number, I get where that's coming from. You're trying to like express interest. But in fact, you're expressing interest in these completely like unimportant areas of her life, which actually don't carry any emotional weight for her, right? And things that you could possibly Google and not going to assist you. The other the other thing about that is that it actually relies on you. If I'm asking you just a barrage of questions, it relies on you providing 100% of the content, right? So there's not actually contributing. And that's a heavy and like annoying weight to have to carry where it's like each piece of and then I'm just and all I do is say cool, interesting, and then sit and ask the next question. And it feels very unnatural. So I agree that too many, too many questions stacked together can create an unnatural sense of pressure in the conversation. And instead, you're going to get what's much better is if someone organically opens up and starts to respond in response to information that you've added into the conversation. We have a simple formula, it's question, answer, comment, instead of question answer question. So just make a call and cool and interesting doesn't count. If I go cool, interesting. That's not a comment. That's just a sound that I'm putting in between the next question. So you have to go. I wasn't expecting to hear that from you. And I find that fascinating because this reason and now I can ask another question. What's up gentlemen, just finishing up the warrior workshop here in Portugal and about to head back to Kiev to run the very last infield seduction workshop for TNL in Ukraine for the year.
