Right, so who am I? What am I doing here? Hi guys, my name is Alex. I'm from Austria, 26 years old, which probably makes me the youngest member of the Natural Lifestyles coaching team now. And how did I end up here? Basically, I've been with the guys for the last over four years, but behind the camera. I was responsible for filming, editing, filming all the infields, filming the daily naturals, getting all the content on YouTube, and everything that comes after. So I've been basically following Shea, Liam, James, the whole team for the last four years behind the camera. I've listened to all the infields, I've edited all the infields, I know the content in my sleep, and I'm now, after also grinding on the streets, meeting girls in different cities around the world, seducing them, and ending up with them in my bedroom. The question is, how do the students feel after four or five days of massive approaching, massive infield, getting their mindsets shifted, having a lot of breakthroughs? They are exhausted for sure, it is a very intense workshop. We cover inner game, we cover outer game a lot, we do infield every day for hours. We have roleplay classes where we have girls, let them go through drills with girls, they're getting feedback from actual females, that's the best thing you can hope for. And I'm sure they're exhausted, but amazingly content and surprised how much they can change in four or five days. So they're definitely exhausted, they will be excited about the coming three days, because there is still a lot to come, we still have to cover a lot of conversation techniques, and we still have another roleplay class where it's about touch. So how do you not only talk to a girl, but if you end up on a date, how do you touch, how do you escalate, how do you respond when she's maybe standoffish, or you reach your limits, like how do you react to that, to be a seducing lover, you're escalating, but you also respect her boundaries, what's the best reaction to that. And on top of that, students shouldn't be too hard on themselves, like they often forget, day game, connecting with people, meeting girls, it is a numbers game, you cannot expect to talk to five girls and end up in bed with two of them. I really want to say I don't want to, but I of course want to. Let me tell you a secret, you will survive. Yeah. It's way more dangerous crossing that street right now, with all those cars, than talking to that girl. Nothing will happen. I'll be here. She loves you. I would do everything not to approach, which is so stupid, because that's what I'm here for. It's like going to the gym and expecting if you pick up the the weight and do this three times, that suddenly your biceps will be huge. It just doesn't work like that. It's the same here. So we remind them, approaching, even if you get rejected, even if it doesn't go the way you wish it would go, you still did your job, you know, you still opened yourself up, you gave her a compliment, you gave her the opportunity to engage with you, and if she doesn't want to take that offer, it's fine. So it's very important to remind the students of that, and to set them up for a path behind the workshop. Like we have them for seven days, sometimes four days, sometimes 10 days on a Eurotour, and then they are on their own. So we want to give them mindsets, beliefs, techniques, how to continue approaching in their life after the workshop. Super important. you"}
