I've got a good idea. You know, hunched over. I bet you do. Checking off with a very strong grip, really quickly, leading to the outcome of coming quickly. There'll be guys who watch this and go, nope, not interested. I'm a card-carrying porn user and I don't care what you say James, you're not taking that away from me. Okay, I can't take anything away from you, it's your choice. But imagine you just did one quick sprint once a day and then expected to be able to run a marathon later on. It's not going to work because we're training for different types of experiences. You set a timer, right? Give yourself 20 minutes and build yourself up. When you're getting close to a point of no return, take your hands off, take some deep breaths, reset a little bit, then go back into it. Then you're starting to train yourself to ride the car."}
