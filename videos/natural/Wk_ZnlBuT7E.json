Hello, coming in. What's up? I need to walk though, it's an airport. Can I walk with you for one minute? Sure. And not get killed? Oh shit, talking to you is dangerous already. What's up? Busy, going to the airport right now. Shit, that's also the worst timing to meet. Where are you from? I'm Holland, from Amsterdam. Okay, did you enjoy your time in Barcelona? Yeah, but I'm coming back on Saturday. That's great, I'll be still here, don't worry. No stress, I'll be here, I'll wait for you. My name is Alex. Hi Alex, nice to meet you, where are you from? Mal\u00e9, nice to meet you. Mal\u00e9, strong, business. I'm obviously here because you're cute, but I guess you figured. I do have a boyfriend though. What? That's crazy. I know, but... I mean, I'm not surprised. How is it going with your boyfriend? Good, yeah, actually. I've been here for about three weeks now. You moved here? Yeah. Oh, how was that? I moved here for work, so I'm currently working here now. After I come back, I'll stay for about three more weeks and then I'm going back to Amsterdam. Okay. Oh, so there's just a short... It's only six weeks apart. Because I'm here for a month also for work. But then I will... Oh, he touched my dick. Then I will move here forever, or like for a while. Forever, yeah. Never. It's a really nice city. It's great. Before, I've never been before, but... It's really nice to be here, but it's just very hot and now I'm going to Belgium. Yes. And it's like 10 degrees less over there. Uh-huh. That's why I'm wearing long jeans. These are the only long jeans I wear. Okay, do you do any modeling ever? Yeah, that's my job here. Cool, I figured. For the stores. Which store? Oh, you work for them? Yeah. Cool. Like almost every day. My ex was in love with this brand. Me too, me too. So like fittings? Loads of stuff. No, it's like a shooting, so... When you look up the site, on the website, from... You'll see me. Pretty much. Huge. Yeah. Cool, beautiful. Well, you have a boyfriend, that's good. Yeah. That's very sad. No, that's cool. I do photography. I like beautiful girls. Even with boyfriends. Maybe... I mean, I guess you have an agency and you're not allowed to work without it? No, but if you... Because I do testing. Yeah. So if you do contact my agency, it's... Uh-huh. Do you have Instagram? Yeah. Do you have one second to... I'll just add you here. Yeah. All right, screenshot down. How long have you been doing this? Modeling? For a few years now. I think about four. Still not tired of it? No, I like it. That's cool, you're so positive. Keeps me busy. Can you add me? So otherwise I'm one of the 70 guys per day that texts you. Can't wait. I'll search myself. Oh, yeah. That's you, right? Just say hi. Why? I don't know how this works. This is not real life. Do you believe in assimilation? In what? This is not real life. It's not real life. Oh, you mean your feet is not. Yeah. Right, that is true. Okay, so bye. Thanks, bye. This is how it happens sometimes, right? I'm running after her. She's turning around and some people might freak out. They're like, now she saw me. Now she saw me before I did my thing. I was just calling that out. I'm just like, here I am. Because she smiled, which obviously is great. What's up? Not every girl smiles. Some girls are a bit shocked. So she could totally take it. She's beautiful. She's a model. So she gets approached. She can handle it really well. She is in social interactions a lot. Which I called out several times throughout the set. I wanted her to understand that I understand her world. I didn't say, what do you do? And then she would say, I'm a model. And I would be like, oh, cool. I straight up said, do you do modeling sometimes? Because I understand your beauty. I understand the way you hold yourself. Okay, you're probably a model. And she's like, yeah. And I'm like, okay, I guess. I say things like, oh, you do fittings. I don't even know what that means. But it seems like a term in the model world that a lot of models do. So I'm like, yeah, fitting, right? Yeah, fitting. Okay, cool. I get it. That kind of thing I do with very attractive girls. You have to make them understand that you understand them. That you're on the same level. That you're not just some guy who's running after them because she's so beautiful. I did wait with the photography longer. I'm not using, because I do a lot of photography and I do talk to girls because I do want to shoot them and I want to make videos of them. But I'm not using it as a crutch to be like, hello, I'm a photographer and you're really beautiful. So do you want to come to my bedroom and take all your clothes off? And then we do a shoot. Maybe I can fuck you then? I'm not doing that. I did it way after she mentioned she had a boyfriend. Literally then, again, as a way of connecting, you know? And in case I meet her for a photo shoot, let's say it happens, then I will definitely, again, turn all my seduction switches off. I won't be the guy who is now trying to get into her pants through a different lane. For like, photography instead of direct seduction. No. I will meet her because I'm generally interested in photography and I want to make cool pictures of a beautiful girl and I'm respecting that she has a boyfriend. Of course, I'm heading on Instagram that for in a year or in two years or in six months or whatever, she breaks up with her boyfriend and then she starts maybe responding to my stories or liking my pictures. I will be very aware of that and then possibly reach out to her. Yes, in a seduction way. Yeah, it was just fun. Like, I enjoyed because the whole structure was off. You know, there wasn't like the stop. Hey, pre-frame. Hey, opener. It was totally free-flowing, you know. I brought the opener as, well, you obviously know I'm here. You're beautiful or something like that. I'm obviously here because you're cute but I guess you figured. Again, it shows that I'm very aware of her situation, of her life and that I'm aware of what she's aware. It's just like, puts me in a different group of men. Yeah."}
