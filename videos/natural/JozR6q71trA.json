You're still validated by your Instagram likes. You're still wasting massive amounts of time online So what's really important to do is to? To be alive in this modern schizophrenic mad world and to be able to navigate it without going totally insane is a heroic act here to be able to Live and draw all of the amazing things out of what is possible in the modern age whilst being able to create some buffers and barriers so that your mind is just not constantly swamped with absolute bullshit requires vigilance and it requires Discerning skills because I'm someone who considers myself to be pretty cool with sitting alone I can go off into the forest. I can go into a meditation retreat center, and I'm okay I don't need to be on the phone with people or having constant contact with people and yet when I put the app on My phone that says how many hours a day do you spend on that it comes out at a couple of hours at least? And I know people who spend eight hours a day on their phones once they figure out what they're doing And that's a third of your life in some cases or a quarter of your life or a fifth of your life that you're giving Away to something that at your deathbed if you had to look back and go well I spent 15 years on Facebook was that a good use of those 15 years of all the other things I could have done in Those 15 years you're gonna feel a deep sense of regret regret and regret Yeah, both of those because Obviously staring blinking at a screen in the dark seeing that somebody liked an opinion that you had for five minutes or a photo that you put up doesn't give you anything other than a Pseudo hit of what you're really searching for because why do people do that? They get they want likes because they want community engagement. They want recognition They want to be part of something and as we live in these mega Insane cities with millions of people where we are in small tiny boxes Surrounded by crowds where we are separated where we don't know our neighbors All of these things have broken us away from what makes us human which is community which is collaboration Which is sharing which is competition with other groups, of course But a sense of being part of something not just an individual consumer and that's unfortunately The role that is allocated to most of us We are simply here to be fed poison to be taxed to pour our attention into something Massive amounts of attention just so somebody can get an extra percentage point on their click-throughs for their advertising For example, like all of this stuff that's drawing this mass of human creativity and imagination all the amazing things that humans can potentially do And then leading it all to this completely pointless ends of just being able to sell more widgets on the flip side the potential Of what is available to you? And what is possible to do in this modern age is staggering even in comparison to me growing up in the 90s Now you have the ability to cheaply travel all over the world the ability to set up businesses anywhere to be able to work remotely to be able to connect with people of interest in different scenes or different things you're interested in all around the world at the touch of a button the Ability to connect to collaborate to create international communities to travel to make money Whilst on the go to be able to start something entrepreneurial with almost no capital This has only become possible in this modern era. I would not choose to live at any other time at all I'm not I'm not here complaining and saying like in the good old days back when you used to read a book and look out the Window when you're on a drive I'm glad that I got to experience the transition between these two very different ways of living But this one is vastly superior in terms of what's possible for me to achieve and many people who are willing to live outside The status quo it is very possible to balance the positive and negative aspects that are existing in this time and place But only if you do that consciously because we are flawed because we are fallible because we are easily addicted to shiny things and buttons that press and things that make our dopamine Level spike all of us no matter how spiritual or elevated you think you might be you're still checking your phone You're still validated by your Instagram likes you're still wasting massive amounts of time online unless you are conscious of that So what's really important to do is to take the best of the time and sometimes that means Making drastic changes in your life moving cities changing jobs rethinking the philosophies that your parents gave you that said that the only way to do things was to Study hard get a good job at the local firm and stay there for 30 years things that have become redundant and changed in this last generation You have to be able to adapt and in order to keep up if you want to be able to live an amazing life That may mean you need to move cities May mean that the thing that you studied is not the thing that you should pursue right, you need to be willing to adapt at the pace of change and the pace of change is Incredibly fast at the moment and will unless someone drops a nuke on us it's going to continue exponentially over the coming years and The problems associated with that are going to get worse. What happens when you have an entire generation was brought up staring at a screen Millennials are different than us Yeah we were brought up looking at comic books and going out and kicking balls even those of us who are quite uncoordinated and not very Sporty and now you have generations that just bought up by screens by this Constant flickering images by very short punchy little bites of information that people can't read an entire book anymore Or watch a whole movie or sit through a lecture. They could only take highlights. They only take the most garish and clickbaity things This is over time going to affect society more and more and people are going to large numbers of people will Be unable to concentrate will be unable to be present and that's the crux of what I'm getting here Is that if you don't create some buffer between you and the outside world You will just be constantly bombarded with information until you die People trying to get your attention to sell you stuff essentially or to change your mind and get you to vote in a certain way You will be the victim of that and the person who shouts the loudest or has the slickest production will get your attention Good day, gentlemen I'm here in Barcelona on a hot summer's day just about to start our final workshops in Europe for the year Which I'm very excited about now If you're new to this channel and you'd like to learn about what we're all about you can receive a free Three-part video series where I explain the fundamentals on how to approach women in everyday locations Without the need to use shitty old apps or wait for hot girls to come into your social circle So this is all about taking agency and learning the fine art of meeting strangers and making them want to have sex with you So you can click the link below get that free video course right now And if you'd like to join us live for our very final workshop for the year We're going to be in New York City from the 5th until the 8th of October and that's it Then we're going on holidays.
