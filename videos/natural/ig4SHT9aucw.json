And if you've been waiting for it, then just don't even listen to anything else I have to say. Just click the link below and get into it. If you're not so sure about it, let me explain what this is. So right now, you have a very unique opportunity to spend some time digitally with me that would not be possible otherwise, and probably will never be possible again. Usually, I spend my year traveling around the world, teaching workshops and doing all sorts of weird stuff. Right now, I'm staying on my farm for the indefinite future, which means that I can and have committed to being the mentor for this group, the personal mentor. There's no, it's not like I'm handing this off to, I don't know, random interns. I will be there every single class. So this is a year long coaching mentorship program with me, based specifically around consciously designing the lifestyle that you really want to lead. I'm not just talking about networking or traveling somewhere or picking up some new hobbies. Although there will be elements of that that we look at it for sure in terms of how you're choosing to spend your time and who you're spending it with. But more importantly than that, I'm looking at creating an overall framework and a plan so that you can go from where you are currently now, and you can do an autopsy on your current life. You can check all the metrics that define a happy, satisfied and exciting life, and using my system, figure out where you're at. We can see the deficiencies, the holes, the key people that you're missing in your life, people that are possibly toxic and holding you back, areas where you're bleeding time and attention that aren't serving you, looking at the way you've constructed your living situation, what city are you in, who do you live with, how do you spend your disposable income and so on. So that's the first stage is getting an autopsy of what's going on for you right now, because everyone designs their life one way or another. Most people just do it fairly unconsciously. So what do they have? They have the net average of their scene. So they have a bunch of friends that they went to university with, or they did that sporting thing with. They met through some shared event. So usually those men, and they're mostly men, if you have women in the social circle, good, but mostly men have their tight circle of men. And most of the time, they're pretty similar. They come from similar demographics, similar income brackets, similar specializations, maybe even similar personality traits. I'm not saying they're bad guys, or you should ditch your old friends. But I'm saying, if you want to live a multiplied version of your life, you'll need help. It can't really be done just alone. There is this myth of the four hour work week, kind of lone digital nomad who outsources everything and has, you know, digital assistance, and doesn't really makes money and does his gym and travels the world, but doesn't really need anybody and doesn't really have anybody with him. That's not impossible. I have met a few people who live like that. But I don't. I am a digital nomad. I'm a traveling entrepreneur. I have been involved in and continue to be involved in a huge number of creative lifestyle projects, ones designed to bring women in, cool, rich, interesting men in, amazing opportunities for travel and exploring the world. And I've built that over the last 20 years, consciously. Of course, there was some luck involved. And, you know, I had some lucky breaks at various points, but I didn't just randomly luck my way through to where I am now. I very strategically took the right types of risks. I realized when I was in a scenario such as a city or a country that had limitations in the area that I wanted to excel at, that I had to leave. You know, I left Australia nearly 10 years ago, not because I don't like Australia and Australia has lots of great things. But for my industry and for my desires, it was not the place to be. If I'd stayed there, I would still be, you know, in a very mediocre situation. Instead, I picked up, went over by myself initially, and then used my seductive economy skills, networking, power of influence, of commanding respect and attraction, of being able to actually bore into people and to draw out what are their core values so that I can connect with them super fast. So this is where seduction and lifestyle design overlap. I've met in my coaching career thousands of men of all different types, and many of them very, very successful, very good at what they do and have become very wealthy or very well connected. But they come to me because something's missing, right? And usually that's to do with dating and seduction. And interestingly, I've seen a number of occasions where a client has come to me who had the perfect lifestyle thing set up, right? I had one client who owned a very fancy club in Melbourne. I've had people who own modeling agencies or work with modeling agencies, actors, very, very wealthy, extremely wealthy people. And even though these advantages did give them something, right? So there would be some girls who wanted to hang out with them because they were wealthy or they were in a scene where there was people around, hot girls around specifically. But because they didn't actually have seductive skills, they couldn't go up and make a connection with somebody and let a girl know what they wanted and be direct and clear and seductive. The lifestyle itself didn't yield nearly as much as it could. On the other side, you have the cold approach wolves, the lone wolves. These are guys who only, you know, they have their job, they go to the gym, kind of American psycho style and they go out cold, approach girls. And if they're good at it, okay, maybe they'll bring girls in and then they do that back to their lair. And then they rinse and repeat that indefinitely. I've seen a few guys where that kind of thing has worked, but again, it's not the most efficient and not the most fun way to do things. The very best way to build a machine that seduces women more or less for you, that brings people into you, that creates a reputation about you that gets projected, you know, outside of your severity of influence maybe so that people hear about you. All of these extra multiplying effects, these are created when you learn cold approach seduction, the ability to walk up to a stranger and make your position known, whether that's some business contact or someone you want to really work with or hang out with or a mentor, or if it's a girl that you want to get into bed, right? You need to have those skills. There is no substitute for that unless you are, I don't know, A-list celebrity famous and then maybe it just happens for you. Maybe. So what I'm looking at, this is one of the areas where this course differs from a networking course or a business course, for example, is that we're looking at the human aspect and we're looking at the strategy and the design aspect as well. You have to know how to make an impression. You have to know how to be charismatic, how to negotiate. You have to need to know how to confront people and have uncomfortable situations, especially if you want to step into more leadership roles. You need to be able to look at your social grouping around you and see, okay, currently I don't have the right kinds of people. I need to find a gatekeeper that leads me into a new social scene. And every social scene has one or two or more gatekeepers. These are the people that are connectors. They're usually extroverted. They're very, you know, let's say friendly and accommodating. They may not be the leader of the group, but they may be the best person to approach to get into the group. And then you need to figure out, okay, how do I make this person like me and how do I get into this scene and what do I have to offer? A big part of the Lifestyle Design Academy is looking at what I call seductive economy currencies. All exchanges that we have are in some way transactional. Right now, I'm transacting with you. I'm giving you information. You're giving me your attention. Maybe you'll buy my product. And if you do, then you'll get amazing results and your life will be better. It's transactional. But if you didn't like me on some sense or you didn't, if you were totally annoyed by me every time I got on screen and started talking, even if my information was amazing, you just would have moved on to somebody else. I presume there's something about me that makes you compelled to keep visiting. And this is the type of personality traits that you want to develop as you're building your lifestyle. So what I've done is broken this course up into seasons because as you can see, I'm all about nature and farming and stuff at the moment, organics. And it's a good model. It's a good way to look at it. And it's just the way the world is, right? We go through seasons. Right now we're in the spring season. So over the next eight weeks, this is the germinator class. I was going to, we were like, this is the accelerator, but I was like, it makes more sense to be the germinator. So this is the germinator accelerator part of the course. Over the next eight weeks, I do eight weekly webinars of 90 minutes, usually more because you know, once I get started, I don't stop, where I will be delivering specific modules of my seductive economy framework, teaching you how to do deals, how to negotiate, how to have charismatic influence over people, how to overlap social circles, how to use the characters within your social grouping to build something such as an event, a party, some kind of traveling, you know, experience, a business, an artistic project or whatever it may be, because you're not really friends with somebody until you collaborate with them. That's my opinion. Otherwise they're just drinking buddies. Some guy you go to the office with and on Fridays you go and have a beer with, he's not your friend. He's someone you hang out with because will he come and move your fridge when you need to move house? Will he lend you money? Will he help you out with contacts? Will he recommend a girl to you if he knows one that he's not with and so on? And will you do the same for him? Because these are the marks of actual trust, actual friendship, actual bonds. We all have plenty of Facebook friends and followers and you know, little contacts, maybe someone you could write to and they might reply or if you saw them at a party, you might go and have a chat. But really those people are just people that you bump into and you kill time together sometimes. They're not your tribe. They're not your core collaborators. And that is what I'm attempting to do with this course is to create a global tribe of men who want excellence in their life in all metrics, not just in pickup, not just in muscles, not just in money, but they want the living experience to be joyful, passionate, exploratory, erotic, and whatever it is that you actually want in life. Now, in order to do that, it sounds like a big promise, right? I'm like, I promise you the best life you could ever have. Well, I can promise you that if you actually put in the work. If you're somebody who's thinking about doing this course and you're like, Oh, I've got no idea what I want to do. And James will, maybe he'll fix it for me. Please don't sign up. No offense, but I need people, guys who at least have a vision, right? Like they have a lifestyle in their mind, even if it's just a bit vague or even if it seems like it's kind of a moonshot, unrealistic goal right now. If you dare, dare to dream, dare to think outside the box, dare to look at your own life and realize that it's more shit than it could be. And that's a hard thing for people to do, to really accept that they're not living their best life. And many people, most people won't do that. They will just create justifications or excuses or blame for why life is the way it is. You know, I mean, my business took a massive hit and most people I know have had, you know, really difficult times. And I'm not here to say that that's your fault or that you should have been hustling harder or anything like that. It's the realities of where we're at right now. It sucks, but it's going to suck way more hard for some people and it's going to be okay. And for some people, it's even going to be advantageous. I've been on this farm for two months, but I've been more productive probably than I have been in two years. I've been rekindling networks. I've been checking in with old flames. I've been working on new projects. I've been planning and preparing. Then I can hit the ground running. Whereas I think a lot of people are just thinking, oh, well, everyone else is just sitting watching Netflix. So I guess the world's on hold. So I'm not really falling behind by sitting on the couch. You are, because there are men out there. There are people out there who are pivoting, adjusting, being adaptable and working out how to make this work for them. And that's what I'm here to do as your personal mentor is to help you through this extremely difficult time to start leveraging other currencies aside from money. So this is not a business course per se, although it will help you in business and it's not a seduction course per se, but it will definitely help you in seduction. It really is a product and a course designed around looking at what is this lived experience? How can it be better? And not just better, but multiples better. And when you see like the tagline where I'm like 10X your seduction and lifestyle results, like that sounds like a bold claim. It sounds like marketing hype, but it's absolutely true because what is 10X when you think about it, right? It's like if your social world currently is a handful of people in one tiny location, to 10X that, that would mean knowing 50 people fairly well and being invited into or having access to 10 different social scenes instead of one. I've got access to dozens of social scenes. If I want to, I can pop into any country and I can contact people. I can be part of their world or I can take my crew over to meet other crews and then I can overlap lifestyle design crews to then multiply not only our effects, but the other groups effects and then having even more effects. Trying to do this all alone, whether it's going out and picking up women, trying to get rich, trying to build a, I don't know, a honeypot that attracts people to you. If you're just one person, you're going to have to be fucking charismatic. You're going to have to have a huge personality to do all of this alone. And you're going to need to have not just the art, the creator skills, which is where I'm at, but you're also going to have to have the, uh, the technical skills, the analytical skills, the micromanaging skills. And those are not my skills particularly. I'm a big picture thinker. I'm an, I'm a creator. Yeah, I can do, I can, you know, I can follow spreadsheets a little bit and I can, I can crunch numbers a little bit, but I'm, that's not my forte. When you find other people who have complimentary skills and you bring them in using the seductive economy framework, you bring them into your life. Then you have access to all of their skills and networks, which right now, if you're in your same crew of guys you went to high school with, you probably all have the same networks. You probably all have the same skills. Therefore, as I said before, you're not going to be able to multiply each other's effects. So here's how it works. The spring germinator or accelerator, which is where you pack in huge, all of the information, all of the theoretical aspects over the first eight lectures. Also I'll be giving you weekly missions, missions that you can initially do from home, but there is a lot you can do in terms of connecting with people and setting things up. Eight weeks, accelerator course, missions, and then a huge suite of bonuses. And our marketer told us, make this offer so ridiculously juicy that they can't refuse. And we're like, okay, we put all this stuff in. He's like, more. We're like, really? And we're like, how about another five hours? More content. 10 more hours. He's like, make it 50 hours of content. All those markers, they just love packing content in. So we did. This course contains around 50 hours of unreleased content, which includes 20 plus hours of the library of Netropolis. And what that is, is all the webinars that I've done in the past for various other online courses, which is over 20 plus hours so far. And we're going to keep adding to that as time goes on. I've answered hundreds of questions on all sorts of different topics, seduction, lifestyle design, finances, sexuality, et cetera. And they're all in these big, long lectures. So what we've done is we've chopped them up into their five, 10, 20 minute blocks. We've created categories and we've made it extremely searchable. So we have a library of all of the stuff that I've talked about, all the answers that I've given to questions. So that's one bonus. Next, I should talk about the fast action takers bonuses. So from now, right now, this now, right now, for the next three days and three days only, just to make things super juicy, to get people who really want this moving fast, I'm throwing in a bunch of bonuses that are only available for the next three days. Two extra modules. These are unreleased two hour lectures of which I've put up like five, 10 minute clips recently on the channel, the new alpha and handling your woman. And so these are specific modules looking at the dynamics of a very highly functioning male social group using the concept of the floating alpha, as opposed to a top down dominance hierarchy where there's one person in charge and people filter down in categories underneath. The floating alpha group is amorphous and shifts and adjusts to the needs of the individuals, meaning that whoever needs to be the alpha or it's going to be most beneficial to be the leader or the person with the most status, all the other people adjust and shift around them to make that happen. And we do that for all the other people. This is the most effective way to make sure that everyone within the group benefits more or less equally. Another module, one of the bonus modules is how to handle your woman. This was the last speech that I ever gave on seduction. And I attempted in that two hour lecture to condense my 15 years of seduction experience into one two hour block. And I've been told by people who were there that I did it. So check it out and you can decide for yourself. So those are the bonuses. Oh, and there's one more. Which is a free webinar with Alex Leon, who's behind the camera right now. He's our many things. He's a man of many hats. But one of the things he's amazing at is social media. He's a social media fuck boy. He's an Instagram fuck boy. Yes, he is. I don't spend that much time, very little time really, actually meeting girls online. I do put time into my online marketing strategy, not in TNL, for marketing my dick, marketing me. You must understand social media in this day and age. The days of being able to go, I don't do Facebook, I don't do Instagram, they're gone, right? Like, sure, you can be a ghost on the internet if that's what you really want to do. But it's going to massively hurt you when it comes to meeting women and creating contacts and networks, because everyone else is on there. And you need to know how to master it. It doesn't mean you need to be on there every day, posting stories all day. I don't do that. It means that you need to be strategic, putting up the right photos at the minimum number of right photos per month or per year, the right type of engagement, and looking at what is your niche? What are you actually trying to project? What is the message or the archetype? So Alex is going to be giving an action-packed webinar, live webinar on that, where he gives lots of examples, breaks down a bunch of different profiles, and shows you how to optimize your social media presence. So if you want to get those bonuses, you've got from now until 72 hours from now to do that. After that, those bonuses are just taken off and they won't be back. Why? Because they're an incentive, obviously. They're there to incentivize yourself, and it wouldn't incentivize you if we just left them there. So you've got three days to get those. However, there's also a whole bunch of other bonuses that are available for the length of the launch, which is from now for the next seven days, seven days only. I will close the cart, and then I'll move on to teaching the guys in the course. This is not just a dump of digital information on your hard drive. This is week by week, live lectures with me with a whole bunch of supporting material. Extra bonuses that you get are almost all of the MMC, Masculine Mastermind speeches that have been done over the last three years. We've put on these huge events in Budapest, 200 guys have come each time. All the T&L coaches plus a bunch of amazing guests that we rate, and we don't rate that many people, have given very in-depth lectures on a wide variety of topics. And for the first time ever, I'm putting them all in one spot. So you've got this massive library, I don't know how many hours, 20-ish hours of unreleased speeches from the Masculine Mastermind Conference. Also, as a bonus, what I'm including are all of my iconic speeches from the 21 Studios. So I gave these speeches between 2011 and 2017, I think was when I was speaking at those. I bought the rights off Anthony, who's the organizer, and so now I have the license to release my material. So there's something like 10 speeches, and these are the speeches that cumulatively have received around 2 million hits all up. So this is my most popular material in terms of what's been out on the internet. And there's a reason for that. The three pillars of seductive success, what women want, multiple relationships dynamics, the final pillar of seductive success. These are pivotal speeches that I spent months preparing for, and they chart all of the key areas that we look at at The Natural Lifestyle. So all of those are available for you. And the good thing about this is that some of this kind of material is likely to get ripped off the internet, and has been. We've certainly had videos taken down, there's channels that have been under threat because of political correctness or, you know, whatever's going on with YouTube. These videos are all hosted separately, and so you will have them there permanently to use this resource library for the rest of your life, or as long as the internet survives. So that's the full package. You get your eight-week accelerator, germinator course, you get this full suite of extra bonuses. You also have accountability and tribal groups. So you've got your private telegram groups, where every day you can ask me questions, you can interact with the other guys, you can find other guys within the course that are in your maybe geographic area, or maybe not if you're thinking globally. And over the course, you will start to work with each other on social collaborations as well. So moving from the spring, into the summer, into the autumn, into the winter seasons, What I'm aiming to do is initially autopsy, give you the blueprint of all of the information, and then I want you to implement and execute this. As I said, I don't want anyone to sign up who's curious or who's just like, I might just come and watch the videos. That's not, I don't, I don't need those kinds of people in my life. And it's not going to be worth your money to do that. It's just like, all right, if you just want to watch Netflix, just pay for Netflix or seduction Netflix, whatever it is. I need guys who are willing as soon as the doors open to go out there and meet people, to go and network in a real, real sense, to be able to find collaborators and build something, to try and find female friends and wing girls to bring in to your group. I need guys who dare to think big. We're going to create the proto version of your excellent life. So it's not like from now until 12 months, you'll necessarily be hanging out with Johnny Depp or Brad Pitt or anything, maybe, unlikely, but it's that you will, if whatever it is your, let's say end goal lifestyle vision, which inevitably will change over time, but the one you have right now, whatever that is, let's get to one to two degrees of separation away from that. All right. So let's work on creating the strategy, working out the gatekeepers, the people we need to target the skills you need to acquire, maybe their communication skills, maybe their actual skills. What currencies do you have to trade on? Because you need to understand that people, people who have a certain level of status or influence, they only really allow new people in if they benefit from that. And that may sound kind of cold, but welcome to life. I get guys writing to me all the time saying, can I have a job or help me out with these girls? Or I'm in town. Can we hang out? And I just usually say no, because I've got as many friends as I can handle. I've got as many women as I can handle. Every man that I work with or hang out with has some amazing skill and sometimes that amazing skill is just that they're really funny or that they're really good to talk to. It doesn't necessarily mean they're high level specialists in some skill set, but they're people you want to be around. Charm is a currency. Listening is a currency. Making people like you is a currency. Making people respect and fear you is a currency. And of course, all of the skills that you have to trade on as well. These are currencies. A guy wrote to me yesterday and said, hey, I've studied permaculture. Can I come and do an internship and work on your farm for a little bit? And maybe I'll take him up on that because he's going to offer me something that I need. I need that skill and I don't have that right now. So that's a good way to try and contact. Oh no, now I'm like, everyone's going to go and like study permaculture for 10 minutes and then rock up at my farm. But you see what I mean? It's like, okay, in my position, that's something that I kind of need right now. So that means I'm more likely to give that person a chance. So over the months, we're going to be looking at targeting, upskilling, bonding and creating links with other men who also want to do this. And probably you'll be able to do that just within the course itself because there's going to be so many guys who are super proactive about this, but if not, to be able to find them in your local scenes. And then to start working on lifestyle design projects immediately. We don't have to wait until you're super sexy and rich and A-list in order to start doing this. It's basically as simple as two guys organizing a Sunday afternoon picnic with Frisbee and they invite people to it. That's a lifestyle design project. It's two people throwing in their resources to multiply the effects. And if they go out and do some cold approaching or they pull in their friends, maybe there's a few girls there. And then the lifestyle design project, which is simple, it's just like hanging out in a park and throwing Frisbees and drinking some wine. That's a more fun prospect than what she had going on Sunday otherwise. Now you're a person that is worth hanging out with. So it can start from things as simple and as small as that. And then it can blow out as far as your imagination and willingness to put in the work will take you. So now when I plan a lifestyle design project, I literally think, which person on the planet would I like to meet? And what do I want to do with them? And how am I going to make that happen? And then I do. Recently, I was like, I want to get involved in the models and bottles and playboy photographer scene. And I did. Very, very quickly. Not with myself, but with the multiplying effects of my networks. I wanted to get involved with guys who are in high level scenes, whether that was politically influential or creatively influential, or people who could get you contacts and access to worlds and locations that can't be gotten to otherwise. And so I've been able to generate this. And every single year I do that and my crew around me, we don't sit down and have like one meeting at the beginning of the year, but we riff and figure things out as we're going along. Like, what if we could do this? What kind of people would we need? What resources would we need? Are we missing any skills? No, I reckon we can start doing this. Let's execute and start implementing immediately and then figure it out as we go along, correct things, renegotiate, be ready to confront and create boundaries or whatever it is we need to do to keep that thing rolling and moving. So if you're at home right now and you're looking at the net result of your life so far in this mini retirement that we're all forced to be in, be honest with yourself. Like if this was it, if this is all you got, is it enough? Is it your dream life? Is it the way you want to be spending your time? Are you with the people that you want to be spending time with? The lovers, the friends, the collaborators? And if the answer is no, now in some ways is a very precious and unique time where you get to take a breath, step back and look at your own personal life and go, okay, before I was so busy and rushing and I had five chicks on Tinder I was sort of talking to and my ex-girlfriend I was maybe going to something with and oh yeah, we're going to go to skiing with my friends next winter. But I'm just letting life pass. I'm so busy and I'm so distracted and I'm bleeding time in things that don't actually yield any results. Swiping on Tinder and chatting to a girl who flakes and then another who flakes and another who flakes is a complete fucking waste of time, seriously. It doesn't give you anything. It makes you feel bad about yourself, right? So let's either optimize it or remove it. And that's the way I look at everything in my life now. As I'm getting older, I'm getting more ruthless. Optimize or remove. And that includes people in your life. Again, if they're good people, they make you feel good, they connect with you, they're funny, whatever, that's a good reason to keep them around. I don't mean look at humans as utility, just like, you know, can you make me richer? No, get out. It's like, can you make my life richer? Yes, then you may stay. And if you don't, if you make my life poorer, then I will remove you. And if I make someone else's life poorer, they should remove me as well. So it's time to be real with yourself. The world has changed, right? Corona will pass, but the world will be different. Economies will not be as good as they were for quite some time. Those who thought that their life was stable and they had it all sorted will realize that it is not stable. We live in a chaotic, intense, rapidly changing time in history. Nothing like this, and I'm not just talking about the lockdown, but nothing like this experience of life has ever happened before, where there was the opportunity."}
