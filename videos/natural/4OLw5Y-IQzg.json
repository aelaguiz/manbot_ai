So when I started doing approaches, I noticed in myself that I'm quite uncertain. Do I really desire this woman or do I just push myself because I fear of not doing anything? And with time, I started being more and more aware. Am I desiring or am I not? And with that, it really changed from anxiety to energy. I got more into the flow. But with that also, I noticed that I started doing less approaches. And sometimes I go to my training session, I spend two hours a day or something, and I don't approach anyone, even though I walk around. But I don't find the girl I really wanted approached, that I desire to approach. So I was wondering, do you notice that when you're coaching guys, what pitfalls, what dangers do you see in that? People say this to me sometimes, and I don't understand what they're talking about. Seriously, come on. Walk around the streets in this city. Every time I walk out the door, I'm like, oh, fucking women again. Women, women, they're everywhere. I thought that maybe there wouldn't be any today, and there they are again. How do I activate my desire? More like, how do I get down the street and get to the thing I'm supposed to be doing? But I am, where do you live? In Lithuania? Fuck, and what are you even talking about? Yeah, they are pretty. Yes, they're pretty. I was there. Yes. It's like if you said, I'm from Detroit or something, they'd be like, okay, well, you're gonna have to lower your standards a little. Yeah, like yes, if you're living in a place where there's a dire scarcity of attractive women, then okay, then that might be an issue, but I know Lithuania. So to be honest with you, it's a creative excuse, because what else can it be? I hear this from guys sometimes, and it's this complicated thing. It's like, okay, I don't know if I feel the desire when I'm looking around. You're walking around, and you're seeing beautiful women, and you're somehow managing to filter them out. I don't think it's a lack of desire or testosterone or something. I'm sure, though, you get yourself checked if you think it's an actual depletion of physical desire, which it can be, or overuse of pornography can be something that can really scatter our energy. But really, it's like, I really just feel like it's that. And if it feels really, really does just feel like, okay, I don't desire these women, maybe there's layers of blockages in the way. But then maybe you can just adjust your dial to be like, okay, do I need to, if I'm not feeling like a raging desire for women, let's assume that it's there, but that it's somehow repressed or suppressed or scattered. Let's assume that even just as a thought experiment. And then look at, okay, what else is on the dial that is going to motivate me to go and talk to girls? And there's lots of things. Can you guys give me some of them? Yeah, okay, so connection, we'll dig into that a bit. Like, what would be the motivation if it's not that, okay, for some reason, I don't really feel desire right now. But I'm going to work with connection. What's the desire of like, what's behind that that's going to motivate me? Validation in what sense? Yeah, okay, sure. And that's that that will be a motivator that will, I wouldn't say is not a long term effective one, but it can be a short term one. Certainly, that's what partially what got me started in the beginning was like, okay, I want to prove myself. It feels good to have attractive women give me attention. It feels bad when they tell me to fuck off, which is the flip side of that one. And so it's something that, okay, I'm, I'm searching for a certain type of approval. And that's okay, as an initial one, but it's, it is dependent on the outcome, it is dependent on the girl validating you, which can be which can also be dangerous, because then you get jerked around all over the place, because she she likes you, she doesn't like you, she likes you, she doesn't like you, she doesn't like you, and then it throws you around. Yeah, so but let's look a bit deeper into this connection idea. Okay, about what? What about them? Yes, that's definitely true. Yeah. So whenever we're walking down the street, and I see a student look at a girl, kind of like he's like, is that a girl? And I'm like, go. And he's like, I'm not. Yeah, obviously, you're sure because you've just turned your head and you'd stop listening to what I was saying. So fuck off. But anyway, the point is, these buzzwords are correct, but you need to dig behind them. Okay, connection? Yes. But what are what is it that is going to lead me to want to connect? It's a desire to be a whole human. It's a desire to understand somebody else's point of view. It's a desire to start a narrative, a story with this person. That's a good way to look at an interaction. Okay, if it's not that I feel raging desire right now, for whatever reason, it's that, okay, I'm in my little bubble, and I'm walking around my rat maze doing the same thing that I do all the time. And I know that and that gets boring. So let's break out of that, pull someone else out of theirs, and see if we can have a magic moment, not to not that it's something that we need to construct out of zero, it's that there is a potential for attraction for this flow of masculine feminine energy to ignite. And it's, it's, it's a potential energy that exists in infinite variation, even within one city. Okay, because there is X amount of girls and there's and depending on exactly the time of day that you bump into her and her mood and your mood and what you're wearing and what she ate and all these other things, it's going to ignite in a different way. And that to me is fascinating. Because otherwise, I would have quit this shit years and years ago, if it wasn't that each time that I meet a woman, something special, knowing that something special will happen, even if she's a total nitwit. It's gonna there's a special type of nitwittery that happens to bounce off my weirdness in that moment. And we have this awkward, strange interaction. And that, to me is better than just walking down the street. Right? So I think it's like, look at how mode have multiple motivational actions with inside you. Don't Yes, I'm I always talk about intention about projecting intent, but it's not just sexual intent. I have all sorts of intentions with people. I want to connect with him on multiple different levels. And therefore I'm mostly curious. Sometimes I'm not sometimes I don't want to have anything to do with people at all. So I bought a farm in Portugal so I can run away. So it's not that you have to be in that state all the time. But it's that having that as a regular part of your way of interacting with the world just delivers results. It just brings so much dividend that it's worth it. Even back in the day when I used to grind every day for two, three years. I just did it whether I felt like it or not, whether I was in a bad mood or not, whether I was like, Oh, women, I don't know. How do I even feel about women who gives a shit just go and speak to some people and get this thing going because you haven't figured it out yet. You have to have a bigger motivation than just like, do I feel like this today? Am I am I compelled in that moment? Sure. The moments where you feel like you're being pulled towards somebody or your head is turning like that. Those are the ones that you absolutely must follow because that's where for whatever reason, the chemistry or something has just ignited. And that is the kind of that is the girl that you really want. Sure. Absolutely follow that. And as you peel off layers, you'll come closer and closer into contact with that more raw animal instinct. And so you'll have that sense. A woman walk in the room and you just feel yourself needing to do it. But if that doesn't exist, you can still do it. There are many other things to be motivated by. And just to add a quick story, Sasha Daygame, our friend, our good buddy, he and I once were in Brazil coaching a program there. We had four guys in Rio and all four were friends. One was Brazilian, the other three were from Europe. And they were all poker players. And because of the poker laws, they had to move every three months. And they were living in Rio and we were running a workshop. And it was the first time either one of us had ever seen anything like this. These three young guys in their 20s, good looking all, just were not driven at all or propelled at all to talk to any woman whatsoever. But they had so much money, they hired us to help them talk to women. And then we both looked at each other. We said, there's nothing like this. How did this happen? Then Sasha just blurted out, look guys, you're doing hookers, aren't you? Right? So you might not be doing hookers and they were. Because they had so much money, why not throw a couple hundred bucks a day at a hooker? And that's what they were doing. So they didn't, for a real woman, now this gets into the serious part, a real woman wasn't, why do I need that? Why do I need to deal with that? They leveled out their connection to women are just for fucking, just sex. They didn't see all that James had just said. They didn't see the artistry in the process, the art of the flow, the practicing of being a great icebreaker, the discovery of me with another person, a stranger with my adrenaline pumping in a conversation. They didn't value that yet because they didn't know it. And there's things you need to come to know. And so maybe you're not doing hookers, maybe you're watching too much porn, which is another, can do the same idea. It's all just about this imagery and it dulls your brain. But it's really about getting to love the process of discovery of yourself and her and yourself with her and exploring that endless dynamic."}
