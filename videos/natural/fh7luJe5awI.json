Three, two. All right, gentlemen. What's up? This is James Marshall sitting in my samurai robe and denim shirt, which is that a good fashion choice? I don't know. I don't care. I'm in quarantine. How are you doing? This is the Natural Lifestyles podcast. And today I am joined by an extra special guest. They're always special, but this one just feels even more special. An old friend of mine. No, she's not old. I've known her for a long time and we've had some very cool adventures together. She's in a relationship with a friend, with another friend of mine, but she's her own person. She's not the wife of a friend of mine. She's a badass. And I also think her husband's awesome. So I've been hanging out with this pair on and off over the years. We've met up in strange places like Serbia and Miami and I don't know where else. And I'd like to introduce you. So this is Saida Desilets. How you doing? Desilets. I'm doing great. Excellent. Now Saida, my audience doesn't know you. I don't think we've ever, you've never been on any of our things. We were planning on getting you to come and speak at the AMC this year, but that's not happening. Obviously. Yes, obviously. So tell us, tell my guys who are you and why am I talking to you? Yeah, so I'm Dr. Saida Desilets and I have been called a counterculture creatrix, which I guess we'll see if that's true or not as we progress with the conversation. I like it. A body philosopher. So someone who just really loves the wisdom and power of the body. So a lot of my work has to do with the body, especially the female body. And an author. I've been on TEDx. I talked about desire there. Dedicated my whole life basically to the topic of sex, pleasure, orgasm. More from the perspective of women, but in the past I did get to teach men and I just love the topic. I adore you. And I wanted to say something because I swear one of your guys ran up to me in a mall in Melbourne and did the whole James Marshall thing and I just was so delighted. I mean, it was so sweet and I couldn't believe what was going on and I couldn't tell him that I knew you, but I walked away going, that was a James and I loved it. It just lit me up, lit up my day and I'm just really grateful for all that you bring to men and also to the women. Thank you, Seda. That means a lot coming from you, especially. Okay. So one of the reasons I want to talk to you is because you're a voice on the other side in the female camp who is, as you just described, a counterculture. What was that? Counterculture. Creatrix. Creatrix. I don't know what that means, but I get the general idea and yes, I think that is you. So you're a person who is, I would describe you as extremely strong, very independent, very like a rational thinker. You spend a lot of time thinking and breaking down sexuality relationships from a different perspective than I have, you know, dealing more with women and dealing with other aspects that I want to talk to you about. But one of the things, one of the things I think is cool is that you, from what I can see, don't really hold an ideological position. I mean, I guess we all have some forms of ideologies that we like to dabble in. You know, I'm a sometimes Buddhist and a sometimes liberal, sometimes capitalist, you know, I have various shades of that. But you're someone who I've never heard, like you've gotten into hot water with women before, right? Because you haven't said what is the right thing to say at the time. I'm literally considered an anti-feminist. Okay. Tell us about that. Well, I'm anti-feminist supposedly because I actually believe that women are powerful and to be a feminist right now, you have to believe that women are victims. And I know we're going to talk more about this, but I don't agree at all that women are victims. I do know that we all have victimized experiences, men and women, but to hold the stance, I think it's insulting actually to be considered because I'm female, I'm a victim. It's incredibly irritating. So if that makes me anti-feminist, I happily receive that label. Okay. Um, yeah, because, well, remind me, there was something recently that you said or wrote in a post that got some, some kickback, right? Can you remind me what that was? Gosh, I don't know because I do get a fairly regular kickback from, from people. Um, it was probably had to do, there was a, uh, and we're going to talk about this as well. There, when this idea of toxic masculinity came out, there was an article released by the New York times. It was written by, I think a lesbian woman author. And then I don't know how the man identified himself, but a guy. And once I read this article, I was horrified because the central theme to the, how do we rid the planet of toxic masculinity was to castrate every living male. Literally. Literally. So I shuddered right down to the very essence of my being and went F no. Can I swear on this? No hard cocks anywhere ever. Oh no, no, no, no. Not for me. We will not be doing that. I like a cocky world. Can we keep a corral of them like under the left or something? Well, you don't really need one. According to certain people, you just need sperm banks. So whatever. Anyways, that's not my reality that I want to live in. So I actually went on, I did an hour and a half Facebook live diving into this. And obviously it was controversial because it goes against the narrative and it's just not the world that I wish to live in. So that's why I'm happy to be here today because I do want to talk about what is healthy masculinity. Why is it so enjoyable to be around that and why we need it as well as all the other facets that you want to address. Yeah, that's something I wanted to, because I was thinking about this in the garden the other day because the idea of toxic masculinity comes up in various forms. In my information bubble, when that phrase is a cue pointed inwards, it's immediately met with extreme defense. So it's like, and kind of understandably. So if the general thing is you're being told that masculinity isn't in and of itself toxic, that's the inherent argument there. I mean, it's a very extreme argument, I'm sure. Most women don't want to cut the balls off all men, but it's kind of like the end point of an ideology that says that the maleness is dangerous. That's its inherentness, that it has all of these very volatile, dangerous elements within it and those things need to be compressed and controlled. And my thoughts on that is that there are absolutely elements of masculinity that are toxic and they're not just random. There's patterns and there's institutionalized behaviors. There's brutalization that's passed down from father to son. There's all sorts of things that bring out the worst aspects of maleness. And you've just hinted at it that there's, talking about that, we were just talking briefly before the call, that there's something that a woman needs. And that's actually a question I could ask you is, why do women need men? If the truth is that you could have a sperm bank and you can have dildos, you can have the functions of a man kind of replaced theoretically in some dystopian, brave new world. But aside from that, why do women need men at all? Yeah, that's a great question. And often I like to answer these questions more from a person place. And so before I answer that, I want to answer what you said before there on toxic masculinity. I want us at some point on this conversation to list what do we think and believe is toxic. And why is that solely a masculine thing? Because I think if we're going to say a human being has these toxic attributes, it doesn't matter the gender. Those things are going to show up no matter the gender. So I first think that that's important to establish that this is an issue of people, mostly probably uninitiated people, people who have been raised in trauma, people who maybe just didn't have whatever the resources to learn and grow and mature emotionally. And then it does lead to these behaviors that have now been labeled toxic. So I want to get back to that after I answer this question of why do women need men. But it's so important to understand that this is across the board a human issue if we make it one. Right. Because I wanted to discuss what is toxic femininity as well. Because that's what I was thinking. There are elements and patterns of women that are toxic and men. And those are elements that need to be addressed individually in relationships or broader scope, I guess. But it's not, you know, it's not just the entire gender or the entire essence of male or female that's the problem. Exactly. So why do women need men? It's an interesting question because I'm just going to frame this with what I do. So one of the main things I do is I love to invite women and people if I'm teaching mixed gender, but women into sexual sovereignty. Now, that scares people for multiple reasons. But one of the ways it can scare people is like, well, if she doesn't need anybody sexually, why? You know, what's the point? It's not about that. Sexual sovereignty is more about having dominion over your own body, the mastery over knowing yourself, being free to know your desires, express your desires, to know your own body so well that you can self generate ecstatic states. And no matter the skill level of your partner, you can actually create an incredible experience for yourself and maybe even for them if you're feeling generous. So at the end they're like, oh, I'm awesome at sex. And you're like, you're awesome at letting me be awesome at sex. Yes. Well, you know, there's just very, there's different levels of skill and there's different levels of confidence. Sexual sovereignty invites kind of an ongoing lifelong relationship with something that shouldn't have an age, to be honest. Sexuality, like the beating of your heart, you know, it's there when you're a fetus until the last breath. So it's very important to look at that. So if we are sexually sovereign women, we don't technically need anybody. I can orgasm happily on my own. I can have even what I call cosmic orgasms on my own. So what's the point? And James, when I took myself through a lot of these practices in the early days, I changed a lot from a sexual predator to someone who was a lot more conscious. And in that transformation, I remember just coming to a point of like, wow, how could I ever have a relationship with another human? This is so good. And I don't have to deal with all the drama. And, you know, it was just so good. And it dawned on me, it's not about my orgasm. It's about coming into relationship with the mystery itself through another. And I can't predict what will happen because now there's this mysterious factor of other. And I personally am oriented myself heterosexually. So it's not that I need men, but I want them because the dance of that mystery that arises with whether it's just a look or a dance on the dance floor or all the way to a full blown sexual experience. It's that dance that I'm interested in. It's that sexual tension. It's the what's next? What's going to arise? Can I be completely open to feeling and sensing this? So it's less need, it's desire, it's want, it's choice. And then to take that to a wider range of orientation, then it would just mean for everybody, we don't need anyone in that sense. But we get to want them, we get to desire them, we get to play in this realm of sexual amazingness together. And that's why I try and reorient women instead of looking to sex as a place where they need to get their 50 orgasms a day status, whatever it is, the number. And they get really disappointed if they only get to 49, which is really a lot of weight on a partner, no matter what gender the partner is. Yeah, dude's like, what? I have to give her 50 orgasms a day? Yeah, it's a lot of work. But what if you come in already have accomplished your ratio that you would like to accomplish every day? You're full, you're gourmet, you're not a beggar, you're not begging for something. You're actually going, look, I'm full and I want to play with you from this full place. Let's see what can happen. And if orgasm doesn't happen, you don't care because what's happening is something else. Deep connection, play, maybe even profound emotional experience. Who knows? Because it's all different. You can even have transcendent sexual experiences are very common. So those things are what coming together is truly about, not about mutual masturbation that leads to one or three orgasms. So we have to shift. Sorry, do you think there's like you've talked about, okay, what is the point of the other then? Is the excitement, the mystery, the unknown, the dance between those two or three? Do you think that there is something inherent about it being a male and a female? Of course, there's all sorts of combinations. People are into all sorts of things. But we're talking mainly about heterosexual guy, heterosexual girl, mainly heterosexual people. Is there something then about the manness of him as opposed to, okay, it's just a really sexy, but, you know, hermaphrodite or lesbian chick? What's the difference? Does it matter? If we look strictly at the heterosexual lens, which is 98 point something percent of the entire human population. There's like a lot of people have this orientation. You mean that there's only one point something percent of card carrying, I'm only gay, I'm only lesbians? Strictly on like that side. I don't know. Maybe it's high. It's lower. But in terms of like Cisgender that's more what I'm talking about. Like I'm female identifies female. You're male. You identify as male now. We're going to interact. That's a Very high in the percentile. There's not a lot of people who sit in the trans point so so I'm gonna address that large percentile of people who are happy with the gender they were born into and Then we're gonna look heterosexual is probably a lot less, but I was referring to cisgen I made the mistake So now we're gonna look at this dynamic and I'm gonna talk from me personally. They think that's very important in terms of Just to let people know because a lot of my audience doesn't know what cisgender means They've heard it and they're like I'm annoyed in immediately hearing that from what I need to I get annoyed with it Yeah, just I don't want to use that means a male that looks like a male that fucks women a woman That looks like a woman that fucks me something like that Yes, so it's just No, it's this gender is simply you identify with the gender that you were labeled as so if I'm born I look female and I So I identify with the the gender I was, you know labeled as that's cisgender So when when that match when it's a match, it's not about heterosexual miss It's about identifying with the actual so you're born a boy and you think you're a boy and you're okay with being a boy Then that's a cisgender. I think it's totally stupid. You're a guy. I'm a woman and that's it in my realm But because it's out there I kind of like to bring these terms because we're going to hear those terms and how do we make sense of them personally? I never use them when I refer to myself I think it's good to like it's good to have our terms defined and for people to be able to navigate the You know the terminology that people are dealing with today So, yeah Yeah, exactly now you're then you're not feeling like an idiot when there's all this weird stuff going on around you because Yeah, I've been to plenty of professional conferences where the speakers, you know Their identity labels go on for like two minutes. I'm like, I don't care The only time I would care to hear that is if I wanted to fuck you So the fact that you're I'm listening to a professional lecture from a professor I don't care I don't need to know any of that stuff about you. So So anyways, you have to remind me where we were now. We were oh, yes. Why maleness? Oh, yes, why only a man as opposed to just another humanoid? Okay, well as a woman who loves men There's something in men that just doesn't exist in women you have facial hair for one you have cocks for another like there's these Features that are fascinating to me as a female. I don't have them. I want to play with them I want to look at them. I want to interact with them. Then there's Qualities of maleness that I love. I love this protective quality even on fierce. I can completely protect myself I'm trained in martial arts and in other things When there's a man around and I can feel his protective energy, I feel like I can relax And I'm not in that hyper vigilant place Which I need to be as a woman often in the world and I can soften and relax and be more playful because he's got my back I Love that If I'm alone in a group of women, I am that person Because most of the women are in trained to be so Afraid of any kind of aggression that they'll freeze and I've had gangs who have surrounded myself and a girlfriend who wanted to rape us and she froze and I broke the nose of the You know the leader of the pack let's say and off they went and then I dealt with her But a lot of women are not brought up to have healthy aggression So I think that for me I'm fascinated with healthy aggression. I'm fascinated with the beast in the man Not the unclaimed beast because that's very scary I don't like men who say they're nice men and they haven't claimed their beast because To me that is a form if we have to I don't want to use the word toxic James like we can go there But just think it's a stupid word. Maybe immature masculinity or something It's just unclaimed that it's like if you don't claim it, it's It's got you and it can act out at any time and you're a lot bigger and stronger than me so no matter what I do, I mean I was violently raped at some point in my youth and There was nothing I could do He was such a big guy that in the position that I was in it was impossible For me to do anything other than bite his fucking hand, which I did Until so something changed, but I I think I left teeth scars on his head. But anyways, so there's when it's claimed however And you know that you can be violent and horrible and you choose not to Everything in my body relaxes and And then when it comes to sex the beast is available because I don't always want Sweet romantic stuff I do like that but sometimes Certain times of the month in a female cycle you want more beastly awareness. The beast is available Exactly and and When I actually met my partner He had been with many women who don't didn't appreciate the beast let's say so he had never really fully come out and I think it was maybe a third or fourth time together and I grabbed him by The throat and I was like bring him out just bring him out because if you don't I can't trust you and then this his beast arrived And I was like, what's that like as a woman seeing a man's transformation? Because like I love I love when I meet a girl and I and I'm like one day we're gonna have sex and I'm like And you know this right now. She's a lady there and but there's something in her that's gonna come out I'm gonna reveal that like what's it like on the other side when you're like, okay, there's a nice man You're being a nice man And then you and then you know But you've there must be something that you can tell that guy's claimed his beast or that guy hasn't Or maybe a feeling or something But what's it like to see that transformation that Jekyll and Hyde thing when done? Well It's not even Jekyll and Hyde when it's claimed. It's Jekyll and Hyde when it's unclaimed So because I asked for it, he was already consciously in contact with it but it never he never felt it was appropriate to bring it into a Scenario because a lot of the ladies just didn't want that So when it emerged I actually like I said I deeply relaxed and a huge level of trust rose in my being and I surrendered More than I'd ever surrendered to any other man at that point and it that's why we're you know, 13 years later Well, you know, it's still amazing. So so That's because there's this place. I can't tame in him. I can't touch in him. It's his wildness and It's his There's it's not I could never claim it no matter what you know What I try and do because the second you claim it you jail it. I Want to pause the air because this is a really important point I think if we if we make because we wanted to talk about what a toxic masculine and femininity It might be good that I think they're just gonna pop out and one I think one of them did just pop out there Which is you have I know that I don't know a lot about your relationship, but from observing from the outside I know that you guys give each other a lot of autonomy you know, I first met your partner Sol when We met in Thailand for a whole month. It was just like Our mutual friend shade said you guys should meet up What's and and so he did he came and he spent a whole month with us eating coconuts and talking weird shit And that's something that I think many girlfriends or wives or partners Wouldn't want and and vice versa, but and it's not just about the time in the distance. It's that You guys I think understand that for this to remain vital and passionate that You need to be able to do your own things you need to be able to have outside friends and to trust each other and And to encourage like what you've said there is you're encouraging him to be untamed in the sense that And I think that would be a toxic femininity point is the the desire to tame the man or to new to the man Which not all women do but a lot a lot attempt to do in some way or another especially like If he's a bit wild, you know, it's that the that there's an impulse to like, okay I want to lock that guy down in some way and I don't want that wildness to be Present because then he might leave me or he might have an affair or he might suddenly become passionate about something and travel the world Or something like that. Would you say that's a common thing you see with women who are trying to control men? I know men do it to women in different ways as well Sure. Yes, absolutely. And so there's a few things happening. There's that most likely that who they're interacting with Control issues come up for everybody because they're you know We're all in kind of insecure and weird and if we really like somebody we're like, oh my god we wanted to stick around but if I really like them and everyone else must really like them and My partner is very magnetic. So a lot of women is sexy as fuck Yeah, so occasionally I've had to be territorial but not because of him it's just that I didn't feel seen by the ladies so So that's that's something that we're missing now actually culturally with women so another toxic thing from for for women It would be like say you introduce your best friend to your girl and your best friend will be like wow I'd love a woman like that not your girl, but a woman like her a Woman, however introduces to her best friend a woman best friend her man and the woman her best friend could just say I want him Specifically I've seen that as a common thing and and at one one coach Phrased in a way that I thought really hit home was that women have the ability to be close friends with someone They don't trust at all Whereas men will not do that right like a group of men That if I can't trust Liam to be alone with my girlfriend or whatever We can't be friends, right? But a woman can know that she is a backstabbing bitch and she would given half a chance But we'll still hang out together and manage that what's going on there. Is that true? It's not true for me. I Think it's maybe true When women haven't really dealt with their own Shadow their own, you know insecurities or and they're just this is a cool female I should be friends with because she's kind of cool and everybody likes her So I should be friends with her versus really having so the injury that we do to young women In the beginning of their life is we don't teach them that they have the right to boundaries and They have the right to define what's not negotiable in all their relationships. We don't teach them that so they kind of just want to be agreeable they're brought up to be agreeable and like everyone and be nice with everyone and that is Becomes a huge shadow later because if you agree to everything and you're always very nice You're obviously overriding, you know your own needs your own boundaries, etc, etc So I don't know Yes, exactly and if you do, you know personality tests There's a large amount. I don't remember what it is. 70% of women will be test very high in agreeableness and Men test a lot higher and disagreeableness and of course an essentialist would say that that's because women are like that, right? Yeah, and I actually my argument when I hear this there essentially we have to be in some ways, you know You imagine if you're completely disagreeable trying to raise an infant, it would be impossible. You'd kill the thing You can't have that you have to have traits where you can put up with a lot of crap from young cute annoying things In order for those things to grow and survive like so in order not to kill them in the immediate surroundings Smile at all the big monkeys There is a biological reason for For also agreeableness. It's not just social conditioning, but there is a lot of social conditioning So I'm always I don't worry too much about biology because there it is. I Worry more about social conditioning. That's where my work has been in the world that psychosexual piece It's like okay, but what did you learn through your parents your friends your community, etc? Yeah, the nature versus in the nurture debate in in the in my sphere of like Libertarians life coaches dating that that that kind of world has tended to just swallow the like it's all essentialist It's biology. That's it And it's and whereas whereas a post construction list or whatever would say that there is that biology matters zero It's all social conditioning, which is also obviously ridiculous because we are by we are mammals But there's definitely is certainly many times in history when culture has overlaid and totally negated Nurture, you know, it's like you can you can train a population to commit ritual suicide if you condition them well enough That's not good for the genes, but you know that can be done. So yeah, definitely like absolutely we are conditioned and that's something that Recently, I've been talking with my guys online About an element of toxic masculinity, which is the inability to express emotion positively and regularly That there and that we are conditioned of course different ways by different cultures but in general men are not allowed to cry except what at the birth of their child the death of their somebody and a football match like Those are like maybe a really good orgasm too. That'd be great Yeah, but they're not allowed to like you sure if you saw that that but it'd be they wouldn't go bragging. They wouldn't go man I had the best fucking sex last night at the end. They're like, yeah, where did you jizz? No, no, man I was crying at the end. They're like, okay, dude cool story I Would like I would like to hear that story Someone said and then I burst into weeping tears like whoa But most most of the time that's not culturally acceptable so and I deal with men, you know, I have dealt with dealt with men for 12 years in this in this industry where The the issue that comes up every time every almost every"}
