This is James Marshall and I'm John Keegan. That's right. And we're here on the main beach in Barcelona. Beautiful beach, stunning beach, beautiful day, the weather's perfect. Everything's been excellent. We just fed ourselves and now we're going to do a little bit of work. So we're going to answer a question for a guy who's asked just a question. And it goes like this. I'm a very low energy introverted guy. I'm often overwhelmed when I'm talking to high energy or extroverted girls. In these situations, I always get really nervous and I feel awkward and I don't know how to behave. How can I handle these situations? Greetings from Vienna. From Vienna this question comes all the way from. Excellent. Who should go first here? Well, I guess the first thing I want to say is, as an introverted man, as a man who's not naturally social, the first thing you need to do is accept that it's okay to not be super extroverted or to have to keep up with somebody just because they're in a very high energy mood. Great point. It's not something where we're competing on energy level. It's not necessarily that a girl who is very vivacious and out there is even looking for a guy who wants to, she would want to guide the same energy level because then often they can just bump heads or just all about banter and it doesn't really have any movement. It's just kind of pinging random energy off each other. So, I understand first introverted is okay. Low energy is okay. However, going into your shell and being boring and totally inward and reserved because of that is probably not okay. And that is exactly what you're teaching, what I'm teaching all the time, which is how to be comfortable in uncomfortable situations. Meeting someone new is inherently uncomfortable. You have a whole set of beliefs you have to transcend. You have to learn how to be the leader to help her transcend all the shitty thoughts she's having, her being stuck in her head, and she may be really high energy and talking fast because she's nervous. So, you need to learn stillness and not be always looking, which a lot of guys that work with us are, always looking for the opportune moment to meet someone. There isn't one. No, usually not. Usually not. Once in a while, you have to... Stumble over and you go, oh, oh, there it is, yes. We're not relying on that obviously because otherwise we'd be out of business. You could walk around for days, weeks, and by that time you're so in your head, when she does stumble into you, you go home and kick yourself and that's usually when you give us a call. So, the other thing is though, if you are an introverted person, what I feel is that you do need to gather your energy and make it count. So, for me, I'm not... Like this last workshop, I was teaching a bunch of introverted guys and they'd be walking past girls and they'd go, hey there, how are you going? And then the girl would just go, and walk off. And they'd say in their defense that, okay, I'm a low energy introverted kind of guy. And I said, well, I am too, but it doesn't mean that I'm not going to commit to a movement or an action. And so, if you are that kind of guy, it means that out of that stillness, you do need to charge it with something. So, you can be a very effective seducer by asking clean questions, by making clear eye contact, by listening carefully and then processing the information the girl's given you. These are all like kind of the powers of the low energy seducer. Right. But if you don't utilize those, then you're just a quiet dude in the corner, which is not that useful. Some of the best guys I know with women are actually low energy. And that low energy isn't even the right word. They're still and they let the girl do a lot of the talking, but there's two things they do. James already said it. They commit to it and they really take her in. They really listen to her and they use that either in a very sincere way or a very humorous way or a mixture of both. The one thing that's always your job, no matter what, is to take a risk. Now, when you get to our level and you've experienced almost, I imagine, every possible social situation you can and you've transcended every fear you have over and over and over and over again, then you can make a choice and say, hey, you know what? I don't like this kind of girl. I'm just going to exit the situation. But at your level, you're not allowed to do that because right now you're in the grips of fear and fear dictates what you do and what you don't do. Until you're past that, then you don't really know what's what. You haven't earned your type yet. Right. That's right. What would you say about, okay, so this guy is mainly talking about feeling uncomfortable, unsure of himself in a social situation where there's people around him who appear to have more energy or more confidence. I think the thing that I'd like to impart upon this guy here is that I still experience that and I think I always will. It is the nature of, as Keegan was saying, strange situations, strangers meeting, there is an inherent awkwardness or negative tension or this feeling that something's unresolved and I'm not sure what to do. It's okay you're feeling that and it's vitally important that you keep stepping into that feeling because true confidence, most people are only situationally confident. They're confident toasting their bread, they're confident with their friends, they're confident at their work and so overall they can have the impression of being confident because they have navigated certain environments and scenarios and they know how to do it. I think the real confident people are the people who throw themselves out into panic zones, places where they're unfamiliar and learn to go through that process of feeling uncomfortable without necessarily trying to use bravado or arrogance or overcompensating and to just sit in it. So when you said, how do I deal with this situation? Well, the first step is to just throw yourself into a lot of those and to sit in that space and see that you've got this tension inside you that says, if I don't do the right thing right now, something bad is going to happen. That's overall I think like the major thing that stops men from taking action with women is they feel like, okay, there's a situation, I know something has to happen, I don't know what I'm supposed to do, if I don't do the right thing then. But what you come to understand is that if you don't do the right thing, then all that happens is that the interaction dissolves or someone looks at you funny or there's a slight pause and someone else releases the tension with a joke and then people move on. It's like I used to be terrified of going into clothing shops with cool chicks. I hated going in and the girls were like, so can I help you out? And I'm just like, no, cool woman, I don't know what I want, just get the fuck away from here. And I would leave, I just didn't shop. I would leave shops all the time to avoid dealing with a shop assistant. And that was a big revelation for me to just go, all right, I'm just going to sit in there. She's cooler than me. I don't know what I want. She's going to ask me some questions. I'm going to do a weird thing and then I'm just going to go, actually, I just need some space or whatever and she's going to go. Eventually I got used to, okay, now I can go into clothing shops and awkwardly or weirdly just go, I don't need any help and then do with my shit. It's like you guys need to step into these awkward situations over and over again. And over and over and over and over. And allow yourself to feel the awkwardness, to be slightly embarrassed, to have those things happen that you weren't hoping because the skill is not entering into situations feeling cool and being perfect. Unless you could, John Keegan. Yeah, and just like a few things you said is like, someone can become situationally great at meeting girls at the beach, but then he doesn't know how to meet them at a party or he doesn't know how to go to a dinner party and he feels so uncomfortable around 20 people. And I've been in that situation. I got great at meeting girls in every day situation solo, but then someone invites me to a party, like a dinner party and I feel so socially uncomfortable. So you've got to say yes to these situations and you've got to go keep going in and you have to have this mindset. I am a social explorer. And the guys who are great at, who really develop themselves and really transcend their introverted nature and capitalise on it and live the lifestyle they want, they keep saying yes and they keep going in with this mindset as I'm going to explore this. I want to experience something new. I want to just experience this and see what happens and then detach totally from the outcome. There is no outcome. I'm just going to put myself in here. I'm going to give myself some socially specific goals like I'm going to break the ice with everybody. I'm going to engage in some great conversations. Maybe I'm going to flirt with a girl. Maybe I'll ask a girl out. Whatever the risk is that you need to take and then you just keep looking for these new experiences and they can be amazing. We just had one of our friends the other night, travel bum. He had this great new experience that he never had before and he was so high off of it because he's done so many things. He's had every experience. We found one he hadn't had. That's right and he was exhilarated by it because he goes to everything with, I want to experience something I haven't experienced before, something new. And even if that's a new form of slightly embarrassed or not feeling quite in sync with the people you're around, that is also valuable, right? In order for us to become overall confident socially and competent, we had to be not very good or slightly off or miscalibrated in many, many situations over these years to get into the habit of saying, oh yeah, that is just part of it. And that will happen in one conversation. You might go through three spikes of that where suddenly you say the wrong thing or she misunderstands you or there's a timing error or whatever and you feel it. And then a lot of guys, that's what they bail. They leave the moment anything like that happens or they feel that coming and they'd rather leave than actually even experience it. We just say, okay, in a conversation with a new person, there'll be three times where there's a pause and someone doesn't know what to say and then the tension builds and someone breaks it and it carries on. Understanding that these peaks and troughs of tension release or awkwardness into comfort are perfectly natural and they're necessary and the true confidence is being able to be okay in situations where you're feeling cool and feeling not so cool.
