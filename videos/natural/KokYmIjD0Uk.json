This is a good way to get yourself out of the thing that you're always, always hustling, always in business mode. So next thing is, if we're looking at work-life balance, is the discipline of being disciplined about your pleasure or about your personal time. Because when you run a business, it never ends. The tasks never end. You can do stuff forever. And this thing of I'd rather hustle 24-7 than slave 9-5, yeah, maybe for some time. But if you're doing that all the time, then really you're just becoming a workaholic. It's a not glamorous way to say hustler. Someone whose work consumes every waking hour of their life is not someone who's living a well-rounded life. And I guess, I don't know because I've never had this, but if you work for someone else in an office and you clock off at X o'clock, then you get to go home and do your own thing. And so you have your own time and then you come in and you give your time to the man. And so there is a clear work-life balance, whether or not it's perfect, it's there. When you are your own boss, then you have to do that for yourself. I've been guilty of both sides of that, so I've certainly had long periods where I just keep doing stuff, keep doing tasks well and long into the night because I'm kind of addicted to it and because there's no off switch, there's no clear reason why to stop working in the short term. But the clear reason in the longer term is that, as I said before, if you want to become wealthy and successful, you have to work. But if that's going to take 10 years of only working, especially if it's something that's not that fun and you didn't get to live your life along the way, I don't know how much that's worth it. I mean, for some people, they may just feel like, okay, I'm going to sacrifice 10 years of my life or X number of years of my life to eventually get the payoff. But who knows if we're ever going to get there, if you will eventually succeed or if you're even going to live that long because you might die tonight. So what I would say is that the way that I've tended to do things is to look at it this way. I will have periods of intense bursts of work, so I'll be kind of 100% on for some periods. So right now I'm preparing for the relaunch of the Lifestyle Design Academy and we're starting to ramp up the work. And as it comes closer to the launch period, I will be working a huge amount and I won't be doing anything. There'll be no chicks, there'll be no olive trees, there'll be no shenanigans. It'll just be grinding until we get the launch out and then afterwards there'll be way less grinding, I can assure you. There'll be 100% off times. And I think that's one cool way to do things that won't work for every business or every person, but allocating, okay, maybe if I'm someone who works really intensely in bursts, then do that, but then give yourself a certain amount of time, whether it's equal amount of time or 30% of the equivalent time to not touch the business or do the bare minimum that you have to do for maintenance. This is a good way to get yourself out of the thing that you're always hustling, always in business mode. And that sometimes you're like, I'm always in pleasure mode or I'm always in self-development or creative mode for a short period of time or a longer period of time if you can claw that out. The idea that you should be hustling 24-7 is also, I would say, more to do with the early stages of the business. So let's say you're in startup phase, you have a certain amount of runway capital to work with and you have to get something to market within a certain amount of time, otherwise you're going to go broke. And so you have to just nail it and work. Maybe you do need to work every waking hour for some period, maybe a year or two or until you've got the thing sorted. Well, when I think of most of the businessmen that I know who are very successful, like guys who have made millions, I do know some who only work, and it clearly is an addictive thing and it's problematic, and they will admit that, and they sometimes don't know what to do with themselves when they're not working. And so I'd say it's more of a pathology, it's not necessary. Those guys could fire themselves from a whole bunch of jobs. They could certainly, certainly hand off a lot of tasks to other people, but they choose not to because they're workaholics. But the guys that I would say that have a really good work-life balance who are extremely successful, yes, they kicked ass and worked fucking hard when they first started for the startup phase. And once they started to create good income and they were able to allocate and delegate tasks and hold departments to other people in order to claw back time for themselves, then they didn't need to do that. And it's not the best strategy to be getting up and going, okay, I'm going to do 10 hours of grinding today. Which major CEO grinds for 10 hours in that capacity? No, their skill will be primarily as a leader, as a manager, as someone who seeks out new opportunities or makes contacts or does the big sales or works on the conceptualization of the next big launch or product. Those are the important things for the manager to be working on. And the busy work, the hustle work, well, that should be done by employees, guys that are younger and have got way more energy and they're in that phase. And that's their job, is to grind and get the grunt work done. The best thing that I've done as a businessman over time is fire myself from as much of this business as is possible. I had to do a whole lot of it back in the day. Back in the day, back in the day, let's say for a Euro tour, for example, I was the one booking the accommodation, booking the flights, doing the sales, sending all of the orientation packs to the guys, answering all of their like, oh, what if someone tries to steal my kidneys in Hungary questions? I was dealing with all of the customer service stuff and producing, being the one who creates the content and writing the copy, writing the emails and then teaching the bloody Euro tour. Right? So I was doing all of these tasks, which meant that the lead up to a workshop was extremely stressful for me with all of these tasks, which literally anyone who is intelligent and has any sense of organization could have done, which is ridiculous because there should have really be only one thing that I'm doing or two things. One, filming videos going, hey, check me out. I know my shit. And two, proving that by teaching it to people. Everything else was essentially a waste of my time. And it meant that my creative energies and my teaching energies were being dissipated. And I kind of had to do that initially because I had a small team, I didn't have much money. But as I started bringing new people into the crew, the camera team, the back end team with the tech stuff, the managerial team, which was, which is and was basically Alex and the way that he worked that out. When Alex came on as before, long before he was a coach, he came on first as a camera guy, then as a web guy, then as a essentially a manager. And I said to him, your job is to make my life easier. Your job is to make sure I do way less things and that I don't do the things that I'm shit at. Or maybe he was the one that told me that. I can't remember. Because he's probably going, hang on, James, I believe I was the one who told you that. Well, probably you did. And my job is to take credit for Alex as good as he is. But in any case, now, my role in this company essentially is to create this kind of content, teach the thing that I'm the best in the world at, and then work, you know, work with the crew on the on the longer term goals, okay, what, how we pivoting or what's the next big picture things that we're working on. My job is not to write emails and to deal with technical problems and to edit videos and so on. Because I'm not as good as that as the guy behind the camera there. In fact, I am way worse than him. And that's the thing that he's a specialist at and loves. And as a result, I don't have to think about it. I just have to do this and blah, blah, blah, blah. And then later, I'm like, whoa, cool video. Whoa, we have special effects now. Can you make spark come out my eyes right now? Yes, I know there's going to be sparks coming out my eyes in the edit. Oh, it's good. Thanks, Adam. Thanks, future Adam."}
