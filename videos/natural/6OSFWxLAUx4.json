No. Oh. You're too small? Well, next to me you are very small. Cute and adorable, we say that for puppies. Just use more, like, strong, stronger words for being beautiful anyway. You're small and sexy. Yeah, sexy. Hi, a stranger just arrived out of the blue, and that is me. Hi, I'm Jonas. Yes. You're very beautiful. So are you going to McDonald's? No, I'm looking for iBooks. For what? iBooks, for paying my telephone. Ah, okay. That is a new concept for me. I have just arrived in Ukraine like five days ago. How does that work? You tap up your SIM card? Yeah, I need it. Is that because you're watching Netflix all the time, chilling? No. So you use up all the data? I'm kind of like in tourist mode right now. How old are you, excuse me? How old I am? I'm 39. Why do you ask? I'm 19. Are you 19? So what are you doing in your 19-year-old life? What are you doing for fun? Study. Excuse me, I need to go. You need to go? Like really in a hurry? I'm serious. Before you go, do you want to meet up for coffee perhaps? Just be honest. Maybe. It's possible. Do you have Instagram? We need to move fast. I hope it's not super serious. It's not like someone is Is it a broken heart? No. I think there's no internet. Let me see. Well I can do this and later I Okay. What happened? At the end? She said there was something super serious, super urgent and her eyes kind of communicated that okay. Probably something bad news or something happened to her, right? You need to go? Like really in a hurry? I'm serious. I felt like I pushed it a bit by saying okay, let's Instagram close. And she didn't have internet so she got half my username. Well then there is why you didn't ask for her Instagram, like her username as well. Because you can even open notes and save anything if you don't have internet. I felt like I would start to divert into the territory of how should I say disrespecting her time. But you did well, you went there, you approached and you stayed in it. You didn't let yourself just to get refused and you didn't leave just because she was not open that much and you still like tried to talk to her. She was curious about you as well, that's a good sign, yeah, she was asking you stuff. I feel like I was not letting the pressure build enough. I don't know if that's true. You didn't really have time for that because it was like not settled. The whole thing was not settled because she was, I don't know, she had like a, yeah, like not a commented energy to the conversation. Yeah, like maybe she was already in a hurry and you didn't kind of, you couldn't get her out from the space what she was in before you walked into her space. Yeah, that's it. Let's go and find someone. Hi there. Are you in a call? Yes, I have one question. Can you call back? No. Yes, I'm free. Almost free. Nice to meet you. I'm Jonas. Nice to meet you. You look like you're almost like radiating this missing sun. No, I like sun but I don't see. I'm sorry. Did you go outside to sort of say, okay, maybe if I go outside and I look like I need sun, maybe it will arrive? Yes, you look like. It's not going very well, isn't it? We're talking about weather. So where are you going? What's your plan? I'm going with my friend and eat ice cream. Oh, nice. That's basically your plan? Yeah. Just to go for ice cream? Yes, why not? I love that. Is that like a six hours you schedule? Like a meeting, ice cream meeting? Yes. Maybe more. I mean, why not? Why not take three or four? Yes. You're here to visit Kim? Yes, yes. I mean, I'm actually staying for a while. A while? I'm staying here for a month. Oh, a month? It's a little bit... Yeah, we can walk. Why not more? I like your attitude. That's the correct question. Where are you from? I'm from Denmark. Denmark? Do you know what danja is? No. I think that's the Ukrainian way of saying... Someone told me. Every time I say danja to a local, they'll be like, ah, yes. And when I say Denmark, they're like... Ah, yes, danja. Yes, I got you. Danja, yes. I just said it before. I heard it before. Because many of my friends go to danja to work. To work on farm. Or... Yes, on farm. Yes. But you don't have GIT, yeah? If I don't have what? Do you have GIT? Who can show you the key or something? No. So that's actually what I wanted to ask you about. Are you a GIT? I can be. But after my working time, you know. At the gym? Okay, I need to go. But I hope to see you again. I think we should. Do you... Do you what? Do you have some technology perhaps? That can make it so that I can... Hello, tour guide. I would like... To schedule a tour from... Okay. I can give you a number. Or my Instagram or Facebook. Do you have WhatsApp? Yes, I have. I need to check in. What is number? You can get my number. Then you can just say hi. Okay, see you. You too. Yes, good job. I like that. That was pretty long, calm, chilled. But you tell me. From the beginning, what happened? How was your energy? To the way when you just said goodbye. It was pretty relaxed. It could be slightly more relaxed. I was still jumpy inside. And your body as well? I didn't stand still? No. It's okay. Did you like her look? No, I can tell. I can tell. Your energy... Is very much aligned with... But if I can tell, she can tell too. And that's my problem. That I can feel that you are not attracted. And I know it's hard to force it on yourself. To act like you are attracted. But you still can practice the projection of any kind of intent. She was cute. She was open. Nice to you. This is what I wanted you to tell me. That she was on fucking phone. Are you in a call? She was phoning in the beginning. You forgot about that? You made her put down the phone. That's amazing. She was like, I'm not gonna put down the phone. Can you call back? And you were like, no. And then there was a quiet challenge. She felt a little bit bad. She said no. She was like giggling. I have a question for you. Can you call back? She said no. And after that, she hung up anyway. There is a beautiful girl. Let's go for her. I think you're gonna be more attracted to her face. Can I stop you for a moment? Can I stop you for a moment? Okay. Are you in a hurry to get somewhere? No. No English. You do speak English right now. A little. My name is Jonas. Nice to meet you. What is your name? Nice to meet you. What are you up to today? I go with my friends together to speak. Oh, okay. Hanging out and chilling. Relaxing. I don't understand. Sorry. You live here in Kyiv? No. Well, yes, right now. But only for a while. I arrived a week ago. One week. A bit, yes. Yes. What is your country? Denmark. You know Denmark? Yes, of course. Denmark. How many times have you been here? I've been here for a month. Yes. Pretty crazy, right? Do you like Kyiv? I love it. It's crazy. I'm attending some classes here. It's really hard work. It's hard work, but I really enjoy it. Do you understand? So-so. Okay. I'll let you go. I think you'll get wet if you don't hurry. Have a great day. Thank you. Bye-bye. How was that? How do you feel? That was bad. I feel bad. Not super bad, but kind of. Why do you feel bad? Describe the emotion. The emotion, you say? Yes. Feeling bad is an emotion, no? It's a feeling. I say I feel bad because in this case I hadn't seen her. You just said, hey, go and talk to her. That's cool. I felt like the combination of me thinking, okay, I wouldn't have loved her if it was on my own, and then the language barrier made me eject. I still don't understand the point. Where is the bad feeling coming from when I tell you to go somewhere? No, it's not that. I mean that I picked the girl for you. It doesn't matter because it could be any girl. And she was a pretty girl. So that was the language barrier, and I sort of felt, okay, this is difficult, and I'm not motivated to push through that way. But you stand in it, you stayed, and it's good, and you tried, even though you could have given up way sooner because she wasn't speaking English, but she was cute, she was open to you, so let's respect that, and you did, so it's great. So what's your problem? I still don't see a problem. If I tell you there's a problem, there is a problem. You know that already. You know that very well. So anyway, you did good, there is no problem. You tried, you went there, you approached her, you tried to practice what you just learned, so it's great. Yep. Don't feel bad. Coming up from early May, myself and the Natural Lifestyles team are hitting the road again and teaching a bunch of brave men all around the world the art and science of natural style seduction. Now, guys have been writing to us going, uh, Ukraine? Yeah, yeah, don't worry. We're not running any workshops in Ukraine for the foreseeable future. We did that last year, which was lots of fun, but for obvious reasons, we won't be this year. So all of our workshops will be held in Budapest, Hungary, as well as other European capitals. So if you'd like to join myself, the TNL team, to no longer be just a spectator of this game, but to be a player in it, then click the link below, get on a call with one of our guys, and I hope to see you in May. Now back to the video. Today we're going to primarily, or probably only be working on touch. Virag will be my touch assistant. Alright, so firstly, tell me what are some bad ways to touch a female. Anything that's very tentative, right, feels creepy and unconfident, especially if I look at it. Too rough, right, so grabbing, especially when I'm, if I grab with claws, I can actually I wouldn't call it a grab, I'd call it a grasp. I can apply quite a lot of pressure to a woman, but it has to be done in a calibrated way that doesn't feel like I'm shoving her around. Never touch a girl with the back of your hand, never. What about if I'm leading her? We covered this the other day. Yeah, don't pull, right, so anything where I start using my tricep, basically, in my shoulders to pull at her, doesn't fit, doesn't feel nice. What do we do instead? Well, we just move, yeah, and let this rubber bandstring lead her where she must go. Aspects of good touch is that we need to know if we want to manoeuvre the woman, that we need to know where to manoeuvre her from. So if I want to move her in either a direction or to go with me or push her up against a wall or something, where am I leading her from? Pivot points, hips, shoulders. The hand, I'm not leading from the hand, I'm leading from the spine actually. Contouring, so I want you to think about your touch as like your chocolate melting onto her. Okay, so when I touch her wherever it is, my hand fits the shape of her body. So if I'm placing my hand on her shoulder, then I let it melt in, I completely relax my hand. You can see, look at my fingers just following the contours there, so that then if I bring that down to take it by the hand, she gets this nice caress, which is kind of an incidental touch. It's the the touch that was implied that creates the emotional impact, because if I do a touch like this on the lower back, this is normal, I can do that to anybody, but it's this little touch here, this social touch, incidental central touch, which creates a little zing. Okay, so what we're going to do is you're going to take your partner and you're going to start really simply, firstly by taking the hands and relaxing with them, spending some time being in the same space, making sure that you're completely relaxed, she's relaxed, and then we're going to move into maneuvering her from my hips, so that then when I go to turn her, the talk is created by me. Alright, so you're going to take that for a while, let your hands melt, be here in this space with her, and then you can say it as well, turn, and then we got this kind of incidental touch happening as well. Alright, turn, incidental touch there. Then I move into the hips, so I'm holding her pelvis, right, so basically right in there where the bone fits into my palm here. So from there, we can turn her like that. You're going to play with that for a while too, so that you've got command of her to be able to move her around the physical space. And then, alright, we're going to attach everything to her spine, so once you've gotten this, you're able to maneuver her, feels natural for the girl, feels nice for you. Then we can start tying that together with moving around from the arms and moving her through the space. Okay, so make sure that if I'm doing one hand, two hands, whatever it is, that we have this boat string thing. She then trails through the water. If I'm leading her from the lower back, what I don't do is what I just did, which is threading this. I walk down the street like this is not comfortable for anybody. It looks like she's being arrested. Yeah, so hand goes behind. So the palm is not going to be dead in the center of the body, it's going to be to the side depending on how, you know, how big her hips are. So I'm hooked in around the pelvis here. And then, the most advanced move of all, the hug. Okay, so a good hug, invite the woman into your space and then wrap your arms around like you're a snake. I'm compressing her or winding her into me as opposed to pressing her into me. And so it winds in and I don't lunge in for it, like I don't take the hug. As a man you offer the hug. She comes in, slow it down, be there with her. So I can have my hands high, be low. She can be high, I can be low. So then, once you've practiced those little components, then you can lead your girl around and take her, you know, with the leading, you know, into a hug, unwrapping, leading her about. So in this one I'm the center point of the pivot and I'm like trawling her around, right, as opposed to I make her the center point of the pivot by just placing, I'm not pushing or anything, I'm just using the momentum of her step. So you walk forward, just walk, walk, walk, walk. So that momentum turns her on her spot. It feels seamless and the man knows how to command the physical body. Like these, obviously this is very simple and not sexy touches, but they're communicating a lot to the woman. One of those versus one of those speaks volumes. So if I want to push a lady up against a wall, which I do in general, here's how we do it. So here's how we don't do it. Oh shit. So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna tango step her into the wall. Look at my feet. So if I walk straight ahead I'm just gonna trample on her feet. Tango step I'm like this. Diagonals. It works from this way as well. If I'm like pushing her through, like taking her through a bedroom door or something like that, right. So you're like, alright, this way. Let's do it. We'll beep into her eyes, let's breathe together a little bit. Warmer. Yeah. And slower. Just slow down, watch her body, feel her body. You have a beautiful woman in your arms. Do it again. Looks more natural to me and calmer. Yes! Thank you! So behind you there is a blonde girl in white pants, but now she didn't recognize you yet so I'm hiding as well. But that's our next target, baby. Oh yeah, excuse me. Stop for one second. No? Okay, I'll walk with you for two minutes and then you can kick me on my way. Okay. Where are you headed off to? You look like you're deep in thought. Sorry, I'm, you know, I will be married in three months. You'll be married in three months? Yes. Okay. So, I'm happy to be with myself now. I understand. So you're thinking for yourself right now. Yeah. Blasting off of freedom. Ah, okay. So you're very busy planning for everything and you're thinking about everything. Are you excited for it? Yeah. That's great. Yeah, I can see it. Well, I'm not going to try to pick you up or anything, but now at this point I kind of just want to like chat with you because it sounds like you've got this pretty positive vibe. Maybe it's because I'm on vacation now. Okay. It's too cold for May. Yeah. So, what about you? I am visiting here from, well, I'm originally from Chicago, but from Mexico City. And I 100% agree about it being too cold. I was expecting to come to Kiev, everybody's saying, come to the summer, it's going to be amazing and warm and there's going to be sun every day. Expectations and reality. Yeah, it's almost like those memes, you know, where it's like expectation, reality. But honestly, I'm still finding it fun. I'm still enjoying walking down the street and chatting with folks and trying to get outside of the comfort zone as well. So that's fun. Where are you visiting from? So, right now I'm just going to shopping. You said you're on vacation? Yes. So are you from, like, Lviv or Odessa? No, no, I'm just on vacation right there and I live there, so... So this is your time off. Yes. Understood. Well, it sounds like you're having a great day and I'm glad for that, so I'm going to let you go. I've got to get back to my friends, but what's your name? I'm Kevin. I hope you have a great rest of the day and I hope you have a nice wedding. See you. That was an interaction I enjoyed. You enjoyed it? Yes. I felt it that you enjoyed it. She was pleasant, too. It wasn't like... Let's talk about the beginning. Like, let's go from the beginning. Okay. How was she? What did you feel? What could you tell about her energy? Why? How did she feel in the beginning? She was a little uncertain, but kind of maybe interested. She was trying to figure out what was going on in the situation. First, she was fucking refusing you, Kevin. Yeah. Don't forget about that, because you finished that way. You did a great job, but in the beginning, from that point, she was refusing you. Stop for one second. Yep, yep. She did not want to, so just remembering what we talked about earlier, I'm like, okay, cool, I'm going to walk with you, rather than asking her to walk. But you said that you're going to kick me out on the way or something. We don't say that. No, I said you can kick me back in two minutes. Yeah, yeah. She can't kick you back. And she didn't. Oh, yeah. But don't even give her the idea. Don't plant it in her mind. It was good anyway. So? Yeah, and of course, she drew the firm boundary very quickly. I'm going to get married in three months, and I'm like, okay, cool. I will be married in three months. You'll be married in three months? Yes. Great acknowledging. You didn't react to it. It's good that you didn't say, oh, must be a lucky person or anything like that. Yeah, which is my reflex. But James is talking about this in the circle this morning. He's very sensitive about that, so don't ever say such a thing. Yeah, I know. He mentioned this this morning. She's lucky because she's talking to you. Yeah, yeah. Okay? Yeah. So, yeah, and it was just a positive. At that point, I was like, okay, cool, I'm going to spread some positivity. I'm going to have this vibe. I'm not going to eject immediately after she tells me that because I just didn't want to, honestly. I just wanted to chat with her for a little bit and spread some positive love. Yeah, and you did. You spread love. Thank you so much. You shared about yourself. That was amazing. You had a good energy the whole time. And actually, your way of doing the whole thing, like you decided to ignore those points where she refused you or she wasn't open. You just went through the whole thing with your positive personality and being playful at the same time. At the end, she was giggling and her body language was so open. She wasn't doing that, that, that, you know, because she opened up with your ways. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, it was nice. Good job. It was nice. Cheers. Good job. Good job. Stop for one second. I have a telephone call. Can you call back? Can you call back? I saw you walking this way and I thought you looked absolutely stunning today. So I just had to come and say hi to you. Thank you. Can you stop for a second? What do you need? Do you need something? I wanted to come and get to know you, especially with eyes like those. Okay, but it's not for me. How about I walk with you? Because it looks like you're in a hurry. I have a telephone call. Is it your mom? No, it's my friend. Ah, okay. He has a different period. Ah, oh, is this your boyfriend? No, it's my good friend. Ah, that's good because you didn't break my heart immediately. Okay. I'll see you. Have a good day. Tell me. I think I could have extended it longer, actually. I think... Ah, tell me the good things, okay? Let's just talk about the good things. Good things got her to stop. I got her to hang up the phone call too, which is, I think, actually the first time I've ever done that. That's fucking amazing, right? Yeah, she was hella pretty. Hella, hella, hella pretty. What about her energy? It was good. What can you tell about her personality, even of this? She's confident. She's definitely a confident person. And? She kind of had this little mischievous smile. So, one thing that was interesting is I perceived that she hung up the phone and she was kind of like, what's going on? So, I have to punch it hard. You did punch it hard. It was fucking good. Yeah, I have to be like, you look absolutely stunning. I saw you walking this way and I thought you looked absolutely stunning today. So, I just had to come and say hi to you. Because if I come in with like, oh, you look kind of nice, she's going to be like, why the fuck did I hang up the phone for this? But we talked about it. She's going to get like, a hundred like, you look nice today. Yes. Yeah? Yes. I think I could have actually been more energetic in that, in the interaction. Where I was like, oh, you look stunning. Did I have more charisma in my voice? No, it was perfect. Like, seriously, you don't have to act too much. This is what I'm talking about. Like, being the person who you are at the same time. You were smiling. I was watching you and your presence was really powerful but playful at the same time. So, actually now you found the perfect balance in what we wanted to reach. What we just talked about. You're like smiling but at the same time like, you look absolutely stunning today. That's great. Let's go. Stop for a second. Wow. You looked very serious walking down the street and I said, I have to go, make her smile, add some positive energy to you. And now you've got this big smile on. What are you headed off to? Where are you headed off to? Okay. I will talk very low, very slow. You will help and then, my Russian, very bad. So... Am I right? Am I right? But you can speak in Russian? A little. I don't understand Russian. English, English much, much better. Okay. You, you look like a model. Oh. Do you do fashion? Do you, do you do model fashion? Yes. Oh. I'm too small. You're too small? Yes. Well, next to me you are very small. What do you do? I go to work. To work. To work. Are you excited about it? What? Are you excited for it?"}
