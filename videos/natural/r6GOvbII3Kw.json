In this upcoming video we're gonna take another look inside one of our four day intensive seduction boot camps. Now in this clip I am coaching Eric and we're a little bit more into the workshop so he's now quite comfortable approaching girls, opening, asking a few questions but now the next kind of challenge comes for him which is staying in the interaction a bit longer. He's running out of things to say, he doesn't really know how to create an emotional impact, he doesn't really know how to apply pressure and get investment out of her so what he does instead is he opens and then he closes really fast and that's quite common. People are moving through different stages at the beginning, they are really afraid of approaching or they just you know have certain anxiety or mindsets around that which we resolve really fast on a workshop so within a day you become quite comfortable doing that and then we just work on the next thing, on the next thing, on the next thing. So I give him advice how to make a more powerful and longer and more meaningful interaction basically so the chance that the girl wants to see him after is higher, right? That's the whole purpose of that. So one last thing, if you enjoy our content we put a lot of work in our video so please press the like button, make it blue, it really helps the channel to spread our message wider and thanks for that and now let's get into the video. Do you have anything planned for today or? Yeah, just trying to shop. Shall we shop? I'm ready to go here. Let's go then. Every time I have a rejection I remind myself of what I actually just did. I didn't go up to a girl and got rejected. I saw a girl, I made the decision, I want to communicate, I made the decision, okay this might be awkward, this might be strange, this is a bit uncomfortable but I'm still gonna do it, you know, I'm still gonna push myself out of the comfort zone and make something happen. So even before I even say one word, before she even sees me, I already made a couple of amazing actions for myself especially, you know, and you did that every time you walked up to a girl and then the other mindset I have that might be helpful for you, let's say you're in a place like this, public, you know, there's people sitting, there's people watching and maybe you approach this girl there and she's like nah, you know, maybe even in a very like shutting down way, she's like no way, I don't want to talk to you and maybe people look at you and you're like f**k, I feel terrible, this sucks or I feel like a loser or I don't like this, just the negative pressure of this. Okay, but what I remind myself is in that moment where you approached her, firstly you did all those things I mentioned before, you pushed your comfort zone, you were the warrior in your own movie, you know, the hero and you were the one person who grew the most in those 20 seconds. All the others were just spectators, the girl was just like whatever, she's passive, you were the active one who actually became a better version of yourself in this thing. So that's literally the mindset I have every time where a rejection happens, like okay, didn't get her number but look at all the other cool things that just happened. Hi. Hi. What's your name? Claudia. I'm Erik. I saw you walking over there and thought you were really pretty so I just had to come over and say hi and what are you doing today? I'm working here. Really? Yes. Where? In that office. And what are you doing here? I'm actually on a communication course, so like doing some seminars and yoga and so on. You're working till 10? Yes. Okay, okay. Well, I'm soon going to head back to the communication course so maybe after you're finished work you can grab a couple of drinks? I don't know if you want this plan but I have boyfriends. Okay, really? Yes, sorry. No, it's fine, it's fine. Maybe we can exchange contact on Facebook and we can... Yes, but I don't know. It's nice talking to you. Yes. Bye-bye. She was very open. She asked you what you're doing here and you said communication, seminar, yoga, yeah, so like a bunch of buzzwords but you didn't share at all what that is exactly, okay, but mainly why you would even do such a thing, you know, like because as of now it's, yeah, just buzzwords for her. You're just doing a thing. It's a seminar, it's a conference, it's a course, it's a workshop that doesn't tell her anything that's going on the whole time and even if you say it's a very specific communication seminar focusing on this and that, it's still, she cannot relate to it but when you say, oh, I realized I'm quite introverted and I kind of didn't like that side about myself too much or realized that would kind of block me in the future to making connections or meeting people, so I realized I want to change that and I found this really cool course here. It's about communication and social dynamics because then she again gets to know you. She doesn't care about the course or what's going on there, you know what I mean? There was a lot of like shallow conversation with like, I'm here for this, don't expect why, what do you do, all your work here, where am I from, Norway, you didn't open up any topic deeper than that. You didn't really get to know her, you know what I mean? Did you, like do you remember anything that you found out about her? No, no, just shallow things. Yeah, and for you the same. Yeah, so I can definitely improve that. Yeah, like she didn't really know, doesn't really know anything about you, I feel like. So, and then kind of the energy went down and then you went for the close. So, and I think I heard that you're doing two days ago as well, where you kind of like, you have a very powerful friendly approach, girls are very open to you, you get through a few questions, but then you're like, I'm out of things to say, let's close. So, next time that happens, stay in longer, find out something about her, don't go straight to the close, stay in longer than you're comfortable with, okay? Excuse me, hi, you look wonderful. What's your name? What you can do in that situation, because it might happen a lot, that girls are like, oh thank you, okay, bye, you know, like thanks but no. You can be like, oh before you go, that's the one way to like get them back. So, by you saying, oh before you go, it shows I know you want to go, but just one thing before that. And then you're just like, so where are you from? Are you from here? And then you just get into a conversation a little bit and then they, it's kind of this psychological trick of, okay, one question, I will answer and then you try to get in a conversation. But like following builds really strange. Yeah, excuse me, hi, how are you doing? I'm Irek. I don't speak English. You speak a little bit English though, a little bit, okay. So, my name Irek. My name is Angelica. Okay, Angelica, you live here in Barcelona? Yeah. How long, how long here in Barcelona? We're heading to the beach. Now you really tried, which I like, you know, like now you actually tried to get to Nora. That was the point of this interaction. Exactly, she just spoke really little English. Okay, you know, she was into you, otherwise she would have, like she was smiling, she just didn't really know what to do, like she was charmed clearly. I would still close in the end, you know, even if you have the feeling this is going nowhere or whatever, still make that rep of learning how to close people and with her just really simple like, okay, no Spanish number, Google Translate, text, you know, WhatsApp or Instagram and then just to close it off like that. Excuse me. Hi. I saw you from over there and I thought, wow, what a good looking girl. What's your name? Denise. I'm Erik. Nice to meet you. So, what do you do in Barcelona? I'm living, studying. Really? Yeah. What do you do? I'm on vacation. Yeah, that's a good city. Meeting pretty girls like you. Why not? Do you have anything planned for today or? Yeah, just trying to shop. Shall we shop? I'm gonna go here. Let's go then. You approached her, you said, oh, what a beautiful girl. You had to come say hi. She was really charmed. Okay. A little bit of conversation. She was like, what are you doing here? And then one thing you said was meeting pretty girls like you. What do you do? I'm on vacation. Yeah, that's a good city. Meeting pretty girls like you. Yeah. Why do you say that? Like, I want to vary from like, I'm in a communication course and I didn't know if I said that. No, no, no. I said that I was on vacation. So, I kind of want to vary, try different things, see what works. And I was kind of hesitant saying that seeing pretty girls because then she just thinks, oh, okay, you just do that to everybody. But for some reason, it worked. I have a problem with it because it says you're not special. You are the 10th girl I'm talking to today and I'm doing this all the time. The opener should give her the feeling of you're special. I was walking along. I saw you. And then I was just, I couldn't help myself but introduce myself. I had to like, go out of my routine, out of my plan and meet you. Like, you're special. Let's make something happen. Well, you have to ask some questions. Yeah. Because then what happened, energy went down and I felt like, correct me if I'm wrong, you didn't really know what to say and you're like, oh, you're shopping. Okay, let's go then. Yeah. When you stop a girl and she stops, never then suggest, oh, let's walk. Because this is way more powerful than us walking into each other. The reason was, I don't know what to say anymore. So, let's go shopping and let's kind of continue what we're about to do anyway. I don't really know where to take this to now. Just be okay and then just ask questions. I want you to ask questions and get emotional and get to know her. Like, get her to be interested. I'm not feeling that you're actually interested in a girl right now. No. My name is Erik. I come from Norway. Why I'm here is that I feel I lack in communicating with girls and expressing my desires and in a constructive way. About the things that I was concerned about before doing this, what I was afraid of was really trying but being rejected and being afraid of that feeling. Okay, I'm not good enough, but that is not the case anymore. Now I wake up without any tension in my body at all. Not being afraid to approach in any circumstances. And if I were to be rejected, so what? From the first day until now, you know that tension you sometimes have when you think about things, you get in your stomach. And you know that it's something missing in your life. It's something that you have to learn but you have postponed it for such a long time. And this is a possible thing to loosen it up. And now that tension is gone. And you can't quite set a price on that. Hey again, thanks for watching. I hope you could take something out of this video.
