I'm James Marshall from The Natural Lifestyles reporting live from Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, the United States of America, Northern Hemisphere. We've just been speaking at the POA Summit 2010, and how was it? Wonderful. Interesting. Interesting? What do you think? It was fun. It was different. They're very diplomatic. It was quite a circus. We met some very interesting people, saw some great speakers, heard some dubious claims, and then wowed the crowds. Best natural at the POA Summit in Australia. I just couldn't believe it when I first met this guy. I thought, he's got to come to the summit, and I was able to talk him into coming all the way from Australia. James Marshall, best natural in the world. Good morning, gentlemen. How are we all? Amazing. Amazing, awesome. That's very good. Now, there's a few empty seats in the audience. I'm hoping that means that there's a lot of full beds throughout this city, so when they turn up after lunch looking bleary-eyed, please find out, because that's the only excuse I'm going to accept for tardiness. Now, most of you have probably never heard of me before. We've been doing this for a long time, about five years in Australia and throughout Europe, and this is our first time to the States. Briefly, I want to tell you about the genesis of me as a seduction coach, as a dating master, or whatever it is that I'm supposed to be. It was the summer of 95, and I was lucky enough to win a scholarship to come and study in America. Now, I was a frustrated virgin at the time. I was 15 years old, and I'd heard that all you needed to get laid in America was an Australian accent, which I had, so I thought I was in with a chance. 90210, I believe it was, was huge at the time. I was thinking keg parties, cheerleaders, and so I arrived. I didn't have a choice where I went, and so I was put in Boise, Idaho. Yeah. Represent. Are there any Mormon pick-up artists in the room today? No? I didn't think so. That is a reality TV show I would watch. I haven't watched TV in 10 years, but I would happily watch that. So, it took me quite a long time, because I don't know if you guys know about Mormon dating. You're not allowed to go on a date just with a girl. In fact, you're not allowed to go on a date with two couples. You have to go with three, so that there's these different angles of chaperones making sure that nothing ever happens. I did actually manage to get laid about eight months into my trip in a cheap hotel in Boise. So, America has a dear place in my heart, and I find it fitting that 15 years later, I'm here again to help other guys lose their cherries or to progress to the next level. Now, I'm advertised as a natural. I certainly wasn't born natural. I've met two guys who basically came out of the womb and picked up the nurses, but most guys have to learn it through a process. I'm a self-taught natural, because I had no access to any kind of mentors. Like many guys in this community, I had an absent father. I was brought up by a single mother, and I had no older brothers, no role models. So, I had to go out and figure it out for myself. The seduction community, if it did exist, I had no knowledge of it. Now, I did this through a very strange and convoluted route. It involved traveling to about 35 countries, hanging out with a lot of really bizarre and wacky people from monks in China, through to tantric instructors in India, through to a porn set in Australia. My teachers were alive, and my teachers were women. Powerful, strong women. Now, there's a lot of debate about whether a woman can teach a man how to pick up. And I think there's a lot of truth that men need men to help them through their rites of passage, through their initiations into manhood. But that's done in reflection and reference to women. And there's a lot of fallacies in this community, one of them being that women don't know what they want, ever. They're just these robotic automatons that if you press certain buttons here and there, they'll respond, which is not really true. Because you guys don't work like that. We're not robots. We're organic. We're flexible. We have incredible potential. So, I got good by listening a lot to women. I don't speak much, actually, except when I'm on stage. I guess what we do is we specialize in low-energy, high-impact game. Because the truth is that seduction happens in low energy. It doesn't happen when you are dancing around, spinning girls, throwing cards in the air. It happens when things turn down and heat up. So, this year's theme is about the difference that makes the difference, right? The missing piece of the puzzle. In this community, we've been watching it from a distance for the last five years, at least. And we've seen it go through quite an evolution. And it started from a place that was built on a very, very flawed presupposition, which is that women are not attracted to you. That's the whole premise of indirect game, right? That they don't really want to talk to you. They're not interested in having sex with you or getting to know you. And so, all these convoluted techniques were built to get around this. That presupposition has permeated through the entire community. And it's great to see that that is changing. There's new waves of seducers coming through every year. Guys are seeing this on a much broader stage, bigger level, looking at this for what it could actually be, which is a revolutionary men's movement. It can also be a place for bitter, twisted men to learn manipulative tricks to try and sneak into a woman's bed. It can be both. I know which side of the fence I'm on and I'm staying on. And it is my hope that this entire community will grow up and that we can be true, authentic, real, sexy motherfucking Anyone interested in that? Yes, sir. Okay, so what is the difference that makes the difference? First, let's define our terms. Direct, indirect. They're at war constantly. It's UFC in the pick-up world. There's a misconception here. The difference between direct and indirect has very little to do with what comes out of your mouth. You can go and say something perfectly indirect and it be fucking direct. You can go in there with all sorts of direct lines. What's a classic direct line? You know, textbook direct. Somebody. That's not, that's, we started with the shoes. Let's cut that out. Okay, can you stand up for a second, please? And she is, right? Yes. All right. So, go on direct. Go on direct. You're adorable. What's your name? Yeah. That's not direct. Direct is about, well, the difference between indirect and direct is about intention, about intent. What is being projected? This is the engine, this is the juice behind everything else. Because once you understand intent, you can use whatever the fuck you want. If you want to use complicated lines that you have to memorize, so be it. It will work. If you want to go up and say, hello, how are you? You look nice, which is what I prefer to do. Because in my opinion, if you can say something in ten words, say it in three. If you can say it in three words, say it with your eyes. I'm a very, very lazy seducer. In case you don't, in case you haven't noticed, I don't move much. And thankfully, women tend to like to talk more than I do. And I'm quite happy to let them do that. So I'll hold space for them. I will be that rock. I will stand still. And when I move, I always move with purpose. It's been interesting talking to guys here on the weekend. There's a lot of crazy dance moves going on. I'll be talking to a guy and he'll be talking like this and looking around. And I'm trying to stand in front of him so he can look me in the eye. And he'll just be doing the fandango here. And I'm like, please, you're making me dizzy. All this high energy stuff. If you are a naturally high energy person, one of our trainers, Tim, is very, very high energy. That's him. I cannot slow him down. I can't stop him from going to approach girls constantly. Myself and Zana, my other trainer, are very chill cats. We just like to hang back, go in there, take the right shots, ask some questions, make some statements, and then let our eyes and our bodies do the rest. What is your intention when you see a beautiful girl? This is a rhetorical question, so you don't need to shout at me. Because often the intention that a lot of guys have got inside them is feeling apologetic about the fact that they are men and that they would like to have sex with women. Now, I like to do a lot of different things with women. I like to hang out with them. I like to learn from them. I like to dance with them. I like to travel with them. But I also like to have sex with them. And I make no apology for that. I have only two rules in seduction. The rest of it is flexible. The rest of it is frameworks. What I teach is not a linear model because seduction can never be linear because every single woman is different and every one of you is different. And the combination of the two of you is going to be different every single time. So if you're working with a linear model, it stops the moment you hit something you weren't prepared for. You guys have seen that. One of our girls was approached by somebody here yesterday. He started with a routine about a horse. Were you a horse girl when you were young? And she said, no. He's like, yeah, you probably were. She's like, no, I didn't really like horses. He's like, fuck. And he went ahead with his routine despite the fact that she had no interest in horses and it just wasn't working. This rigid adherence to a linear model is what will fuck guys up every time except for that one time out of a hundred when she does exactly what she was supposed to do the whole time. And you see this in a lot of the material. It says, okay, you say this, this, this, and the girl says blah, blah, blah, blah. And then you transition to this, says blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, as if that blah, blah made no difference. As if that was irrelevant. That is ridiculous. So I'll tell you my two rules of seduction. The first one is the right to freedom rule, which states make no apology, take full responsibility. This is the foundation for our inner game work. Make no apology for the fact that you are who you are and that you are moving to a place that you want to go to. There are so many forces at work in this world, in this community, and outside that want to put you in boxes, that want you to be good consumers and workers, that want you to fit within a particular paradigm. And that helps a society at large function, but it doesn't always help the individuals. This is the land of the free, right? Is it? Okay. Well, in that case, you guys have to be internally free. So whatever your intention is, and that depends on whatever point you are in your evolution, take ownership of it and make no fucking apology for it. So in your experience, you guys are from Los Angeles, and so you've met a lot of pickup artists, I presume. Guys have come and asked you strange questions about whether you like horses or lesbian dogs. So you've hung out with us over this weekend, and you've got to see what our style is. How would you say it compares, and did you like it? I mean, you guys have definitely a more natural approach to everything. I think that your style is much more about being yourself and being real, and I think that girls see that. Girls see how genuine you are, and they love it. Yeah, girls see how genuine you are and how down-to-earth you are. It definitely works on girls. It's things that all guys should already know, and it feels like you're teaching common sense, but obviously it's not, and it really works. I mean, me and Zana have already been married, so... Yeah. He wouldn't be in one day. One day marriage. Marriage closed. It's pretty good. So if guys out there are kind of sick of having to spit out routines, use other people's lines, and just do something that's not being them or being real, then there is an alternative, and that is the natural lifestyle's way. So if you want to learn how to be yourself, but project that in an incredibly sexy, powerful, charismatic, and masculine way, then wear them in to come and see."}
