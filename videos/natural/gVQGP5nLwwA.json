How do you meet women these days? I talk to guys all the time for our elite workshops So I get to know guys on a deeper level basically every day You know, that's hundreds of guys a year that talk to me about their dating life and what they want to change in it I often hear the frustration and I hear how guys don't have a lot of income streams Socially and they're often stuck to one or maybe even zero, you know, and the one they have they're very frustrated about Maybe they are only relying on tinder and it's not getting them the results They want maybe they DM people online without knowing them Maybe they hope that one day their dream girl walks into their university class and sits down next to them, you know, so they only Relying on their immediate social circle or the only way for them to meet women is going out Getting smashed in bars and hoping to wake up next to someone the next morning As I said talk to hundreds of guys on discovery calls I have dozens of clients every year that I help through the process and basically help revamp their dating life Get way more women into their life and out of that hopefully find somebody they really want to spend time with and you might be surprised like through my Incredible life that I currently have I'm very lucky that I meet Very wealthy people and I'm talking about nine figures ten ten. What is a billionaire ten figures? Nine and ten figure kind of guys who made the same mistake. They thought okay Once I have a hundred million once I have 200 million once I have 500 million once I have a billion surely women should be zero problem for me and You might be surprised of course Can they use their wealth to attract women easier into their life? Absolutely, but once you're at that level where everything is like five stars, you know You drive the best car you live in the best house. You eat the best food. You can fly private jet You obviously want to have five-star girls as well or basically top of the top and do Those women just fall into the lab just because of their bank account No, absolutely not because imagine you work all your life again with that fallacy in your mind that you know Build it and they will come and then they don't come it can be very frustrating so you have to be as strategic about your dating life as you would be about your business life about your Income streams and so on now in this miniseries I want to explore the different options to meet women and we're gonna start off in the first part of the series with Online so online is obviously a thing and online is not only a thing it is D thing It seems these days most people seem to be meeting online, which is kind of crazy still Considering that it's still relatively new and has been quite strange like 20 years ago to meet somebody online and that totally shifted I got a study here Or just a short text. It says in 2017 they found out that 39% of heterosexual couples Reported meeting their partner online compared to only 22% in 2009 So within eight years it doubled and that was 2017 now in 2022. That's kind of crazy now when we talk about online Let's talk about two different things dating apps and Social media slash Instagram in general, you know, I noticed a lot of different dating apps for different people and for all sorts of folks Let's talk about tinder since it's the market leader now tinder for sure helped a lot of people find a partner in the past But let's be honest I think it also led to a lot of frustration at least when I talked to the guys that I work with They are kind of relying on tinder. They're Frustrated then I helped them meet people in the real world and it changes their whole reality because suddenly they're not relying on a Simple like swipey app and on their phone, which kind of makes you depressed just like using it But the whole world opens up to them, but let's talk about tinder the main thing You gotta understand that tinder is a company and it exists to make money. The success of tinder is Calculated in dollars nothing else not the number of users even Not the number of matches not the level of good emotions that it creates between Couples not the number of beautiful powerful Healthy relationships it creates none of this really matters to tinder what's important in the end is how many dollars does it make and Everything you experience on tinder Leads back to that and i've done a lot of experiments actually in the last two or three months I worked with a researcher together who kind of took over my tinder to explore different profiles Experiment with one profile that spends money and one that doesn't and the different results it gets And it's quite shocking to say the least i'm actually preparing a longer kind of webinar on that topic So more to that later subscribe and like but the reality is they want to make dollars which is Fine if you have and you spend some But the problem is how they play With your happiness with your dopamine with your Habits in that sense because what do they want you to do they want you to spend money Okay, so they give you a little bit of dopamine at the beginning, you know, you create a new account I'm sure you guys know this feeling if you've used tinder before You create a new account and you get some of really hot girls and you maybe even get a match with one of the hot girls Uh what tinder is doing there is it shows your profile to as many girls as possible To hook you you want to they want you to hook to the app They want they don't want you to install three other apps because it gets frustrated in the first five minutes So now you're hooked and now you swipe swipe swipe and it kind of dopamine wears off now They pitch you something that has the potential to give you that feeling back and you're craving this feeling because it's deeply rooted You want to meet someone beautiful you want to interact you want to be social you buy the whatever the premium subscription? Or super likes or whatever it is that it's the newest package and then as soon as you buy you get rewarded Not because your profile is so hot or you you are such a good texter No, because you spend dollars because you get they got your credit card details now Basically, they give you a little bit of dopamine back it wears off again And so on until you get another hit another hit another hit they turn into your drug dealer Basically, and you are a drug addict if you are constantly on tinder Sorry to burst your bubble. Here's some stats I found about tinder, which might be interesting. Uh, okay revenue is going up Good good job ceo Uh users going up which obviously leads to more revenue now this surprised me here tinder gender demographics in the u.s As well as the uk 24 female 75 male in the uk 9 female 89 male. I don't know why there's such a big difference in us versus the uk But this gets me to my next point the odds are stacked against you on many levels, right as we see here Way more men than women already on the platform. I mean that just is a fact Mathematically for every woman there's nine guys on tinder, right? Women have way higher standards on a dating platform than men Even though there are a lot of men. They are not choosing any of them. They're only choosing like the top 10 So now you're hoping to get one of the 10 to 25 percent of women But those women Already by definition rule out 90 percent of men as well on top of that if you're not spending constantly money It's not a lot. But if you're not constantly kind of Rewarding the algorithm with your dollars the odds also get stacked against you on a technical basis. So it's just math it's Women's psychology and it's the fact that tinder is a business and wants your money. So ask yourself Very uncomfortable question. Are you Considering yourself Look wise no, let's not talk about personality. Let's only talk about looks your photos your cheekbones your abs Do you consider yourself in the top? one or two percent of men And if not, why are you wasting your time on tinder? Sorry to break it to you that way, you know, but If you are by the way in the first top one two percent congratulations, you won the lottery and you Probably have no reason watching this video because you're probably crushing it on tinder Because all those women are probably in your inbox. I assume i'm not in the top one or two percent you know i'm a little bit short and my beard isn't fully grown and I have a little bit of a God that i'm trying to fast away and work out away and my hairline is already a little bit receding But that's okay Because i'm not relying on tinder. I got many other Social income streams that I I work on and that i'm very strategic about so my dating life is a-okay so far Then you should do something else So moving on the other thing other than dating apps is social media in general and when I talk about social media, let's talk about instagram because it's One of the most active users the most attention is there people use it the most And it's kind of the best in terms of like messaging interacting and so on now when I said tinder is the biggest Dating app I was lying Instagram is actually actually the biggest dating app. Why is that more people are using it and let's be honest people who use tinder If they're at least a little bit strategic about it and not just like mindlessly scroll and just waste their time Then they're either using it to get sex slash dates slash Female slash masculine attention or to make money so it is then by definition the biggest dating app in terms of users and Interaction now as you've probably guessed i'm not the biggest fan of tinder. I barely use it I maybe go on Two dates a year off it and when I mean dates it must be in the radius of my home because I don't want to Risk getting catfished or wasting my time with somebody who looks totally different than on their photos I do use social media though to get dates to improve my dating life to get attention and to basically Uh, yeah get women in my life and manifesting that and I think instagram is much better for that for several reasons First of all, you're not relying on what is it five to ten photos show a little bio text and maybe your favorite song You can actually if you know how to you have visual storytelling let people know who you are Um communicate with them right react to stuff Uh put stuff out that other people react to because they resonate with it and so on So there's way bigger like socially way bigger opportunities to really put yourself out there and not just a very like photoshopped Curated image of you, you know, you can be more of yourself on instagram I always want that people are themselves and i'm in my coaching sessions I basically explore how can you improve your dating life while at the same time being yourself and not Putting on the mask of somebody who's dating life is amazing, right on tinder. You're trying to meet somebody Who you've never met before a total stranger and you're trying to convince them within 0.2 seconds that you are worthy and the girl looks at your profile and in A split second she's like nope and you're like swiped out of existence, you know, not worthy of reproduction um On instagram on the other hand i'm not even trying really to meet strangers Really? I I don't slide into girls dms first I don't have time for that and it makes me not feel masculine to be like. Hi your pictures are hot I use Instagram to stay in touch With the people that I meet in real life Okay, it's not a tool to get New people into my life to to expand the funnel that I do with all the other things that I will talk about uh in the next videos, it's for me to to cement and to To to strengthen the relationship that I started in real life because sometimes you know, I might meet somebody Literally for three minutes, you know, I might get introduced to someone in the club and she's a really beautiful girl But you know, she's busy she's with a group I see I cannot just sit down with her now for two hours and get to know her but I can't get instagram And usually beautiful girls have a very low resistance to sharing instagram. It's totally okay It's nothing that needs to be convincing these days. So that's a good start and then over a long time I can Get to know her better and mainly give her a chance to get to know me better versus again on tinder It's like I have literally like once by time to convince someone And is that really the game you want to play? Is that really the game you want to play for the rest of your life? I don't think so. We do things online and we're going to do things online for the next many years You know, we do stuff online. We probably even in the metaverse, you know, and if you don't Firstly accept that and work towards that and not against it You're gonna be way less significant than you should be, you know, you don't want to be illiterate You don't want to be a guy who can't read or write In the 21st century. It's kind of the equivalent, you know So that means you should have a basic understanding of how to present yourself online how to Create a basic profile how to storytell how to do visual storytelling because obviously instagram is mainly a visual platform how to Not be cringy Say it bluntly Well, you know what what comes across as cringy what's not What do people care about what not what drives engagement and i'm not even saying in a like business way, but what? makes people like What captures their attention and makes? Makes them remember you based on something you post, you know If you don't develop a sense for that an understanding for that and a skill for that You know, you're just ignorant a little bit and maybe proud to be not online, but it's not going to help you You know social media detoxes and like distraction detoxes are good. I do that as well, but being totally ignoring that whole world it's uh It's a bad cost benefit now. It's not rocket science, you know, I created a three-part course Totally for free. It's free videos So within like 50 minutes, you can get a head start on all of what I just mentioned Just click below you can start it for free Just put your email in and you get the guide into your email inbox and that gives you a good understanding if you're now like Oh, yeah, probably I should Learn a little bit about this usually the stuff I teach and it's free course I only give to the elite clients that come on our four to five figure workshops But I want to make it more accessible to people online, so I created this guide So we talked about tinder can be an option if you do it perfectly fine And you're in a very high percent of people and if you're crushing it on tinder congratulations. I'm happy for you I just in my personal experience met a lot of guys who are not A little bit frustrated and they want to learn about more options, and we talked a little bit about social media As I said if you want to know more about it click the link below now in the next video of this mini-series of social income streams I will talk about Social circle how to meet people in social environments and not just meet But how to turn them into dates and into lovers and into beautiful romantic Experiences so stay tuned next video is here"}
