There's been comments saying James doesn't do infield anymore. Yeah, I do. And I'm gonna do it again. So where am I right now? Kiev, Ukraine, which is where we've been holding our workshops this year because it is maskless. Primarily. Firstly, it's open. The weather's all right. But most importantly, is the insanely hot concentration of insanely hot femaloids on the street. So we've been having a great time running around, throwing our guys in for life-changing, awesome events. So on my day off, I'm gonna go and do something for you. And here I present to you, James Marshall on the streets of Kiev, Spring 2021. Let's do this. I swear. Hi. How are you? You look like you're in the middle of a fashion shoot. Thank you. Just that pose, the outfit. Where's the photographer? No, not here. Thank you. Oh, yes. Cool. And what's, are you getting a passport? No, I was just writing my CNN test and now I'm waiting for my friends to come to the restaurant. Come to the rescue? Restaurant. Okay, cool. What's a Zeno test? It's like... Or is that too personal? I don't know what that is. The main test all students in Ukraine had to write before their enrollment. Oh, okay. So some entrance exam or something like this. Okay. I get the general idea. Yeah. What's your name? Yeah, you've got a cool smile. You look lovely. Thank you. I'm James. What's this about? Is this from a manga thing? It's a sloth, right? Yeah. I saw... There you go. That's kind of my forever mood. Is a sloth? Drink a cup of coffee and be in a sloth. A sloth in a cup of coffee. But then you would be drinking the coffee and then you would be all freaked out. I went to the Amazon jungle once. I mean, many times. But I saw these things. And I was with a guide and he... So they're up in the trees and we were in this boat because the forest floods, right? So it's all water, but then in the trees you have the sloths. And then he would whistle in a special way that sounds like a female sloth. Are you with me so far? Yeah. Okay. You're like, what the fuck is he talking about? And then, so the male sloth heard this sexy sound of the female sloth that he had the thing. And then it was like, oh, girls. And then he starts going like this, really, really slowly to try and get the girl. And I'm like, it would take him like a week to go and find his girlfriend. I just, I didn't know sloths make any sounds. Apparently they do. Because it works. Yeah, it's a weird whistling sound. But if they can't, when they go on the ground, because their bones are very, very thin. And so if they're on the ground, they can't walk. They just crawl, like drag themselves because they don't have any structure. Now you know some things about sloths. Thanks. You're welcome. That's what I do. I go around telling people. All right, now you can ask me something. Really? What are you doing in Ukraine? That's always the question. And it's done like this. What are you doing in Ukraine? Why would you ask it like that? Are you not proud of this great country? I think I'd move to Europe one day. You would, you look pretty European. Yeah, you would fit in in Berlin or Holland, Barcelona. Yeah. Why am I in Ukraine? Basically because this is the place where it's all open. And I was in Portugal. I lived there like half the time in the countryside. And then I wanted to go and have some adventures. A lot of my friends are here. It's easy to get into. My grandfather was Ukrainian. There's some reasons. I see. She's like, no. I don't buy it. Yeah, that's why I'm here. So yeah, cool. All right, are we gonna go out? What? Not now, but sometime in the future. I don't know. I have a boyfriend. No, you don't. I really don't. No, you don't. I do. Are you gonna marry him? Is it serious? Yeah. Okay, I saw that. It's serious. All right, tell you what. Then we'll swap Instagrams. You text me in one to three years and then we'll start again. Okay. You add me because I'm a private person. I'm sorry. I switch. You switch. All right. You should have a case, you maniac. What happens if I'm now I'm worried that I'm gonna drop it? I don't know why. I just trust you. You just trust me with this? Yeah. Okay, well, I don't. And I run really fast, so. If I run, you'll run faster than me. No, I'm not gonna steal. I'm just gonna drop it accidentally. Okay, good. You have an awesome day. Thank you. I like you. We'll see you soon. Thank you so much. Bye. Okay, so everyone knows the day game line. Hi, I saw you from over there and I just had to come over here and say that you're cute, right? Which is fine. It's better than any other weird scripted line, I would say. In this situation, I'm taking a snap read of the girl and I get this sense, just there's a moment there. She's leaning up against things. She's in some kind of Berlin high fashion outfit. And so that's my read on her. The feel of it is that's the moment and that's where I go and communicate to her. Wow, you look like you're in a fashion suit, something, something. And she lights up instantly because it's so clearly genuine. So clearly I didn't plan this and very, very disarming. All right, so then we had a cute chat. Oh, she was so adorable. I wish you could see her face, but she can't because otherwise we'll get demonetized or something. And we can't afford that now. We've got 100,000 subs, boom! Only took 13 years when some other dude, people with cats did it in a week. 13 years, another 13, we'll have 200,000. So the important thing there was the boyfriend objection. She said she had a boyfriend and I said, no, you didn't. Now I highly recommend not saying that. So under those circumstances, that's where I will exchange an Instagram and then, I mean, maybe I will, maybe I won't, but keep an eye on her profile from time to time and see if there's a time when she goes from couple photos to hot girl summer, in which case, is that what they do, hot girl summer? Then, then I will move in. So keep that in mind. I generally don't try and push through boyfriend objections unless there's a really good vibe. And in this case, that's kind of the best I can go. It's like, I've got a loose contact that maybe something will happen in the future. You do enough of those, sometimes they reappear. All right, well, this is going pretty good, isn't it? Let's try and get a few more rejections, come on. Are you guys in a gang? Gang. Ganger, you know, like gangsters. Why are you dressed, are you part of a hip hop team or something? What's wrong? Do you want me to say something? What's wrong? Oh, you're just cute and I thought I'd say hi and see what's going on. Thank you. Yeah, no, so what are you doing? Are you promoting something or what? We're going shopping, yeah. But you just, are you twins? No, just best friends. Best friends, okay, cool. Sometimes I dress like that. I don't know why. Best friends, okay, cool. Sometimes I dress like mine too. All right, see ya, sorry dad. Excuse me, hi. How are you? You don't, I'll just, this is where I hang out sometimes. Hang out here by myself sometimes. Girls come, I like to say, move along lady. It's best you give me some space. How about this one, is she cute? Excuse me, hi. Are you? Okay. Hi, what's up? Okay, cool. Do you mind if I walk with you for a moment? I'm not dangerous or anything. No. You believe me, straight away, cool. You mean right now? I was just taking a walk and then I saw you and now I want to talk to you. How's it? Australia. Everyone says it like that. Everyone says it like that. Like, what are you doing here? What are you doing here? Yeah, I mean, with a bit of suspicion. I'm living here at the moment. Yeah. Why? Because Australia is bad? Maybe so, but Australia is locked from the world right now. It's what? Blocked, like you cannot come in, cannot go out. It's like North Korea with good beaches. It's a joke, you're supposed to laugh. Ha, ha, ha, there we go, nice. I've been working on that joke for days. Yeah, so, I mean, I split my time between here and Portugal currently. Yeah. Because I have a lot of friends here, I run some business here and... Business? Business. In Ukraine? Well, it's like an online business. If it's business in Ukraine, it must be dodgy. Do you know this word? Dodgy. Dodgy? You know this word? I know doggy. No, not doggy. Dodgy, I don't know. Dodgy is like sketchy or... You don't know that one either? It's my vocabulary. It's a colloquial word, I need to figure out how to translate it. Okay. Yeah, what's your name? After we go, we can change contacts. Okay, we're gonna hang out sometime? Okay, bye. What's your name first? I'm James. James. James. Okay. Normal white, you know, name. Where are you going now? Shopping, I have... I'm going on third day to Costa Rica. Really? Costa Rica is awesome. So I have to buy a lot of some different stuff. Yeah, have you been there before? No. It's beautiful. I will have Ayahuasca for you. If you know what it is. I definitely know what it is. I've done that 40 times. Yeah, I went to Peru and did like long dieta for like three weeks, taking every night. Yeah, I've seen things. Have you done it before? Similar. Like Yopo, Yopo ceremony here. Yopo, what's that? It's also DMT. Like which you smoke? No, in the nose. Oh, like Rape, where they blow it up your nose. Not Rape. Okay, I haven't had it that way before. I've heard DMT. It's a bit stronger than Ayahuasca. Right, and do you have a good teacher? Like you know who the person is? Not really. He's a center. Okay, I highly recommend you like research online because there's a lot of centers where are good and some where they're not good and they can be a little bit. I did research. You researched? A guy who did that, he has his own book about Ayahuasca and such stuff. Okay, cool. Well, good luck. You're gonna learn some things about yourself. Are you doing one session or more or what? Yeah, two. And you know you have to not eat certain things before and you know all that? Okay, good, good. Yeah, because if you don't, it's really not fun. You'll just be throwing up all night. No, did you try? A little bit, yeah. It's not good. It's not fun. But overall, Ayahuasca gives you what you need. So she will let you know. So when are you leaving? Like two days. When do you come back? I don't know. You don't know? We'll see. All right, well if I don't see you before, I'm interested to see you when you're back, actually, and find out how your journey was. Why did you decide, are you going by yourself or? Well, you're brave. It's a nice one. Maybe I'm a bit stupid. Well, I mean, you just look out for yourself. Costa Rica is like safe, cute place. The jungle's like Disney jungle. You can give me a WhatsApp, things better. It's right? Yeah. Okay, cool. I'll text you now, just so. Just so. So you're going shopping for Ayahuasca. What do you need for that? Panama, how do you say it? Panama hat. Gucci poncho. Bra. Ah, yes. Yeah, you need loose. Loose clothing is good. Swimming. Ah, yeah, cool. Business account. What business are you in? It doesn't mean anything. Just as a business account. Okay, cool. All right, well, best of luck. Thanks. And when you think, when it feels like it's too much, just relax into it, just let go. Don't fight. Sometimes you need to, sometimes the best thing to do is take more. Take more? Yeah, like if you've had one cup and you're feeling like half on the edge and it's really not pleasant, have another one and it punches you through to the other side. Okay. That's my advice. Thanks. All right, see you. Have a good day. Bye. Right at the beginning of this, there was like a micro-attunement, which I had to do, right? So I did my standard Jedi stop and I see blank face, like blank face, a little bit scared, and then she's walking past me. Hi, what's up? Okay, cool. Do you mind if I walk with you for a moment? I'm not dangerous or anything. You're not dangerous? No. You believe me, straight away, cool. Now, this is where I'm making a micro-decision. Sometimes like the girls just give me a hard stony face and she's just trying to blank me. I'm sure we got one of those on film. Hi, how are you doing? Thank you, that's exactly what I needed. Thank you, now they know I'm not faking it. In which case I usually let her go, depending on how resilient or whatever I'm feeling at the moment. But what I'm looking for is the, I'm not sure, maybe, maybe no. That's where most girls are gonna sit when you approach them. Some small percentage will be like, hey, it's a guy, I'm gonna talk to him. Some will be an asshole about it or whatever. They can just blank you, which is fine. But most of them are gonna exist in that like, probably not, I don't know what this is. And you need to be ready for that and totally chill with that because it's totally understandable, right? You're a stranger. She has no idea who I am, what I'm doing, why I'm approaching her And so it's understandable her initial reaction is, uh, don't think so. But in that little micro moment I'm looking and seeing that she is looking at me and she's trying to figure out what's going on So I just spin on my heels Release the pressure by not staring at her too much, smiling and allowing her to have some relaxed moments So then it goes from like, probably not, to within seconds, okay, I'm happy to talk to this guy So watch for the subtleties. I know sometimes you look at my infill and it's like, he's just saying normal things Yeah, well we were talking about tripping on ayahuasca in Costa Rica, so not that one I'm saying normal things but it's the way that I say it. It's the in between the lines It's the pulsing something out, seeing her reaction or response and then micro adjusting to the needs of the moment This is where natural game becomes an art as opposed to, hey, I saw you from over there and I thought you were cute Hi, how are you doing? You walk with such confidence Okay, well, the fact that you said it's terrible is a... that's fine, I think we can try Where are you going in a rush? Or you just always walk like this with power and confidence? Sorry, I'm going to meet with my girlfriend Yes, okay, cool. I'll just walk with you for one minute and then I will go Okay Yeah, what's your name? Yeah, I'm James Nice to... Nice to meet you, yes, good And what's going on in life? Are you like a sport person? No, I... No You're just naturally like this Yes Yes, cool And what are you doing in life in general? Like, are you studying, are you working, are you a... I'm studying A mistress of someone or... I'm working Okay I'm in future graphic designer Right, so you're learning graphic design now Yes And eventually you'll be a graphic designer That's a good industry Yes, well, as I work in this business So you're already doing some design... Yes Right, okay, cool So you're an ambitious person Do you know this word? Ambitious I don't understand some words Okay, it means that you have dreams for the future and you want to achieve these Now it's getting more complicated You're a busy girl Yes Okay, cool, excellent Well, I was just going to see my friends back there But I had to talk to you because you look awesome and sexy So, can I take you out for a date sometime? A date? Sorry, I'm busy today No, no, I don't mean today I mean sometime when you're not so busy we can have a cup of coffee or whatever Maybe Okay, well, stop for one second, I'll get you... You have a WhatsApp or something? WhatsApp? No, I have Instagram, I have Telegram Let's do Telegram Telegram So... Sorry, your name again was? Okay, just cool, I like that And I'm James Okay, write your Telegram number Or is it a name? One second This number? Yes Okay Okay, my Telegram is an American number, so yours... It will be from an American number Okay Good luck Yes, thank you, see you Hi Hello How are you? I'm fine You look amazing today Thank you I always look amazing Well, good, I mean it would make sense, right? If you could look like this every day, then why not? Okay If you could look like this every day, then why not? Okay Is it for some occasion or just... Just Just Being alive Everyday life Excellent, cool, what's your name? And you're quite confident, I'm James Thank you, nice to meet you Nice, very... Hang on, you can't shake hands like that, it's gotta be like that Yes And where are you going right now? Good luck What's the plan? I'm going with my friend to a milk bar To a milk bar, like an old school American milk bar? No, here Oh, that's a place, right, okay Yeah Awesome, okay, cool I can see you're distracted and you wanna go, but do you wanna hang out sometime? What, what? I can see that you're distracted, like your mind is already going Yeah Yes, I understand that I can read people I can read people very well So would you like to hang out sometime when you're not in that space? Maybe Okay, cool, give me your number Yeah Tell me your name again I've got it Yes Yeah, what's up? Yeah Okay, I'm fine And you? Cool, alright, a couple of quick sets So the first one, very shy girl, although walking with supreme confidence And who spoke very little English So this happens, right The thing to note from that is how I recalibrate on the fly I use some words she doesn't really understand I can't remember what they were I use some words she doesn't really understand I can't remember what they were Ambitious, she didn't know what that was And so whenever you're speaking with someone who doesn't speak your language so well You need to really be observing, does she get it or not? Because often people will be like, uh-huh And they don't understand the key words in the sentence So as I'm working, the moment I'm reading, does she actually see this? And then I'm gonna rephrase and adjust Now, the reason I didn't stop her initially is I could Once I got in front of her, she turns, she walks It's very clear to me that right now she's not comfortable enough with me to stop She's moving fast, her mind's going in that direction So I waited until the very end, once we get to the close To go, alright, stop for a minute Okay, we'll stop for one second, I'll get you You have a WhatsApp or something? WhatsApp, no, I have Instagram, I have Telegram And then she was quite open and friendly about it She was keen to exchange contacts, just that she was really shy I'll counteract that with the next chick I ran after immediately afterwards Who was, I mean you couldn't see her eyes, but she was She stared me down, I'm a little bit shaken by that Like she was fucking powerful And when I gave her a compliment, she was like, I look like this every day You look amazing today Thank you, I always look amazing That was a cool chick So with her, again what I'm reading is that She's alright, okay, this is a man talking to me, I know what he's doing I've been here before And then I can see that her mind's not with me That she really wants to keep going So that's another moment where because of the read that I'm getting I wrap things up I can see you're distracted and you want to go But do you want to hang out sometime? Maybe If I tried to go, alright, so tell me about your dreams and hopes And let's have a long chat I would suggest or I'm guessing that she would be like Alright, I've got to get out of here buddy So getting straight to the point with her as best I could Trying to keep up with her slavic intensity Was the right thing to do Alright, so that's a couple of hours on the streets of Kiev Old man Marshall"}
