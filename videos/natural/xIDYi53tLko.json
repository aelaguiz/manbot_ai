And guess what? You don't have to do it by yourself. Talk to people who know what they're talking about. Talk to people who can work this out. I had to go through this stuff for years to understand what I understand now. The secondary thing, which I talk about a fair bit as well, is you need to work on your mindset in terms of where you've been coming from in the past. It's another huge part of the work that I do, one-on-one and in workshops, is helping guys to clean up their idea of themselves in the past. And this is very personal work. It's very detailed work. But it's also very important work. So if you've ever heard of characters like Jordan Peterson talk about things like self-authoring, future authoring, these are powerful technologies. It's a similar thing to what I'm talking about here. Being able to take the conception of yourself, the self-image that you have with all the details that have been associated with that in the past, and to be able to go in and to specifically find moments where you created definitions of yourself that were limiting. Moments where you became crippled, stifled, stuck because things were not given to you, or because somebody shut you down, somebody knocked you down, somebody held you down. And then you had a reaction to that experience that you carried forth from that time. So the practice is to go in to find these knots, these blocks, these challenges, and to undo them. And guess what? You don't have to do it by yourself. I'm here. Good coaches are out there. Good therapists are out there. Talk to people who know what they're talking about. Talk to people who can work this out. I had to go through this stuff for years to understand what I understand now. So you can't just learn this in a few minutes on a YouTube video, but I can give you the idea. This is about cleaning up the past, about giving yourself healthy mindsets, changing beliefs, re-imprinting, re-installing, reprogramming the subconscious mind. Because that is part of your physiology. That's your neurochemistry. That's your neurology. It's part of who you are and how you feel about yourself. And the really juicy thing here is you learn how to get into positive, resourceful, powerful physiological states, which I've already mentioned many inside of this video already. You get into these states, and then you take these states, these resources, into the past, and you use them to help you to move forward. And what that does is it starts to move you away from the emergency. It starts to shut down the siren of emergency inside of your nervous system, so that you can be free. You can be at ease, relaxed, expressed, whole, at peace. And I don't know about you, but that is the best feeling in the world. It's the most important feeling in the world. And this whole game of women, relationships, sex, growth, learning, holistic self-development, it's all tied into this. It's all one system. It all has to begin with you. It all has to operate within your physiology and to feed back into it. So to come back to practicalities for you guys now, because I'm sure you guys want to take away some really good stuff. I mean, I've already given you some good tips, so pay attention. Recognize that wherever you are, that's exactly where you need to be. Recognize that whoever you are, that's exactly who you are right now. That doesn't mean that you cannot change. It doesn't mean that things will not change, but it does mean that you need to accept things as they are to begin. To accept yourself as you are to begin. Physiologically, emotionally, energetically. To bring yourself home to yourself and start to say, it's okay that I am who I am. It's okay that this is what it is. Because it's a big tendency for guys to beat themselves up and to make it hard on themselves, to be self-critical, to be judgmental, to be doubting and heavy, and to basically be putting a lot of shame on themselves as if they're not good enough. Why? Because it's a habit. What's up, gentlemen? The Natural Lifestyles is back on the road for a limited series of live workshops all around Europe. You can join myself, Shea Matthews, and the full team to work not only on your external seduction skills, which of course we cover in great detail, but also the internal journey, looking at your self-esteem, your sense of masculine groundedness, and your sexuality.
