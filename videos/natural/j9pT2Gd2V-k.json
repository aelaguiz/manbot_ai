So like when the princess is bonded and then the prince saves her, and I just started to do it myself, like bonding myself, and I'm like, I kind of enjoy that, but I never experienced it in a sexual context. Um, just putting it out there, uh, if you happen to want to experience that in a very soft and simple and safe way right now, that can be arranged. Oh! It's so beautiful too. I mean right here. Now? Yeah. All right. Have you had the experience so far? Like, have you had a good period? Yeah, I did. I had a few boyfriends and one girlfriend who did some really good stuff to me, and I was really intrigued to experience this kind of thing. Good stuff. Good stuff. Yeah, like, yeah, yeah. And like, what was your first, like, initial reaction when you were like, ah, this is actually cool? Like, what was my life before this? Well, first of all, I was always aware that I was into these kind of things, but only in my mind, maybe subconsciously, and I was like, okay, this is something new. I'm not sure how I'm going to react, but let's do it. And after when it happened, I was like, wow, this is how you can do it. Can you give us, like, some more details? Yeah, sure. So, um, my first, uh, spicy boyfriend, uh, tied me up and that was really amazing. Like, I never met anyone who was into this thing, uh, except Bourne. Like, he tied you up in what way? Uh, my hands, my legs. Yeah. Awesome. Yeah. Also, we did some waxing, you know, playing with wax, this kind of thing. So. Just a note for guys, if you're thinking of doing wax play with your ladies, buy a soy wax candle. You don't use normal paraffin wax because it's way too hot. Use a soy candle, which burns at a lower temperature. So you still get the nice sting, but it's not actually going to burn the skin. Also, James, for the guys out there, actually, what is BDSM? And where is it? How did it get, where did it come from? Um, I don't actually know the history of kink. I mean, look, ask Caligula. Like, people have been doing kinky stuff, certainly since the Romans. There was, there was some kinky fucks back then. But you also been doing this for two decades. You have the most experience. Yes. Yes. Uh, that's, I mean, I actually haven't researched the real history of the, like, let's say the modern BDSM scene, but it's, I mean, it's been around. Well, what was that in the 1950s? There was that pin-up girl. Remember her? Pin-up girl. You guys know. Pin-up. Uh, can you look it up, Adam? It's like a... Pin-up girl, 1950s BDSM. Girl on a poster. Raquel, the... No, no, no, she's got like a great name. She was a bombshell and she used to do these foxy photos of her tied up and whatever. Uh, so yeah, I guess it's been around in the public eye since the kind of 50s in very, very underground, uh, scenes. Shibari, how long has it been around? Oh, that's, I mean, that's a Japanese tradition. I don't know, hundreds of years. Yeah. Cause that's, that's not... Does that relate to it? Like, did it come, did BDSM bondage come from Shibari? I don't know. I wouldn't, I wouldn't say so because Shibari is like more, from my understanding, I'm not a Shibari master. That's really complex stuff. I know some knots, but I'm, it's, I'm too impatient to learn all that stuff. I mean, it looks amazing. And in, in my later years, that's soon, uh, you know, when I'm an old, older man, uh, then I, maybe I'll get into all the rope tying stuff. But from what I understand from riggers and, and ladies, I know who are into it, it's a, it's basically immerses you into deep, deep trance states and it is erotic and sexual, but typically from what I understand, you know, I'm not an expert on this. Traditionally, it was not done as a penetrative sex act. It was like, you know, an erotic bondage experience, which took the, the woman or the sub into, yeah, like deep trance meditative states, which I guess were erotically infused. That's kind of all I should say about it. Cause I don't know enough about it to, to comment on that, that field so much, although it is fascinating and I will look into it. Um, so yeah, like, I mean, the kink scene has certainly exploded since the internet, right? Cause talking to my mate, Dom, who's been a professional dominant since he was 19 and he's like 50 ish now. So yeah, he, he was back in the old school days and then it was all about fetish communities. So there'd be clubs all over around the world, but particularly in places like New York and Berlin and Sydney actually is, Sydney is pretty freaky place, um, where there's, you know, dedicated spaces where people would come to play. And I've been into a bunch of different dungeons and, uh, and it's interesting, but it's like in, within those scenes, people tend to be very particular about what they do, who they are in, in that, in that thing, uh, in these contexts. And they'll go and if you approach someone, I mean, there's all sorts of rules. It's not like a club where you can just roll up and say, how about a bit of a spank darling? Um, it's, you know, there's, there's very clear, they have very clear communication and consent, like extremely clear to the point of sometimes like legal contract clear. And so, you know, they'll, people will like match up with, you know, the saddest and the, and the masochist and the baby doll and the daddy Dom and the, um, you know, the dude that wants to be, be ignored in the corner because that's his thing. Uh, and, and, and can I tell you guys one funny story? Yes. Thanks. Uh, so I was in, um, I was in like a, like a couture kind of, um, fetish club in New York. And a friend of mine, she's, she was like the queen of the queers. And she like was part of this crew that got paid to dress up like vampires, basically sex, sexy ass blade vampires, and go and be fabulous at these like high-end kind of queer clubs. So she invited me along and she's like, not dressed like that, James. She like does my eyeliner and like puts me in all the blacks and makes me look, you know, confusing. Uh, and so we're going to, I go into this bar and it's really fancy place. And, um, everyone's like out of a video clip. And there's like this dominatrix, like her name's Kelly leader. Kate, look her up. She took me home and it didn't work. I'll explain why later. Yeah, we need, I don't know why it didn't work with you, James. It's not on the internet. Oh, I'm so slow. And, um, so I'm looking around for my mate, Jess. She's gone off to be fabulous. And so I walk over to the bar and as I get to the bar, I like stumble. All right. And I look down and there's like a huge rolled up carpet, which they've just rolled up and then like put up against the bar. I'm like, that's not very good. Oh, H and S in such a fancy bar. And I stand up on top of the, um, the carpet. I'm looking around. Where's Jess? I can't see her anywhere or whatever saying I hang out some, uh, what am I allowed to call him now? Drag queen comes and has a chat to me. She's he, she's like, you're so straight. I'm like, how did you tell? It's so obvious. But I got the eyeliner and everything. It's so obvious. All right, fine. I'm straight. Who let you in here, Jess? All right, you can stay. And, um, and then, you know, again, I stand up on there looking around and then he, she says to me, carpet guy really likes you. And I'm like, what? And I look down and there's eye holes cut in the fucking carpet. And there's a dude rolled up in the carpet and that's his thing. And I was just involved in that thing. And I'm like, wow, people are so weird. Why? I have so many questions. I should stop having this conversation with a man rolled up in a carpet. And then I felt, and then I was like, that wasn't consensual. I'm going to take the power back. And then I got on him and stomp, stomp, stomp. You fucking like that. Don't you motherfucking. He's like, yeah, yeah, yeah. Step on me. What was the question? Get him on the podcast next time. Oh, yeah, it's a good one. Yeah. Okay. What is BDSM in like a understandable log line? Just like if you want to like simplify it in one line. Bondage, domination, submission, masochism or sadomasochism. There's various combinations of those four letters. So it's kind of like, it's trying to like in four letters encompass the wild and wonderful world of kink. So if maybe kink is a better word just to be more relatable, which literally just means more or less anything that is slightly deviant or outside of the norm of what we might consider normal sex in this time and place. Because what was considered normal sex back in, you know, Athenian Greece would have been way different than what it is now. So let's say whatever's normative now, it's all any deviance upon that. And it tends to have aspects of power play, right? So power to exchange dynamics. And that tends to be kind of the engine that makes it really spicy and interesting. So, you know, that's where the submission and dominance comes into it. But it's not just about subdom. It's about friction. It's about impact. It's about intensity. And essentially, it's about sensation. It's about creating, well, there's many layers to it. But like it's creating varieties of different sensations, which then create contrast and polarity, which gives you a much broader spread of experience than just the, you know, waves crashing with a soft light filter, pumping two strokes a second, or whatever it is that normal people do. All right. I mean, I could rant all day, but like, stop me. So for you two who've been working and are working at the SCAM agency, please. What are the weirdest kinks you guys have experienced? I remember I met a fetish girl and she and she said that she had a client who loved he had this fetish of putting any type of fruit on his dick and she was she was leading him. She was telling him how to do and she said, first time we tried with peach and it's really good because it nurtures and it's so moisturizing and you can just go around with it. I'm like, oh, wow, this is a cool thing. I would love to try. You should get the grapefruits out. So he literally just likes fruit on his junk. Yeah. Like they make a hole and then like, yeah, like everything goes around his dick. So, yeah. That's really harmless. Yeah. It's a very harmless. But actually one, so the harm thing, I remember, I think the hardest thing I saw, there was one guy, he loved to be, I think, submissive or it's always called like penis humiliation. So he sent a picture of his small dick and he put a hot pepper inside of it. And he said, this is for you, my love. I was like, oh, my God, this is so bad. And I was showing it to every guy and they're like, I would never do that. Like, what the hell? Yeah, it's interesting that like when you get into more extreme fetishes, they're literally things that if ISIS caught you and did it to you, it would be the worst torture. But some people really like that. I mean, I can tell you some way more than that, but. Yeah. Well, weird fetishes. I'm not sure if it's weird, but it's not my cup of tea, so. You're not judging anyone. Yeah, yeah, sure, sure, sure, sure. For me, the weirdest was like armpit fetishes. I don't know. For me, that was really strange. Also, the various things that people love to do with pee and poo within sexual things. That was really weird to me. So Germans like this? Yeah, I've heard that they do like that. Do you guys want to know stuff that you don't want to know? Yes. Oh, yes. And once you know it, you can't unknow it. Let's go. Sign an NDA before. All right. No, it's not about that. You know, now you have to carry this burden with you. So a friend of mine works as a financial dominatrix duo, right? So you're aware of what a financial dominatrix is? It's a sickening new kind of trend, which is really based around taking advantage of a mental illness. But there's all sorts of variations on it, right? And the guys who are called cash pigs, usually, or depending on their fetish, might be other types of pigs. So this particular duo is a guy and a girl. The girl is the front face. So the clients always think they're talking to the girl, which they're not most of the time. In the background is the guy who is extremely good at\u2014he understands human psychology to levels that are terrifying. So anyway, they basically niche themselves for some time as fart fetishists, right? So there's these guys, and they basically form this little cartel, and they know each other. There's seven guys, and they know each other as fart pig one, fart pig two. They know it. They never\u2014it's like, you know, reservoir dogs. Anyone? Oh, shit, I'm sold. Thank you. And so they only know each other as this thing, and they're all part of this private Telegram group, and they worship this girl. Let's call her someone. Give me a name. Barbie. They worship Barbie's farts. All right? And so what they do is\u2014I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. What they do is every time\u2014basically, they have committed to pay a fart tax, so multiple times\u2014and if they don't, there is fucking trouble. There is serious trouble. Yeah, like they will be punished. They're going to have to do some nasty shit if they want back in. All right? So they have to\u2014multiple times a day, they write a little story, and it just goes like something like this. I was on the bus, and then I couldn't help it, but I squeezed out a little fart. It was silent, but I hope that nobody knew it was me, but they could definitely smell it. And the guy's like, oh, you fucking\u2014200 bucks each. All right? Immediately. So, like, immediately, seven times. 1,400 bucks. Boom. All right? And then\u2014and it's not\u2014and I was like\u2014and I'm talking to him, I'm like, dude, this is true alchemy, because not only is it\u2014not only is it that you're not even selling a fart, you're selling a story about a hypothetical fart that never even\u2014 fucking happened this is genius he's like I've tuck and told you I've been saying I was a genius for years and so this happens like five times a day right where they were like whatever name is Barbie or whatever does her little thing and then the guys pay the tax right and then I said and after a while I said okay I said what about like audios like why don't you sell sell them like the sound of surely that they love that and he said yeah the problem is her farts are terrible they don't make any noise at all they're useless and I said what about yours and he's like I've got all that fucking problem with my guts and stuff and I was like well you know I'm famous for my like musical farts right it's like yeah I said I'll just send them to you and so I did I recorded them and I send them to him send them to Australia to this evil Dom who then passes them on to his girl who then sells them to this cartel of dudes around the world and I don't even take a commission I'm just like I'm such so generous just like wow we just turned my farts into gold and now you have to know that they're actually people who sell their farts online yeah you make shit ton of money yeah it's an industry girl who was like speaking about the business and how she does it like she in the morning she wakes up she eats beans to like generate the fart and she sits down she eats some ice cream and then she puts like a little cute jar with like some leaves in it she even explains that the fart stays for four days the smell if they order right now oh yeah she's like sells out in like it's just like 100k in like a day like dudes what they do what she does with a jar she sells it okay yeah so you now you have to know tonight would you sell your farts 1,000 euros what's the lowest what's the lowest price you'd sell your phone I would start with hundred yeah are you still fear I give him away I had a question like if anyone feels like sharing is there any like fantasy that you have that you'd like to share no like they have never tried before what is like the wildest fantasy that you've had you've never shared I mean that's a big one yeah never say wildest or anything because people's brains cannot do it because then they have to create a catalog of all the things and decide which one's which and like is it the mostest or it's not quite the mostest so it's better to say what is one thing that you something something yeah seduction one what's one fantasy that you've had for a long time that you'd be willing to share how was that some reason I'm the judger of questions now and yeah it works let's go like rounds this way and yeah I can go first if you want yes please I think what it's been like a fantasy for a long fucking time since I was like I don't know since I started having sex which was like 13 a long like maybe even 9 maybe 10 like that young I had the fantasy of like multiple girls who were like they all needed my like come and I was like the king and I had to like impregnate them all and like they were like they were my girls and like you know they did what I needed and they'd all like bend over like in a line and like they'd be like please give me a come and like it's like a Mongol Khan fantasy basically yeah that's one and it's not happened yet but I'm what I'm working on it so far I've got one chick so that's a start got one number keep adding to the line another one in the line wait there wait the first one needed to leave fuck I feel like nothing I'm not feel like I'm not too comfortable sharing this but I'm more feel like I'm I didn't have that much experiences to think about this and it was not this big part of my life truly so in my opinion I will start with the BDSM I guess so that would be the first interaction for me to maybe have or I'm interested in can I ask a follow-up question and feel free not to answer so as we as I kind of said BDSM is a big toolkit like what do you imagine something specifically within that that like you maybe saw somewhere or you've thought about that kind of interesting well I don't know because I was interested in videos maybe at first I guess and I kind of don't don't truly get to know myself in this topic I guess I need time in this do you think maybe then you could say maybe a fantasy is to discover who you are sexually I'm like in the videos like what was happening I think we might have reached a limit there yeah well thanks for sharing I would add to that so since I was a kid I used to watch a lot of Disney movies and and many more sorry cartoons and I don't know it just stuck in my head so like when the princess is bonded and then the prince saves her and I just started to do it myself like bonding myself and I'm like I kind of enjoy that but I never experienced it in in the sexual context I'm like I think there will be a first start like the bondage and with the Vox thank you for sharing the tip about the candle I would I put it in my head so yeah this is the first thing to try because I never shared even this before okay that's awesome thank you for sharing can I ask I presume you've had a boyfriend or two in your life boyfriend yes of course yeah why did you not talk to him about that and see if you could make that into a reality yeah I think because I was always closed up and also in Kazakhstan I mean it's just like this woman thingy whatever like you always have to obey man and like whatever he says whatever he wants but if you exactly say something what you want then you're a whore or something so I think I've never felt this closeness with anyone yet there was almost coming but not not really right so you felt basically like fear that you would be partially judged if you express that to somebody yeah but now I feel like sharing it but of course I need to meet the right partner for that but you've also been living here for 11 years so yeah even with the Hungarian guys or yeah that's the thing like the last Hungarian guy I had like we were very open about trying many things but this didn't come there yet like even he asked me what's your craziest fantasy it just didn't come because I was still closed up yeah just putting it out there if you happen to want to experience that in a very soft and simple and safe way right now that can be arranged oh it's so beautiful too but guys you have to move on to our premium channel for that it's fine let's do it right here now and anyone else that would like to try okay let me explain okay how are we gonna do this okay all I would do is put a wrist cuff on you and then if you want I can bind it around I can explain it okay I can bind your wrists and then I can do something cool which is really sexy and is in no way dangerous or confronting and I barely touch you all right okay that sounds exciting let's try it yeah all right do you guys want to stand up for this yeah James Marshall I would love to continue next time anyone else want to try yeah this way wow very fucking nice all right and I'm sorry but I have to let you go now that's okay but this is really good thank you so much for coming I need I need one of those where do I get those from me obviously all right that's all I wanted to say about that where were we see uh I mean it could be as rough or as light as you wish like that's why these are really interesting but it's kind of cool it doesn't have to be this crazy like you know violent thing like it could be also very you could have very sensual soft kind of like bdsm session or bondage session as well so it's kind of crazy gentle you know yeah yeah that's maybe that maybe that's a common misconception with bdsm that it has to involve violence pain humiliation um and those some you know they those can be aspects and some people really like those and and a lot of women like a bit of impact like in terms of impact play but that can be you know this can be done I can hit someone in a really cute way totally you can like you can do it in a really playful in a silly way uh you can do it in a sleazy creepy in a good way way uh and you can also do it in a fucking nasty way all right so there's and many other ways so that like the sign of a bad dominant I would say is someone who thinks that more more force is better like you know in order to get more out of it I need to increase the pressure increase the pain or whatever as I said before I'm more on the sensual side of dominance I can be fucking nasty when when called for um but yeah this these kinds of bondage restraints can be like as delicate and as dainty as a butterfly like really it can be really really slow and sexy and often and often but often I prefer it that way and uh yeah it's it's uh again it's just about leading into different sensations like immediately it creates a bit of polarity between us right so it's like okay I'm doming you right but it's it's a it's in a way it's an it's an exchange it's a little bit of a dance and I switch into an aspect of my psyche or a aspect of my archetype and that tends to you know then sync up with an archetype or an aspect of the feminine and now we're dancing so just like firstly I want to ask you like how that felt but I can see like it looks kind of good but also at the same time just just to let the guys who watch this know that like communication and like this openness like if you have the balls to like you know really hold the space for like a woman and she can open up like it can turn it can turn things very interesting very very quickly and very easily and like it's fascinating to know just not to have this anger and shame towards women and like the more we actually allow them to express these things the more fun it is for everyone they'll be more curious that's the first thing to start with without being judging or anything yeah I mean I guess with us you feel like not judged you feel relaxed like and that's all it takes really for you to like be able to express that that aspect which is kind of fascinating and how was it it was amazing like it was super gentle I like that you asked if I give consent on or not because at the beginning I was like oh my god what's gonna happen and the first thing like oh my god am I going to be naked like in Germany like nipples out I'm like no I don't think it will go there but you still did anyway yeah but when you explain what you're gonna do I'm like okay now I feel calm and then you just build more trust yeah yeah and so yeah for a guy out there who want to you know learn this stuff you're not learning it to like have cool tricks or to have power over women or because like then they think you're cool or whatever it's like as you step more into dominance you have a lot more responsibility right so like I you know I know that when someone's submitting their body to me then now I have to be really conscious of what I'm doing have to be really aware of how she's feeling and I can't be and I can't be attached to the outcome that I think I want right so if I'm like I come to I want to do this cool thing right and half and you know let's say I put the wrist thing on you I would have I'm watching your reactions if I'd seen fear or suddenly like you're uncomfortable I wouldn't have gone oh well we're going to finish the thing because I want to do the thing and I would check in and go okay do you feel safe or would you like me to release you right now right because in in this way then it's that's that's what I'm talking about in terms of being a top let's say and not that like an authoritarian dom if he's a good one totally he's able"}
