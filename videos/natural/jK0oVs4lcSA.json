I'm on vacation. Yeah, that's a good thing to do. Meeting pretty girls like you. Why not? OK, my name is Erik. I come from Norway. Why I'm here is that I feel I lack in communicating with girls and expressing my desires in a constructive way. Excuse me. Hi. Hi. You look wonderful. Thank you. What's your name? My name is Marta. I'm Erik. I'm impressed. What you can do in that situation, because it might happen a lot, that girls are like, oh, thank you. OK, bye. They're like, thanks, but no. You can be like, oh, before you go. That's the one way to get them back. So by you saying, oh, before you go, it shows, I know you want to go, but just one thing before that. And then you're just like, so where are you from? Are you from here? And then you just get into a conversation a little bit. And then it's kind of this psychological trick of, OK, one question I will answer, and then you try to get into a conversation. But following builds really a strange person. Yeah. Excuse me. Hi. How are you doing? I'm Erik. I don't speak English, so. You speak a little bit of English, though. Little. Little bit, OK. So my name, Erik. My name is Angelica. OK. Angelica, you live here in Barcelona? Yeah. Oh. How long, how long here in Barcelona? The beach. You're heading to the beach? Ah. Now you really tried, which I like, you know. Like, now you actually tried to get to know her. That was the point of this interaction. Exactly. She just spoke really little English. OK. You know. She was into you. Otherwise, she would have, like, she was smiling. Yeah. She just didn't really know what to do. Like, she was charmed, clearly. I would still close in the end, you know. Even if you have the feeling this is going nowhere or whatever, still make that rep of learning how to close people. And with her, just really simple, like, OK, no Spanish number, Google Translate, text, you know, WhatsApp or Instagram, and then just to close it off like that. Excuse me. Hi. I saw you from over there and thought, wow, what a good-looking girl. What's your name? Denise. Denise, I'm Erik. Nice to meet you. So what do you do in Barcelona? I'm living, studying. Really? Yeah. What do you do? I'm on vacation. Yeah. That's a good city for that. Meeting pretty girls like you. Why not? Do you have anything planned for today? Yeah. Just trying to shop. Shall we shop? I'm going to go here. Let's go then. You approached her. You said, oh, what a beautiful girl. You had to come say hi. She was really charmed. OK. A little bit of conversation. She was like, what are you doing here? And then one thing you said was meeting pretty girls like you. What do you do? I'm on vacation. Yeah. That's a good city for that. Meeting pretty girls like you. Yeah. Is that... Why do you say that? Why do you say that? Like, I want to vary from... Like, I'm in a communication course and I didn't know if I said that. No, no, no. I said that I was on vacation. So I kind of want to vary, try different things. To see what works. And I was kind of hesitant saying that, seeing pretty girls. Because then she just thinks, oh, OK, you just do that to everybody. But for some reason it worked. I have a problem with it because it says, you're not special. You are the 10th girl I'm talking to today. And I'm doing this all the time. The opener should give her the feeling of, you're special. I was walking along, I saw you. And then I was just, I couldn't help myself but introduce myself. I had to go out of my routine, out of my plan. To meet you. Like, you're special, let's make something happen. Well, you have to ask some questions. Because then what happened, energy went down. And I felt like, correct me if I'm wrong. You didn't really know what to say. And you're like, oh, you're shopping. OK, let's go then. Do you have anything planned for today? Yeah, just trying to shop. Shall we shop? I'm better off here. Let's go then. When you stop a girl and she stops, never then suggest, oh, let's walk. Because this is way more powerful than us walking next to each other. The reason was, I don't know what to say anymore. So, let's go shopping. Let's kind of continue what we were about to do anyway. I don't really know where to take this to now. Just be OK. Just ask questions. I want you to ask questions and get emotional. Get to know her. Make her be interested. I'm actually interested in a girl. Right now. About the things that I was concerned about before doing this. What I was afraid of was really trying. But being rejected. And being afraid of that feeling, OK, I'm not good enough. But that is not the case anymore. Now I wake up without any tension in my body at all. Not being afraid to approach in any circumstances. And if I were to be rejected. So what? From the first day until now. You know that tension you sometimes have when you think about things. You get in your stomach. And you know that it's something missing in your life. It's something that you have to learn. But you have postponed it for such a long time. And this is a possible thing to loosen it up. And now that tension is gone. And you can't quite set a price on that. Thank you for watching this video.
