I'm not selling something, I just thought you looked really cute. Is that a script? It's my material for my exam. Do you have the exam today? No, it's Friday. Oh, you're studying while you're walking. Walking and studying. Either you're a very good student or a very bad student because you're trying to catch up. Somewhere in between? Mm-hmm. Okay, nice. Cool. And what's your name? My name is... Classic Ukrainian name. Yes, what's your name? James. Oh, where are you from? Where do you think? Maybe... No, a long way away, very far. The other side of the planet. Wow. And what are you doing? Australia. Wow, it's really interesting because I have learned a topic for my English exam about Australia. Oh, really? What did you learn? Oh. About the history or the animals? Geographical position, I don't know, history. We don't really have a history. We have a very short history. Mm-hmm. So, did you like what you learned? Do you like Australians? Do you like me? Yes. Yes. Oh, good. Because you're beautiful. Oh, my God. Oh, thank you. Thank you. Right. And you have a really funky style. I like it. Do you know this word, funky? Mm-hmm. Oh. How would I describe funky? You see, the funk is a living creature about the size of a medicine ball but covered in teats. It means, let's say, cool with your own unique twist. Oh. Yeah. But it also refers to 1970s music. Disco. Like, you know disco? Disco but with a heavier bass beat. It doesn't matter. But what are you doing in Ukraine? I don't know. What does it mean? I'm lost. No. I live in Europe. Like, I lived here last 10 years. But I lived in different places in Hungary and Portugal. And now I have some business here and a lot of my friends live here. And my grandfather was Ukrainian. Oh. Mm-hmm. So coming back to my roots. Mm-hmm. Yeah. But it's a good place now because, you know, everything else is locked. Australia's locked. Europe's locked. So better fun here. Are you working here? Yes. But I have, like, my own business. So I work when I want. So it's like an online business. What is the kind of business? Coaching business. Ah. You know what I mean? Yes. Yeah. Teaching people about communication skills and body language and business skills and other skills that people need. And you're a full-time student? Yes. Mm-hmm. I'm a teacher of English and French. Are you? And Ukrainian, of course. Oh, wow. How do you keep so many languages in one brain? It's, uh... It's not really difficult because I like it. Mm-hmm. I guess that's with most things. If you really enjoy it, you'll learn it. Mm-hmm. Of course. Mm-hmm. Excellent. Cool. Would you like to get a tea with me sometime? I don't really know because I have to study my material, for instance. Yeah. I don't mean now. I mean, like, sometime after your exams. Maybe. Yeah. When you have some time, I have some time. I'm not sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So maybe we can meet next week. So I get your WhatsApp? You look a bit nervous. I have got only Telegram and Instagram. Telegram we can do. Do you have Instagram? Yes. OK. Why do you prefer Instagram? Yeah. So you can stalk me and see what I'm like? I will show you. Not a problem. Not a problem. All right. I will add you. Mrs. Mrs. Are you married? No. You know that Mrs. means you're married. I know. It should be Miss. Miss. Or Mistress. It would be good too. All right. I have followed you. Add me. OK. So. Add me. OK. And you'll need to ask me back because I'm a very private person. OK. I never share anything to the public. So. I have a present for you. OK. I got you. OK. So. I see. Yes. Good luck with your exam. We'll see you soon. All right. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Okay. So. We will see you soon. Later exactly. See you. OK. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Okay. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Anyway, one of the most powerful aspects that of masculinity that a man can project is when there is a little bit of an issue, I'll solve it. There's a vanilla ice song that goes something along the lines of that. I got a problem, I'll solve it. Something, something. The DJ, I'll have to check up on my vanilla ice. You get the idea. Soft note. Step around the objection. Solve the problem. You're good to go. If there was a problem, I'll solve it. Check out the hook while DJ revolves it. The point is, it doesn't matter exactly what you say in the beginning, you know? Wow, she's so hot, I have to talk to her. Hello. You just unknowingly interrupted my video because I had to say hi to you. I'm sorry. I was just filming a video and you interrupted it, but it's not your fault because I wanted to say hi. That's why I interrupted it, because you look really cute. Thank you. What's your name? My name is Alex. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Sorry. What are you doing today? I'm going home. I just finished my last lesson in university. Last? Forever? No, for today. Oh, okay. I was like, congratulations. I'm too young for that. How old are you? Ninety. That is very young. How old are you? What do you think? I hate this question. Me too. Could we just skip it? 27. 27. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 27. Okay. And what kind of video are you? I can't tell you, to be honest. It's a very secret, yeah. Okay. Sorry. I can tell you something else about me. I don't live in Budapest anymore, but I lived here for a while, so I kind of enjoy coming back. I travel a lot, so it's cool to see the city again. I love the city. Where are you from? I'm from Austria. Yeah? Why do you live in Austria? Because I don't really like Austrians so much. Why? Do you like Hungarians? It depends on the single person. In general, they can be a bit negative, right, and a bit complaining. I am negative. You're negative? Yeah. Why? I'm Hungarian. Why would you? You don't seem right now. Yeah. All of the sunshine and smile and, you know. And me? Yeah. Of course. So, it's similar. You know, Austrians are a bit like this as well, so I enjoy, like, Latin culture. I mean, now it's kind of weird, because I live even more east. I live in Ukraine, but I used to live in Central America as well. I don't know. I enjoy the mix of all. Central America? Yeah, Nicaragua. Wow. Where do you want to live? Here, I guess. Actually, I have to be somewhere else, quite far from here, in, like, six minutes. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Actually, I have to be somewhere else, quite far from here, in, like, six minutes. That sounds stressful. Yeah. Okay, so when do we continue this then? I don't know. Do you? Give me your number and I'll text you. Uh. Okay. That's a lot of paper you're carrying around. Yeah. I just bought it from a guy. Do it. Beautiful. Do you have time for coffee tomorrow? Tomorrow. Tomorrow. No. Or Thursday. You can choose. Hmm. Maybe next week? Difficult. I'll text you. What's your name again? Okay. All right. Budapest. Okay. Okay. Hurry up. Now it's five minutes. Okay. Bye-bye. It doesn't matter what you say. Of course, it matters a bit, you know? But don't try to exactly transcribe the openers me or the other coaches here are doing and replicate exactly the words in field. It's about the intention we're putting out. It's about me communicating through my being, through my eyes, through my smile, through my voice, through my words as well. Hey, I want to meet you. You're a cute girl. I'm a cool guy. Let's make something happen. That's the overall theme. The exact words don't matter so much. Hi. What's up? Everything is good. Okay. Cool. Do you mind if I walk with you for a moment? I'm not dangerous or anything. You're not dangerous? No. You believe me? Straight away. Cool. Yeah? What are you looking for here? You mean right now? I was just taking a walk and then I saw you and now I want to talk to you. Where are you from? Australia. What are you doing here? What are you doing here? Everyone says it like that. Huh? Everyone says it like that. Like, what are you doing here? What are you doing here? Yeah, I mean, with a bit of suspicion. I'm living here at the moment. Oh? Yeah. Why? Because Australia is bad? Maybe so, but Australia is locked from the world right now. It's what? Blocked. Like, you cannot come in, cannot go out. It's like North Korea with good beaches. It's a joke. It's a joke. You're supposed to laugh. Ha, ha, ha. There we go. Nice. I've been working on that joke for days. Yeah, so, I mean, I split my time between here and Portugal currently. Yeah. Because I have a lot of friends here. I run some business here. Business? Business. In Ukraine? Well, it's like online business. If it's business in Ukraine, it must be dodgy. Do you know this word? Dodgy? Dodgy? You know this word? Not doggy. No, not doggy. Dodgy, I don't know. Dodgy is like sketchy or... Okay. You don't know that one either? My vocabulary is... It's a colloquial word. I need to figure out how to translate it. Okay. Yeah. What's your name? We can change contacts. Okay. We're going to hang out sometime? Okay. What's your name first? What was... And James? James. James. Okay. Normal white, you know, name. Where are you going now? Shopping. I think I have... I'm going on Thursday to Costa Rica. Really? Yeah. Costa Rica is awesome. So I have to buy a lot of some different stuff. Yeah. Have you been there before? No. It's beautiful. I'll have Ayahuasca trip. If you know what it is. I definitely know what it is. I've done that 40 times. Really? Okay. Yeah, I went to Peru and did like long dieta for like three weeks, taking every night. Yeah. I've seen things. I'm interested to see you when you're back, actually. And find out how your journey was. Why did you just... Are you going by yourself or... Well, you're brave. Fucking nice one. Maybe I'm a bit stupid. Well, I mean, you just look out for... Costa Rica is like safe, cute place. The jungle is like Disney jungle. You can give me your WhatsApp, things better. It's... right? Yeah. Okay, cool. I'll text you now, just so. Just so. So you're going shopping for Ayahuasca. What do you need for that? Panama? How do you say it? Panama hat? Gucci poncho? Bra? Yes. Yeah, you need loose. Loose clothing is good. Swimming. Oh, yeah. Business account. Yeah. What business are you in? It doesn't mean anything. Just business account. Okay, cool. All right. Well, best of luck. Thanks. And when you think... When it feels like it's too much, just relax into it, just let go. Don't fight. Sometimes you need to... Sometimes the best thing to do is take more. Take more? Yeah, like if you've had one cup and you're feeling like half on the edge and it's really not pleasant, have another one and it punches you through to the other side. Okay. That's my advice. Thanks. All right. See you. Have a good day. Right at the beginning of this, there was like a micro-attunement which I had to do, right? So I did my standard Jedi stop and I see blank face, like blank face, a little bit scared, and then she's walking past me. Hi.  Okay, cool. Do you mind if I walk with you for a moment? I'm not dangerous or anything. No? You believe me? Straight away? Cool. Now, this is where I'm making a micro-decision. Sometimes, like, the girl's just giving me a hard, stony face and she's just trying to blank me. I'm sure we got one of those on film. Hi. How you doing? Thank you. That's exactly what I needed. Thank you. Now they know I'm not faking it. In which case, I usually let her go, depending on how resilient or whatever I'm feeling at the moment. But what I'm looking for is the, I'm not sure, maybe, maybe no. That's where most girls are going to sit when you approach them. Some small percentage will be like, hey, it's a guy. I'm going to talk to him. Some will be an arsehole about it or whatever. They can just blank you, which is fine. But most of them are going to exist in that, like, probably not, I don't know what this is, zone. And you need to be ready for that and totally chill with that. Because it's totally understandable, right? You're a stranger. She has no idea who I am, what I'm doing, why I'm approaching her. And so it's understandable her initial reaction is, don't think so. But in that little micro moment, I'm looking and seeing that she is looking at me and she's trying to figure out what's going on. So I just spin on my heels, release the pressure by not staring at her too much, smiling, and allowing her to have some relaxed moments. So then it goes from like, probably not, to within seconds, okay, I'm happy to talk to this guy. So watch for the subtleties. I know sometimes you look at my infill and it's like, he's just saying normal things. Yeah, well, we were talking about tripping on ayahuasca in Costa Rica, so not that one. I'm saying normal things, but it's the way that I say it. It's the in between the lines. It's the pulsing something out, seeing her reaction or response, and then micro adjusting to the needs of the moment. This is where natural game becomes an art as opposed to, hey, I saw you from over there and I thought you were cute. Hi. One second. You look awesome. I love your glasses. You're very powerful. Oh yeah? You are? Sorry, I didn't hear this because I was listening to some music. Okay, I will repeat. I said I loved your walk because it was powerful. Oh, thank you. And your glasses are very fancy, so you seem like an interesting person. Really? Let's find out. Yeah, it just depends on... What's your name? Alex. Hello. Nice to meet you. What are you doing today? Well, I'm going to uni. I have a class, so... What class? I'm studying German. Germanistic. Do you know what it is? I know German. It's a language. So, it is Germanistic. What's the difference? Well, honestly, it is about literature and history, so kind of interesting, at least for me. Kind of. You must convince me more. But it's like you learn about German language, but not the words. You learn how it developed and the history and stuff like that. From a different perspective, I would say. Why do you like that? Well, I like German. Why? Yeah, this is a little bit surprising because not so many people like German. That's why I'm surprised. Yeah, but I don't know why I like it so. My parents worked in Germany for a period of time and maybe somehow. So, yeah. And where are you from? Where I'm from? Yeah. Austria. Austria? Oh, really? I don't believe you. Why not? I don't know. So, you speak German? Yeah. That's why I was surprised why you want to learn German. No, I mean, I get it. You have your personal contact to it if your parents lived in Germany. For me, it's funny because in Austria, people speak like depending what region, they speak like a dialect. And then for me, thinking about my German that I speak with my parents, it's like almost comedic, you know. Like I really love the humor in it and making jokes in it. What kind of humor do you mean? It's almost like, you know, stand-up comedy, what it is. It's almost like we have a very special humor that works really well in stand-up comedy when you use that type of language. And that's funny, but it's almost like not sexual to me. Like not at all, actually. Like it's just funny and quirky, but not sexual, not sexy. Like I love speaking Spanish because it holds, you know, more sex in it. Not sexy. Do you mind if I go to my class? No, you're not allowed. You have to stay forever. Oh, really? We are now together for the rest of the time. Sorry. No, it's fine. It's like animals. They're just, you know, like pigeons. What are the animals who stay together forever? I think it's parrots, dolphins. No, wait. Dolphins fuck a lot. Yeah, maybe. You know what I mean? So I have two cats, but I know they don't stay together. No, they are not loyal at all. They just fuck around. Yeah, they just fuck around. Literally. Are you a loyal person? Well, I think so. I mean, I was told so. You never cheated on somebody? No. Me neither, I think. Do you think? No, not at all. But the reason is I didn't really have a long-term relationship. I had, but it was an open relationship. How old are you? I'm 18. Oh. Is it surprising for you? You seem older, yeah. Not much older, a little older. Really? I mean, what do you think? 22. 22? Oh, really? It's kind of surprising. You seem cool. I want to go on a date with you today, tomorrow, when it's good for you. I think just next week. I leave maybe next week. Budapest is not my hometown. I do not live there. I just live there. From like Monday to Friday you're here and on the weekends. Yeah. Okay, I understand. Maybe you have time for a quick coffee on Thursday. Because after next week I might leave for a project. So I better meet you before. We can talk about it. Okay. Do you have WhatsApp? I don't really use it, so... Is it too private for you? I mean, we can talk on iMessage. Yeah. Do you have an iPhone too? I have an iPhone, yeah. I always get confused with iMessage because I change my SIM card a lot. Oh, I see. But it should work. Yeah. And Messenger? It does work. And I don't like it. Why? It's confusing to me. It's not confusing. Because they update it all the time. You know, I'm here, Messenger. Yeah, that's true. Oh, that's the Messenger. But then I go into Facebook. And then what is all this? It wasn't like this the last time. I don't know. I mean, I don't really use Facebook. I just use it because of Messenger, so... That makes sense. Okay, then let's do Messenger. Okay. Sounds good to me. Oh, you search me. That's easier. Because then I see your name straight away. Can you pronounce my name? Yes. That's kind of good. I say hi. My mom is calling. Okay. That's weird. It means I have to leave, so... Yeah, that's the only reason. I'm going to be late. You're lucky. Okay. Enjoy your day. Thanks. See you. Bye-bye. Thanks? Thanks for what? Excuse me. Hi. You look so dreamy. You're off in your own world? Yes, yes. Is it a nice place? Sometimes. Right now it looked okay. You were sort of, you know, in the moment. Yes. Now I'm in the moment. Oh, good. Me too. We're in the same moment. Okay. Good. I'm not selling anything or trying to convert you to any religions or anything like that. I just thought you looked wonderful and wanted to meet you. Thank you. Nice to meet you, too. What's your name? How would you say it? Right. Just say it's James. Nice. Are you from here? Yes. Nice. And what's going on in life? I'm studying at this place. Uh-huh. Conservatory of singing. Oh, wow. Like an opera singer? Yeah. Are you an alto? What? An alto? Your register. Soprano. Oh, really? Yeah. But you have quite a low speaking voice. Yes. But singing high. What's this? Oh, it's sheet music. Yeah. Uh-huh. My area. Your area. Area. Uh-huh. Well, probably the way you say it. Awesome. Ukrainian. Ukrainian. Okay, cool. And what are you doing now? You're just wandering around in your own world? Go to home. Okay. Cool. Would you like to get a cup of tea with me sometime? Now? Not now, but soon. Sometime? Yeah, sometime. And you, what do you do here? I'm living here at the moment, so I'm from Australia, and I've been living in Europe a long time. I have a farm in Portugal where I spend maybe half my time growing olives, and then I have a business. Well, it's like online business, so I do it wherever I want. A lot of my friends are here now because we all are Australians who are in exile. We had to move from EU to Ukraine. So for this summer, I will be here more or less. That's part of my story. There's a lot more, but that's the general idea. Does that make sense? Can you repeat, please? All of it? Yeah. Because I turned off. Okay, right, right. I'll start again. Yeah. So, do you remember anything? You're from Australia. Yeah, I'll test you. What do you remember? Okay, you are from Australia. Excellent. And you have a farm in Portugal. Right. I don't remember about your friends and how you appear here. Your appearance here. Right. It's two... Two out of five. Not bad. Yeah, basically because a lot of my friends are from England or from Australia. We were working in Europe, but then we ran out of visa, so we must go in exile. You know this word, exile? No, I don't. Do you know your Napoleonic history? So, when Napoleon was finally deposed, he was sent to an island, the Isle of Elba. This is called exile. Okay. Right. So, we are in exile where we must leave Europe and come to Ukraine, because it's not in the EU, for some three months or so, and now we are here. Does that make sense? Yes. Good. Story checks out. And you have a job in here. Yeah, I have my own business, so I'm not like working... I work wherever I want, so it's online. Freelance? Something like that. It's an online business, so I can do it anywhere I want. But I don't work that much. Like, I work very hard short periods and then I spend most of my time traveling, learning martial arts and growing trees and many, many adventures. That's cool. Yeah, it's fun. Sometimes it's a little bit disjointed, like, because I move so much, so it can be a bit confusing, so I have to stay centered. But it's a good life. Tell me your name again. Sorry, I forgot. That's right. And mine? James. Yes, you win. You win. Alright, I pay for the tea. Correct. Okay, let me get your WhatsApp or something. Okay, WhatsApp. Mm-hmm. You have a really nice, gentle energy. Yeah? And clear eyes. Oh, thank you. I know my eyes don't look clear, I didn't sleep so much. I think it's clear, too. So, my number, yes? Yes. Well, you can maybe type it in. Hey, I just met you and this is crazy, but here's my number. You know this song? I do. I'm surprised an opera singer chose that one. Is there an aria that they talk about? No, no, no. That one's appropriate, okay. Alright, you can type your number. Okay. Yes. Maybe I'll text you now. And you can send me, like, hi. I can do that, yes. Yes, I can do that. Done. Got it? Yeah. Okay. Well, I'm going to go for a walk to the park, I think. This is my day off today, so I will relax. Nice day to you. Nice day to you, too. You're lovely. I'll see you soon. Thank you very much. Bye. Hey, gentlemen. I hope you enjoyed that little trip down Approach Memory Lane from some of our fun approaches during the year. And that's pretty much it for TNL for 2021. I hope you had a good Christmas. It was an epic, challenging, unique year for us at The Natural Lifestyles. Still managed to travel the world, teaching hundreds of guys the arts of natural style seduction and loving yourself, pretty much. So, I'm off for a little break, and I'm actually going back to Australia in a couple of days, believe it or not. I haven't been there in two years, and there is a little window where I can get in. So, hopefully, I'll be able to get out again, but that's going to be an odd experience. Going back home, mate. Going back to your own country. And then I'll be back in Europe in 2022, and we'll be doing it again. So, if you'd like to join myself and The Natural Lifestyles team for one of our live workshops, we start up again in April and May, and then we hit it hard through the summer. So, we'll be having workshops in Budapest, Barcelona, Kiev. I'll put some dates on the screen. So, you can join us for the real thing. So, if you guys have enjoyed the content throughout the year and you want to actually go out there and make it happen and speed it up exponentially by having experts at your side,"}
