So I'm going to first tell the story and then at the end of this video I'm going to tell you the three most important lessons I learned on that journey. So watch the whole video until the end. Like most young guys in their teens I wanted to have more women in my life and by more women I meant I wanted to lose my virginity eventually. This was not easy because from Monday to Friday between the age of 15 and 20 I was in an all boys boarding school every week. I did have some girls in my actual school in my class but first of all obviously the girls who you know go to like a higher technical school like I went to. They're not really the ones you want to date and it's not really the place to hook up anyway with your classmates. So what's left was the weekend where I drove home to my little farm town you know far away from any club scene or any big city life and there I was. To be honest I never felt comfortable there. I was bullied in primary school so I was feeling actually really comfortable in my new high school apart from the whole women part but I had a good time reinventing myself as a dude there. So home Saturday Sunday I was at home with my parents mostly spending time playing online poker, learning how to program, doing my homework or just nerding around on the internet. I didn't really go out at all at 15, 16, 17. Now when I turned 18 I was getting increasingly not only frustrated but kind of like stressed because I was still a virgin and I was like all right I need a game plan. I need to go out more. I need to meet ladies. So here was my game plan. Pre-drinks, go to the club, after party. Right that's what everybody did these days. So by pre-drinks obviously I mean some social environment where guys and girls meet before they go out which often is kind of the more relaxed environment anyway because you're not stressed by the pounding music. You don't have to buy drinks you know. You can kind of sit where you want. You can relax. You can play card games or other stupid drinking games and it's actually more relaxing than going to the club. But to get to those kind of pre-drinks where there's girls also you had to know the scene. You had to know the right guy. I was super lucky because I met one really friendly guy in a poker forum. In an international poker forum who ended up being that he lived in my little town which was amazing. So he was super friendly and he was connected to the guy who did organize those pre-drinks back then. You know and this is now over 10 years ago. So here I was you know at those pre-drinks. I was still quite shy and you know there was girls there. Most of them have boyfriends anyway and basically the strategy there is just get really hammered play games and then go to the pub. Obviously you don't make moves there. I was way too shy anyway. Alright then you ended up at the club slash pub and it's not you can't really call it a club. Where I grew up there's basically two or three little like pub slash bars capacity between 25 and 80 people per venue. So that's how you can imagine it. Maybe you live the same way. I don't know if you can relate but you arrive there and instantly it's super stressful. You know you show up with your bros okay they got drinks and then you stand there like an idiot. First of all I didn't have any money so I didn't want to spend too much money on drinks anyway. Second of all impossible to approach you know crippling social anxiety. The only girls you could approach are either people you've seen before so it would be super awkward or there are people who know people who you've seen before and you don't want to ruin your reputation. On top of that as I said I was bullied a bit in like primary so I didn't want to you know ruin or double ruin my reputation trying to approach a girl and failing. That was not an option at all. So basically those couple hours in the club or pub were always super stressful. The only dopamine spikes you kind of get standing there like an idiot is some guy who you know walks in and he's kind of friendly luckily and you're like hey bro I'm sure you guys know that feeling so that's like the only thing that makes you feel like you belong a little bit and it makes you feel a little bit good because here are you with your tribe and you know your buddy's obviously also not approaching. That one guy actually was a little bit and I was always like wow if I can be one day like him that would be cool. Then you just hope that eventually the leader of the group who organizes the pre-drink says all right let's go and you follow him home for like the after party and what is the after party? It basically is a time where you sit there and trying to somehow engage a girl because now everybody's drunk and the mood is kind of fun and easy. The hot girls obviously went home by then you know the hot girls always go home at 1 or 2 a.m and you're trying to make a connection somehow with one of the girls who's left. So you're there at the after party hoping for something to happen you don't really have a game plan you basically just hope that one girl is drunk and horny and leans on to you and you know 50% of that whole going out thing of like you know getting ready going to the pre-drinks smashing beer into yourself getting really hammered paying entry at a club staying up all night there is to make maybe 2% progress with one girl you know that you've met two weeks before and you hope she's going to be there again and then the other 50% is like that wishful thinking that fantasy of maybe today is the night where I'll you know make a move or where I have the courage to meet someone outside of my immediate social circle let's just walk up to someone and open it can't be that hard right I've seen it before so kind of that fantasy that motivation keeps you coming back as well it's almost like being a drug addict and you hope maybe maybe tonight I get some and the overall emotion with all that thing which you know has been going on for maybe one or two years in my teens like around 18 19 the overall emotion has been it's not for me I don't belong here I don't know what I'm doing here this is ridiculous you know like how is this the best part of my week why am I wasting time here and at the flip side of that is I had no idea what is the alternative what else could I be doing it was this paradox of this is clearly not for me and I don't belong here but this is the best I got and I guess that's the call cards I've been dealt and so I have to deal with that and make the best of it that was just so depressing and I didn't really see a way out back then the other problem I saw with this whole setup was basically you work on a girl over and over you try to you know meet basically the same type of girls because they're in your little bubble and that's what you end up with if she likes you so it's basically if the girl accepts the guy you know if the girl is already into the guy then something will happen and a relationship will maybe come out of it and if not you have to try with another one and that's it you cannot date outside that little bubble and that's ridiculous I think you know I already knew that's insane that's crazy I don't want to live like that even to this day I coach a lot of guys who ended up with their like first girl they had sex with or the first girl they had sex with more than two times or they just ended up with and they've dated that girl for years and years and years and then that feeling came crippling slowly of like what the fuck why why did I agree to that you know why did I sign such a contract with myself and it takes them years to break up and to really go like no there must be more out there so that all changed when I read the book The Game by Neil Strauss which probably a lot of you guys know about it really gave me hope it was a time when I was like oh my god you can like learn this shit you can learn this like a skill in school and you can get better at it like it's not just like here is your cards and you know play with it you can get a whole new deck you can shuffle again and you can improve your skills at the poker table so to say that resonated so much with me and it really gave me hope it gave me a vision out of this box that I was trapped in so I started trying stuff out you know there was this book there was kind of those guidelines in there and I started to try stuff I was really lucky because I was in a totally new environment then I've been doing my social circle in Nicaragua at the time I was reading that book so being in this new environment gave me permission to be someone else it gave me permission to even be a little bit weird to try things there was always tourists in that city as well so that is the part of you know not being picked at by girls that you approached a week before or being afraid that your high school bully sees you and makes fun of you so that was really great and I tried it all I tried peacocking I put like feathers in my ears and I had like three watches and a lock around my neck and weird hair bands I always had a deck of cards with me I watched youtube videos on how to do card tricks I learned different like conversation techniques I learned different touch techniques so I've done all that and you know I literally there was a time where I went to the club like five times a week which was kind of insane because every time I went out I was still heavily relying on alcohol so I would there were times where I would drink like 10 beers and like a half a bottle of rum shout out to tonia beer and flor de ca\u00f1a rum it's like so ridiculously cheap there anyway um sometimes it actually worked you know that's why what's so kind of intoxicating about this whole like pickup stuff it works sometimes of course it works with the girls who are really already into you who already decided this guy's kind of cute yeah whatever he's waffling there yeah he's dressed a bit weird but at least he said hi and uh those are the girls I sometimes ended up making out with at the end of the night it was never really hot girls of course it was never the ones who were around you know other cool guys or other cool girls I was always like the ones who already gave me eyes and I finally had the courage to do something about that so that was cool but of course I didn't get really the girls I wanted when I tried it with a really hot girl it failed miserably because they just saw this guy's wearing a mask he's doing some weird trick he's not being himself and you know if there's one thing that uh really attractive women resonate to a lot and really it's you being real you being authentic you're not wearing a mask you're being totally confident in your masculinity and not bullshitting them because they're being bullshit all day so they really appreciate a guy who's like straight honest open and real and I wasn't back then I was playing literally card tricks to even open up a conversation and alcohol was involved a lot right so I knew okay this is uh at least a step up this feels better but it's still not me so back in Vienna I tried to you know keep the momentum going kept going out at night slowly spent all my money because obviously suddenly it wasn't as cheap anymore and I should have finally gotten a job but I still really wanted to you know get results with the ladies at the same time I was aware of like RST real social dynamics who were really good at like creating events in cities right they had their free talks and a lot of people would show up so I was like okay might be a cool opportunity to meet some other guys who also want to improve in this and so I did go to one of those talks I remember it was weird because there was like 200 people or more in the room and the speaker I don't remember it was a Julian RST Max someone like there he really like managed the crowd really well there were great speakers and the audience was like screaming and growling and jumping off their seats and like you know the speaker would make some condescending joke about women and how he I don't know manipulated her and everybody was like laughing and I was like damn I was it was a bit depressing because I was like fuck do I have to become like that to have success with women you know because obviously I mean the speaker knows what he's talking about right and and the audience is like yay and I was you know and all the way in the back in the last row leaning against the wall and I again didn't belong I felt like this is not for me and I don't wanna I don't want this I don't want to be like this to to have a connection with women and to be intimate with someone you know I it's not myself I don't want to wear a mask I've been trying that already didn't get me the results I wanted so I knew again this is not for me and there's something else out there but I didn't know yet what it was also ask myself is that really what women want like do they want to have some guys like screaming around and dancing and you know puffs his chest out and like makes bold claims and like necks her and does all the push and pull and like really that's what works I was quite critical about that so I had to dig deeper I was again googling researching and I wanted to find a more natural way right which led me to the natural lifestyles and James Marshall's speech the three pillars of natural seduction I can link it here amazing speech it blew my mind I literally was like midway through I called my friend I was like Dominic Dominic I found something I think you will love it as well and it really gave me hope it was eye-opening it was a relief it was like a weight off my shoulders I was like thinking oh my god I can be low-end energy, I can be introverted, I can be myself, and I can talk from that whole energy and still girls gonna like me, and they're gonna go on dates with me, and I can have sex with them, without all those tricks, and lines I learned, and all the card tricks I did, and all that stress. And the best part, I can do it during the day, while the sun is up, on the street, without getting drunk, and standing in line for an hour to get into the club, and without the need of my buddies behind me to feel proud, and strong, and other girls around me to show status, I can just literally just say hi to a girl on the street, like it was mind bending. No more pick up lines, no more peacocking, no more alpha bullshit nagging, and no more getting drunk, and staying up till six in the morning. So, I was hooked, I knew this is the way, and I was really excited to try it out. So, as accepted, my buddy really loved the concept as well, and you know, the hacker he was, he quickly found a 30 day, day game approaching challenge. He downloaded it off torrent or something, and all I remembered was like 30 audio files, and you were allowed to listen to only one file per day in sequence, so day one, day two, day three, and you were not allowed to skip a day, and it was a little challenge every day, right? So, it started super easy, the point was obviously to overcome your approach anxiety, because still, at that time, the thought of approaching a girl on the street was like the most terrifying thing I could ever, ever imagine, you know? And at that time, I traveled alone to Nicaragua, I was in China, in like crazy villages, I got robbed in Nicaragua, I was, you know, I had knives on my neck, I did like, traveled alone with my backpack for three countries in different buses and trains, I met different people, and still, saying hi to a girl was like impossible. So, day one of that challenge, the thing was say hi to 10 people, all right, check, next day, it was ask for the time 10 times, all right, check, did that. Day three, got harder, you have to ask for direction three times. Okay, still indirect stuff, you know, you still don't really have to like show your intention of I'm a guy, you're a girl, I wanna date you, or something like that. And you still didn't really have to engage with people, you're basically literally just asking for information. Day four, got a little more difficult, which was give 10 people a compliment. And that was the last day I did, and failed, I did like one, I told one guy he had a nice hat in passing. That was it, I couldn't do more, I gave up, you know, the next day I tried again, walked around hours and hours, you know, got a lot of steps into my health app and iPhone, but that was pretty much it. Again, I was frustrated, I was like, fuck, why is this so hard, what is wrong with me? You know, what is it about me, my brain, the way I grew up, the barriers in my thinking, and so on, it was so frustrating to, needing to understand and accept that I am that way. I knew I could get better, because I kind of proved to myself, at least I made many steps before, but I think the most important part was admitting to myself that I cannot figure it out by myself, that I need help, and that I need support, and I need somebody to mentor me. Now, that last part, admitting to myself that I cannot figure it out by myself, took me like many months, and like looking back, what a crazy waste of time, like literally making that one little shift of, let's get help, let's have somebody, you know, coach me, wasted half a year of my life, and half a year compared to what I'm hearing now on the phone talking to guys about a workshop isn't even that much. Every day I talk to guys who wanna do workshops, or wanna work with me, or wanna do online or live training, right? Especially about approaching, meeting more women, lifestyle design, and I often ask them, like how long you've been either watching our videos, how long has this been a problem, how long have you not been taking action? And the guys regularly say things like three years, four years, five years, or I was in a relationship for eight years, but it should've ended seven years ago. Insane time spans, like it's insane, like you're in your 20s, you're in your 30s, you're in your 40s, each of those blocks is like a three times three year block, or a two times five year block that you wasted. Like it's insane, take action, please. So finally, for myself, I made the decision I need help, and I made the conclusion, well obviously there's guys out there who did figure it out, you know, there's people putting videos online of doing day game approaches, getting numbers, the content is out there, clearly they haven't just been born with it, they picked it up somehow, and it seems like they're running successful businesses in teaching other people how to do it, probably I should get in touch with them. So that's what I did, I booked a call, you know, for a TNL website, and I wanted to go on a workshop, and well, long story short, I couldn't afford it. I was like 22 at the time, I was barely getting by on my Starbucks wage, still in uni, totally broke, spent all my money before, and I just couldn't do it. You know, since then, I've spent like 50, 60,000 euros, at least, on personal development, and gaining new skills, and buying myself into several social circles, and learning about that there, and paying mentors. But back then, I was 22, I had a lot of skills, you know, I knew things, and I was motivated, I had a lot of time, but I had no money. So obviously, that was a little bit disappointing, you know, realizing that I just don't have the funds to come on a workshop, and that I wouldn't for a while, because I just didn't have a job back then, but I knew this is what I wanted, this is the path, finally something that really suits me, so I didn't give up, I offered my skills, I realized, hey, I am good, or at least okay, at photography, I had a camera, I can put that to use, I can edit videos, I've done it before, I have a premier license, I know how to make websites, I understand a little bit about marketing, I've been doing two or three websites for other companies before, and I have time, and the best part of it, I know how to learn new skills really fast, and I guess because I'm Austrian, and because I'm diligent, and I'm a perfectionist, I am able to deliver things at a level that our professionals expect it. So, I put all that in a good pitch, and explained why I'm the man, together with my buddy Dominic and sent that over different emails to James. At the beginning it failed, but I didn't give up, and finally I got an answer, I got the chance to do a photo shoot for the TNL team. You know, it was really short notice, I didn't know how to run a studio photography shoot back then, so I did what I knew how to do, is how to Google, and how to find things on the internet, how to do shit, and that's what I did. I drove to Budapest, and I guess it was like, right time, right place, right pitch, and good delivery. To be honest, I'm not in a position where guys want to work for me. Also, I've been managing applications for James for many years, and most of the pitches and suggestions and offers of guys who want to work for us, they're just really bad, you know? Literally guys are like, hey, let's meet up and talk about something, or let's meet up for a coffee, or hey, I want to work for free. Even that sounds cool, but it's like, if somebody wants to work for free, you make it my job of finding out what you could even do, where I would use you, what skills you even have, are those skills any good, if yes, are you gonna deliver on a good level, what else you got going on, like, now you give me another job, which is onboarding you, right? And onboarding is not an easy task. So, I didn't do that, I delivered really well, and what followed was like six months of me going to Budapest a lot, right? The deal was my time for your coaching, and it was a lot of my time for a little coaching, so I had to go many times to kinda add up hours to get some coaching at the end of it. But it wasn't even about the coaching, to be honest, it was being in that environment. So for the next half year, every week, almost every week, I was in Budapest, which meant I got to spend time with the team, I got to look at them approach, right? And I got to be pushed by them to do something that before was so weird to everyone else, and weird to me, and it didn't feel right. And suddenly I was in an environment where I was encouraged, and it's normal, and it's cool, and why would you not do it? You know, you're a man, there's a beautiful woman, of course, go up to her, like, what are you doing? Go, let's go, you know, how was it? Oh, she didn't say anything, oh, cool, do the next one. You know, it was such an engaging and encouraging environment that made it really click finally, and made it not easy, but possible, right? So that was a great time, that was super exciting. One of the best times in my life, I would say, because I really, for the first time in my life, felt like I found an environment where I belong into. And that was liberating, and it made me feel so good. So here are three lessons I learned along this, sometimes cruel, but sometimes super beautiful journey. The first one is that day game is really powerful. It really gives you an edge over a lot of other things. Because, if you think about it, you know, you going to the club, trying things there, you're doing what everybody else does. You swiping on Tinder, you're using like 1% of your masculinity to get girls, and you're relying on five good photos that you maybe hired a photographer for, even a Photoshopped, or, you know, basically relying on genetic lottery plus Photoshop skills. For you to be even starting out with day game, you have to be at a certain level of confidence, at a certain level of not giving a fuck, and at a certain level of just inner peace. And also, you're putting yourself out there during the day, you know, bright sunlight, without alcohol, and you have to be real and honest with girls. And if you can do that, girls really appreciate that. And if you do that, as I said, you have to have a certain level of confidence about you. Girls make the assumption of, oh my God, you know, this guy is so confident, he's just approaching girls on the street. If you do it in a calibrated way, which you can learn pretty fast, especially with coaches, girls will be shocked, and they will be charmed, and they will really appreciate it. And they will think that there's all those other girls that you're dating, that you're seducing, that you're flirting with, and believe it or not, that is really attractive to girls. That kind of communicated sense of abundance, you know, that they assume, it might not even be true, but it really gives you an edge over a lot of other guys, and makes the girl really attracted to you. There is a funny story that my friend Liam told me of a guy that he coached when the guy was like 19. He was a virgin back then, and he spent like all his scholarship money on coaching. He was like, I need to stop being a virgin, I need to figure this out, take him out of the way. I guess he was a little bit as crazy as I was back then. So he did coaching with Liam, and you know, they started going, they did some social freedom drills. So he approached a girl, finally did one of his first type of approaches, where he really like stops the girl, he, you know, gets her attention, he gives her a compliment, he gets into a conversation, and so on. The girl was super charmed, he loved it, she liked it. They ended up exchanging numbers, they ended up going on a date, they ended up, I think, on a rooftop, under the stars, and he said some like romantic line, and she started to kiss him, they ended up having sex. So that was his first time, that was the first time he had sex, was from one of his very first day game approaches. And right after they had sex, the girl is like, all right, I wanna ask you a question. How many girls did you sleep with? And he was like, well, one, you. And she was like, yeah, okay, haha, very funny. But come on, tell me. And he's like, no, I'm serious. It's like, you're my first, I was a virgin. And he's like, very kind of you, you know, you're a gentleman, you don't wanna hurt my feelings, but don't worry, you know, I know you're really smooth, and you approach me in such a cool way. I just wanna know, like, what's the numbers? Like 10, 20, 30, 50, 100? And he's like, no, it's like, it's less than 10. And she's like, nah, come on, it's for sure more than 10. And then he just got annoyed, and he said, like, 13 at the end, just so she would stop asking him. Because everything I just said, you know, she really assumed, well, a guy who has the balls to approach a girl on the street clearly overcame certain, you know, anxieties, and therefore is attractive to other girls and gets laid. So it really gives you an edge over so many other things. So that's the magic of approaching on the street. It's the magic of day game, that even if you're a little nervous, you know, the girl really respects you. You can create a whole new identity around you in that sense. Every time you talk to a girl, you're a new person. Some girls won't stop, right? But the ones who do, they see you as a warrior. They respect you on a level that other people never respected you in your life. And as I said, even if you're nervous, they give you a chance because they don't, you know, people are afraid of that. They don't think, ah, he's nervous. They're like, wow, he's nervous, because this is hard. I know how hard it is. And he's still doing it. Oh my God, this guy is cool. I want to give him a chance. I want to see who he is that made him decide to even, you know, pull that off. So there really is a magic in that. And if you have been hesitating,"}
