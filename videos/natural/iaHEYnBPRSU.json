Should I make him wait or good girls don't do that kind of thing or any of that stuff that she might have to think about in general or with other partners. With me, forget about it. Just be your slutty self. So now we can look at what would be considered to be nasty words, right? Calling women nasty names in bed. Now what I've kind of discovered is that there is a grade of these words, right? I'm not going to just take a big risk and just throw out dirty whore to a chick that I have no idea how she's going to respond to those, to that phrase. Because of course, uh, many women are going to have triggers around particularly words like bitch, slut and whore that, you know, they don't want to be called those words in a real context or by a man that doesn't respect them. Uh, you know, because those words are often weaponized to hurt women, right? It's rare that you hear a man saying in a sweet, endearing tone that she's such a great whore, right? It's usually designed to shame, uh, and to punish, not in a good way, uh, to damage the woman's reputation, to try and take power over her, right? So these words have inherent charges in them, which is their negative and their positive, uh, characteristics is that the fact that it has such a powerful charge means that there is emotion embedded within it, let's say. And so if I can use that word or some of these nastier words in such a way that the woman like she feels safe and she knows that I don't really think she's a dirty whore, right? I'm not, I'm not actually shaming and judging her. It's just play. All right. I'm just calling her a, you know, my cute little slut or my dirty little slut or whatever it is I'm calling her for theater, right? So she gets to play with feeling like, like she can be a slut, whatever that means to her, or be a whore, be a wild bitch, or be a naughty little brat or whatever it is. In this space while we're having sex, knowing that when that's finished, the scene's over, there's no residual consequences, right? It's not that now I'm, I look at her differently and I'm like, well, she let me do that. What a filthy slut. You know, that I actually shame and judge her because that's where, you know, she's going to accrue damage from the sexual experience and not want to do it again. She's going to feel like she was taken advantage of or the guy didn't treat her with respect, right? Because you can absolutely call a woman the foulest words in your language and it'd be extremely respectful, right? That it is because it is done in context. I don't, you know, like when I'm with my girlfriend, I don't call her bitch, slut, whore randomly around the house. But when I've had girlfriends, many of them like to have those words applied to them in play and often by, and often softened by the use of, um, ownership words, right? So if I say you slut, that's just saying you're a slut, right? If I say you're my little slut, that's a very different feel, right? So you're dirty whore or you're my dirty whore. Very different because one is like, you're a whore to everyone. You're a slut to the world. The other one is for me, that's when you become a slut or a whore. And whatever that means to the woman exactly, it doesn't mean she goes and sells sex on the street necessarily or that she has sex with every man who looks her on the street. It's that the sluttiness within her, which is the desire to be complete, to be wild and sexual without, you know, thinking about should I wait three dates or you know, what does everyone think of me or you know, should I make him wait or, or good girls don't do that kind of thing or any of that stuff that she might have to think about in general or with other partners. With me, forget about it. Just be your slutty self, right? And I don't judge you for that. In fact, I encourage that and I applaud that, right? So that's, that's the kind of vibe behind us delivering nasty words to a woman and check yourself on this, right? Like if you actually have resentment or hatred towards women or a woman or a woman or particular women and you find yourself in physical situations with them where you end up like wanting to say that as a weapon, don't do it. Don't do it because if you do, then you're going to be causing harm, right? So obviously if we're using, the more we're moving into extreme types of sexuality, whether that's through our intent, our verbal delivery or what it is that we're doing physically, then our potential for harm increases, right? If we're just having very slow vanilla sex and no one's really in command, no one's sub, no one's dom and uh, we never go beyond, you know, two pumps per second or something like that, then okay, we're not, when we're unlikely to cause any damage, probably unlikely to cause too much excitement either, but okay, so as we step into more extreme positions or more, uh, powerful positions where we have more authority, more dominance, our responsibility increases, right? So if you're taking a woman into a sub space or into a fantasy space where we're playing with our archetypes, playing with these subconscious aspects of our sexuality and our personalities, then you've got to be a little careful because we're dealing with real stuff, right? We're dealing with people's deeper emotions and their, sometimes their insecurities or their latent fantasies, which can be mixed in with shame and guilt and fear and so on. And you can easily put a woman in a really exposed, vulnerable position and then make her feel really ashamed about it, right? And you might, you might not even mean to do that. It might just be because you didn't do proper aftercare. You know, you had a really intense scene with her and then, you know, you went off and had a shower and you made yourself a cup of tea and you came back in and she feels all exposed and vulnerable because she needed to be cuddled for some minutes afterwards, right? So she might feel like that was kind of abusive or that she was taken advantage of or just kind of used for your pleasure and then not really respected or dealt with afterwards. Like there's been times where I've been in a play session where, you know, I've thrown out some testing in terms of the types of nasty words she might like and she, and I got good responses and maybe I go really nasty and hard. And afterwards, a couple of times I thought, I'm going to check in with her just so she knows that was for fun, right? And so I've said things like, hey, that was so fucking hot what we just did. You know, when I call you a nasty words like a slut, it's just play, right? You know, it's not real. And I mean, I've done that two or three times and every time the girl said, yeah, I know, I know, but better to check in than not, right? So if you get a sense that you guys went really deep and hard and nasty and afterwards, you're not sure, was that resolved? Did we seal that off and we finished that scene and you know, any emotional threads that were there have been tied up and we're like, cool, that's over. And we moved on with things or does she have something residual or maybe you do where you just don't, you feel a bit weird about it or she feels a bit weird or she wasn't sure. It's like, is he really being cruel to me or was that just fun? Better to just have that little phrase, have that little conversation with her because then she knows like, oh, when I'm with, when I'm doing that stuff with him, you know, we can call each other whatever. He can call me the nastiest names in his language, uh, with absolute ferocity, with a look in his eye, like he wants to kill me and it's all a game, right? And then, then we can enjoy the fun of the game, you know, then she can enjoy being the victim or being hunted or being ordered around or being used in a really good way for the man's pleasure and vice versa. And then, you know, it's sealed off and we finished the game and we're back to being our, you know, respectful couple that values each other as human beings, not just as fuck toys. Cool. Then it's going to have a really, really powerful effect. So when I'm first introducing naughty, nasty words to a girl, I grade them like this. So you could think of them as like, uh, an escalation ladder of nasty words. So the first ones that I'm going to be using, uh, these using these words, naughty, bad, horny, right? Pretty much something like that. So of course I need to add something to that. So I'm like, if I say, oh, my naughty girl, or you're such a horny, horny little girl, right? Or bad girl, you know, or you've been bad and you need to be punished, right? So these are pretty soft, right? It's not, it's not an insult. It's not really nasty. So I'm just calling her nasty, naughty, horny, dirty, you know, these, these kinds of adjectives which, uh, imply the dirty talk and the nastiness of the sex without giving her a label that says you are a bitch or whatever it is, right? So I test those ones out first and usually the response is really good, right? So I bend her over so it, and that would be often done as a reward, bend her over and like take her hair and pull her back and I go, my naughty little girl, you need to be punished. Right? Or, you know, my sexy little thing, my pretty little, uh, nasty chick or whatever, right? So I'm using these softer, semi-charged words as tests and then I see, okay, she, she gives me like eyes or she like purrs or she says, yes, I'm in that, or she says, no, I'm not that, right? You've been a, you're a bad little girl. No, I'm not. Means that's not her saying, don't call me bad. That's rude. It's like, I'm pretending I'm not a bad girl, but I really am a bad girl, but I'm also a nice girl and that's part of the role play. All right, cool. So we can start with those, chuck them out, test, note. Sometimes you know, girl gives nothing back and it might be a sign she just doesn't like talking in bed at all. Okay. Some girls like that. They don't want to talk. You throw out a few tests, you get silence in return. Okay. Maybe forget about it except in terms of, I'll never forget vocal commands. Even if she's not very communicative, I still need to be able to tell her what to do, where to go, how to do things and to give her awards. So at the base, I will still have those. I might not do them as often. I might use them when it's more particularly important that, uh, you know, I'm to reposition her for example, like I'm behind her and then I pull out and then I sit down and I say, sit on my cock, right? Instead of trying to like silently move her to show which position I want her to do, it's like get on top of me or sit on my cock. Very simple. It's not really dirty talk. It's not a dialogue. It's a, it's a command that's going to make the sex better and then I give her an indication that I like that. Ah, that's it. Or just a moan or something. Okay, cool. Still has this basically the same effect. It's just that you're noting that this girl isn't very talkative in bed. Fair enough. Another one will be. Now moving up that escalation ladder of nasty words. So we have our dirty, horny, nasty, naughty adjectives. The next level up would be the word bitch. Now in some, like in Eastern Europe, often when you hear the word bitch, people interpret that as prostitute, right? So I've called girls my sexy bitch, for example, uh, in another country and that's really, really hot. And then I've done that in Ukraine and I've had girls say, I'm not bitch, I'm slut or something like that. Where it's like, I'm not a prostitute and that's what bitch means to them, right? So, okay. So you might need to be aware of what does the word mean to people. But in general, bitch, uh, what does it mean? You know, it can just mean a sassy, naughty, sexy girl, right? And that's an, or it could be a real insult, right? You fucking bitch. Okay. I'm might be weaponizing it in a situation has a very different meaning. So it has inherent charge cause it can be used as a weapon. But when I'm using it in a more playful or fun way, then it has a sexy effect. So usually what I do when I'm starting to move into these harder words, bitch, slut, whore, for example. So it's like, bitch is level two, level three would be slut and level four would be whore or, or any other like really vulgar identifying phrase like fuck toy or fuck hole or cum dumpster or something like that. Right? Like those are quite vulgar phrases. And uh, I do use those sometimes, but that's when I, you, I wait till that's where we're in a really nasty state together. Like where it is all about holes and cocks and bits of meat, right? Then I might call her my little fuck hole or that's my sexy cum dumpster or something. Yeah. Okay. I might do that sometimes, but you can see how that's a big, way bigger jump from my naughty girl. Right? So in this way, you don't just throw out the most extreme thing hoping for a home run because the girl could just, it could be the end of it. She's like, what did you just call me? Or just feel really insulted cause it's so out of context. So out of, out of, it doesn't make sense yet in the play or maybe it never would make sense in the play. So you're aware of those levels. But the interesting thing we can start to do with these words is we can soften or intensify them depending on how we combine them. Right? So if I just say bitch to a girl, I mean that would be kind of odd, right? But if I said my bitch, that's better. If I said my sexy bitch, that's a good one. Like I've, I use that a lot as a, like as my test to kind of move into the next grades, right? So I've gone naughty little girl, something, something a little bit later and she's, I'm getting her to dance for me or she's riding my dick or something like, fuck you sexy bitch. That's clearly not an insult, right? That's clearly whatever sexy bitch is, it's a good thing. And she gets to feel like a sexy bitch, whatever that means to her. Okay. Now I can, I can, I can even soften this much more by saying my little bitch or my cute little, right? Or my pretty little, right? So using these endearing softening terms means you can create this kind of mixed messages thing. So if I, if I use the word slut, for example, I say my perfect princess slut, right? Or my little angel slut, I'm mixing the really soft word angel and the really hard word slut. And so it has a kind of cuter feel to it, right? So I can, I can shave the edges off the harshness and make it much more of a private cute thing between the two of us. And when I add the word my or mine, right? So she, in this, she's only my slut. She's not anyone else's. Fuck them. And with me, you're my angel little whore, right? My little anal princess, yeah, or my, um, my adorable sweet whore, yeah, or my perfect fuck toy. All right. So all of those, like I would, I would recommend using those types of things much more often than I would you dirty whore, right? You fucking slut. Like be rare, it would be rare for me to go that hard. That would, I would usually only do that if we're in like a harsh role play of like where she's playing a prostitute, for example, um, or where she said things like, use me or do what you want with me or like when I've, I've thrown something, I'm like, you're such a little slut. She's like, yes, I'm your slut. Right? Like, and some girls love to do that. They respond immediately. They throw it back and they want to hear the words and they want to say to them, yes, I'm his slut. I'm your slut. I belong to you. I'm all yours. Right? Like this belonging to the man thing again is, is all related to this, like to her self-esteem, right? If I belong to a man and it's not like, you know, obviously she's free, she's not my slave, but she's choosing to feel like she belongs to me for this night, week, month, whatever. Why would a woman with a good self-esteem and who's attractive and have lots of options belong to somebody? Because he's a good owner, right? He treats her well. He makes her feel awesome in all the ways that a woman wants to feel awesome, right? So then being belonging to that man Makes her valuable It's like this man is my owner. He he looks after me. He treat he treats me. Well, he uses me He fucks the shit out of me. He makes me feel like a sexy whore little pumpkin princess anal Queen or whatever it is and And That's a really beautiful actually really like intimate beautiful dynamic, right? Because you could step into a scene like that just you know, imagine you walked in and someone's there like you filthy little fuckhole I'm gonna use all your holes and fill you up with my cum you dirty little slut and you love it And you might want to call the cops or go. That's not a very nice thing to say to a lady and It wouldn't be in some contexts and in others where we're both in that zone where she's like, I'm a fucktire use me Whatever. My holes are yours Then calling her those things like I say it sometimes say things like that's what you're for or you're only for fucking right? Give me your holes. That's what you're for, right? So it's like in that moment. She only exists as a sex object and think about it Like if you're having sex, why wouldn't you be a sex object? Why would you not want to be a sex object? Would you want to be something else at the same time? Not really? It's like, you know, I want to be the respected scientist and family man You know and guy who plays the flute And a sex machine all in this one thing. No, fuck all the other stuff off right now It's irrelevant that I'm a flute player and I have a job and a family and a status and a whatever and same for her It's like we're fuck animals now, right? So cool Be a complete sex object for both of you like I encourage the woman to use me as a sex object, too You know, I'm like take that cock not my cock. I'm like use this cock. Yeah, swallow it Yeah, you need that cock. You'd love it, right? I itemize bits of my own body I commodify myself or objectify myself too, right? Because now we are bits of meat using each other's bits of meat and that's fucking hot right because that's taboo That's where we like she gets to forget about you know Am I a princess and am I a nice girl and you know, am I respected and you know? What's my position in society and all this kind of stuff? Nah when it comes down to you and her in your private space Going wild then yeah, you can get nasty. All right, but be aware right we can jump way too nasty too quick we can and Be aware that many women will tolerate things They don't like can be hard to know when that's the case, which is why we want to have open channels of communication But you may be thinking. Oh, yeah dirty talks. I'm like, yeah, that's it You fucking whore you love that and she's like dude, you know, and she puts up with it and she's just like that's okay But you may have really thrown her out then or she doesn't like this or she's now she's worried about what kind of person you Might be or how you feel about her and respect her and so on Alright, so I really do recommend grading these things throwing out little tests using soft at the softening words So by making her my little that's my pussy Yeah, I love that juicy pussy. You make my cock so hard telling her how you make her feel, right? Telling her how she makes you feel how she is affecting your body, right? That's dirty talk, too Yeah, can you feel how hard my cock is inside you is? Saying to her you made my cock so hard And now we're talking about cocks and girls like talking about it and feeling it and thinking about it if in doubt Then ask for verbal consent. I'm not always I'm not always sure sometimes I'm with a girl who seems fairly delicate or like more sensitive in the way that she's having sex She doesn't she's not talking very much. Let's say and so I might throw a little test her out and say oh, yeah You're my cute little kitten who's such a kitten or you sexy princess One of these kinds of ones and again don't get much response and I'm like, I want to say something but I'm not sure so I can in play in real time say would you like if I say nasty words to you and And and watch for the initial response because if she's like any kind of like negative thing Before she then says something probably that's her truth right, whereas Most of the time she'll be like, oh, yeah, I like that all or like what right? So she's like like what and then I would put in those in those levels So what if I called you my sexy bitch, would you like that? She's like, yes. No and What about the words slut and whore and then I've had girls say don't call me whore don't like it Right or don't call me bitch. Don't call me slut. Cool It's much better that we have that little conversation in flow Even if it's not really breaking the trance or breaking the sex It's it's it's ongoing consent which we and communication and negotiation which you need to be able to do All right So I'm in that space where they were having slow sex and I asked if she liked to be called dirty words And then I say okay these this this and she gives me negative positive negative or whatever it is And then I don't immediately do them and I go, okay And then we move into something else and a little bit later when we're ramped up We're in the zone and she's riding me on top and I go Are you fucking sexy bitch turn me on so much and then I see her eyes light up and she bucks harder I'm like cool dirty talks working here calling her some nasty stuff good that I checked in now I know where we're at with it and I know she doesn't like to be called whore but she loves it appears to be called My sexy, you know, my sexy witch my sexy bitch Today's video was just a tiny clip from a much larger three-hour module on dirty talk and voice commands from the master lover method This is just one of 52 complete modules that you'll get when you sign up to the course to celebrate the launch I'm going to be holding a free live 90-minute webinar coming up next Thursday the 2nd of March in this I will be giving you some of the deeper concepts from the Course and also giving you an opportunity to ask me any questions about anything sex related that you would like So to reserve one of the limited spots for this live event All you need to do is click the link in the description Sign up takes just a few seconds and we'll send you out full details for the webinar coming up next Thursday Stay tuned for lots more amazing bedroom content and the launch coming up on the 4th of March"}
