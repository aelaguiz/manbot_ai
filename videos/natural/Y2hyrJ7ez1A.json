So what we want to do today is it's going to be as per usual pretty much AMA or AUA, ask us anything. But first do you want to introduce yourself, tell them a bit about you, who are you? I'm another introvert like in the group who learned how to act like an extrovert and also I was always quite good in communicating with people and on some different level I was helping them anyway. But the main purpose it was like a channel through TNL I got the chance and basically James gave me a purpose through his company and the possibility to help people on more advanced level. So I like to just work more with the energies and get to the core of a personality, you know, do some healing on deeper levels because everything is coming from that level. So basically that's it, this is what I'm trying to help to everyone around me, even my friends and looking forward to your questions. Yeah, I mean you're an incredibly empathetic person and I didn't know, were you an introvert? I'm still a fucking introvert, it's huge! But I act like an extrovert like in I think advanced level. You certainly do, you're a very advanced social operator and people would be forgiven for thinking that you're an extrovert. Well, how do you define that? Because like it's something that for all, not all, but most of the people that I work with and myself and a lot of people have hung out with, we've sort of identified ourselves in that way for its negative and its positive aspects and definitely had some kind of struggle or sense that we needed to overcome this or work around this in order to be socially functional. Well, I'm surprised that you didn't even notice that, yeah, it means that I act very well. You do act very well. Yes. Well, you do hang around with me quite a bit which maybe points to you being introverted. Now, here's a question which you may or may not want to answer. How did you meet the TNL crew? Do you want to tell the story? I have no idea what kind of job I applied to, it was some kind of, I don't remember where you actually advertised it, but I sent a text like for some kind of hostess jobs because I have to tell you this was one way to open myself up to people and learn how to connect and talk to anyone that I was doing hostess jobs on conferences and and any other kind of parties and events. And anyway, I was like looking forward to this kind of jobs like, okay, meet people and how to communicate easier and not to be so shy. And I texted you and you told me that, hi, I'm James Marshall. Now I can hear it with your voice, but it was just a tag. Hi, it's James Marshall here. Who's this weirdo? And he said that I'm going to meet with Andrew, his colleague. Travel bum. Travel bum, for an interview. Sorry about that. Sounded so official, but it wasn't because we just met for a coffee and he was just doing his charm on me. Didn't seem very official. Didn't seem very official, surprisingly. The only official thing she's ever had was the first text and after that it got very unofficial. But I can be really thankful for him even until now that he chose me as well to be one of your role players. And then this new world just started, but slowly we became friends. I think more than than colleagues or working partners. At least to me, it was more important. And I never even like, I never dared to think about deeper actually that this will happen. So I was just loving them so much and I still love you so much and everyone else. But it just turned out like this. That's how it happened. Just a text on some dodgy job, something that I don't remember how we did that. Probably I asked Ella, I'm like, can you find a way to get us some females? And she hunted around and put it up on some hostess thing and the rest is our sordid history. All right, cool. Well, let's get into a few questions and we have some for you here. By the way, I saw one compliment there that someone likes my nails. Thank you. They're pretty good and they've got, if you don't notice, they've got little, where is it? They have little sparkly diamantes in there as well. Very nice. One thing I've learned from Virag is the pleasures of pedicures. It's amazing. It is great. It's a nice treat. It's great. Now I understand why, like, especially like old ladies, I imagine why they go and sit there and get their hair done and their things done for like six hours because you feel like quite pampered. And then there's some lady just scraping, although she was actually like carving shanks of prosciutto off my foot. Yeah, I don't know if that's going to translate well. Yeah, they were shaving foot prosciutto off me. All right, so let's hear some questions. All right, I'll read it out so that I feel like I've got something to do and then you can answer it. So this is from Peter. So from a woman's perspective, during initial meetings and the first few dates with a guy, what are some good signs, but also red flags or deal breakers us guys need to be aware of that would show you what he'll be like in the bedroom with regards to how he behaves around you, touches you, touches you, touches himself, carries himself, etc. Radar. Radar. Radar. Radar. Radar. Radar. Radar for anyone who wasn't sure. I'll just occasionally translate. If you don't understand anything, just say like, what? What is a radar? But anyway, we feel you. So if you come there, insecure or, you know, you're like, I don't know what to do. But anyway, we feel you. So if you come there insecure or not that kind of like, you are not centered enough and you don't feel your masculinity at place yet, then women will feel that. So make sure that you go there with the right energy, you know, relax yourself and try to be that masculine energy that she will be attracted to. Your question was about like the meetings and first dates. Well, I don't know what's the background, like how much you talk about the escalation and the touches. It's really looking what from your perspective, if you're looking at initial. I just don't know what you told them already or not. Just pretend I told them nothing. Basically, we prepare the touches and all the escalation from the beginning. So once you got the number and you set up the dates, even from walking next to each other, you know, these incidental touches where accidentally you touch the other person, you prepare them for the physicality. So it's not surprising them, for example, if on a date you just do this, that all and you never, you never, you never even touched them before, like you never escalated and never prepared for closer and more direct physicality. So actually, if your touch is not sure, not prepared, that could be a sign, like even if they don't do it consciously, unconsciously, they feel like this guy is maybe he doesn't know what he wants or what he does. But how we teach that we try to prepare it from the beginning. And then when you really feel that it's the place and you are talking and your legs are like now our legs are touching each other. But just because we are comfortable with each other and we already fine with all the touches. But when you meet with someone new, this is another thing what you can do just to prepare her unconsciously for your touches. Let's just show them a bit. Because if we're looking at like red flags and good signs, this is all happening in flow and in motion, right? So as she said, coming in with a good masculine energy and feeling grounded is awesome. But how does that reflect? How does she, how does she even know that? It's like, okay, let's look, we look pretty cool. I always look a bit cooler next year. That's for sure. If I meet for a first date, hopefully we can get all this right. So let's say she's, you know, waiting there nervously. Let's hope text, you know, on her phone, whatever, whilst I walk into the, into the scene. Right. So from the, from the very get go, as the Aussies would say, uh, as if I, if I see the girl like 40 meters away, I'm like, all right, there she is. She's waiting for me. I'll do that thing. Like everyone does where they kind of do a bit of like, all right, what's the best coolest thing to be like, oh, I just noticed you there. Right. So all right. That's, that's okay. I don't want to be like staring at her. And then she catches my own like, oh fuck. Now I'm going, now I have to recover. So I see her from across the street. I feel my feet. I walk over and I, and I look at her the whole time because if she looks at me, glances at me on the way there, then there's a smile there. And so I'm making that contact as I come into the like 10 meter radius, which is where, where that's going to, she's going to pick me up in a periphery, usually within some meters. So I'm coming with the, with the same energy. Let's say that I left her when we first got the number, which is the like, all right, well, it's been awesome to hang out. I should get your number. Let's, let's meet sometime. We get the number. And then maybe, maybe I give her a parting touch, or maybe it's just a look, this kind of look where I'm giving her like a bit of the sex eyes. And then I turn and trip over it. And then I turn and walk off. So she's left with that impulse. And then when we meet again, it's a continue. Ideally, it's a continuation of what that was, right? Because if it, if I now bring it back down to this cold thing, like, oh, I'm basically meeting a stranger again, then okay. Can we build that back up? Yes. If both of us are invested and we click, but it's easier for me to come in with that sense of like, here we are continuing off where we were and building on that. Right? So I'm so glad to see her. So usually I'll just offer a hug. I'll say great to see you. And she steps in and then I wrap around her, wrap around her. I don't pat her. I don't press her. I don't stick my butt out. I don't crush her. I don't try and go for a feel, right? It's just like that. And then I unwind and I tell her something good. Well, you look sexy today or like awesome dress or you look lovely. All right. Did I say that one already? Probably. And then usually I would maybe take her arm, one option, or take it by the hand and just lead her off. Like, okay, we're going on this thing or direct her in a direction. Let's go for a walk here or let's head to the cafe here or whatever, and then probably release. And there we are. Right? So within the first seconds, we've set this tone where it's an escalation from where we last left off. I've, I've assumed that it's okay to give her a hug or sometimes like a girl might not want to. And if she's masked up and gloved up when maybe it's not going to work, but, uh, you know, usually I would do that or I'll give her a kiss like so. And the kisses are again, we've seen on this side, it's a, it's a little sensual moment. I'm just air kissing, which is the correct way to do it. You know, I don't want to do to air. I want to do cheek. I want to do cheek and air, you know, kiss, kiss, depending on which part of Europe might be eight kisses or two or one. Australia is just one. Europe is two. What is Hungary? Two. And there's other places where it's three. All right. And then that here, and again, maybe I take her off like that, or maybe I just let go. I'm not going to be clawing all over straight away. And if I walk off arm in arm and wrapped around her, then that's probably too much, but just giving these brief fleeting touches and then we're off. And then as we're walking, maybe we were walking along and as Virag was saying, this incidental touch, which is, uh, not overt. It's not me grabbing at something, but it's physical flirtation because if we're walking this close, cause girls are very aware of physical space, you know, I mean, how do you operate in a club to avoid men's touches? You just have all these little dance moves to, to snake away. So this isn't happening accidentally, right? In the sense that if she didn't want this or she wasn't comfortable with it, she would just maneuver over a little bit or put a hand in a handbag or something or, you know, do this. And I see this like relatively often. I can pick a first date where a guy's really uncomfortable cause you have the girl walking up, right? And then you have a guy walking into a space, but putting his arm behind his back in some way. I've seen it quite a lot of dudes who like, oh, I can't touch her and I better, I can't even, better not even bump her. All right. I definitely want to bump her. I definitely want to have this going on as we're walking along. Uh, and then, you know, these kinds of touches when I direct her somewhere or, or lead her into open the door for the thing and then lead her in there, right? So I can, I can apply this really simple, not in non-invasive, not fancy, not, uh, like still gentlemanly types of touch, which has a mixture of some overt touch where I'm doing something specific or I'm taking her body, I'm leading her in some way. And then preferably a bunch of other ones, which are non-specific and non like directed at a purpose, but they're just us feeling comfortable in sitting, sitting or standing or walking with each other. And then wait just a second, because, because that's another essential part of it. But what you said, what you were asking that, what are the signs? Like, for example, if it's like this and she's not comfortable yet with your touch, then she will pull away or just, she will move like that. Or if you do like any kind of like, if your legs are, or just like that, your legs are touching, then she's pulling away. So you have to read the signs. Like you have to see her reactions, her facial reactions as well, but more like the physical contact, if she's not ready yet for, for that, but you can try it later, like have more personal conversations, dig deeper in her soul and then maybe after she will be more comfortable with your touches. So, you know, like right now, okay, we have knees touching and this is what I would want on a date. Another reason why I don't sit opposite. The primary reason why I don't sit opposite on a date, I want to sit like this, or like this, so that then it's easy right now, I put my hand on her knee while I make a point, it's not public, she doesn't have to think about it, it's not me reaching out across the table to hold her hands, oh those ones are awkward too, we're holding hands across the table, because then you're committed to it right now, we're like oh now we're doing hand holding, here I don't have to commit to anything, just touches come, touches go, we lean in, whatever is going on, she shows me something on her phone, I hold her this, I can check out her badass earrings which she's not wearing today, do you have earrings? No. Okay, doesn't need them, and so on. But it's like, in terms of like what are the good signs, it's, yeah, we're presenting ourselves as here I am as a good grounded man, but the signs are in action, this physical conversation makes her feel ideally comfortable, relaxed, and that she enjoys being in his presence, and it also takes out some of the need for the conversation to do all the heavy lifting, right, because if we're feeling at ease with each other physically, then we don't have to stress too much about, now we're sitting apart, now we've reached the end of a topic, what are we going to do, and now I need to quickly rebuild it again to create energy, there is energy being circulated between us by the nature of us being tactile. What else do you think in terms of, like you've been on dates before, and like red flags, deal breakers, like things where you're like, this guy is either arrogant or he's dangerous or he's pushy or he's bullshitting, you know, like there's lots of things I guess that you're looking out for with maybe a guy who at least appears to be grounded or appears to be confident, but there might be other kinds of red flags on the other side. Well, it's all about the personality, but I think it's already a good sign if someone is open to meet you, so you start from a positive position if someone is already going for a date with you. So let's look at it like, okay, this is a good position, from here, where are the parts where you can fuck it up, or it depends on the girl, like if she has that kind of boundaries, if she's set up like, I want this kind of guy, I want that kind of guy, like who's not bullshitting too much, or someone likes like more sensitive guys, someone likes more dominant guys who doesn't show the emotion and I'm the alpha man. But I think you have to read her signs, you have to see, but once you put in action what we actually teach to go to personal level, to listen to the girl, really just be curious about her being, don't make her feel like she's just a piece of meat you want to fuck. Because that's, I think, the worst you can do, like to make her feel she's not special, she's just a pussy. How would you, in your experience, know when that's the case with a man, like specifically? Well, if it's just, I don't know, everything is about sex and he's talking about his sexual experience, which I don't give a shit about anyway, because it shouldn't be about other people. I think it's the other thing that talking too much about what he did in the past, like who he fucked, but I wouldn't do that to guys either. So you don't want to imagine that girl who's sitting in front of you and you're just getting to know each other, trying to have some connection that someone else is fucking or having a gangbang with someone. So I think this is essential part of it. What about the way he talks about himself? Well, mentioning the dick is one thing. Do people do that? Of course. What do you mean, of course? You know, I have a pretty big thing in my pants and things like that. Really? Yeah, of course. What do you mean, of course? It's not of course? No, it's not of course. No one here would think, they wouldn't be like, yeah, that's the first thing you mentioned. You'd like, there's some action down here and like, wow, what Virg says you should, is this Hungarian dudes doing this? No, usually I don't need Hungarians, but in the past I did. I just figured out because if someone has a big dick, then they want to prepare the girl for it. Like maybe they look at the reactions if she's carried away or I don't know, just be so proud that they have that in the pants. But yeah, it happens. Like they are proud of it, I guess. I mean, good for them for being proud of it. It's exactly what I think as well. That's why we talk about it. Like for me, it's not impressive that it's anyway, it's a subject. Like I don't want to imagine something, but it's not even mysterious anymore. Like let me figure out, like let's go all the way, not like cutting the shortcut and it's, there is no charm in that. Right, so we need a little bit of sexual tension and implication rather than stating the huge obvious. Here's another question for you. What's from Jacob? What's the difference between handsome, cute and sexy? Well, it depends on the context. Well, for you, the context is you. Do we talk about my personal things? I don't know. I guess so. Well, it can be like each one. It doesn't mean that you don't have the other just because you can be handsome and sexy at the same time. Like if someone says, I noticed that men are very sensitive on this. They don't want to be cute for some reason, but it can be a positive thing many times. Well, OK, let's look at that then. So if someone is cute, does that mean that? And let's just say they're theoretically not the other two. Are they still a sexual prospect? Yeah, of course. Really? Just cute as sexual prospect? Or does it need to have some sexy and or some handsome thrown into it? Because for a man, definitely cute is fuckable. Sexy is fuckable. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Like for men, it's something that's not a compliment, I guess, for a man because they don't want to be cute. They want to be masculine and sexy and wide and stuff like that. But it can be like cute can be. I would rather combine cute with something. That's true. Well, the difference then is cute is maybe not a sexual prospect or needs a little sexy injected into it. I would say handsome or let's say beautiful is more like a technical thing. Like we can say that like this person has a bone structure or whatever. We're like, this is technically a handsome man. And, you know, I used to talk about a handsome couple. You look at them in the old black and white photos and they looked good. Sexy, I would say, is well, that's like kind of the way of being, right? Like the cute can be like it depends. Because if I say that you do something nice for me and I say that's like not for your like I say, oh, it's so cute from you. Why? I'm joking. Like that, I think it's fine. Yes. It's so sweet of you. It's so I don't say nice, but it's kind of. Yeah, but it's so cute from you. Right. It can be sweet, thoughtful. Of course, you can replace it with more precise, juicy words, but it could be that. I think if we're looking at it from a perspective of like what's a good mixture for men that's appealing to women. OK, being like being handsome as we can be, which involves looking after ourselves and grooming and our dress and whatever we've got to work with. And then we have sexiness, which is, I would say, for a man, you can tell me what you think is the way he the way he manages his social and physical environment with ease, with grace in a way that looks. And let's hopefully is fluid and enjoyable that he is able to, yeah, let's say, be at ease with himself in the environments and the context, which are not just like a social environment. They can also be an emotional environment. They can also be and absolutely should be an intimate environment between the couple that then his dominance or his sexuality is infused in that as well so that the woman can get a sense of and feel for this is the entirety of this of this man. And then once she likes all of that, then she doesn't then she's quite happy to call him cute occasionally when she sees the little parts of him where he's a bit softer and sometimes has some self-doubt and also has some weird interest and thinks puppies are cute or whatever. That's a good mix. What do you think? Well, that's it feels a bit negative. Which bit? Like this, like comparing to puppies and stuff like that. What's wrong with puppies? They are cute. No, but he's special. I mean, OK, so like we're now seeing the, let's say, sensitive or vulnerable side of him, which if you are only that and you're cute, but not let's say not sexy or fuckable, then that might not work as a combo. So blend them all together and then we're talking. Have it all. OK, Camille wants to ask this question now. Let me translate this. Tell us about the blizzard of dicks, please. Do you know what that means? No. OK, so we went and saw Louis C.K., right? Yeah. In Italy. We went saw Louis C.K. in Rome. That was good. That was very funny. Well, one of his jokes, which he didn't say on that night, is talking about how women, attractive women particularly, have to move through a blizzard, you know, a blizzard, a big snowstorm of dicks. Yeah. For most of their life. So the analogy, she's like, OK, I'm with you. The analogy is, you get up, you go and you do stuff and you're trying to get through your day or your week and there is a large amount of men that are trying to get your attention or fuck you or get in your way or whistle at you or whatever. And so the visual is a woman like going through a blizzard, you know, and then just of dicks, just trying to get them out of the way. I can imagine that, totally. You got the visual? Yeah. OK. Right, yeah, you got it. You know, these icy dicks and that one's a bit wet and floppy and you're like, oh, there's a bunch that got to get this shit off me. Right. You got the idea. OK. Right. So what he wants to ask about is what is your, what's it like with your experience? Because I kind of know because I hung out with you a lot and I noticed the blizzard more than you do, actually. Yes. But what is that like in real time to experience that? And like, how often would you experience the blizzard of dicks and in what way and how do you deal with it, I guess, is the question. Let's start it from the beginning when you are a teenager and you already look more mature and because you use makeup and you do your hair and stuff like that. When you are a teenager or younger girl, you experience it in a bad way, like it's annoying and everyone is whistling and is like, fuck you and reacting in a really bad way and protective way. Because you don't know, like, like, I don't know, it's just we don't learn to take the compliment or put it in positive perspective that actually this is a compliment for you that, OK, you look pretty today. They just show it on their own way. That's very kind of you to say. I mean, this is how I look at it now. Like, like, because in the beginning of time, it's annoying and you don't understand. But once you get, like, more comfortable with yourself, you settle yourself, you, you know, and you make it conscious, like, fuck, this is what I'm doing all these things for to to look good and not for the compliments. But this is like something if you are comfortable with yourself, it's fine. And then when you get this kind of all this blizzard of dicks, then you can't blame individual dicks for that, that that you have the blizzard. So so it's not their fault, basically, that you have a kind of look and so many men are interested because you are hunters and you have instinct instinctly in you that you want to spread your your seed. And we call it around. Oh, sorry, sorry. You are jizzing around everywhere. And so after a time, it's what I wanted to say that that you grow up and you realize I'm a woman and this is what I get. And I take it as a compliment. Now it's like, OK, it's a nice feeling. But as you noticed, I also learned to close it out most and not to even notice it. And you notice it more than me because I'm not looking for eye contact. Depends on my mood. Like if I'm today, I was like, oh, it's so beautiful everywhere. Autumn and the air smells so good and everything is smiling. Everyone and everyone was like, fuck, she's retarded or crazy or something. It's how Hungarians respond to someone, someone smiling. That's a crazy or disabled person if they're smiling for no reason. Yeah, but I feel like this spread this kind of positive vibe. Yeah, basically, that's it. You avoid it or you learn how to handle it. It's not a bad thing. Actually, it's a good thing. It's a good reflection of, OK, you are noticeable. They see you. Yeah, like I've had funny experiences with Vir\u00e1g. So I walk along next to her and I mean, I can't help but screen the streets like seduction, seduction, Terminator. That's where I am now. And I just see like men turning. And sometimes what I'll do is I'll go and walk behind her for a little while so I can just feel the like the entire force of it. So I'm just getting buffeted by as the dicks as they bounce off her and I get hit slapped a few times in the face too. But like I remember one recently, I think I told you where I saw an older man like do this like proper turn and follow you. But it was that he had this look on his face of like, I don't want to do this, but I have to. Like he just had the look of like, all right, there's another there's a beautiful woman. So I have to just follow her down and look at her ass. When is this going to stop? I'm 70. When is it going to stop? That's the way I interpret it. Maybe that was him. Maybe he was just tired. But that's nice that you understand that we don't really have a choice. And what was that? That was a good one where you can't blame the individual dicks for the blizzard. But also, even very recently, you told me about not good experiences, right? I don't remember now. Oh, that's my personal secret."}
