I'VE ALWAYS BEEN! I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A GRAPEFUIT MAN! Hey guys, I'm Jack, 30 years old, from Taiwan. And the reason I come to this course is actually I came into the community since about four years ago, from the rock bottom, which I was a 27-year-old virgin. Excuse me, sorry, I don't want to be weird or anything. Excuse me, I'm not selling anything, but... Excuse me, I'm not selling anything, but come in. I have to go. I know you have to go, but let me get your number and we'll see what happens. Because I want to get to know you. It's okay. It's okay. When I first started out, I actually wasn't taking much action, just like most of the guys in the community. We're just reading, reading, reading, getting a lot of e-books, downloading a lot of the videos. Doesn't take action. And then for a small period of time, I did actually go out and take a few actions, but it's just like one interaction there, one interaction there. It wasn't consistent. And at that time I was using indirect routines or whatever, and that just puts me right into my head. I was so nervous, even using indirect routines, and my throat actually just froze up all the time. And then I saw the Eurotour, which is the most intense, most full immersion coaching that I can get. So I want to speed up my learning progress in the shortest amount of time. And that's why I took Eurotour. So the first three days we were in Prague, and now we came to Budapest. So in Prague, we did a lot of social freedom exercise and quite a lot of energy work and meditation and posture work. But since we moved into Budapest, the craziness actually tones down a bit, and it's more about custom coaching. So the first day in Budapest, James took me one by one and had a really, really specific custom coach. Remember, it's your job to make her feel comfortable talking to a stranger. It's not her job. She's just walking along minding her own business. Suddenly there's this dude in front of her, so she needs some time, and she needs you to help her. You're coaching her on how to be picked up by you. Anyway, who are you? Huh? Who are you? Okay, my name is Siri. What's your name? Jack. Nice to meet you. Yeah, because at that point, that was kind of the start of you getting into a conversation. Remember that when two strangers meet, it's a strange thing often. It can be awkward because you don't know each other. That's just the natural part of strangers meeting. And you need to allow the fact that it'll often reach an awkward point, and you sit with it, and you just keep going. And then pretty soon, maybe seconds later, you know, they open up. I forgot your name again. Siri. Siri. I'm Siri. Siri. Yeah. Okay. You can just call me every time. How can I ask out a date from a girl who's right next to me? Yeah? Anyway. Okay. Yeah. Thanks. Just put in your ID, and we'll catch up sometime. Alright, I'm going to just keep walking around anyway. Give me a hug. Bye. Good to see you. Bye-bye. Bye. Nice to meet you. Bye. About the coaches, their custom coaching, I'm just speechless. It's so custom, so specific. And we all had our turn with each of the coaches, and we get a feeling of their coaching style, their energy style. So I'll first start with James. He, every time I was around him, he gave me the energy of just, like, relax and chill. I can see you're texting and walking, but I thought you looked very elegant, and I wanted to say hello. Excuse me, ladies. Hello. How are you? Don't worry, I'm Australian. It's okay. I just thought you were really sexy, and I wanted to say hello to you. Is that cool? So she did stop, and then, you know, he had your chance. Yeah. Excuse me, madam. Hello. How are you? It's like his vibe, it captures me. So every time I was around him, I always feel relaxed. And that's the vibe I want to put out into the world. And Tony, the newest coach in TNL, he is a bit more high energy. Hello. Hello. That presence of, I'm here, I have something to say, and you're going to listen. That authority behind that is so strong that they're going to just be compelled to listen. Okay. So go in with the authority behind what you're saying and what you're doing, and watch how your interactions change. All right, so more authority. Okay. Just more authority. Just let them know that you're there. Just, your presence is there, let them know. I just saw you two walking over, and I really, I think you're really cute. Just want to talk to you. Ah, that's why. Ciao. Ciao. Are you a little bit in love with her? Yeah, I think so. I'm going to flirt with her, I'm going to flirt with her, and then you can flirt with her. With who? With this one? Yeah. Yes. Yeah. It's okay. Give me your Italian number. It's expensive here. Italian number? Yeah, sure. We can call by Skype, whatever. Okay. All right. Bye-bye. The first day we were in Budapest, when he was coaching me, he was really down to earth. Wasn't like, you know, you have to do this, you have to do that, whatever, whatever. He really understands where I come from, and just being so fun and real. And then Shay is actually the top guy I look up to, because his wealth and knowledge and inner game, oh my God, it blows me away. Try holding the column up in the air again, and just hold that intention up. Ultimately, this whole inner game thing is about efficiency and effectiveness, you know? It's not about being fluffy or feeling good all the time. It's about becoming an efficient, effective human being. Yeah. So we want to look at how do we operate from perceptions of effectiveness. And that's why I probably said it a couple of times, but it's like, you know, starting to move in the world like, you know, a secret agent or a special forces soldier, in the sense of like, you start scanning the world and start operating with efficiency, or a martial artist. You start moving in the world with the warrior mentality of the path of least resistance to achieve the best possible outcome. Liam, that guy, is weird in his own way. He doesn't give a fuck about how people look at him. He doesn't have any anxiety about meeting any new people or try to keep the conversation going. He just flows, and he doesn't care about what he says or what anyone says. You are cute. And that is actually the first thing I want to learn when I come to this tour, is like, not caring about what other people think and just say things without filtering. And Jess... We've come to the styling part of the Eurotour here with Jack, and we're going to be going shopping for him today. We've just had a bit of a chat, and I've worked out a bunch of different styles and different looks for him. So we're going to be redeveloping his look and making him look sexy. Okay, so we've just hit the shops, got Jack a couple of different outfits. The first one you can see here is just a basic, really classic take on the jeans and jacket look, but a little bit more edgy than the lighter colours he was wearing. Cool, so outfit number two here for Jack. This particular one I've put together for him is a little different than the one before. I wanted something a little bit more edgy and expressing his creative side. In terms of results, actually I just got a date last night, pulled her home. We didn't have sex, but she gave me a blowjob. And then, just now, I just finished another date with a girl, which we were just walking along the riverside, talking a lot, holding some hands, and kissing. And both girls, they were going to have a second date with me, and both of them didn't want me to go home, back to my home country. So, pretty good. This afternoon I just had the best day of my life, ever. Which, at the beginning she was very close off, but then I started opening up myself first, and then she actually opened herself, and then we got into real deep connections. She really opened up to me about her childhood, whatever, about her past experience with men, and the best compliment I've ever got throughout my life was on a date today, which she told me that this is the first time she felt like a woman. From a guy like me, a 27-year-old newbie, Asian, with really, really low self-esteem, which I did try to improve myself over the years, but being in the Eurotour, I can see my results really skyrocketed, in terms of how to really connect with women, and drop all the gimmicky stuff, and also, not just about seduction, this is about life coaching. So, if you want to just learn, not just about how to connect with girls, or how to connect with people, it's how you want to progress in life, in anything you do, jobs, your lifestyle, your health, and your relationship. I would highly, highly recommend this tour. Thank you. Thank you."}
