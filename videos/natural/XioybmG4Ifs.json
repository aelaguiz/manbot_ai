So red pill's another common philosophy that a lot of guys are into these days. Taking on a position of pulling apart female psychology, of pulling apart the war on masculinity. I'm not saying that stuff's not important, I'm not saying that some of those things aren't true. But when people become obsessed with that as their identity, they start to take on the mask of like, I'm a red pill guy. I believe in red pill. It's another religion. It's another trap. And then before they know it, they're stopping themselves from actually experiencing reality. Because they have to look at the world through the red pill filter as if everything has to conform to that reality. And in its extreme form, that can mean black pill. People starting to become obsessed with nihilism and deconstructing everything and not believing in anything anymore. That's not a very positive place to come from either. And that's a very dangerous ideology because then you start to become nihilistic and empty. You start to have a sense of grief and shame about your existence because you can't find an answer that is satisfying to this question, who am I and how does this work? And once again, this goes for left wing beliefs, right wing beliefs, religious beliefs, whatever. All these different beliefs are just constructs, they're just means to an end. And once again, we need to acknowledge their purpose. Like an application on your phone, an application on your computer, that's a useful thing. But if that was the only thing that you could experience on your piece of technology, it would be annoying. Imagine if every time you picked up your phone, you just had to look at Instagram because you became obsessed with it. And that's probably what a lot of people are actually doing. So recognising that there's more to the world than what you think. There's more to the world than these frames of ideologies. So that brings up this point of like, well, yet again, what do I do then? How do I be able to deal with this? Well, you need to create a flexible ideology, a dynamic ideology, an ideology that's connected to the truth, an open-ended ideology. An ideology that can take in different beliefs, different perspectives and start to see, this is cool, this is useful. I can allow this to be something that I work with because it might help me or it does work. And this is not useful because I can see how that's not really part of what is functional. So you have to start to become aware about your thinking, about your feeling, about what's going on to create functional ideologies. And that's a huge thing that I really want to promote inside of your mind. It's a real huge thing that I really want to promote inside of the world really is what I would call white pill. So I've got my own trademark ideology now. Now, what is that? It's about taking on a holistic perspective, a perspective of dynamic emergent truth, a perspective of understanding multiple different perspectives, multiple viewpoints. And to be able to acknowledge and realize that the world comes from different contexts, that there are multiple contexts that are arising within a larger context. And those sub-contexts, let's call them, have different value systems, different ideologies, different beliefs. So if I'm walking around the world, I need to acknowledge that. If I want to be a king, I need to acknowledge that there's a lot of people in my kingdom. I need to acknowledge that my kingdom is big, that the world is big, it's multidimensional. I have to acknowledge all the different levels because that's what a king has to do. He has to understand the world from a higher perspective. And part of that is recognizing there's people in the world that don't like me. So that creates a very important understanding that if you can see this and you can work with this, it will start to break you out of ideological possession more and more. You will start to awaken from this trap that so many people are caught up in these days, which is becoming obsessed with ideas, becoming obsessed with ideologies, becoming obsessed with philosophies and frames of reality. And because of things like YouTube, which you're probably watching me on right now, people have access to huge amounts of information, but it's so confusing because there's all this data coming in. And oftentimes, there's not enough real-world engagement going on. People are so busy interfacing with their digital technology, with their version of what I would call hyper-reality, it's not reality anymore. They're trapped in a different reality. And it's a simulation. They're trapped in an ideas world. So we need to get you back into your body if you want to change. So what does that mean, get out into the world? It means start to talk to people on a real level. It means start to engage the nervous system with actual experience, because there is nothing that's going to replace actual experience. Thank you."}
