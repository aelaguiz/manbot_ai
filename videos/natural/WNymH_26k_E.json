Gentlemen, welcome to the end of the world. James Marshall reporting here pretty much by myself in Budapest, Hungary and the first thing before we get into today's rant is to remind you that the Lifestyle Design Academy is open for enrolment right now. That's right. From now until Sunday you still have the opportunity to join me on this 12-month adventure of redesigning your lifestyle, of understanding how to network, how to infiltrate, how to move within your city or within the globe to maximise your results in all areas including seduction, finance, career, social circle, sexuality, you name it. So right now you've got four more days to join. You can click the link below to go to the page which explains everything in detail and be really clear that after Sunday I'm shutting the doors. The reason being is that straight away the following weekend I'll be starting with the first of the eight weekly lectures getting straight into the live course itself so there will be no latecomers allowed. So now is your last chance for the next four days to join me for the LDA experiment. All right. So now let's move on to today's topic which is essentially how things have changed and my how have they changed. It was only about a year ago that I couldn't walk down this street talking to a camera without having at least one if not three stag parties coming behind going, Oi lads, lads! Some of my students Buck off, cocksuckers. It's a really important thing. Hello. Yes, brother. Now I kind of miss Daryl and Lionel and Dave. Where are those lads now? So yeah, this was once a vivacious, amazing, metropolitan, erotic city and presently it sucks. Seriously, like Budapest is dead. You can't go out after 8pm. You can't even catch a cab sneakily over to your girl's house because if they catch you, which they try to, then they fine you through the yin yang. Bars, restaurants, cafes, you name it. It's all closed. So basically this city is in a boring kind of stasis like many places on the planet. Which brings me to today's topic. Last week I put out a short snippet, it was just a little clip that I released from one of the lectures that I do on the LDA and during the LDA I cover a huge amount of topics and that's basically only limited by the questions that I'm asked. So guys do often ask me questions about the digital nomad lifestyle, about living remotely, about leveraging currencies, you know, trying to earn western currencies in non-western countries. The disparity in beauty wealth, right, because there definitely are places around the world where the girls are hotter or the guys are hotter. I come from a country, Australia, haven't been there for a while but in Australia, on average, the men, I would say, are quite handsome. They're tall, they're broad, they're, you know, nice dudes, they can surf and on average the girls are not that hot whereas a place like here, it's reversed. So guys are talking to me about this kind of stuff all the time because I feel that it is really, really important. If you want to understand how to maximize your lifestyle returns then you need to look at the base ingredients of your lifestyle and those things absolutely include the things that weren't set up by you but you were put into, as in the place that you were born, the demographic that you come from, your parents' income, the time and place in history and what is going on in the world. These are things that can't be denied and shouldn't be ignored and almost always are when it comes to anyone who's giving you advice on how to be better in your life, right? You think about it in terms of, except for the nomad capitalists, anyone who's getting on a video and saying here's how to get better in your life is you need to, you know, become time more effective, you need to have better mindsets, you need to hustle harder or smarter or better in some kind of way, you know, you need to have clear goals, you need to get the right resources and so on. Like none of these things are incorrect but none of those things happen within a vacuum. They happen within a lived reality that is not just yours, not just in your mind and on your vision board but is out there in the real world. So today I want to have a bit of a talk to you about that and it may seem kind of like an ironic time to be talking about, well, maybe you should think about moving to another city because you might be thinking, well, I'm not even allowed to leave my apartment. That may be so or it may not be so because right now I choose to be in this country and very soon I will choose to leave it because for now the only reason that it's good for me to come here is to renew my visa, see my friends. I can't even go to the bathhouse, they've closed that and no other reason. So right now this environment is not the place where I can have the lifestyle that I'm used to or the one that I've built. It's just the situation is working against me and I could stay here for the next X number of months and really try to optimize and really try to work within the framework and I could be able to, like, I mean, everyone else is going to have to figure it out but for me, because I'm lazier and maybe a bit smarter or let's say more experienced with this kind of thing, I will leave and I'll go to a place where things are cooking which right now is Kiev, Ukraine for me as well as Portugal for other reasons. So I have been doing that, like I've been on the road for 13 years, literally. Like the first time that I started traveling was when I was 18. I took little mini experiments into living in different countries and different cities and then I continued to do that over the last decade plus amount of time is that I was always on the run from something, always running from my dark past. No, not really. I was always running towards something, moving to locations or environments that were going to work better for me because I wanted to be able to get the best returns that I could on my life and so therefore when it made sense to leave or it didn't make sense to stay, right, by looking at it, looking at the limitations, the systemic limitations within any environment, these are things that sometimes can't be worked against and often don't have to be worked against in the sense that it would be better to move to a more fertile plane. There's an interesting YouTube channel I've been checking out lately called Second Thought and you can check it out, links in the description and it's a political channel and it's looking from things from a left of centre position for sure so people who are like libertarians and right-wingers might be like, James, I knew you were a communist and like, whatever, doesn't matter. I'm not a communist but what I think is interesting about this channel is that there was a recent video about the cult of hyper-individualism, right, which is essentially the Australian, American, to some extent, European dream and philosophy and let's say life ethos which says that anyone, if they work hard enough, if they work smart enough, if they follow their passion, if they put their mind to something, that over enough length of time they will be able to achieve their goals. So that anyone can pull themselves out of poverty, anyone can become a material success, anyone can become a social and seductively successful man if they work hard essentially. Now, of course, in order to get somewhere that you're not, you're going to have to put in effort. You're not going to just win the lottery, you're not just going to get lucky and everything's not going to just land on your plate. You're also not going to be able to just use mindset shifts to, you know, vision with the secret and try and project your ultimate eventual life and expect that that's going to yield it to you either. Of course, in order for me to now live an internationalist, exciting life with lots of different friends and lovers, none of that came to me because I hoped for it. It came because I moved and because I put in action and I worked for sure. However, there's a couple of things that are wrong with, I think, the individualist up-by-bootstraps myth. The first one is that it's an individual pursuit at all. And the interesting thing that I pulled from this video, and I'll put a link in the description, we'll probably overlay it, is that there was a research foundation that looked at a map of America. I don't know if they did the rest of the world as well, but they looked at America and they're like, what are the metrics that en masse, like if we look at the national population, leads to wealth increases? What are the things that are most likely to lead you to improve your situation from, let's say, your parents' class, to be able to move up a class, for example? And guess what those things were? They weren't how much you hustled and grinded and whether you had the right mindsets. The things that made the big difference were where you were born, as in America, what state, and that's based around what economies, what resources, what industries were going on and the amount of people competing for those, how much your parents earned, your race and your gender. And I know a lot of people will be like, oh, that's bullshit, you shouldn't let any of that hold you back, that's a victim's mindset and so on. I don't agree. I think that there is obvious en masse, when you step out and you look at the mass of a population, you can see that there are poor areas, that being brought up in a poorer family or having limited resources, whether that's access to education or safety or food or good nutrition, good, healthy, loving surroundings, like all those things make a massive difference in how much acceleration you get, how much support you have and so on. Now, on the other hand, that can seem a little bit depressing because it's like, well, I can't change where I was born or how much my parents earn or my gender or my race, right? Okay, we can't necessarily change, we can't change those things, not without expensive surgery. But the reason why this is pertinent is not just to be like, okay, well, there's a reason for me to be a victim. It's to look at, okay, what one of those metrics can I shift? And out of those, the only one that you can really shift, unless you like get rich and give your parents lots of money, but then that you don't need to, then you've kind of, that doesn't help. The only one you can change really is your location. And that's something that I'm really big on in terms of like, you can change a lot of things in your life, but these foundational pieces that over the mass of a population means that you will succeed or fail. Now, of course, there are outliers. Of course, there are people who build themselves out. Like in a way, I'm an outlier, right? I came from a low income family, very low income, single parent household, coming from a town that was boring and didn't have a lot of opportunities in areas that I was interested in anyway. But the reality is like, if I had stayed in that environment, I mean, it sends a shiver down my spine, not just because it's starting to rain and it's miserable, but it sends a shiver down my spine when I think, well, what if I'd done what most people do, which is stay in the same place that they were born? The vast majority of people may, okay, maybe they move to a bigger city for university or within their nation, they might shift to a larger population center, but most people don't. Most Americans don't even have a passport. They'll never even leave their country. And this can be totally fine or it can be totally disastrous if you're someone that wants to live a life less ordinary. Because like, I always feel a bit torn whenever I'm giving lifestyle advice or financial advice, because I don't wanna be one of those guys that just says it's just about the hustle and do these ABC steps and you'll be a millionaire because I don't believe it. I don't think it's true. Although there are people who do do that, right? In some ways I can tell you, don't do all the random weird things that I did to get successful, which would be a bit hypocritical because I actually got successful that way. But I do recognize myself as an outlier. And what my attempt is whenever I'm teaching is to try and teach to a broader scope audience. I know I'm not talking to the average person because the average guy would never be willing to go and approach women cold. He would never think to possibly step out of his current social world and break into different social scenes, even in his own city. He wouldn't think to try out different lifestyle hobbies or breaking into new groups or getting involved with people that are very different to him because he wouldn't see the commonality and so on, right? So I know that on this channel, I'm not talking to the average person. I'm talking to a guy that at least in his mind, even if you haven't put that into application yet, wants to live an extraordinary life. And that is possible in this time and place. And one initial point to make is that even now, it's possible. In the last three weeks, I've been lived in, been in three countries, from Portugal to Ukraine to Hungary. And I will continue to travel and move around the world and do business and go where the opportunities are, even in the midst of this crisis. And there are ways that I have to work around it. I have better networks than you. So I have lawyers and friends of lawyers, friends who have lawyers in different countries who know the legalities of how to slip into a country legally, but in a way that most people don't know about. I understand, like I have put in the work over the years to set up different social groups in different parts of the world, which are now paying dividends. And I've talked about this before in terms of your social retirement. If you spent the last 12 months, and let's be honest, the previous part of your life, ensconced in a very small social scene that's five dudes of a homogenous nature in the city that you were born or went to college in, and you're not making efforts to think outside that box, then my sincere warning to you is that that may be the thing that puts a cap on where you can go in your life, right? Humans have this endless capacity for hope, which I think is a good thing, because it gets them through lots of rough times. They have this ability to have faith in something. It's not real yet, which again can be a really good thing to get them through difficult times, but at the same time it can be a complete delusion. Whenever I hear someone who has no real plan on how to build their life saying things like, ah, things will work out or the universe will, you know, the universe will figure it out or when it's the right time either this opportunity or this person or this love or whatever will turn up, I know that person is kind of destined to failure unless they're very lucky. Because I know the realities of this planet are changing so fast and humans again have not a great capacity for understanding and really accepting that change is happening all the time. We're living through this major historical moment, I'm looking out the window at night to totally empty streets except for a couple of policemen hassling anyone who's on the streets and I'm like, wow, I'm living in a dystopian future that no one two years ago could have possibly predicted except for the QAnon dudes who predicted it and then predicted a whole bunch of stuff that went wrong and now they keep on changing their predictions so they'll keep on predicting stuff. But you know, this is not what we would have expected. And if you'd asked me two years ago, you know, I'm a young guy or I'm a single guy and I'm thinking of moving to where the action is, where would you suggest, and I will get onto some suggestions in a moment, I would, back then I would have said here, Budapest, great place, cheap, hot girls, you know, crazy, fun, social and nightlife, lots of great stuff going on and now, don't come here, totally pointless. Now those things have shifted. And if you, you know, if you make the mistake of really putting roots down in the wrong position, that can be the thing that not only, I don't want to use the word ruin, but let's say stifles your life or, yeah, like really paralyzes how far you can go in life, it's going to do that for your children as well, right? It's like, where is it that you want to then set up so that at some point in your life, if you set up a family or have a, you know, a serious relationship or really put some roots down, is this environment going to support you or is it one that is dying or shifting so rapidly that you can't predict? So I know for myself, in the last 13 years of travel, uprooting myself at roughly the right time and maneuvering to a new position is the thing, is the ultimate reason why I broke out of a poor class and became a wealthy person. It's the ultimate reason why I get to spend my time with the types of women that are, that when I look, if I thought, if I knew 10 years ago I was going to be with this kind of woman, I would not have believed you, right? Because getting access to women that beautiful or that high value was extraordinarily difficult even though I was hustling and grinding the streets of Melbourne and Sydney and Canberra back in the day and getting some results. There was just better stuff going on in this part of the world, right? So I would not have been wealthy. I would not have gotten access to global networks of people who gave me advice on things such as real estate and crypto, how to work within the legal systems to think more like a corporation than an individual that's attached to a country, right? So now I'm a complete expatriate and I have no patriotic connection to any country. And some people may think that that's ethically or morally defunct. There's a problem with that. But I disagree because I think you really only have two choices, broadly speaking. You can be a nationalist, and I don't necessarily mean that in the flag-waving sense, but I mean in the, I'm committed to my nation, to the nation-state that I was brought up in. And look, of course, people can have a great life, a fulfilling life situated within the culture that they were born in and they have to because most people will, right? Most people don't have either the opportunity, the drive, the cash or whatever to change their life or they just don't think they can or they don't want to, right? So, yeah, on one hand, in order to construct an amazing lifestyle, your choice is make the very best of the scenario that you're within, which means that, yes, your family bonds, your friendship bonds, how you position yourself within the scene of the local city, whether that's the social scene or the economic hierarchy or whatever, okay, you can do that and then maybe you can win the game within this one location, right, on that one level. But I like to think much bigger. I don't want to, I didn't want to put all of my eggs in one basket and risk everything on one location, on one style of living, on one social circle and I look back at my friends who did that, okay, they lived their lives, we're all in our 40s now, so we've had enough time to look back and go, wow, half my life's gone, my youth, you know, my young man days are at least coming to an end if all of my holding onto them, I mean, I'm going grey, so obviously they're coming to an end, but, you know, that part of life is passing and now there's another part and I look back on all the friends that stayed in the small town or the small city that I was from, got married early, had kids early, bought property in a market where, I don't know if you know the Australian market, look it up, like average house price in Sydney or Melbourne, it's over a million dollars, so it's like all those people, they made their commitment to that country, to that social scene, to the people around them, for better or worse, and as a result, okay, they live their lives and now some of them have families and some of them are happy and some of them are miserable because they married the wrong person, had kids too early and got divorced and that destroyed their income for another 10 years and, you know, they're only starting to get themselves back on their feet now, whereas for myself and everyone else that I know, right, everyone that I'm close to, we are all nomadic entrepreneurs of one type or another, whether we're the boss or whether we work for somebody else, whether we freelance, whether we found a way to move to a new country and plug into the resources there, or to get resources from other countries and plug them into a cheaper country, this has been the benchmark, like the real tangible factor that has made all the difference, and that's the main point I want to make to you guys today, is that you can't fight the system on a global level, right, okay, yes, there will be people who succeed in every scene, but the realities of the numbers are going to pull most people down to the average of what is going on around them, and those who want to become outliers may want to think about, well, and when I say outlier, I mean, you know, someone who's self-employed, someone who works under their own, more or less under their own conditions that they want, even if they're working for somebody else, someone who is able to work on lifestyle leverage projects, and most guys that I work with want to have an unorthodox love life, right, so they want to date freely, they want to experiment with multiple relationships, and they also want to have other relationships, but only when they choose to step into them, into a monogamous relationship, for example. So it is vitally important, let's just cross over this road, that's vitally important. Any traffic? No. So it is vitally important that you are realistic about your unrealistic goals. I've had unrealistic goals my entire life. I wanted to study in Shaolin Temple, I wanted to go to the Amazon and learn from masters, I wanted to date the most beautifully amazing sirens of the East, you know, I wanted to be a famous funk musician, I wanted all sorts of outlandish, unrealistic things, and I achieved almost every single one of them, by looking at that in a realistic way. Like, when I wanted to be a musician, I lived in, I was born in Canberra, Australia, the most boring, sterile city in the southern hemisphere. It's a city which honors Australia's past, and shapes its future. And I wanted to be a musician, and there was two venues in town, and like one studio, there was no scene there, there was no industry for music, and I was, yet I was passionate about being a musician, and so were my friends. And we took it as far as we could go within that scene, and there is, any life coach that I may have hired at that time, that told me to hustle harder, and believe in my dreams, and have more passion, or whatever, would have been useless to me. The only life coach I would have needed at that time would have been the one that said, alright dude, so time to get out of this shitty city as quick as possible, which is what I life coached myself to do, and moved with nothing, literally just the network I had, which was my band, moved to another city where there was a music scene, and that meant that eventually we could become actual musicians, right? In the same way that if I, I did start this business in Australia, but because of the limited population size, the smaller economy, and also some attitudes about Australians, that I don't know about taking advice from people, which is a bit of an Australian thing, and a British thing, Americans like taking advice, Europeans are willing to as well, so these systemic issues meant that the business could only get to a level where we were just living paycheck to paycheck, or workshop to workshop. It would not have been sustainable in the long term, and if I'd stayed in Australia by now, I probably wouldn't be doing this, I would have to be doing something else. It was the ballsy move to rip up myself, and my collaborators, move them over to Eastern Europe, where, originally in this city, I could live for half the price that I could live in Australia, and I could get a better standard of living, right? So I could get a cooler apartment, I could eat out more, I could afford to take taxis all the time, all the sorts of things that as a basically broke or, you know, dude starting out in life back in Australia, I simply couldn't do. You know, you would have to think about how often do I buy a coffee, or you know, I eat out once a week, or you know, I'm always struggling to pay the rent, and so on. Whereas over here, the standard of living rose massively, and the costs dropped. At the same time, I found myself on a continent which was very easy to manoeuvre around, because I had the mindset that it was easy to move around. I wasn't thinking I'm moving to Hungary, I was thinking I'm moving to the continent of Europe, and I'm going to milk that for all it's worth. And so I did, over the last ten years, plus bounced around to dozens of different countries, and milked the best of lifestyle, weather, like until now I haven't had a winter in ten years, right? So it's like my lived experience during that time, it was not just that I was like, alright, I'm going to hustle for the next ten years, and then I'll be a millionaire, and then I'll sit on a Versace boat, or something. I don't know, Versace probably doesn't make boats, but you know what I mean. No, it was like all along the way, how can I increase the metrics of my lifestyle, success, and pleasure, and nourishment, right? So that meant, being in this city, meant that I got to hang out with, and sleep with, and date more beautiful, interesting women, more easily than if I'd been back in Australia competing against all the Aussie chads, which is called Bruce, I believe. You know, the networks and opportunities that I found happened years faster, and in many situations would not have happened at all if I hadn't have upped sticks and moved to new locations. So, I know right now, this may seem kind of irrelevant, it's kind of like, just teasing you, people are like, fuck you James, I'm not allowed to leave my house. Yeah, okay. But, I would say we're at kind of the midway point of the pandemic. I remember giving talks something like this about a year ago on similar topics, when things had just first started. But, reality is, I mean, believe it or not, there is a virus, I mean, there'll be some people who are just switching off right now, there's a virus, there is a cure, it will fucking happen at some point in the next 12 months, and yes, you may need to have a vaccine passport, sorry QAnon dudes, you guys just get to stay home, for the rest of us we can take the jab and start moving. But, it will be possible again to manoeuvre, but, it's like after a type of war, right? There will just be cities that have been flattened by this. This, I think, is one of them, I don't know how long it's going to take for Budapest to recover, because it sure does suck right now. Some places will bounce back straight away, others will be economically depressed for years, because there are service industries, or the local industries have been destroyed, there'll be brain drain, people will be moving to try and figure out new opportunities. And, maybe you should be one of those opportunity refugees. Now is a time when, okay, maybe you can't think about moving, and maybe your economic situation has been massively disrupted, like many of us it was. But, I've seen, absolutely, for myself and other people that are lifestyle engineers, that most of us have thrived, even if we took a pay cut for some time. Most of us have thrived, because we went, oh fuck, it sucks here, let's go over to Ukraine, where everything's open and fun. Or, let's go to the south of Europe and ensconce ourselves on a farm for some time and wait this out. You know, let's take these invitations to people's country houses, or to go and work on collaborations that aren't social right now, because we can't do that, and so on. And, in this way, being able to be adaptable and nimble, it means that you can succeed, even when the environment around you is starting to crumble. Primarily, by being able to, and willing to go, alright, this place sucks, my loyalty to Australia has now totally gone, see you later, camp, I don't care. And some people are like, well, you know, it's not about being a national traitor or whatever, it's like, I have no loyalty to any place. I have loyalty to myself, my friends, the type of life that I want to live, and I'm not willing to sacrifice that for anybody or anything, or any flag, or any nation, or whatever. I know quite a number of Americans, for example, who are giving up their American citizenship, because it's way better from a taxation perspective for them to become a citizen of another country, because the tax rates are much lower, and they won't chase you to the ends of the earth like the Americans will. That's a big decision, right, to actually give up your nationality, but for those guys I've talked to, it makes absolute sense. It means that they can still go and visit America with the right type of passport, they can still be involved in the country, but they've decided that, why would I pay tax to this country for the rest of my life at exorbitant rates, when I could move somewhere else legally, and do what any other rich person does, or any other corporation does, which is leverage the planet as a whole. So I would suggest that now is a good time to start thinking about what is the next one through to five years of your life going to look like from a local perspective."}
