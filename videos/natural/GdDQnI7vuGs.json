So we can have sex in many different locations and so let's have a little bit of a look at that. Most of the time we're going to be having sex doggy style if we're not using a bed. It's what tends to work the best. If I was to be using a desk, a couch, something like this. So I'm gonna get her and then just guide her over. Alright so she's choosing where she can go. Now there's lots of positions she can go. She can go on her elbows, she can come up onto her hands. If I want to bring her up higher. Now if I want to increase the tilt, I take the hips and I tilt her hips a bit. In this position here, because she has long legs, she's a bit too high for me. So in that case I just say open your legs. So if I get her to open her legs, that will bring her down lower. Right and if she was a short girl and she was too short, then I would get her to close her legs to lift the height up. Right so you just and you can put your knee on the inside and guide as well. Just open your legs a little bit or put your hands in between open legs. Alright and then I can present her like so. Alright so from this position here, obviously we get in we penetrate and then everything you know works more or less the same. Be aware that if she's on a hard surface like this, like if I was doing like long strokes like this, I would be cleaning the table with her face. Which is not what I want to do. Right so I'm aware of like if that I'm doing strokes that that end here, here, here. Right so I'm getting these tilts in the hip. I'm not doing like big pushing strokes. Right I'm here and if I want to do heavier, I'll hold the hips pull them into me and then I can get this fucking here. Right so you can see that she's moving but it's not too much movement that it's gonna be uncomfortable. If I wanted to get her to stand up. Okay so from here, good. I want this I want this curve that she's got here in the spine. So if for example she had this straighter back, now as the hip tilts that way it's hard for me to get in under and actually penetrate. Right so sometimes you know a girl stands up and then you find the dick is like slipping out. Okay that's because of the angle so I'll go tilt your hips. Good like that. Right or I can put my hand on her belly and I can tilt like so. Right so as long as I'm gripping the pelvis or I'm being clear about what I wanted to do then I can maneuver as such. Okay so from here very easy for me to lean over, put a bit of my body weight into the desk of these dominant seams to have great spanking from here. You know if I come out to the side I could start by you know maybe at the beginning I come in bend over and I come around to the side. Right so now hold her in you know and this ties in nicely with any kind of secretary fantasy and bending her over the desk lifting up a skirt, giving her a spank. She's been a naughty secretary. Rip off the panties, open your legs. From here come up. So from here we can also apply all of our different holds we had. So holding packed into the front of the chest, holding the the arms like so. We can get her in like here. Lifting and again so this is essentially we're standing so I can bring her up into standing positions and then you know I could poke her hard and then I could let her go and she'll fall back and she'll take her position again. Right so we can maneuver between these different aspects from here. Getting my body weight in. Reaching between her legs to touch the pussy, spanking. Come around to the side and so on. I can also use a desk or a table or a bench from let's say standing or seated missionary. Right so you want to make sure that it's a thing that's strong enough to take her body weight and it has to be at about the right height for your cock. Right because if the the desk is 40 cent you know this high there's no way I'm going to be able to get it. If it's really really low it's not going to work. So at about pelvis height then we can use these surfaces. So in this situation I've just walked her back to the desk till she can feel it at the back and then I can just give her a little hop up and then open her legs. Come in, pull her into me. So now I'm going to penetrate. So her pussy is going to need to be like right on the edge right in order for me to get penetration here. Right so she's here and then I'm gonna lift one knee, lift the other one and then from here we've got position here. Right so the body weight for her is on a hard surface so we're not going to do this forever. It's one of those, it's a passionate, passionate quickie type of thing. Right so let's say you know she's she might be wearing a dress and then I'm taking her over here. All right I take my cock out, open our panties with the dress on right and then just put it in and then we're straight into having sex here. So you know this is a fucking hot looking scene. Lift the knee up a little bit, might tuck her in closer and so it can be having sex like so. It's not the most comfortable position but it's awesome psychologically. It feels great for a while so we do you know we would do that for some time and then probably I would pull out, get her to come here, spin her around, bend her over and then do some more from here or vice versa because this obviously this position is more comfortable and we can do that for longer. Right so great we can be throwing a girl onto onto your desk, onto a table, kitchen table or whatever. Sexy stuff you don't want to just have sex on the bed, get the boy. The video that you've just watched is a small snippet taken from one of over 50 explicit modules that will be available coming up soon in the Master Lover Toolkit. Now you've got some better ideas of how to pleasure a woman in non-bed situations and this clip is about as explicit as I can get away with putting on YouTube but within the course coming out very soon things go much much more high-definition and explicit. Right now I'm offering a free giveaway which is a 40-minute master class which goes much deeper into demonstrations and instructions on position mastery. So how to maneuver a woman around space, how to transition between different positions, how to adjust to the needs of both your body types and how to get different types of stroke control, hip game and synchronization between the partners for excellent sexy times. So if you'd like to take advantage of that click the link below, put your email in, you'll receive it immediately and in the lead-up to the launch I'm also going to be running a free live 90-minute webinar where you get to get on a call with myself, ask me any questions that you want about sex, dating, seduction and to find out all the details about the upcoming Master Lover Toolkit.
