Okay, so I'm gonna go back go back through each of those briefly So these are things these are when I look at look, what do I do with my collaborators? I do all of these things and I also do business stuff as well, right? You know that that's yeah, I'll add into that. Okay, and then business business legitimate business Okay, so parties we talked a bit about what makes a good party last last week Which is controlling the environment controlling the physical space chips dips coke lighting good music A ratio of at least one to one anything less than one to one. It's Lord of the Flies hopefully moving into the two-to-one and maybe eventually the coveted and Mythical three-to-one ratio, but at least a one-to-one must be Or I mean, no, we I have dude parties where we have dude parties hang out with bunch of guys come over It's just the dudes they will come in. It's like Seinfeld We have our one Elaine and then the dudes come in and we hang out and do stuff and whatever and that's fine Cool, but when we're putting on event events, we're working the ratios for sure So the different elements different types of parties that we can that we can throw Remembering that the party doesn't need a lot of it doesn't lead a lot of money It needs a location which can be indoors or outdoors depending on the weather It needs those elements that I talked about which are cheap as fuck It's like booze and some things to eat a music making machine and some form of lighting Which remembering back in the day for us was often cellophane over a light bulb. Uh-huh. Yep So these days you can get cheap as fuck lights for ten bucks on eBay Back, then we use candles and cellophane Just remembering my early one of my earliest seductions Was a girl that I started dating in high school, you know back before that meant fucking and we didn't fuck ever actually But we dated for a week or two and I brought her home and I had my that was my first attempt at like a Setting the whole thing up for seduction. And so she came to my house when my mother was out and I lit a candle Put cellophane over the light bulb I had a tape player and I had this one tape of this guitar player who played this like elevator music guitar that my Ex-girlfriend's father had given me when I was 15. Like it was this one like cheesy kind of Really tacky sounding guitar with with uh, you know wind chimes and synths and stuff It was terrible, but that was my seduction. I couldn't remember that guy was that was my seduction tape And so she came in I put on the tape press play lit the candle and then started making out with a For a long long time and then at some point the tape stopped 40 45 30 minutes in and I quickly went clicked Span it over like I've got 30 minutes to close the deal before the end of the tape and I didn't close the deal Okay, so parties we have themed parties and themed parties are fucking awesome There's something about when you give people a mask or give them a character where they just go wild We we did that a lot in Melbourne We had a series of parties and it's great if you can do a series of parties Once a month for four months for the summer, right? Don't commit to you can't do that forever, right? because you'll burn out or people get lose interest over time, but if you like there's gonna be it we're doing a party season or Sunday night dinner season or or a Saturday afternoon in the park Frisbee Picnic season and we're gonna and each one's gonna be themed All right, we me and Jess spearhead a lot of these parties we had one that was like apocalypse That was cool. Everyone dressed up like Mad Max and shit. We had your ultimate fantasy party We had a masquerade which is awesome because in any mask will do and then when people wear masks, they get weird very weird they start like moving and like Becoming archetypes this and then people in acting know this when you do a mask workshop You put on one of those like happy or sad masks It brings something quite bizarre out of people it because it's you become that expression. It's cool. So Organizing those is really really quite simple. It's like it doesn't have to be on Halloween whatever you can say doing it we're doing a dress-up party or like a think of it like a Alice in Wonderland Tea party. All right That's a cool one we've done before where we have a picnic where everyone's and we've taken acid, of course Where you have cakes into you and everyone's dressed and stuff and we play a croquet we should do that We've got croquet set here So, yeah, if you put on an event where girls get to dress up girls love dressing up They loved and I will always dress up slutty no matter what you tell them You're just like even if you said we're going to have a Victorian chaste themed party. They'd find a way to make that slutty Because it means a girl gets to be a slut right But only for fun Because we you know because girls will often be modest or they are aware of how much skin they're showing and whether they doing it You know and often when I meet girls who've got huge tits They often cover them up because they realize that they're there's such a focal point but you you tell the girls it's a pimps and hoes or it's a naughty bit naughty and nice or And ones that are really easy are black and white naughty and nice your alter-ego The Masquerades Any uniforms right things where people have a broad Set of choices to go from in there and they're quite easy to like black and white parties Some people will go extravagant others just wear whatever black and white t-shirts and that's fine as well because it still adds to the thing And then yeah put on the party if if you can have any kind of punctuated event during a party It will change the dynamic what I mean by that is that If it's just like come to come to my house, okay, and whatever happens happens fine that can be awesome or it can can lose steam if you have something during a party that lifts the momentum for it a performance of some sort and and People people don't understand how easy and cheap it is to get live performers to anything Because I've been a live performer. I know how fucking cheap I was You can get a DJ you can get a fire twirler you can get a belly dancer you can get a Morris dancing troupe you can get a four-piece string quartet and we've done that one before recently You can get a stripper you can get a burlesque dancer, right these people In most cosmopolitan ish cities like they exist. I mean, okay, if you're in Saudi Arabia, no, please no You know, there'll be some countries where okay that that means different things right in Serbia I can get a gypsy band for a hundred bucks and they will follow us around drinking with us and that's fucking awesome Like there is nothing more fun in my mind than rolling down the street with rocky with a gypsy band following you playing Like that's amazing and that can be done for a hundred bucks ish so I pretty much every party that we've run a big-scale party. We always got a performer the ones I can think of you we had a String quartet even back in my very first parties when we were broke students. We got a belly dancer a DJ a band Because people will play for beer people will play to come to a good party people will play for 50 bucks each, right? It's if if if they're of a not famous level But there's a lot of quality quality Every type of performer and they're broke and they want to perform and if it's a cool party Like my band played at lots of house parties for free because why not? We're like cool Yeah, we'll come and play in someone's garage and they're like we'll give you some beers and just fuck the chicks And we're like cool sweet What else we're gonna do Friday night? We go and play some funk. We try and pick up some girls get wasted You know, I'd probably do it again if my band was here. So if you can punctuate it with some kind of event My a friend of mine Clary had this cool party series for years called Clary oaky and It was it was always a great party But it was always that people had to do some like it not everyone but at least five or six people had to put they put in beforehand that they were gonna do some kind of performance and These were not usually professional performers. They were just our friends, right? So people did Sang a song or did a poetry reading or did like a skit or a little musical theater piece and Some of them were great and some of them were very shit But fun, right and it was just like people got up and did the thing did something they dressed up in drag and sang a song or Someone played the ukulele or whatever and John would then get up and play good music and then you know We'd and then we didn't have a DJ It was just like okay Clary would put on these music and that was those Clary oaky events became legendary in Sydney And the last one I had like 500 people because he eventually we couldn't fit them everyone in the in his apartment And so he moved it to a hidden beach in the Sydney Sydney beaches and then we had massive amounts of people They were they were legendary So having something that happens at the party makes a big difference The other type of party is after parties now after parties Sometimes an after party requires that you well it requires that you're moving through a funnel Right because it's after something After parties can be Basically the way that we initially started doing about after parties was this myself and Grant and wolf Sorry and Zana and flows we would go out a lot like three four nights a week and we would meet girls and then we'd Often like someone would talk to someone talk to their friend and then we'd pull a couple of other girls over all that or it Was a group of girls, right? And then we'd say hey, let's let's do after party at our place and we would take five girls back Right, so there might be two three four of us and we bring two three four five more girls back because we like after party And what an after party meant was we knew that when we arrived at the apartment Action stations, right? We would arrive Someone would take the girls in and talk to them and whatever The other one would others would run around turn the lights in the right way get some drinks put the music on within five minutes We could turn the place into a into it and a chill zone after party Maybe you should do that as a drill You have that with your wingman where you like come home You're like six minutes to make this into a party space, but often that led to Led to sex right because a girl didn't want to go home with a guy from a club and fuck him because that felt a bit Cheap, but she spent all night with this guy We were at the club and then we went to this cool after party and then they had you know They had a jacuzzi on the roof or whatever whatever happened. We played twister, which is a good good one, which we do sometimes And you know, we got a bit wasted and then we fucked right that happens a lot a lot of an end to give you a little Snapshot into the the higher worlds if you ever go to one of those clubs where there's very beautiful women right, you walk in you look around you got in somehow and There's very hot women and they seem to be separated from the main dance floor right there on tables or there. They're in groups Those girls are brought there by promoters, right? So there are promoters whose job is basically to be a guy who's got a network of hot girls. He's got good game He's you know He's a he's a hustler and he brings them to two clubs and sometimes the clubs pay him per girl or they give them a table They give him booze All those girls are there as part of an entourage with a with a rich rich guy or famous guys or famous in the in The local scene or they're just going there as hot girls knowing that they all get swept up into something That's interesting if they position themselves. Well, you know the reality being that If it's at a certain level of attractiveness And it's known as a like a glamour or location It's very very unlikely that any of the top-tier girls will go home with any guy that's on the dance floor Unless you know, I've seen less it was grand, you know, like a really heavily trained night game killer And talented as well those girls are going to those scenarios to look to get to milk the best what they perceive to be the best or most expensive or most Validating or most exciting or most drugs part of the night and that is that is usually run by Guys who've set up their funnels, right every club in them on the planet Has regular guys who've gone in there and set up what we're talking about, right? They've set up lifestyle design Machinery they've positioned themselves towards the top. They've created funnels to bring girls in they work the ratio they have resources and Currencies that are valuable which might be cocaine. It might be Access to this couch. It might be booze. It might be the feeling. I mean actually overall It's a feeling right? The girl goes out to get a feeling of I'm sexy. I'm important. I'm better than other girls I'm having fun You know, I'm the center of attention I look beautiful right I'm having a great night I'm excited You know all those things so she she's going to navigate where that stuff is And the reality is the guys that run the after parties are the guys that have set that up within that scenario So they're funneling girls up and then they swipe off the cream and they take it home That's how it works right now this this works almost exactly the same whether it's The Soho house glamour club in London or a hippie dance festival There's just different light. There's just different Hierarchies right in the hip I've said I've been to hippie festivals where there is a massive class system And it's you know, I go with my one one tent and my buddy in my like can of baked beans I am a useless prospect to any hippie go to any beautiful hippie girl there. I got nothing to offer She can sleep in the dust by herself whereas the dude that brings the teepee and the beanbags and the you know, this the Nice cooking setup and the weed And the LSD and the the van that's got like a nice Mattress to sleep on and maybe has air conditioning even whoa That guy is is the fuckin Bill Gates of that Festival, right? No, it's these not gruesome. That is the... T-Pain. Is he- does he get lots of girls? Fucking hell. Who- what? T-Pain's not around anymore. Who's the rapper that's famous now? Kobe Bryant? Ah shit, he's dead too. Drake. He's the Drake of that TV festival. God damn it, I'm getting old. Maybe I need to hire someone to once a year just fill me in on what the cool- what the young kids are doing these days. They sit me down for once- once a year. It's like a Trump briefing. It's like, okay, Mr. Marshall, so Trap music. What? Oh, I don't want to know about that. You're gonna have to learn, sir. All right. So... Yeah, there's some- there's some things to think about in terms of parties. Because the great thing about a party, if you do it well, is you become those motherfuckers. You become the top of the club. You become the Drake of the hippie scene or whatever it is. And it doesn't take a lot. It requires you to set up something which is fun to be at. Which, remember, just requires lights, music, something to do. Drugs, let's cover in a moment. Drugs and alcohol. And that there is less girl- less men than girls. So therefore, the girls are like, oh, there's a hierarchy here and these girls- It's- it's very funny to see this. Women's- women's, like, attraction to the- to the leader of the packs, which goes off a lot. And it goes off- but remember, it only goes off if she thinks the pack is good, is useful, or sexy, or important. Right? So, you can be the leader of a pack that she has no interest of being involved in and she won't be triggered. But the moment she wants to be part of that world, she will be attracted to the- to the guys that are running the thing. And this is where a bunch of dorks, like us, can suddenly become cool. That's what we did back in high school. We put on space house parties. It was me and the dorkiest of the dork. We were total losers and we put our shit together, put on a cool party, and we all got laid. And now, after that, we were cool. And then we made- we did it a couple more times and then we were like, yeah, we've- we've earned our right to be weirdly cool and we're getting the benefits of it. Right? So, this is- and that's- and it's- it's a different thing. If I want to try and climb my way up, walk into a Glamour Club and try and get to the top of the food chain, good luck, right? Like, by yourself, untrained. I've only seen Travel Bum do that and Flows do that. I've seen, yeah, two, three, maybe four guys who can walk in cold into an extremely stratified top-down dominance hierarchy and charm and hustle and game their way to the top in a single night, right? That's- that's an extremely advanced skill and I- and a subset of personality, which I don't have either. So, I mean, I've- I've never done that. I've gone in, but I've gone in and ruled a scene in one night when I've been invited in, when I've had a good gatekeeper in, and when I've gone in with a- with- with wingmen and an entourage to- to make it work, right? But much easier, actually, it takes more outlay, it takes more work and planning, but it is overall much easier to control the environment and you just build your own club. Remembering that a club can be a picnic, you know, the club can be- sorry, whoever it was that took a group of people canoeing down the canals of Amsterdam, right? Like, that's still- that's your club. You just want to make sure that if you can be in charge of it, then you will just trigger these switches in women, and men too, that are kind of primal and hard to fight.
