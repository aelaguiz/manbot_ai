You look very friendly, very open. I'm not really in a rush today. That's good, you're a little dreamy a little. Yeah, I got some good music on. That's good. Before you drive off, would you exchange numbers? Would you like to meet up again? I've been really into self-development, habits, productivity, books lately. So one trick I stole is my morning cocktail. Obviously, you should drink a lot of water after you get up. That's common knowledge, like your body loses water. But also your body loses a lot of salt and electrolytes while it's asleep. So I'm literally just creating a cocktail with water, some lemon, and some good pink Himalayan sea salt. Contains more than 60 minerals. I'm just putting that together and chug it together with my supplements. I can tell you more about that, but I guess Shea is the master on supplements, so I stole some knowledge from him as well. So this is how I basically stay alive. I don't eat food, I just live on amazing, like extravagant elixirs and powerful tonics from all around the world. And this will get my body in a kick mode right away, right from the start. So that's the first thing I do every morning. Right, so who am I? What am I doing here? Hi guys, my name is Alex. I'm from Austria, 26 years old, which probably makes me the youngest member of the Natural Lifestyles coaching team now. And how did I end up here? Basically, I've been with the guys for the last over four years, but behind the camera. I was responsible for filming, editing, filming all the infields, filming the daily naturals, getting all the content on YouTube, and everything that comes after. So I've been basically following Shea, Liam, James, the whole team for the last four years behind the camera. I've listened to all the infields, I've edited all the infields, I know the content in my sleep. And I'm now, after also grinding on the streets, meeting girls in different cities around the world, seducing them and ending up with them in my bedroom. Hi again. Wait a second, I just wanted to say good morning, but then you gave me such a cute smile. Well, before you go, what's your name? Are you going to the new school? What's the new school? I am from Austria and I'm here for a month. I'm not going to school here. So you know a guy who looks similar? I think I'm not him. But I'm me. What are you doing today? I have to go to class. Like musical school? Yeah. Are you late? Because you're like... I'm in a rush, yes. Okay, cool. You're in a rush. I need to go the other way. I know you don't know me. Do you want to be friends on Instagram and in a taxi? Instagram? Sure. Do you have Instagram? I haven't. I'm now in a position of being a coach as well. And I'm super honored. I'm super excited. I love the job. I love to see students change coming in on day one, going through a massive change within seven days and putting them out into the world, welcoming them to their new life in every workshop. The question is, how do the students feel after four or five days of massive approaching, massive infield, getting their mindsets shifted, having a lot of breakthroughs? They are exhausted for sure. It is a very intense workshop. We cover inner game. We cover outer game a lot. We do infield every day for hours. We have roleplay classes where we have girls. Let them go through drills with girls. They're getting feedback from actual females. That's the best thing you can hope for. And I'm sure they're exhausted, but amazingly content and surprised how much they can change in four or five days. And so they're definitely exhausted. They will be excited about the coming three days because there is still a lot to come. We still have to cover a lot of conversation techniques and we still have another roleplay class where it's about touch. So how do you not only talk to a girl, but if you end up on a date, how do you touch? How do you escalate? How do you respond when she's maybe standoffish or you reach your limits? Like how do you react to that? To be a seducing lover, you're escalating, but you also respect her boundaries. What's the best reaction to that? And on top of that, students shouldn't be too hard on themselves. Like they often forget day game, connecting with people and meeting girls. It is a numbers game. You cannot expect to talk to five girls and then end up in bed with two of them. I really want to say I don't want to, but I of course wants to. Let me tell you a secret. You will survive. Yeah. It's way more dangerous crossing that street right now with all those cars than talking to that girl. Nothing will happen. I'll be here. She loves you. I would do everything not to approach, which is so stupid, because that's why I'm here for. It's like going to the gym and expecting if you pick up the weight and do this three times, that suddenly your biceps will be huge. It just doesn't work like that. It's the same here. So we remind them approaching, even if you get rejected, even if it doesn't go the way you wish it would go, you still did your job. You know, you still opened yourself up. You gave her a compliment. You gave her the opportunity to engage with you. And if she doesn't want to take that offer, it's fine. So it's very important to remind the students of that and to set them up for a path behind the workshop. Like we have them for seven days. Sometimes four days, sometimes 10 days on the Eurotour. And then they are on their own. So we want to give them mindsets, beliefs, techniques, how to continue approaching in their life after the workshop. Super important. I just want to know how did you do yesterday? What was the main stuff you worked on that you know you still have to work on? What were your main sticking points? Yeah, my sticking points, my voice. Right now, I'm talking stronger than I used to talk. What I usually talk like this is, they're like, people, what? So that's my voice. I think I'm getting there on more or less handle the interaction. Not perfect, of course, but more or less relaxed. One thing that I noticed is when the girls react to me, like I just try to get the interaction done so I can go back and move to the next one. And you blow yourself out a little bit by trying to close too early, right? Yeah. Although you could stay in a little longer. Yeah. And I think, I mean, like always calm yourself, be in the moment, always handle objections so far. What do you want to get out of this session? Well, I want to see how far I can take it. Maybe ask a girl to go for a drink, if that makes sense, by the way. You mean straight away? Instant date or? Yeah, instant date. The situation looks like that way. If not, just get the number and text her right away. At least still getting numbers. I guess that's the level I'm starting to be on for now. First, what's approaching now is like getting numbers. I think later dates or whatever is the next. Okay, we'll do that. How about you, Marco? Yeah, just being more calm in general. Having the voice down here, giving her the space, leaving the time, not nodding, not approving everything. You're very positive, happy. And the voice goes up a lot. It does. So that's basically what you want to work on. Just continue. That's what I want to do with you guys today, is like be a little more of a bad guy. Challenge the girl a little more, put a little more pressure on her. With the mindset of that's what she wants. She wants to get taken out of her daily routine. Everything is great, always. Especially hot girls. Everybody's always approving of them. And we want to today challenge them a little bit. When they tell us something, be a little suspicious. Be like, you're really sure about that? Is that the right thing for you? And stuff like that. Okay, let's roll. Hi. No, don't talk to me. He didn't bring you a line yet. What did you do? Like, no. Oh really? Okay. Now I want to try. Hi. Hi, how are you? I saw you from over the street. That's not a nice hand gesture. I'm just being friendly. No, I'm on a 24-hour project. All right, I see. I hope you get after that. I really like that. Do you have a business card? No, no business card. I work about here. Awesome. Have a wonderful day. Hi. Hi. I saw you from over there. I want to say hi. You look a little shocked. Oh yeah, no, I just... Okay, hi. Hi, I'm Marco. Annie. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. You have a very open energy with you. Just wandering around, or what are you up to? On my way home. Oh, right. Yeah. From work, I suppose, then? School. School. What school are you in? I go to Sotheby's Institute. Oh, right. Yeah. Oh, you have very beautiful eyes. You have beautiful eyes. Oh, thanks. That's good. One thing in common. What are you doing in this neighborhood? Well, I live in East Village, actually. I just wanted to... I was in Chinatown. Okay. Just wandering a little around. Okay, nice. Well, I suppose you live here, is it? I've never been down here. No? No? It's a good neighborhood. I like it. How is it called? What city? Officially, this would be called Two Bridges, but I call it Chinatown because no one knows what Two Bridges is. Yeah, right. I wouldn't know. I would really like to know you better. Would you like to get some coffee or tea? Are you a tea or coffee person? I have a lot going on for school this week. That's very fun. That's fine. But it's been nice talking to you. Very nice talking to you, too. Marco. Hi. At the end, I think she wasn't that sure not giving me her contact. So I probably could have, if I would have been a little more firm, and not directly said, well, okay, well, then not. Like not directly really approved. Did you ask for her contact or did you only ask for tea or coffee? I only asked to hang out, yeah. Right. That's why she wasn't even sure. Of course. Because you didn't even ask. Yeah, we come to that later. Basically, the main things, we talked about it in the morning. Repeating, repeating, repeating. You repeated everything she said, basically. It's cool. I got a set of ears. All right. And you did not leave a single pause in the conversation. You jumped in right away, always. And everything was positive. She was really hot. I could not think about anything. I don't even remember what we were talking about somehow. Like it was... Well, then shut up. Yeah. Even if she's so hot that you don't know what to say. Then just like, you have to learn how to pause, especially with a hot girl. Everything went blank. And I just thought, oh, I found someone to talk to. Finally. Let's get her out here. Yeah, for the next one. Yeah. Chill out. Like be like, hi, I'm Marco. Like the one trick I have for students literally, and it feels super strange. But whenever she says something and she finishes her sentence, in your head, you count to three. And you're not allowed to talk until you count it to three. Oh, fucking hell. I can't. Just say, hi. Just say, hi, I'm Marco. Hi. You look funky. What are you up to? Hi. That's nice. Have a wonderful day. Good, we did it. Your voice is still like... I was so amazed by your beauty. I didn't really know what to say. I'm not trying to be rude, but I'm rushing to get back to work right now. That's fine. Have a wonderful day. That's good. We don't know yet if she doesn't want to get your number or doesn't want to go on a date. She doesn't want to be rude and say you suck. She's like, I don't want to be rude. I'm not going in a 10-minute conversation with you right now. And you're like, don't worry. Before you go, I know you don't have time now, let's chat later. Talk to the girl on the back. Hi. I know you're in a rush. You look very friendly, very open. No, I'm not really in a rush today. That's good. You're a little dreamy, a little. Yeah, I got some good music on. That's good. Having a good vibe here in New York. That's cool. Yeah, it's nice not being in a rush. Before you drive off, would you exchange numbers? Would you like to meet up again? I don't know. What? I mean, I don't know, like as friends? That's totally fine. I wish you have a wonderful day. And again, she didn't reject you. Yeah, well, she wanted to be friends. No. She said, I don't know. Would you exchange numbers? Would you like to meet up again? I don't know. What? I don't know. I mean, I don't know. You met her 20 seconds ago. As friends. Like, it was clear that my voice is too high. I'm just a friendly person. Like, I just want to be. That's again your interpretation. Like, again, you didn't get rejected. You didn't say, you didn't. She didn't say no, yeah. She didn't say no. You, she said, I don't know. And then you have to call it out. Of course, it's strange. Of course, she doesn't know. Of course, you have to be. I know, it's strange. We just met. Let's, or like, let's imagine what could be her worry. Why is she saying, I don't know? Why is she not instantly like, okay. Could be a serial killer. Yes, for example. In my, in my. But you don't seem like one. That's the thing. I'm, I think in my position, in my situation, I'm just seem really too, too friendly again. Like, too, she doesn't need another friend. But the way you say it is like, too friendly again. Like, she just met you the first time, you know. Yeah, but. You have those reference experience. Yeah. The way she sees it, I think, is, well, we just met. I don't know you. Maybe you are a guy who texts a lot. Maybe you, like, she doesn't know you at all. So you have to be, you have to see that, her situation. And be like, don't worry. I'm only gonna send you one text. But I had to try, because you're cute. Of course. Hi. Hey. Hi. I'm Marco. Hey, I'm Manon. Well, hold on. Didn't introduce myself yet. No. You did. I did. Not good enough. I'm gonna keep walking now. Yeah. I got a boyfriend, so I'm gonna. Oh, that's a shame. Stick to that. Alright. Really? Why would it be a shame? For me. It would be a wonderful thing. It is a wonderful thing, but just not for me, right? But I'm happy for you. In that way. Have a good day. You too. Bye. She did reject me now, right? She has a boyfriend. That's true. It's not about me. Approach her. The one with the. Like, oh, I really want to say I don't want to. But I, of course, wants to. Let me tell you a secret. You will survive. Yeah. Way more dangerous crossing that street right now. With all those car and talking to the girl. Nothing will happen. I'll be here. She loves you. Handsome German guy. Right. She wants you in here a lot. Hi. Hi. No, no, don't be afraid. What's up, man? Just wanted to say hi. You look very sophisticated. Very nice. Thank you. So do you. Cool. What are you doing? I'm just walking around. Where are you from? Germany. Willkommen. Very nice. Prost. Where in Germany are you from? Near Frankfurt. Cool. I went to Munich once. Got super drunk and went over fast. That's what you do there, right? I know, right? Yeah. Cool, dude. Yeah, you've got a really. Are you here or just visiting? No, just traveling. Visiting. I think we should grab a tea sometime. I have a boyfriend. Really? Yeah. Thank you, though. Hello. What's your name? Marco. Hi, Marco. Lisa. Nice to meet you. Are you going to be around here? Yeah. Yeah, sure. Cool. So maybe I just check in every day and see if the boyfriend's still there. Yeah, sure. Cool. All right, let's do that. Have a wonderful day. See ya. Hi. I just saw you walking past. Had to say hi. Hi. You have a very nice aura around yourself. Oh, look at your smile. Wonderful. So what are you up to? I'm late to meet a friend right now for coffee. I just got out of class. Oh, okay. So you're deep into studies? Yeah. That's cool. Well, just hanging around, I guess. Well, nice meeting you. Well, it was nice meeting you, too. Have a good one. You, too. I do have to ask. Once you're done with meeting your friends, would you grab a team with me? Maybe. Oh, that's good. I like that. Would you exchange contacts? I'm just going to write you just once, if you're not in the mood then. Yeah. So what's the easiest for you? Telephone numbers? Yeah. I got yours, I think. It's 01, right? Uh-huh. All right. Have a wonderful day, then. Talk to you soon. I'm so happy you walked in again, because I would have made you anyway. You're like, okay, I guess I give up. And then you realize, well, again, I didn't get rejected. Let's try to get her number and continue this later. Yeah, exactly. And she likes me. Yeah, you're right. So I really take this, that if I ever feel like this again, I have to approach. There's no way around that. Hi there. You saw you taking a picture of your juice. I'm just curious. What is it about? Oh, I'm just taking a picture. Yeah, but what's the juice? Sorry? What is it? The juice they have? I'm just taking a picture of this. Yeah, I'm not. Okay, yeah. I think what I'm trying to ask is, what is it important on the juice? Or what keeps your attention from it? Nothing. Oh, it's just randomly. Yeah. Okay. So you're like a spontaneous person? What? You are like an spontaneous person? Would it be fair to say? Sorry, I'm kind of in a rush somewhere. All right, well, you don't look in a rush, but I will let you go. Bye. Like, we want to make it about her, right? You could say, it was cute how you take a selfie with your juice. Or it's important to tell people that you're healthy, right? Or something like about her, not just what's in the juice. Like, you don't really care, right? If you want to know about juices, you would look it up online. Hi there. Excuse me. I know this is a little unusual, but I think you're a very attractive woman. What's your name? Julia. Julia? Alonso. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. What are you up to? I'm going back to my building. Oh, to your building? So you are from here, from New York? Yeah. Mind if I walk you just to the corner? Thank you. All right. Have a good day. Bye. How do you feel? It was good. What? No, it was good. I mean, she was on it like, yeah, no, thank you. I'm fine. I got her attention. She stopped for a sec. She kept walking. I kept walking. I'm nice. You're repeating a little bit what she said. Yeah, I know. Like, right? Like, all this shit. You're aware. I'm starting to get it. To your building. All right. Yeah, that's good. So we want to stop doing that. Excuse me. I have to stop my friends a little bit. What? I was walking with my friends, and I have to stop them a little bit because I want to know you. No, it's a little unusual, but I just want to say hi. What's your name? Hi. I'm Anna. Ella? Anna. Anna? Hi. Alonso. Nice to meet you. Hi. What are you up to, Ella? Just chilling? I'm working on a class. For a class? Yeah. Mind if I sit with you maybe two minutes? Sure. Sure. What class is it? It's a class about disaster. All right. So are you getting ready for it? Yeah. All right. All right. So are you getting ready for the apocalypses? The apocalypses? Yeah. Because you're taking a disaster class. Oh. No, we're just learning about the way that... Well, it's like disasters in America, so we're learning about the ways that disasters in America have affected our future. Like, we went to the 9-11 incident last week. It was a bad day. Okay. So you said... We're still like terrorists, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's just like a class about disasters. No. It's just like a... Yeah. So it's just like a class about disasters. Like, we're learning about natural disasters, like Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Hurricane that hit Puerto Rico. Okay. Hurricane Katrina. I guess I'm trying to figure out what was your motivation to take that class. Well, I signed up late, so... All right. Yeah. Well, I guess I will go back to my friends. Anna, did you say it's your name? Yeah. What was your name? Alonso. How do you say it? A-L-O-N-S-O. Alonso. Alonso. Yeah. You got it at the first. That's kind of interesting. I tried. Good. Good. All right. Boy, you got it. Boy, you got it. Boy, you got it. Boy, you got it. Boy, you got it. Boy, you got it. Boy, you got it. Boy, you got it. Boy, you got it. Boy, you got it. But before I go, let's change numbers and... You seem to be an interesting person to talk with. I mean, I have a boyfriend. Okay. Boyfriend? Yeah, I have a boyfriend. But you say boyfriend. Like I'm dating someone. No. With an S. I have a boyfriend. Like I'm dating someone. Okay. May I ask you something kind of serious? Are you marrying him? No, I'm just dating him. Oh, look at you. Well, all right. People look around. I mean, they turn around. No. No? No, it's pretty serious. Okay. That's the question I want... The answer I want to expect here. Yeah, like I'm pretty... Pretty serious? Yeah. Nothing wrong with that. I respect it. And a pleasure to meet you. Yeah, me too. Bye. Bye. You still did the repeating thing quite a lot. Quite a lot. But mainly I want you to work on your voice. My voice? Yeah. Again, like, you have to, I don't know, talk to me like... Hey. Say it. Hey. Hey, excuse me. Excuse me. How are you doing? Doing good, and you? How was your day? It was great. How about you? I know this is strange. I know this is strange. I know this is strange. I know this is strange. I know this is strange. Don't worry. Don't worry. Don't worry. Don't worry. It's cool. It's cool. Yeah. Talk a little bit more quicker, more up. Otherwise, they're going to fall asleep. Excuse me. I just saw your bus walk, and I think you look pretty stylish. Are you into mall fashion? I'm not. Oh, you're not? No, thank you. Oh, okay. Mind if I walk with you at the end of the corner? I know this is a little weird. Why are you up? How about you? What field are you in? Say what? What field are you in? I'm actually an engineer. Oh, wow. Oh, do I look like an engineer? What is your name? Alex. Alex. Electrical engineer. Oh, nice. Software. Really? Where are you from? I'm actually from Mexico. How about you? I'm Russian. Russian? I wouldn't tell that. Cool. What are you doing in New York, if you don't mind asking me? Living my life. Living your life. I like that. Yeah. So you're following a dream? Oh, I have a lot of dreams. Are you really an electrical engineer? I am. May I ask you a question? Sure. Can you program my scales so they show weight less, for example, 10 pounds? If I step on them, it will show less than 10 pounds. Yeah, you can do that. What's your name, by the way? Olga. Olga. Alonso. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. So you want to develop a system that shows you less weight? Yeah. May I ask you why? Yeah, because I also work for a beauty industry. And we need our clients to see their weight less than it is. Okay. So, yeah, I was looking for someone to program your scales. That's an interesting approach. Would that be to motivate them to keep going, or is it just to, like... What's the reason behind it, if you don't mind asking me? Because people like themselves when they weigh less. Okay, that's interesting. That makes sense. All right, Olga. It was nice talking to you. Sure, nice talking to you. I will let you go. Bye. Okay, have a good day. Yeah. Did you like her? Say, actually, you're really friendly. Let's continue this chat over coffee. Before I go, actually, you're very friendly. I would like to continue this chat later. If you don't mind, we can exchange numbers, so we can go for a coffee or something later. All right. Oh, you're married? Wow. Yeah. But thank you, I appreciate it. All right. Bye, then. Good luck. Thanks. How do you feel about it?"}
