Because I'm effect body. Yeah, it would feel like a James Marshall. I'm like, I just feel like Jimmy Jojo. Day one on the workshop is always first about the mental battle, the internal struggle of helping guys to get over what it is that they came to me to get over, which is fear. The primary reason people come to work with me initially is to try and move through blockages that have separated them from connecting with their desire and with women. And the guys that work with, that I work with today and always, perceive initially that women are creators of fear in their lives. They are actually fairly rigidly attached to deeply held ideas that a woman on some level is an existential threat, because that's really what real fear is. Like real fear, if we look at it on the primal level, the way that it's activated in our body as an important defense mechanism or important mechanism of self-preservation is in regards to things that can hurt you and damage you or kill you. And the reality is certainly in this modern day and age that you're very unlikely to experience any kind of damage from going and meeting a woman. And my job is to help guys to maneuver through the maze of their beliefs and self-defense mechanisms to get to the point to understand that this is not real fear they're dealing with, actually at all. It's not really even anxiety. What it is, is a bunch of feelings, some physical feelings, emotional constructions attached to physical feelings and then mental ideas that rationalize these and create a self-enclosed little loop that says, don't go outside of your little bubble. Don't go and take a risk because it might be damaging. And it's important initially for the guys who come and work with me or you guys there to understand that your deeply held beliefs around what women and men are around the courtship models that you're allowed to engage in and what the consequences of stepping outside of what everyone says you're allowed to do, but mostly those are not real. And it can be really hard to admit to yourself that you've been living some kind of lie or that you've been held back from achieving what you could really achieve and getting amazing wonderful women into your life simply by understanding that it was all an illusion. The fear was really not real all along. And that's a strange aha moment for a lot of guys when they first step through their social fears and see that they're not really fears and that they were just protecting their ego and go and talk to a girl and she's fine or they get a number or she rejects him and it wasn't a big deal. And then he has to look back and go, fuck those rigidly held beliefs of mine around how women really are going to treat me or of course you can't do this or women are always like that or I'm not good enough or any of those things held up to the stark light of real evidence. Then you have to go, fuck yeah I may have wasted some time. And that's all right, we still have time but really important to notice this. Otherwise you can simply have your limitations or you can have growth. You can't really have both of them. Which one do you want? The interpretation of attractive female, my desire or James or someone pushing me to go and talk to her. Then resulting in a bunch of physical sensations going off. You get activated in your body and you guys know what those are, right? Butterflies, heart beating faster, breathing shallow, sweating something. It's okay, it's kind of a lockdown, shut down feeling. Yes, twitchings of various types. Okay, so you guys know, right? There's a whole bunch of different stuff. You'll all have your own individual symptoms and then there's common stuff. But what I want us to start to be able to do is, previously if you interpret that as, okay those things are happening therefore I'm afraid, therefore I have anxiety, therefore I have fear of embarrassment etc. Let's shift that to a neutral which is using the technique I've given you. Liam says, go and do this weird thing and you're like, fuck and I'm scared and you're like, are you scared or are you activated? Okay, do I have anxiety or do I have energy? Which one's true? The one that's most useful. The one that's most useful to us is, okay I'm activated, there's some stuff popping and going off in my body. That's just my body preparing to go into some new situation. Humans like being homeostatic. We like being fairly warm and comfortable and keeping ourselves in an even predictable state. Which is good for kind of surviving in a normal way. But if we want to go out and meet hot girls, we're going to have to step out of our comfort zone and outside of the comfort zone will be all this activated sensation. Most of what goes on inside your mind is not revelatory, it's not new. Most of what we think is cyclical, we have these kind of patterns of thought behaviors that we run over and over again in our minds. Doubts and worries and fears and opinions and gossip and things that you should have said to that guy when he was rude to you in the coffee shop and so on. And when you want to grow up and evolve, you want to change your mind, then you need to recognize that a lot of the kind of programs that are running inside your mind are not very relevant. And when I'm teaching guys meditation, what I'm showing them to do is to step back from that linear monkey mind, the chattering, the repetitious thought loops and to come back to something which is radically new. But when you see it, incredibly obvious, which is simply stillness, which is openness, which is stepping away from these thoughts and coming into presence. And this is kind of a thing that can become a bit of a cliche in modern self-help, talking about the power of now and just being in the moment. And it is a cliche if we just say it like that and do those expressions. But it's very, very powerful and important when put into place as a practice. And meditation is not an idea. It's not a fad. It's an action. And when I show guys how to get out of here and into their body, then they can start to extract themselves from all these thoughts that have held them back in the past. All of these worries and fears, which are simply just boring, repetitious loops that you've been running over and over and over again in your brain. It's nothing new. It's boring. So let's try something radically new, which is just allowing yourself to be the thing that has stopped many of you guys from going and doing what you want in life has been feeling a feeling, interpreting it in a way as if it's a really solid, important, dangerous thing, and then backing away from it instead of allowing it. It can be quite an intense revelation when you really get this and you're like, fuck, the thing that stopped me from doing what I want is this inside my stomach. Oh, I placed way too much meaning upon that. So let's take the meaning out of it. Observe the sensation. Allow it to be as it reaches its peak. It changes. It shifts. Can I still talk to a girl when I'm doing that? Yeah. And then you move through the sensation and you see on the other side of the sensation is just another kind of sensation or no sensation. We often tend to overthink our problems to perceive them as some kind of high level complex issue, often something that is very unique and specific to our brain and our unique experience because we like to feel like we are significant and therefore we like to think that our problems are very complicated and significant, but sometimes they can be solved by very simple things. And one of the simple things that I like to give guys the gift of is to understand their bodies better, especially when it comes to their posture. One of the most powerful ways that I ever learned to become confident, to become clear with my communication, to become relaxed and cool was to learn how to stand and how to move in a way that took stress off muscular areas of my body which align my spine and which gave me much more ability to gain control over my breathing, for example. When you are able to slow your breath down, feel happy and relaxed in your body, then your problems don't seem so big. We are to be aware objectively of what's happening internally and we start with body and sensation because that is the the most real thing that we can access and it's after a while it becomes the easiest thing to access immediately. And when you are approaching girls, the fear or anxiety that you feel is a physical thing. It's associated with thoughts and it has an emotional response, but emotions, how do you know you're feeling emotions? Your body gets involved, right? You don't really have an emotion without the body being involved. If I stand like I stand, which is with good posture and upright, that affects my mood, that affects my thought processes. I used to have this posture, this used to be a posture. Oh God, that feels really bad. Yeah. So what we're going to do is use precision internal awareness to adjust all parts of your body and I'm going to be hitting, returning to this over and over again throughout the week because as I said before, it absolutely affects your emotional lifting up. It's that I'm drawn up, this weight of my skull is now distributed down the center line of my body rather than being held out in space by my shoulder muscles. And very importantly, it affects the way women perceive you. So they won't like necessarily break it down in terms of what's wrong. They'll just get a feeling like, ah, he's nervous. Or they'll just feel like, ah, I don't want to be around that guy. Or it won't even be verbal. They'll just be like, meh. Right? So we want them to have the feeling of like, not that. If I want to be depressed, I can make myself depressed by bringing myself up. I can't really feel particularly confident or engaging. And I'm like, do I really know what I'm talking about? Fuck, I'm a fraud. Like within minutes, I won't feel like James Marshall, right? Because I'm affecting body. Yeah, I would feel like a James Marshall. I'm like, I just feel like Jimmy Jojo. And now I'm like, oh, okay. Yep. Now I feel more like, yeah, that's the one. All right. Which one's real? They're both real. I've lived in that space. I've been here. I've lived in this for years at points in my life or some very tough months. And it's the same, you know, I'm still me, but it's not the good me. It's not the useful me. Sometimes you need to do that. You're just like, all right, I just need to shut it down and be depressed for a week. All right, whatever. My girlfriend broke up with me. I'm going to be depressed. I'm going to wallow in that for a while. And then at some point we go, oh yeah, you stand up like this and then you go and get some sunshine and then you look people in the eyes and then you go, hi. And she goes, hi. And you're like, oh, yeah, okay. This works. And then you move on. I'm not really interested in esoteric meditation systems, ones that require you to have some very complex belief structures or to believe in a certain God or deity or chant something or do weird rituals. I'm interested in things that are practical, tools that can affect my life and my students' life right now. And in my opinion, all good meditation is about awareness. And what does awareness mean? It means shifting focus out of your head, out of your thoughts, worries, fears, dreams, fantasies, imaginations, etc., and then bringing them back to things that are actually happening. And that's simply done through our senses, by directing our focus to what we can hear, what we can touch, what we can smell, what we can taste. And so the first simple meditation that I'll give a guy is helping him to listen, to actually actively listen and investigate his environment that he's in because that helps you to sink into the moment. And from there to move through your senses so that you're getting a real-time experience of what's happening without putting thoughts and feelings in between the experience and your awareness. And now feel the entire sole of your feet, feel the pressure, feel the different texture or gradient of the grass underneath you, feel the heat, moisture, itching, scratching, anything, pulsing, anything that you can feel on the soles of your feet. Any sensation is useful, particularly the annoying ones, pain and pressure and itching, weird pulsing sensations. Don't think, oh, I don't want to feel that. The relevancy of this is we're starting to observe what's happening internally, as in on our body, and we're learning to become more at peace with that. That will become very, very important to you later today. Hi, what was your favorite thing when you were a kid? Playing. Playing? Yeah. It was just the usual scare, like heat from the stomach just rises up and your heart starts beating. But it was okay, I mean. What did you say? She said she liked traveling. Hi. Hi. Hi there. Hello. Just one question. Can I? It was really good. It felt good and her reaction was nice. Hey, sorry, I don't want to sell anything. Just one question. Will you marry me? That feels terrible. Ah, no. Terrible is a judgment. So what I want you to do is close your eyes, now put your hand wherever on your body you feel that feeling. Okay, now put your hand down, now can you describe it for me, what does it feel like? On a very physical level, like is there a pulsing, a pressure, a heat, whatever, what's the feeling? It's tense. Okay. Just like... Okay, so now like you're an acupuncture needle, go into that space, go deeper in there and just stay in that for a little while. Okay, it feels tense, it'll change. Okay, now keep your awareness there but now bring your attention to your feet as well. Feel the pressure of your feet, unlock your knees. Now feel the temperature on your face, on your legs, on your hands. Feel the breeze. Just stay there and notice, okay, there's a whole bunch of things, sensations. It's just your body activated, it's fine, it'll change. Just observe and allow, observe and allow. Alright, so open your eyes. Does that feel better? It's just part of the process. Go do something, I mean the whole point of that exercise is to make a girl think you're a weirdo and for you to deal with that. And you survive. Two hot girls think you're a weirdo. Welcome to my world. Close your eyes, feel it. It's supposed to feel tense, it's supposed to be awkward, it's supposed to be pressure. Feel your entire body all at once. Breathe deeply and slowly. Allow the sensations to just wash over you, to do their thing. It's not personal, it's not permanent. It's alright, let it out. It's alright. What do you think? It's stupid. Don't worry about it, it's stupid. Just all the time I wasted doing things that weren't important. I don't know, I'm still young. Very young. Like what? Say it out loud. I don't know, spending time on my own, like taking care of my ego instead of doing this. Doing things that I don't know, maybe I knew I should have done. I waste so much of my time thinking all these things. I don't know, it just makes sense to cry either. Okay, good. Good to have these moments and to check in on yourself. Everyone's wasting all sorts of time. I've wasted a good amount of time in my life. Everyone does. But you're in a spectacular position because you're 21. Most men are 21, dicking around on the internet, joking off, getting drunk. You're entering into a vastly accelerated path. If you follow it, you don't have to do it super intensely every day like you're doing it now, but something that you integrate into your life. It means that when you reach your peak, which a man's peak is when do you think? 30 maybe? Yeah, 30, 40. You've got 10 years before you're even anywhere near hitting your peak. And the fact that you're facing this shit now, when you've seen this 40-something, and he has a deep, deep sense of regret because he did let 10 years pass. That's pretty brutal. That is something that's a difficult sorrow to carry on to and go, shit, yeah, I missed out on a decade. So the screaming of the Formula 1 Ferraris was messing with mine and Andrea's beautiful moment there, so I thought I'd come down by the river with a jazz's cruiser. That's the end of day one. We hugged it out and I sent him home to kind of process what had happened. And this is the sort of thing that does happen on workshops quite often, is that people have pops and meltdowns and breakdowns, breakthroughs, and it's good. I like it when a guy cries. Not that I'm trying to make him cry, but so much of the time men repress their emotions. It's usually not accepted that men can express what they really need to. And we like to hold a really safe space for guys to be able to just go through whatever they need to. Screaming, crying, shouting, whatever they need to. Anyway, that's it for day one. Looking back over this day, we've gone through a huge amount of material. Firstly, helping the guys to look at the way their minds have been playing tricks on them, the way these concepts in their mind have actually prevented them from taking the action that they wanted, from going and meeting the girls that they wanted, and then giving them really practical tools, meditation tools, to be able to step back and be more objective, to just be more of a witness and observer of what's passing through you, in your physical body, in your emotional space, in your mental space, without getting too attached to it, without putting meanings and stories and heavy judgments on yourself or on an external circumstance. And then, of course, with Liam at the helm, we took the guys out and threw them around the streets to make them go and do a whole bunch of social freedom drills and the beginner seduction drills. To see what it's really like to face your fears, to put a guy in a situation where he is going to be judged, where a girl is going to think he's a bit of a weirdo or maybe a bit creepy or whatever it is that he's been most worried about. Because most guys I work with are very concerned about what people think about them. Because they consider themselves, and they are, to be good, nice, moral, upstanding citizens. And they're very concerned that a girl or a stranger or the witnesses around might perceive them to be creepy, weird, sleazy, awkward or whatever. So we deliberately put them in those situations. And they all survived and actually had some fun doing it. So I'm looking forward to tomorrow where we get to take them out and really start to work on the nuts and bolts of approaching girls and getting things started. And if you'd like to get things started, then you should come and see me. I'm doing a bunch more workshops this year and they're selling out fast and I'm really good at what I'm doing and I'm enjoying it. So you should come and join me in my prime as I maraud around the world helping you to crack through your barriers and get the ladies that you want. And I'm going to go and chill out. Try and stop the girl on the rollerblades quick. You're really cute, so I had to run after you. What are you up to today? I come with my sister and my sister waiting for me at that place. Nothing with my mommy and my auntie. Just I play here. Actually I didn't find any place to play ski there. And I don't know where I should play skate there. Play what? Play skate? Just here in Diak. I don't know where. Another place. A special place. Oh, because those are fast ones, right? You can go like really fast on them. And here I can go fast. Okay, cool. Why do you like going fast? What's your reason to do that? I like it. I'm a fan of fast in driving or in horse riding. Always fast. Oh, adventurous. I have to run. I have to go meet some friends. But are you free tonight for a tea? So we can continue this very pleasant conversation. I will see, okay. Yeah? Tonight? What's the best way to stay in touch? You have WhatsApp or Viber? Yeah, Viber. I have WhatsApp too. Okay, then let's do WhatsApp. Do you play skate? I used to be a skateboarder, you know? Skateboarding, like tricks and all that. Yeah, I don't do that. I don't have those. But that one is so hard. Skateboarding? Oh yeah, skateboarding is very hard. But it's a lot of fun. So you're meeting your family right now? Yeah. And are you available like 8, 8.30? 8.30 I will speak to my family. Okay, sounds good. We'll just text. Okay, I'm so happy to meet you. Bye-bye. My aha moment yesterday was the one when James said... So, feedback. Okay, firstly, would you have ever thought that it's... that you could just run after a girl on rollerblades and stop her? Okay, so... Alright, so knowing, realising that there are so many opportunities that you go, oh, I can't do that because... Can't do that because she's holding shopping. Can't do that because whatever. Yeah, if you can run faster than the rollerblader, then you can stop her. And she was fucking cute. Already in that first interaction, I've got some ideas about where your issue is. Because you talked about your issue being escalation. And I think you probably think that that means certain points down the line that you're not getting involved in. Right from the get-go, as we say in Australia, from the get-go, you are releasing pressure, a lot of pressure. You're overly friendly. You're overly accommodating. And like, it was... If I wasn't a trained observer and I listened in on that, I'd be like, oh, cool. Yeah, they're friendly. They're both laughing. You know, she's interested. And she's interested, so it could well go. I mean, she's very keen to meet you again. So that's good. It's not an exact sign. It doesn't need to be perfect. But there'll be many girls where this laughing, being a bit cute, investing a bit too much, and you have an upward tonality that happens quite a lot. Now, I'm just giving you a bunch of stuff. You're not going to fix it all right now, but these are the things to start being aware of and start to work on. You missed something right at the beginning because I think you were kind of trying to stay a couple of steps ahead. You were sort of thinking ahead, trying to go, okay, where am I going? Next thing, next thing. If she says she doesn't know where to go rollerblading, what does that tell you? She has nowhere to go. No. She has time. Yeah, but is she from here is the question. Probably not. Can't be because otherwise she would know where to go. Yeah. Right, so it's not a big deal because eventually she told you she was Iranian. And Iranians have beautiful skin when you take their clothes off. But yeah, these are things where there's like little clues that come out. Girls give you little things. The fact that you missed it is not a big deal in that case, but if you always miss those little hints, you miss information that girls are giving you because you could have picked up on it and go, oh, okay, so you're new in town obviously. Yes, I'm from Iran. Okay, the fact that we found that out, found that we would find that out early and later wouldn't have affected the net effect of that interaction, but these are the things where we can start to read between the lines, start to understand what the girl's talking about when she gives little hints, and then not be stuck on ICAM trying to go through a linear process. Shifting away from being friendly and playful and silly and childish maybe to, I'm a man. I'm interested. This is about sex overall. I want to find out about you. That's the sort of thing that sets you up. But later on in the escalation, which actually happens from the moment you lock eyes with a girl, but the physical escalation, you've set precedent for that as you start moving into the more physical aspect. It's the intention that you set early on that creates the momentum later on. Make sense? Okay, cool. That's enough. Let's keep going. When I talk to women, I always release pressure by smiling. You know, I'm easygoing. I can talk to people. That wasn't an issue. And I always wondered, okay, where's the sexual tension? And James pointed that out and I started applying it immediately and I got results immediately. Like, wow, this is different. I'm more for like a serious type, which for me personally is important because some people are too serious, some people are too light, and I'm too light. One of my goals here is when I come out of the office in my world in Berlin and I'm in my computer, I was sitting in front of the computer all day, then I may have those ideal situations where there's a girl standing there. But I'm like on my arm. I don't feel like talking to her. Like I'm in my still, like so much in my head. But now it feels easier to go, to be okay with that, to go up there, express my intent and even also express kind of, hey, I'm just from my office and I'm still like totally in my work, but I saw you and I had to approach you. You're really cute. Let's go for coffee sometime. You see, so I don't have to get in a state and be like, hey, and I can be okay with that mind state. And that's also something that I learned my first day here. Who's been struggling stopping girls? Who's been struggling? So to give you a little bit more clarity on this, we're going to just go through a few stops. All right, now this here. Yeah, it's fine to do this when you are much more adjusted in your own style. But when you just do this right away, a girl might do like this. So be careful doing that. All right, hands down to the side. You can stop me just like this. So you know, when you're coming around someone and the universal sign for somebody to stop is either this or just put it out to the side and showing like there's a barrier. Perfect, man. Perfect. I want to meet that guy. Yeah, that's good. Hey, all right now. Good, good, good, good, good, good, good. Because you're so tense. Are you too close? Yes. Yeah, definitely. How do you get around that? All right. So it's spacing. So one of the things I want you to do is when you come and pass me. All right. You got to realize what's the pace I'm going at. And when you stop me, I will take a few more before I stop. So you have to think about the few more steps."}
