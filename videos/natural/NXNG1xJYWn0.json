Do you feel good? Do you feel high energy? Or do you feel more kind of low energy? Yeah? All right. At this conference, we encourage all types of energy. So if you guys are more on the introverted, low-down, cruisy type, then that's awesome. As you guys know, that is my style. So I won't be doing any more of that, hey there, and making you put your fist in the air. I just had to do it once because I know you're supposed to do that at your first conference. All right? So welcome to the Masculine Mastermind Conference. It is an absolute honor to be standing on this stage. It's fucking great to see you and see that you exist. I wasn't really sure if anyone would really turn up. You were like, are they going to be here, or are we just going to be sitting there and going, right, well, that was an expensive trip to Budapest. It was all a scam. Ten years was just to sting you guys. No, seriously, I mean, we spent a lot of time working on this shit, right? I guess you realize when you see our videos that we didn't just like hold up an iPhone and film it. We put a huge amount of effort into putting together material, putting out the daily naturals and the vlogs and the infill videos, which, of course, are all fake, by the way. Did you know that? Yeah, we pay actresses, and then we spend hours. It's quite hard. You have to rehearse, fucking it up and getting it right, and then I'm like, okay, what would a real person say in this situation? She's like, I think I'd say, I'm busy. Right, that's great. Let's write that one down. No, we don't fake. Did anyone ever think that? And please be honest. I'll forgive you. Did anyone ever think, he's that guy's like, yeah. What do you think now? Have we convinced you yet? All right. You can just tail me through the streets and see if I actually do it ever. So, no, I really appreciate the fact that you guys have got up, away from your computers and traveled, for the most part, across countries, right? How many Hungarians are actually in the room? Just one. And I'd like all of us individually, at the end of this, to go and apologize to him for coming into his city and causing a mess. And Teodora, you go and warn all the women on the streets. We've all told all our girlfriends, you have to stay inside this weekend. There's no going out of the house. So, who came from the furthest away, do you think? Someone's like, yep. Where from? West Coast, Los Angeles. West Coast, LA. Yeah, represent. What's that? What do you got over there? LA. Nice. Brazilians. Fuck, yes. So, people flew over oceans. Yes. Melbourne. Melbourne. Did you come all the way from Melbourne? Ah, and did you bring me any pork ointment? Ah, shit. I should have asked you to. All right. Well, welcome. Okay. So, firstly, I just wanted to pay respects to you. I really appreciate this. This means a lot to us. This is the first time we've put on an event of this scale. And it's interesting because when we first started way back in Melbourne nearly ten years ago, we used to do this kind of thing. We used to get up in front of much smaller groups in the backs of pubs and, you know, dodgy little kind of meet-up groups or the back of an RSL, which is like a return, like a pub with a bowling green and some old men in the front drinking their beers as people are sheepishly filing and out the back, like, just the sex things this way. Something written on a bit of paper, like, you know, don't ask any questions, it's that way. And so, but we haven't done anything like that for years. And this is the first time in ages that I've got to get up and stand up in front of a group of people. And so, I hope you'll be kind to me as I try to remember how to be a presenter. And we're going to get into some cool shit. So, the purpose of this weekend is to fill your brains with all sorts of ideas and to make you stretch intellectually and emotionally and sexually. Just, we won't be getting you to do that with each other or with anyone else in the room, but to start to ponder and question some of your beliefs and, hopefully, to mean that when you come out of this weekend, you guys are going to be charging. So, firstly, you guys from all different experience levels and so I want to know who here is at the stage in their journey where they haven't really gone and talked to any girls or if they have, it's been sporadic here and there when it was really easy, when the girl's like sitting on a bench and the sun's shining and she's like reading a book that says, please, boys, come and talk to me and looking around. Yeah. So, who's in that stage and there's no, there's absolutely no shame or judgment. Okay, cool. Right. That's awesome. The beginner's phase, which can be hell. This weekend, we're going to be giving you a bunch of foundational materials, some great techniques, some ways to get over the two main issues that men face when they're first starting out at this. Anyone want to guess what they are? Two main issues? Yes. Those things. Yes, you're right. Just getting yourself to go and talk to a girl because you're afraid of that and then when you get there going, what do I do now? Who's done that? Going up there and going, hey, I saw you from there and I wanted to say, she's like, yeah, and you're like, I got nothing, I'm out of here. What's that? It still happens. Yeah. Yes, it still happens. It will continue to happen occasionally for the rest of your life and that's going to be okay when you learn the methods for processing that process. Most men don't come to an event like this, don't come to coaching and don't ever go out on the streets and get anything happening because they don't want to look like a fool. I've met guys who spent years preparing to approach and maybe some of you are like that. If you think about it, if you haven't really been approaching, you have been spending some years. You spend a whole bunch of years looking at girls and going, ah, boy, I hope one of those turns up in my university class and sits down next to me and asks me for a pen sometime. You've been in these situations where you've been waiting and hoping that women would come into your life and now you're proactively coming to a space where you want to go out there and choose, right? Yes? Or does anyone want to just swipe and wait? That technique is not very good, the old swipe and wait. Sometimes I pull out Tinder just to remind myself what the alternative is and I've been doing this series where I've been, I travel to a new country every month at least and so I've been filming gradually this series of like why Tinder sucks and so every new country I go to, I pull out my phone and I go like this, what? And at the end of that, when I run out of matches, I feel like a piece of shit and I'm pretty clear to me that nobody's ever going to love me because I didn't, because the only girl that matched me, I was like, really, okay. And there's girls and I'm like, you're going to reject, you are going to reject me? I can understand why you would but, you know, and so I've gone around the world to prove that okay, that is not the best way to do that because in the amount of time that I can run through a demoralizing list of rejections, I can go out and meet a couple of girls and I can probably get a date. And just on that as an aside, I sat down recently with a lover of mine, I lay down next to her and I said, do you use Tinder, right? She's like, yeah, sometimes. I said, show me how you do it. And she pulled her phone out and she went, you know, we go that way, they go this way. And she's like, no, no, no. And I was like, hang on, stop, stop, that guy, he was pretty good looking, I don't like his shirt. No, no, no. Hang on, what about this dude? He's holding a puppy. She's like, he's looking at me a bit funny, don't like him. No, no, no. It's just, you know, for them, it's a totally different thing. And then the only time she says yes, is when it's the perfect archetype of every single thing that she ever wanted. And if she wants to, she can write to him and say, want to come over here, go, yep. So that's the, you know, that's the different experience of a man who's trying to use technology to get women, as opposed to a woman who can use it primarily, why do women use those apps at all? Is it to get laid? Or is it something else? Validation. Validation. And you would too. Imagine if you just got to go every day and go, I wonder if I'm cute. Hey, you're sexy. I'm sexy. Yeah, I want to fuck you. I guess I want to fuck you. It's just a video game where they get to like, be told that they're cute and sexy. Cool. You can't ruin that by going and meeting some dude and having an awkward date. So anyway, I digress. I don't know why I got there, but I did. Who here in the audience is in a position where they've been doing this for a while. You've been out running around, meeting girls on the streets, in the bars, in the morgues. Don't do that. Sexual health clinics or wherever, whatever. And you're getting something happening. You're getting on dates and sometimes the girl flakes. Most of the time girls flake. That's what they do. Girls flake. Tidora, have you flaked on a man before? She's, yes, I know you have. I'm sure you have. No matter how good you get at this, I'm pretty good. You would hope. And I still get, I don't know, 50% at least of the girls that I get numbers of disappear. And if anyone's like, what? Fuck this. I'm out of here. You're like, you lied. You lied to me. On those videos that look like every girl said yes, no, we've released compilations of us getting rejected. Yeah, it happens. It's always going to happen. So don't feel bad about it. Understand that there isn't, partially this is a numbers game. And that there are certainly ways to improve those odds from all girls flaking or nine out of 10 flaking to 50% would be cool. Because if you go and approach two hot girls, okay, you're going to get a date, hopefully, when you get good at this. So who's at that stage where they're out meeting girls, getting numbers, sometimes getting on dates, getting laid here and there, you know, some of those more advanced levels? Hands up, anyone? Okay. Awesome. All right. So for you guys, and everyone else, as well, but for you guys, we're going to be looking at some bigger concepts. And when we were looking at how to approach this over the weekend, we wanted to be able to hit information that was going to resonate with a whole bunch of different guys. And we decided to construct things in terms of putting together a foundations series of talks where we will be looking at the beginner's stuff, the approaching, the conversation, the dates, the mindsets, however, you never get over the beginning stuff. You guys know that I'm all about principle-based learning. It's not about learning a technique and I've mastered that, so I'll throw that out and move to the next one and the next one and the next one. When I was first learning martial arts, I came to understand pretty quickly that a true master, someone who is very good at their art form, always returned to the foundations, always returned to the beginner's mind, to the basics, because that is where everything comes from. The principles, which I have kind of deconstructed, and originally I did that through looking at martial arts that were either technique-based, where when you punched, then you did this, and then you click that with another technique, and then hopefully had enough techniques to be able to prepare for any eventuality, and then I saw other styles of martial arts which were based around understandings of force, of movement, of angles, of breath, and all of these principles that when you understood those, you could make infinite numbers of applications, and that was what gave me the original inspiration to create a teaching system where I could try and communicate this quite, in some ways, ephemeral or vague or difficult to pin down idea of what it means to be a natural. And all of you want to be natural with women, right? Okay, and what does that mean? Any ideas? What does it mean to be natural? Yeah? A free and easy conversation. Cool. I mean, I've met guys who are really good at conversation, but they don't get laid, so I mean, that will help, sure. What else? Sexual. Sexual what? Just sexual. Just sexual. Everything's sexual. Yeah, a natural is someone who is certainly in touch with their sexuality, who's not hiding it, who's not ashamed of it, and is not trying to trade it or use any weird agendas or tricks to suppress it and then bring it out at weird moments. Yeah, someone who is a natural with women has an ambient level of sexuality happening at all times with women. Of course, if that's too much, then we slip over into sleazy areas, which Liam will talk about in one of his talks. But yeah, there is an element of that, that, okay, my presence, my intention is about sex. Any other ideas? Following your impulses. Your instinct. Yeah. To be yourself. Oh. I'm triggered when you say that. I'm going to talk about that in one of my speeches. So let's leave that one aside for a minute. Don't feel anything weird. That's a common thing that people talk about. And know thyself, as some Greek philosopher said once, I don't know, Socrates or something. Yes, we'll be looking at that, but what does that mean? Practice makes perfect. No, it doesn't. Perfect practice makes perfect. I can practice the same thing, and I've seen it. I've met guys, I remember early on when I was teaching, and I was really trying to get I went around to all sorts of strange meet-up groups, lots of lairs, they called them. Has anyone been to a lair? Maybe that's, yeah, is that still a thing? Okay, cool. Back in the day, that was where we started, and a lair was usually an online forum where guys got together and talked about mystery method and other weird, you know, hypnotizing girls into bed and various tricks you could use to trick them. And there were these groups of these guys all around the world, and I used to go around and speak to them. And there were a few guys who would, like I said, slip in behind the pizza shop and come in and, you know, give the little handshake, and then come in and sit down, and everyone was a bit ashamed. And everyone was like, okay, we're going to learn the stuff to get the chicks. And there were guys that I would talk to, and they would say, oh, yeah, look, I did a hundred approaches on Friday night, and I didn't get anything. I'm like, what? A hundred approaches in a night? I've never, I have never done anything close to that. if i do a dozen approaches in the day that's a big day for me for sure and i said what are you doing hundred times he's like i'm working this one open up you know i just got i can't remember what the uh... maybe was like one of those weird old open as the horse open or something where it's like you like horses right and then the girls is uh... yeah and they run through this whole spiel there was there was also to the strange opens back in the day that was sold as if you say this it works right this is this a and if it doesn't work is some wrong with the delivery or that you should use me to keep practicing and doing it over and over again and so going in practicing the wrong thing in an uncalibrated way without responding to the feedback of of the person you work with won't work right so of course we must practice you can't just do one approach and hope and expect you can get the girl your dreams uh... and if you do do that you gonna lose her if by some amazing chance you happen to just bumbling to the right girl if you don't have experience with women in general it's very hard to uh... high-value high self-esteem woman so perfect practice that's gonna be important it's imperfect practice of the perfect thing right so it's like going out there and trying to do it perfectly every time that's gonna mess you head up go out there expecting to do it in perfectly but you want to be working on what the the right ways of doing things that's what we're here to try and give you guys guidelines uh... and save you hopefully years of trial and error because i didn't have any teachers originally well i did and i'll talk about them a little bit in a minute what else makes a natural being at ease with your imperfections that's really important because we are always going to be imperfect i've done three perfect seductions in my life i just made that number up but let's just say it was three uh... there was not many where like everything i did was just on point and everything i said i was like damn i'm good and the girls said did you just say damn i'm good and i was like yeah and i said that right too yeah that's happened occasionally but i didn't learn much from that the things that uh... the seductions that i learned most from were the ones where i fucked it up royally and then took the feedback and learnt i don't know what i'm just rambling now so i'm going to get into what is my specifically what my speech and i want to open with this it's a question what is it do you think what do you think is the one thing the one like underlying program or driving kind of uh... aspect that makes a man in the long term good at this having self-esteem having a self-esteem okay persistence awareness okay i'm always harping on about awareness right you've all heard me rant about that before surely yeah i will be doing it again so don't think that i'm finished with that yes i mean the foundation we have to have awareness we have to be out of here in this vague thinking aspects or imaginations and all that we need to be in the present for sure confidence okay he said it and he cheated because he already knew and you said it again so you get the mars bar at the end uh... yes in my opinion it is curiosity that is the fundamental driver or engine that will make you get through the inevitable difficult times that will help you to traverse the beginner's hell and it will give you a compelling reason why in the long term why the fuck you were doing this at all i finished a workshop a week or so ago seven day workshop and i was having dinner with the guys at the end we're just chilling out having a glass of wine and talking about the experiences and one of the guys asked me james doesn't it get boring sometimes doing this i'm like what getting paid to travel the world getting laid and teaching people how to do that not what uh... and he said no i mean like you've experienced a lot with women you've met a lot you've seduced a lot of women and you've probably seen more or less what is going to happen like doesn't it get boring knowing that when you go into an interaction with a girl that you probably can see where this is going and then i went oh okay cool yeah that's a that's a legitimate question i had to think about it i had to think about it for a minute and i said honestly no i mean and in fact i'm more interested in this now than i was when i first started because now it's like if you're a i don't know like a biologist and you're standing looking at a at a field and there's a cow there and there's some grass and then there's a little butterfly uh... and then you can see there's some mushrooms growing out of the cows turds and so on you see that in a very different way than the person who just walks up and goes cow shit mushroom that's it uh... if you see the entire ecosystem you see the way all these things interrelate they become more more fascinating and for me over time because curiosity was always my primary driver as i get better and better i see the deeper and deeper nuances i'm endlessly fascinated and every ladies man that i know that is good and good long term has been able to maintain this in the long term and have healthy relationships is someone who is endlessly curious about women he wants to understand them has anyone ever asked a girl this question because i have what's it like to be a woman it's a weird try out they just go woah and one girl said once to me i asked because i'm like i don't know like that is an interesting thing to me i'm like okay there's this whole other experience of humanity of being this thing which is similar to me in many ways and see it's so different and i understand some of it and probably more than most men but still it's still a grand mystery to me one girl said to me it's like being in an endless dance between pleasure and pain and i was like woah if you ask me what it was like to be a man i probably wouldn't have said that what would i say now i don't know i have to think about that curiosity is key for multiple reasons i mean when i first got into this my curiosity was really about like how can i get what i don't have it was more selfish and it was more self-enclosed and solipsistic where i couldn't really see so much outside of my own experience and women were like almost like an alien species to me okay i could see that they had arms and legs and they responded to certain stimulus but i didn't know what the fuck was going on inside their brains or their emotions or their sex drive and so there was a lack a distinct lack of connection there was a massive degree of separation and every time i went up to a woman it was like really trying to negotiate with this alien individual trying to find out like ask random questions like uh... what do you what do you have any pets what's your favorite color uh... you know what time does this place close and just throwing things out to see if they responded to any of it and that was a really important phase and i look back and cringe sometimes thinking about all the retarded things that i asked girls or tried to do uh... but i had no other choice because that was what i had at my disposal when i first started on this journey of going to cold approach which was as john was saying around two thousand six when i first i broke up with a girlfriend who was pretty hot and uh... cool and because i i wanted something more and i'll talk more about that story in the next couple of days but i started going out and approaching girls and i didn't have any mentors i didn't there was no the only stuff that was around then was the indirect methods and the weird you know here's a story that i spent an afternoon memorizing it's a lie and i'm gonna go and tell it to a girl and she's gonna go okay buddy uh... because that's what that stuff did and so who did i have to learn from and i said this before okay i did have mentors the mentors were the women that i met because i had spent many years prior to going in and cold approaching meditating and i'd spend a lot of time investigating myself having curiosity about myself which is an area that is vitally important if you wanna have curiosity about the world you need to also be very curious about what's going on internally and i spent many uh... days in retreat centers many weeks in retreat centers i'd spent years practicing different uh... introspective techniques so that i could understand myself more and what they did is it cleared out space in my mind allowed me to be more present and then therefore to be more responsive and to be able to observe what was going on for the other person so although even although initially there was a lot of distance between me and the women as i was going and trying to figure out okay who is this creature and how do they work i started taking lessons from them women are always always trying to teach you how to seduce them every time you go up and have any kind of interaction with them they try to give you all sorts of lessons problematic is that we don't see those if you run up to a girl and you go hey excuse me i just saw you from over there and she's like going like this and she's like oh yeah sorry i'm actually busy and you're like stepping in front of her and i just wanted to come on i'm just trying to get to the just give me a chance just fucking hang on all of these movements are little lessons of hers she's like i feel uncomfortable with that i'm trying to get past you uh... you're talking you're talking too fast and i'm not really understanding you i'm giving you an excuse because i'm trying to move around this situation because there's negative pressure involved she's trying to tell you all that stuff okay of course she's not consciously thinking all those things in her mind she's responding to your actions and if you're unaware of them and you're practicing the wrong thing over and over again which is you you've seen someone online go the line the day game line is what's the day game line that's the end of it yet starts i just saw you just to let you know i was over here and then i came over here and i saw you what what what was over here and i saw you and then i came over here i told you that i was over there and i had to come over here and tell you i saw you and then what happens in the day game line you give the compliment which is the same one every time i think you look nice i think you look beautiful i think you look cute and then you finish it up with the old kicker which is the okay cool that's the Liam McRae opener you finish it off with the no no hang on well that's those other guys i saw you from over there i thought you looked really cute and my name's James alright that's the day game line and every workshop now that people research us really heavily before they come and do workshops with us i hear these lines come out over and over again and our first few days is really about cracking people out of just repeating the same thing without taking the actual feedback from the girl we will be giving you some very specific uh... examples Liam's going to give a talk on on those first ninety seconds how to make an opener work well and it's not about those words it's so much about being curious to see how does she respond to me right so all of the initial lessons that i had before i found some other guys that were good at this were from actually watching and giving a shit about the other person if you want to be a good salesman you need to be able to understand the needs of the person you're selling to you don't just go i've got this cool thing and here's all the bells and whistles and trust me it's gonna be great buy it that doesn't work so much whereas if you go i perceive that you may have a lack of a need in your life and let me find out a little bit what that is and you can tell me more about that and i can find ways to fulfill that need and feedback to you what you've already told me and i can come to an understanding of what your position is what's going on for you and then maybe you want to buy this thing because it's going to help seduction and sales have some correlations you need to understand very uh... important aspects of the female experience if you want to be out to move through her objections her desires what is the main reason possibly yet probably the the absolutely main reason why women say no to men that they meet on the street that that okay the guy came up and he looks alright he's just okay he's well groomed and he's uh... he's got good posture and he came up and he said the day game line to her what is the main reason a girl says no to that guy stigma the stigma of what okay if she gave a number on the street everyone goes slut that chick just gave a number on the street she's so easy what was the other one someone you said something testing what so she's like alright so a guy wants me let's see what he's made of i'm gonna test him by saying no because i am in charge i mean i'm in perfect control of my emotional state right now i know exactly what's happening and i've and i've decided consciously to test this man to see if he's right if she's russian that is totally the case for many other women maybe not what else he's not present okay so yes it's that one it's fear that's a good because all of the other ones assume the girl knows exactly what's going on she's like oh cool the guy approaching me i'm fine i'm not nervous i'm in charge of the situation and uh... so i'm gonna test him or i'm gonna be aware of the stigma or or the other one that i think a lot of guys think is she's like what i have all the men that i want in my life i have infinite options there is nothing that this man could possibly bring me that i would want that's the that's one that we definitely all feel because when when the girl goes oh no we're like oh fuck she's i'm not good enough or she thinks she's so good that kind of thing that's a reaction that often men have but the primary reason really is some level of fear it may be a fear it's it's it could be a fear of like actual violence or because men are a dangerous prospect random strangers uh... can be dangerous and that is one reason why we'll use a pre-frame to let her know we'll say it even don't worry i'm not dangerous i don't know how that proves it but i just said it so it may be all that or it may just be"}
