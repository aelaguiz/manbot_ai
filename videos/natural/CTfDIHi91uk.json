Sure, I mean... You know, how old are you? 43? Yeah, we can be friends. Oh, get out of here. You think I need more friends? I don't know, but that's it. Okay, well in that case, you're too young for me. Too young for me. In my opinion. No, I decided. I friendzoned you first. Okay, sure. I appreciate that as well. Do you want to be Instagram friends? Because I'm actually fucking cool. Okay. And then you're... No, you had your chance, so don't. It's okay. When you change your mind, don't. It's too late. I won't. Don't worry about it. You probably will. Excuse me. Hi. You look like you had... Did you have a big night? No. What happened? Nothing. Oh, cool. Can I talk to you for a minute? I will have to leave. Can I walk with you for one minute? What for? Just to chat. Oh, sure. I'm not selling anything. Oh, okay. Why would I... I'm Australian. I'm not here to sell anything. Oh. Yeah. What's your name? Yeah. Cool. I'm James. What's up? Nice to meet you. You too. Are you a local? Yeah. I mean, I'm not, but I am. You're an imported local? Yeah, exactly. Right. Where are you imported from? I'm Chilean. Ah, okay. Excellent. Well, I'm an Australian that... I live in Portugal mostly, but I come here a lot. So you're on vacation? No, no, no. I'm here working. I mean, not today, obviously. Not dressed like this. Yeah, I mean, you can work with any... Yeah, it depends on the job. True. Well, I'm not an accountant, so... Yeah, I mean, yeah, that makes sense. I'm not. Yeah, you don't look like it. I could be an accountant if I wanted. Hey, that's a compliment. I know. Not looking like an accountant. I know. And so why did you move here? To study. Yeah? Yeah. And... To study. Okay. And do you like that? Yeah, I love it. I hate it, but, you know, I don't know how it is. You hate it, but you love it? Yeah. Which bit do you hate, which bit do you love? The part where you have to study. Ah, that bit. Yeah, that's annoying. But when I'm able to work, I'm going to love it. Right. And is it a field that you like? I'm studying law. Okay. So I don't really like it, but I can do a lot with it, you know? Yeah, you can be a diplomat or... Oh, yeah. I mean, you could go into... There's lots of things you can do from law, right? It's not law if you don't want to do it. Yeah. And puppy's name? Name? With a T? Yeah. T-R. Very cute. Yeah. Yeah, and how long have you been here? Six years. Ah, right. You are definitely more or less local. Yeah, no, definitely. Yeah. I know more about Barcelona than many Catalan people, so... Oh, don't say that too loud. I'm proud of it. No, I mean, they know it. They have to know it. We have to humble them a little bit. They really don't like us, do they? But it's like, well, too bad. Well, I've been here for six years and I still don't speak Catalan, so... Ah, I bet they don't like that. They really do not like that. I can kind of understand why they don't like it, but it's too bad. It's okay. We're keeping the place alive. Yeah. You know, let me tell you one little story. So, I went to get a really good massage. Like, the best fucking massage I've ever had, right? No, not like that. Just a normal massage. Oh, okay. Just normal massage. Come on. Jesus. Alright, so I walk out and I'm fucked, right? So I'm just walking along like a zombie. Because this woman is amazing. And then I see this shop, which has a smoothie in it. And I decide I want it. So I just walk in and I just take it and I walk out. Because I'm so fucked that I just accidentally stole it. Okay. And I didn't know that you can't do that because my brain was fried. And then suddenly I feel this, like, drip out of my hand. I turn around and there's a very angry Catalan man screaming at me in Catalan. And I'm like, oh yeah, you have to pay for things. Yeah, that's how it works. Well, I forgot that. Yeah, I know. But I just wanted it. Well, you're definitely not an accountant then. Yeah, but then, you know what I did? I was like, well, I'm not a thief, so I'm going to go back. Yeah. So I went back and I went, ah, disculpe, lo siento, lo siento, lo siento. And he's like screaming at me in Catalan. And I said, posiblemente comprar? And he's like, okay. I bought it. I'm like, okay, I'm out of here. Okay, bye. It was very confusing for him. Yeah, makes sense. It would have been confusing for me. I was trying to explain. Explain. Message. I don't know how to say it in Spanish. All right, bye. Yeah, you're like, I'm just kind of high. That's it. Yeah. Well, I didn't have time to do it. I didn't have time to do it. But anyway, so that's how good that massage is. It turns you into a criminal. So I can highly recommend Ascend to you if you want. Name again? Cool. I'm going to not follow you forever. Yeah, I appreciate that. Yeah. Well, I mean, I'm not going to. Even if you want me to, I'm not going to. But do you want to hang out some other time? Sure. I mean, you know, how old are you? 43. Yeah. We can be friends. Oh, get out of here. You think I need more friends? I don't know. But that's it. OK. Well, in that case, you're too young for me. Too young for me. In my opinion. No, I decided. I friendzoned you first. OK, sure. I appreciate that as well. Do you want to be Instagram friends? Because I'm actually fucking cool. OK. And then you're, no, you had your chance. So don't. It's OK. When you change your mind, don't. It's too late. I won't. Don't worry about it. You probably will. All right. I probably won't. Right, you know me. Haven't you ever dated an older man before? Yeah, I have. That's why I won't. Well, that's ageist. Also, if you go for like 25-year-olds, like, are you like a little bit... I go for the person that I saw that I thought I might like. Yeah. I don't know. It's kind of weird. OK, explain. So throughout human history, throughout the entirety of human history, younger women have been attracted to older men and vice versa. Yeah. Since the dawn of time. Yeah. So what's... Since the dawn of time, there's been like slavery and rape and also murder. Those are separate things. Those are separate things. So, I mean, but it's not an argument. It's not an argument. It's not an argument. It's not an argument. It's not an argument. It's not an argument. It's not an argument. It's not an argument. It's not an argument. It's been done forever. It's like a lot of things have been done. But you're saying that it's very weird when actually it's weird to say the other thing? Yeah, no, I don't think so. So do you think 25-year-olds should date 25-year-olds only? No. What's the age range where it becomes not OK? I don't think it's about an age range. Oh, I think you did say it was. It's, I mean, in this case it's very obvious. Well, you tell me where it is. It's not about an age. I don't think it's about an age. So what's the age range where it becomes not OK? I don't think it's about an age. What's the age range where it becomes not OK? I don't think it's about an age. Oh, I think you did say it was. It's, uh, I mean, in this case it's very obvious. Well, you tell me where is the cut-off point. For me it's 30. Pfffft. Five years. You know that 30-year-old men are 16 year-old girls in their mentality. I'm not trying to convince you anymore. Because I've already friends-edged you. Where there is, like, where is this, this is like a scientific study? Or like your opinion? No, no, science. Well, in your experience have 30-year-old men been mature, been able to handle their shit? Um, no. But also not 25-year-olds. Yeah. Also not myself. Right. So, yeah. Maybe you want to go, like, three years up. OK, when a man becomes, like, more or less a man. Maybe around 35. I don't know. You know, I was talking about this with my friend the other day. Yeah. And I don't think so. Like, if you have to go for, if you feel like you have to go... Did you just say, I have to go? What? You're saying, you're about to say, if you have to go for younger women or something? Right? Yeah. I never have to, I don't have to do anything. Sure, I mean, technically you don't have to. I could do whatever I wanted. And I don't know how old you are. But... But anyway, I think your argument's falling apart, but continue. Yeah, I feel like you want it to be falling apart, but it's OK. I'm not trying to convince you, because I friendzoned you six minutes ago. Oh, OK. Well, then, I love that. Um, do you... Honestly. OK, but listen, if you want to be friends, like, that's a serious commitment on my part. Like, I don't just... I don't do, like, hang out friends. OK, and what kind of friends? Like, you know, like you got each other's back. Yeah, I love that. Well, that... We need to build trust over time. OK. Yeah, that's how friendship works, right? Yeah, there's a lot of fake friends out there, right? Yeah. That's why I don't have many friends. So, actually, you're very lucky that I offered that, because I feel like... Ah, you didn't offer it, I offered it to you. No, um... Also, you're so old now that you have, like, memory issues. That's true. But that's because I was a stoner for many years, not because of my age. Oh, honestly? Yes, but I've... And I've also lived, like, 18 different lives in one lifetime, so it's hard to remember them all. OK, pop-off. Which pop-off? The clown? The Russian clown? No, it's a... It's a term that Gen Z people use. Gen Z? Yeah. I'm Gen X. I'm... I don't know what I am. Yeah, you're... Like, I'm like a millennial Gen Z. Were you brought up with the internet? Half of my life. No, then you're Gen Z. Yeah, I'm millennial. No, no, you're Gen Z. I'm, like, sort of millennial, but also Gen X. So you remember life before the screen, kind of. Yeah, 100%. I remember it, in the 80s. Yeah, I would play with, like, spiders and stuff. Yeah, yeah. And then... What's your favourite spider? In Chile we have... Well, you're Australian, so you have many spiders. Yeah, yeah. But in Chile we have one spider, it's called the... Tiger spider, I guess. OK. And it eats the most venomous spider we have in Chile. OK. We have one of the most venomous spiders in the world. I'm sure in Australia we've got more venomous. Yeah, I think Chile and Australia are, like, the top two. Oh, we're like... Yeah. But we've got... We have more spiders. We have more. But we have one of the most venomous. Is it aggressive? Um... No, she just bites you and then your hand starts to die, so... Oh, we have one like that. We have the white-tailed spider, it bites you and it rots. Yeah, literally. That's not a nice thing. Then the night spider, it's, like, super small, but it eats and kills the spider. Oh, OK. So you have to, like, live with her, you know? Like, it's in your house and you're like... Oh, we live with spiders, totally fine. Yeah, that sounds awful, actually. Spiders are fucking awesome. They're the apex predator of the insect world. They've got eight eyes, eight arms. They're awesome. Like, they are technically awesome. Yeah, yeah, they are. They definitely are. Yeah. Like, my mother sent me a video the other day of her. Like, there's one called the Huntsman, it's about that big. It's not venomous. It just hunts things. It just hunts? Yeah, my mother dusts around it. Oh, that's kind of cute, but it's kind of scary. Yeah, she's like, oh, I didn't want to bother it. No, it's like we're neighbours. Yeah, so she dusts around it and then just says, you stay there. I'm like, Mum, that's pretty bad. That's pretty badass, actually. Yeah, that's actually kind of cute, but also kind of scary. That's normal. It's a perfect badass. Yeah, I mean, in Portugal, everyone comes... Like, I have spiders in Portugal at my farm and people freak out. I'm like, these pussy little spiders, what do you think they're going to do? Jump on you and, like, annoy you with their teeth that can't pierce your skin? I don't know. These are pussy little spiders. We have also very furry spiders. Like a tarantula type of thing? Yeah, kind of like a tarantula. But if they don't bite, they don't benefit, so I would play with the spiders. I spent quite a bit of time in the Amazon in Peru. Oh, yeah, that sounds scary. Yeah, it was. And when it would rain, the tarantulas would come in and just sit on the roof above you. Okay. And you'd just be like, yeah. Just, like, enjoying the rain. Well, they'd want to get out of the rain, so they'd come into the Molocca. Oh, okay, because they live under... Well, they're like, that's a dry place, so we'll stay there, and you just have to deal with it. Yeah, you know, I also lived, like, in the Amazon in Peru. Near Iquitos? No, I was in Oriental Itambo. We were living with, like, Peruvian, like, originary people. Indigenous people. Yeah, indigenous people. Yeah, we were too, actually. Yeah, we started in Iquitos, then we went up to somewhere, and then into the jungle to do guess what? Ayahuasca. Yes, ayahuasca. Of course. And then I went to Pacaya Samira. Have you been there? No. Fuck. That's, like, the flooded forest. Like, that's deep Amazon. You know, I actually know more of Europe than of Latin America. That's kind of a shame of that, but that's what it is. I know more of Europe than I do of Australia, for sure. Yeah, that happens, right? Like, you'll never get to know your own... Well... I don't know. I don't know what opinion I have about that. It's just, like, Australia's very big, and, you know, I couldn't... And most of it's desert. Yeah, that's what I was going to ask. So, I saw enough, and now I do other things. Yeah. Great. Cool. Did we already Instagram? I can't remember. I think so. Did you smoke? No. I haven't smoked in two months. Oh, that's not that much. For me, it is. I recently quit, and now I can actually think again. How many years? Most of them. I quit smoking, like, six months ago, and I'm also, like... Now I'm, like, back again. Not smoking, like, my personality. Oh, yeah, yeah. Well, I don't know what my personality was, because it's been stoned for many years, so now this is apparently something like what I am, maybe. Okay, yeah, I mean... I'm getting to know it. Step by step. Paso a paso, yeah. It's coming along. I have a lot of energy, and I can... And I'm being very effective. Exactly. I'm pulling off shit you wouldn't believe. Yeah. Also, like, motivation to live in general. That's also good. Yes, all that. Doing stuff, taking care of yourself. Yes, doing that as well. Yep. I showed him this, like... Blah, blah, blah. I have this artist called Fernando who's doing the mosaic in my temple at my farm, right? Okay. And so last time he came months ago, I was a big stoner. This time he arrives, and he has his... Like, gives me an ounce of very good homegrown. Okay. And I took it, and I gave it to the other stoner there, and I said, Take that. And I didn't even think about it. Blah, blah. I was just, like... You weren't even tempted. No. I mean, I did this. That's good. Take that. Sometimes. But I wasn't later on like, Fucking give me that or I'll kill you. Well, that's great. I was like, chill. Yeah. So I think I might be done. Yeah. Right? That also happened to me, actually. I was like, okay. No, but I still want to smoke sometimes, you know? When it gets very stressful, I'm like, I wish I could just avoid it. Are you the type of... Avoid the world, you mean? I wish I could just numb myself, right? Yeah, look, humans do need to numb themselves at various points. Because life is too intense. I don't think they need to. There's other ways. There are other ways. There are. Yeah, but when you live in this kind of madness, people tend to need... Yeah. Well, they've got to have some kind of release valve. Yeah. Yep, and we all dose ourselves in various ways. Yeah. But I just do it now with madness and coconut water and many other interesting things. With coconut water, what else? Madness. Oh, madness, yeah. And doing so many cool things. Like what? You wouldn't believe me if I told you. Ah, okay. You would not believe me. Okay, then don't tell me. I won't. It's a secret. It's not a secret. You want to make something super special, you're like... I'm... You would never believe me. No, no, no. I'm not like other 40-year-olds. I'm clearly, clearly not like other people. Like, sometimes I wish I was an account. I wish I was boring. I wish I knew someone who was boring. But it just hasn't happened. No, I would never wish I was boring, bro. But for a day. Imagine for a day. For what? Just being a normie who's just like, you know what I'm going to do today? Something average. And then... You can do something... Actually, if you do something average, it would be like an adventure for you. Yeah, but I'd probably turn it into something interesting. So, like, to do something really... Yeah, but it wouldn't be interesting if you've never done it before. Then it's like, I'm going to ask something new. Yeah, no, I don't want that. I want to be actually really boring. Like, I'll just turn up to an office in a suit and be like, hi, I'm here. And they're like, who are you? Can I just sit down and pretend to type? And can I do some, I'll do some photocopying. What else do people do at offices? I'll sign some stuff, like I don't want any money, I just want to be bored for a day. For one day, imagine that. So you, do you feel like superior? No, no, no, not superior, no. No, not at all. No? No, no, I'm not, no one's superior to anyone, but I am absolutely unique and weird and it's not superior, it's just a fact. I would say this is your sonority. Yeah, did you notice the psychedelic pornography? I didn't when I bought it. And then later I was like, f**k yeah, f**k yeah. I'm like, whoa, I watch good porn, cool. I'm wearing porn at the moment. I didn't even know, but I'm like, well, I'm gonna obviously wear it. Okay, yeah, I mean, you pull it off, I guess. Thank you. Yeah. This is not my usual outfit, but anyway, today it is. Okay, yeah, very cool. Yeah. And this is her outfit, actually. This is what? Oh, yeah, now, fabulous, fabulous. So she's also not like other dogs. No, I can see that. She's special. Yeah, yeah. And she loves it. She loves, she loves checking stuff out. All right, I gotta go. Maybe we'll hang out sometime, you'll see me around. See you soon. See you. Bye. All right, gentlemen, I hope you enjoyed that interaction of me with a younger lady. Interacting with the old fart, James Marshall, and dealing with her ageist objections. Oh, and if you're wondering what happened here, I was bitten by a croc, mate. No, I was actually sawing a willow tree, and then I looked at a bird and slipped and cut my fucking thumb. It's all right. That's what happens when you're a man. So let's have a little bit of an analysis of what went on in this interaction, and also think of it in kind of the broader context of age difference. So it's no secret that I'm 43. I don't lie about my age with women because, well, for two reasons. I just don't lie to women anymore. And secondarily, I clearly look like I'm old, right? I look good. I think I'm wearing my age well, but I'm clearly not 30 or 28 or whatever, and there'd be no point lying because she'd find out pretty quickly by just checking my ID. So I just tell women my age whenever they ask. So a lot of the guys that watch this channel are in their 30s and 40s, and no secret, they're often interested in, at least in the idea of dating women who are not their own age, and that's totally fine. It's always been done that way throughout history. It has been extremely commonplace for older men to date younger women and for younger women to be interested in older men. And in different places in the world, this is more or less accepted, but I don't really care how much it's accepted on the aggregate or on a societal level. I just care about whether this woman in front of me wants to hang out with me and I want to hang out with her. And if she's of legal age and we're both consenting adults, then it's none of any fucker's other's business what we do in the bedroom. So don't worry about, you know, society at large, man. Just worry about, okay, if you want to approach a woman that you find attractive and you find out that she's over 18 or whatever the, you know, yes, let's say over 18, then it's just up to you and her to decide what you want to do. It is a massive block for a lot of guys that in their 30s and 40s who want to go out and approach attractive women. And okay, that woman is in her 20s or early 30s or whatever, 21, 28, whatever. And they're really worried about what happens if the girl calls them out on their age or says that they're too old. I've been experiencing this actually for decades. I remember I was at a party when I was 21 and it was like a high school party. So it was full of 18 year olds and I was 21. And I remember a girl saying, how old are you? Australian. And I said, I'm 21. She's like, you're fucking old. And I felt old too. I was like, well, I'm way too old for these young chicks. Now I'm three years older than them. So basically, are you too old for any woman is determined by whether she thinks you're too old for her. My current girlfriend is 22. She loves the fact that I'm older than her and we get on really well. She's super smart. In fact, she's smarter than me and she runs rings around guys her own age and there's no way she would want to date a guy her own age because dudes take a way longer time in general to become mature or to get their shit together. And she likes whatever I am and we've chosen to be with each other and what anyone else thinks they can go fuck themselves. Although it is pretty scandalous when we walk down the street because she clearly looks her age and I clearly look mine. But the point being is that for some women, if you go and approach them, if you're three years older than them, you're too old. For some women, the fact that you're three years older than them means that you're too young. She's like, oh no, he's 25. Oh no, I'm not going to date a guy that age. You want to date a guy who's in his thirties. And I've also had the experience many times where I speak to a woman, we have got a good vibe and eventually she asked my age and I tell her the number and it's a bit of a shock to her because she wasn't expecting it and she hasn't dated someone that much older than her before and it takes a bit of time to just get her head around it. And then she's like, oh well, fuck it. I like the guy, right? She likes the man. Okay, maybe I'm not going to go and hang out with her and her, you know, uni buddies or maybe I'm not going to be actually become her boyfriend because that might not fit in with her idea of what type of guy she has as a boyfriend. But she's totally like open to the idea of, well, I've got this older lover that's my dirty secret and he's my daddy or he's this guy that teaches me things that I don't know or he's more mature or he's got his shit together or he's totally separate from my normal life and that's an erotic fantasy. So this is way more common than you think that women are in, many women are into older guys in general or they're just into the guy that they like and when they find out what his age is, they don't care. So what I did in this interaction, I'm not necessarily suggesting that you deconstruct the age differences like I did with this lady. She was 25 and I'm 43 and I'm like, seriously? Okay, and she's, you know, fairly mature and a fun intelligent girl and she could handle me and I could certainly handle her, uh, but she disqualified herself by making such a big deal out of it. But in that moment, for whatever reason, I just decided to prod and poke and start to deconstruct her argument, which fell apart under the, under the smallest amount of interrogation because she hadn't really thought it through. She just had this arbitrary idea in her head that that's too old. And for her, yeah, it is. I'm not going to try and date that girl, even though I was flirting with her, I got her contacts, uh, if we hung out again, there's, there's a good chance that she would actually change her mind. But she's, as, as I said in the video, she, she is friend zoned, uh, because I'm not going to necessarily play those games outside of the interaction. But for the sake of you guys on the camera and because that's what I felt like doing at the time, I started pulling apart and you look at what happens, right? She's like, oh, you're too old for me. And she's like the, the point where she started to be antagonistic, where she's like, if you feel the need to, and I already knew what she's going to say, if you feel the need to date young women, there's something wrong with you. And so that's where I interject. And I'm like, I don't feel the need to do anything. I've dated women of various age ranges. I date women I find attractive and surprise, surprise, I often find women who are younger than me, more attractive than women who are of my own age. Could I date someone my own age? Absolutely. Shall I? I shan't. Why? Because I don't want to, and I don't have to. I got options. So I'll date who I find attractive. So, you know, I started to interrogate her and pull, pull, uh, punch holes in her argument where I'm saying, well, what is the actual age range that you should do? Like, where is this magic cutoff point? And she says 30, right? As her arbitrary line, I interrogated a little bit more about, okay, so how's it been being with 30 year olds? Are they the right fit for you? And she's like, nah, right? So she actually has no leg to stand on. And I'm not backing down on the fact, like, I'm not apologizing for my age. I am what I am. And it always makes me smile a little when guys in the comments go, James is old. I'm like, yeah, I'm my age. So what? Like I, I'm, I'm in no way worried about the fact that I'm my age. When I was 28, I was 28 and I wasn't worried about that then. Actually, I was probably more worried about it when I was 28 than I am now. I'm perfectly comfortable with myself or as comfortable as a human can be really. I know how old I am. I know that I'm still sexy. I know I've got plenty to offer women. I know that there's, as proven by every woman that I've ever dated, that there are lots and lots of ladies who find me attractive at every age that I've been at. And will they forever? Yeah, because I know plenty of ballers who are in their fifties and sixties, actually, who, who choose to be with younger women and date women sometimes 30 or 40 years younger than them. And I'm not saying that you have to, or should, or that this is even ideal. There's absolutely something to be said for dating someone within your own age range. And you find someone attractive, you're 40 and you're dating a woman who's 48, good for you. If she's the lady that rocks your world, then fucking go for it. I'm not saying that it's necessarily better or you have to, or that this is the outcome that you're absolutely aiming for. But as most of you guys out there will probably agree, you find hot 20-somethings hot because they're hot. And often they are more than enough mature to be with a guy that's older than them. There are, there are women who are 25, have lived really dense lives, are emotionally mature, um, have a lot to offer. And they also like the juxtaposition or the contrast of being with a guy who's at a different stage in his life. Because there are also disadvantages of dating in the same age range, right? Because if you're both 25, let's assume that you're of some similar maturity level, then the problem can be that you're still, neither of you yet knows exactly who you are going to be. Especially for men, it usually takes them until their late 20s or early 30s to figure out who they are actually as a man, to be over their boyishness, to be over their ego or over their insecurities. Ideally, if they've done the work and to be like, cool, this is the man that I am. I'm still growing. I'm still learning. I'm still evolving. It's not the end point, but yeah, cool. I know who I am. And I definitely did that when I was around 30, 32-ish. That was when I was like, cool, I know the James Marshall I am. And I've been through my warrior phase and, you know, not that it was finished, but I've done the bulk of my warrior phase, my learning, my insecurities, my figuring out, am I this, am I that, you know, having my dark nights of the soul and, uh, my, my internal crises and my grandiosity and all that kind of stuff to be like, yeah, okay, I feel pretty solid. Now I'm actually a man, right? Whereas you'll have a woman who's like 23 and she's like, I'm a woman and I know who I am and I go for what I want. And this is the lady that I am-ish and, and that it'll, it'll develop from there, but she's pretty clear who she is at that time. So if you have two people at 23, you can have actually this dissonance where they're not going to end up in the same direction, right? And I've seen this with so many clients where they hooked up with their childhood sweetheart or their uni, uni girlfriend or whatever, and they spent five years together. And after those five years, they had diverged in pathways so massively that they were, uh, unrecognizable to each other as the people that got together in the first place, right? So just like the idea that you should date someone that's only one or two or three years different than you or exactly the same age or in your same class at school is absolutely fucking nonsense as a rule, right? Sure. If you meet the love of your life in, in uni and you guys stay together forever, that's beautiful, but I'd say it's less likely to work on the aggregate on, on average than having a, a seven to 10 year age difference between a guy and a girl, and it can work in reverse. I have seen older guy, older ladies and younger guys work, but mostly it tends to be the other way around, uh, because the guys need a bit extra time to figure out who they are and they, you just become sexier, more attractive, more confident over time. If you do the work, just getting older doesn't make you sexier. Sorry, right? Uh, you know, just age in and of itself does not equal maturity or equal confidence or equal success, but it does give you the time to move towards those things as long as you're actually developing yourself. I've met many men who are in their thirties and forties who are still children, right? They're still scared teenagers or scared little boys because they never did any therapy. They never did any meditation. They never did any exercise. They never really faced their fears. They never went for what they want. And so they just remain in this stasis of immature, youngish, uh, boy, possibly for their entire lives. But if you decide as a man to start working on yourself at any time, but the earlier the better, then yeah, you can become, uh, an established, mature and extremely sexy man in your thirties, forties and beyond as long as you look after your body enough that it works and your cock still gets hard and you know how to groom and you know that like I have hairs that grow out of my nose and if I'd left them and never trimmed them right now, they'd be down to here. And I guarantee I wouldn't be dating any 20 something year olds because they don't find that attractive. So I know how to dress, how to groom. I look after my body, so I'm still ripped and fucking look pretty sexy for my age. And lots of women would much rather date me now than they would when I was 30. In fact, I showed my, my girl that I'm with at the moment photos of me in my twenties and I said, would you want to date that guy? And she's like, I don't like that one. I don't want to look at those photos anymore. You look too much like a little boy. It feels weird. The fact that I am actually 20 years older than her, uh, is a big part of the attraction that she has for me. So this is absolutely possible as a man. As I said, it's, it's not going to be that just because you're older, every young girl is going to want to be with you. For many women, you'll, if you go and approach them and I get this commonly, right, where the girl brings up my age and I, and I tell her and then, then it's over because for her, yes, I'm too old. Okay, no problem. And it's true for her, I'm too old. Okay, for the next girl, I'm just the right age. How are you going to find that out? By taking your balls in your hands and walking over and talking to girls and, and just knowing the fact that yes, I'm going to go, I'm going to think you're a creepy old guy, even though you're not being creepy, right? Because just being older and approaching a woman that's of age, uh, is not creepy in and of itself. Creepiness, if we want to put a definition, is unwanted sexual attention where you don't read the signals and you don't give the girl space and you don't hear the word no and you're doing it in some awkward, weird way. That's what's creepy. It's not that I'm at this age and she's that age. You can be a very creepy 19 year old man or, and a very not creepy 43 year old man. And in this interaction, if you're watching it and you feel a bit uncomfortable with attention, that's fine, sit with it."}
