I want a new, better, stronger, alpha-er me. That can actually be done. You can go back in some ways to earlier parts of yourself or earlier versions of yourself and give them love, give them understanding, be kind to them, help them to unravel what they couldn't unravel at the time because they were young and inexperienced and just a child. Much better to have a context of something like this, which is I want to be whole, I want to be kind to the young part of myself that was hurt and did the best that it could with what it had at the time and that is your old you. I get this with guys coming to me and they say, I want to crush, you know, I've got to totally crush my old self, you know, the guy that had approach anxiety, the guy that was scared of women, the guy that was quiet and introverted. I've got to crush that guy and I need to rebuild myself as this uber, social, positive, sexy, seductive guy. That's, you know, a common thing I hear from guys in one way or another. And I say, I don't think that's a good way to look at it because what you're doing is you're going to war against your own old self or your own self now. You're like, I hate that old me. That old me was weak and childish and unconfident and needy and a nice guy and didn't get what he wants and all this stuff, right? I don't like that me. I want a new, better, stronger, alpha-er me, more alpha. Now, you can transition between those two people and they can look like those two things but I don't need to crush one in order to evolve into the other. You did the best that you could with what you had at the time is the overall truth, especially when you're a child. What else could you have done? Yeah, like I've been talking to a therapist recently. I told him about some event as a child that was an adult type of event that I had to experience as a child. And I was kind of explaining it to him and rationalizing about, but it wasn't really my mother's fault because this and this and this. And he said, hey, listen, listen to what you're saying. The seven-year-old you had to deal with this thing, right? And now the 40-year-old you is looking back and saying, okay, it wasn't such a big deal and I understand why it happened like that. But that doesn't mean that the seven-year-old you didn't experience that as a horrible thing, as a traumatic thing and it didn't have any better or bigger context to plug that into except to perceive it as that I wasn't loved or I'm being threatened or whatever. And so it is very useful to be able to create a broader context that allows a healing throughout your life, like through the timeline of your life, right? So I mean, a way that you can go back in some ways to earlier parts of yourself or earlier versions of yourself and give them love, give them understanding, be kind to them, help them to unravel what they couldn't unravel at the time because they were young and inexperienced and just a child. And that can actually be done. It sounds trippy, but in various trance states, so being hypnotized and there's various ways, there's lots of ways to go into trance. You can put yourself into trance by looking at a sunset, by immersing yourself in something, by lying in a float tank, by having cosmic sex, by meditating, lots of ways. Or a therapist, a skilled therapist can lead you into a trance state, guide you in there by guiding your breath, your imagination, your physical sensations, for example. And then through asking you good, clean questioning and directing without trying to influence you back to a state, a time in your story. And maybe you need to do that. You know, maybe you need to go back to the nine-year-old you when that thing happened and go into that space of what it felt like to be 15 or 9 or 20 or whatever it was and have these experiences and then reinterpret them, remap them, right? Because if I would go back to the kid in the library, what would I say to him? You know, I would say, hey, dude, don't even worry about it. She's just a grumpy bitch. Whatever the card system is here doesn't fucking matter because pretty soon it's all going to be on computers anyway. Like, yeah, she's just, she's being nasty. Let's just not, you don't need to worry about people like that. When people talk to you like that, that's their problem, not yours, right? Like, if someone had told me that right then and there, I don't think, I don't know, maybe my mother said, oh, don't worry about it, whatever it was, if I could communicate that well to that part of myself, then I could let go of that fear, you know, that really affected me at that age. And maybe, if not that one, definitely some other ones that riddled through my life and controlled me in some sense or rode me or were there, those bigger traumas, okay, maybe not the library one, but other ones, those things have influenced the way that I am. Those influence my stress levels. They influence my joy levels, right? And they're things that I need to purge and move through me if I want to continue to live more or less a happy life. And that's, I would say, what you would need to do as well. \u266a\u266a\u266a"}
