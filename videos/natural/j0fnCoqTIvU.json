In today's video, I'm going to take you on a deep dive into how to become the most interesting man in the world. Well, if not in the world, at least in the room that you're in. So I'm going to give you my top five tips on how to become a fascinating, powerful, charismatic character. Before I get into the video, I need to let you know that right now enrollments are open for my Lifestyle Design Academy. This is an eight-month program where you get to work with me, as well as my elite masters and coaches on all areas of lifestyle design, sexuality, inner game, how to be fucking interesting, and so much more. Now, back to the video. How to be an interesting man. Now, you may think that this all boils down to the adventures that you've been on and the crazy things that you've done and achieved. Now, I'm not saying those things do not make you interesting, but they are not the primary things that make you interesting. I could tell you right now about a dozen cool stories about the time that I got into a bar fight with drunken miners in Mongolia, about the time that I starred in Australia's first and only feminist porn movie, the time that I ran away to Shaolin Temple to try and study Chinese medicine and found my way learning Kung Fu under the most amazing ancient masters of Shaolin Kung Fu, and so on. And when I say these little anecdotes, if you're interested in that particular type of thing or that story, yeah, you might find it kind of interesting. But really, that's just going to come down to what are my skills as a storyteller in terms of being able to spin a good yarn to entertain you and keep you interested for that length of time. This doesn't make me an interesting or fascinating person necessarily. It makes me a person who's done some things and can tell some stories. But what really matters when it comes to being someone that is truly fascinating and interesting, someone that people talk about, they want to invite them to dinner parties, they want to know their opinions, they sit with bated breath when they're speaking, and so on, comes from something different. So the first kind of primary tip that I want to give you in terms of how to be fascinating and interesting is to become more interested, to become more fascinated, to have a real sense of curiosity about three broad areas, I would say. That is yourself, the world around you, and people. And you can have interest in other stuff as well, animals in the non-physical world, fascination in the cosmos and the stars, and the microbes in the soil, also amazing and fascinating stuff. But on broad scope, what we're looking at here is the person that is actually interesting is the person that is learning constantly, that is surprised, shocked, entranced by life in general, and constantly wants to go and seek out more information, more experience, and more interface. Because you don't become interesting in a bubble, like with most things in life, you don't become extraordinarily successful just by your own hard work. And in the same way, you don't become fascinating just because of the things that you have personally experienced. This becomes quite a solipsistic thing, or a narcissistic or arrogant thing, where it's, I'm so awesome, I did all this stuff, look at my Instagram feed with all my cool shit, and my bling, and my girls, and my travels, and whatever. It's all about me. I'm projecting out to the world, here's what I've done, here's who I am, and you should be impressed. Sometimes people are impressed, sometimes the things look impressive, and so people like them and think, I wish that I could do that as well. But the true renaissance man, the true man of art and science, the man who has a lust for life, this man is infinitely curious about what's going on around him and within him. I've spent my entire life operating from, or trying to, from one primary base, which is what the Zen Buddhists would call the beginner's mind. There's an old Zen saying, in the mind of the beginner there are infinite possibilities, in the mind of the expert there are few. Meaning that when you've reached a certain level in your career, or in your passions, or the things that you're good at, and you reach a level of let's say competency or mastery, the risk can be then of having pride and arrogance in this. Of thinking, I have my degree, I have my PhD, or I have my black belt, or you know, I've meditated for a thousand hours, or whatever it is, and so therefore I'm an expert on this subject. I can lecture people about it, I can pontificate about it, I can feel smug about my achievements, I can prove them to some degree as well, greater or lesser degree. Okay, that's all awesome stuff, but this can be really negated if you perceive that there is nothing else to learn. That because you know something to a certain level in a subject, that you couldn't learn anything from a student for example, or someone who comes from a discipline outside of the one that you have, who has maybe a different perspective. The reason why I know that I'm an interesting person is because I am fascinated. When I meet someone, I don't care who it is, if it's a beggar on the street, if it's a woman I don't find attractive, if it's a fan that comes up to me on the street to thank me for my work, if I'm going to engage with somebody, and I don't always, doesn't mean you don't have to engage with everybody all the time, but if I choose to, I want to actually know them, to whatever degree we can get to within the amount of time that we have. I want to look them in the eyes, I want to ask them questions, I want to read their body language and their intent and their projection. Because the thing that everyone knows the most about is themselves, and everyone wants to express themselves, to talk about themselves, to communicate what they know. And if you're a truly fascinated, interested and curious man, then you can go out and draw the gold out of people. When I'm talking to new people particularly, I don't usually speak a lot about myself. Sure if people ask me questions, or if there's an anecdote which is appropriate or I think is entertaining, I might throw it in for sure. But I'm not someone who feels like every time I get into a social scene, I need to immediately impress upon everyone how interesting or charismatic or whatever it is that I am, by going around and being loud, telling stories, giving my opinion on every single thing, even if it's something I don't know about. You know, throwing witty banter or frame games around to show people who's boss. I don't do that stuff, mainly because I find it exhausting, boring, and difficult. It's like the stress of needing to go into a social scene and quickly make an impression to let people know how awesome I am in whatever way. I just can't be buggered doing it. And the paradox is that if you're the person that engages with people and ask some good questions, not just how are you today or how's business, right? If you're going to do that and they say our business is all right, say well what's going on with it? How are you pivoting and what new strategies are you using? Digging below the surface two or three probing questions, particularly with men, because often men take a bit of warming up to start expressing themselves and talking about themselves personally anyway. So I try to make sure that when I'm sitting with someone, talking with someone, that I engage them on those levels. I use the same kinds of seduction techniques that I would use on a woman. Qualifying, connecting, a little bit of flirting, usually not. But why am I doing that? It's because when I'm trying to seduce a woman, I also want to understand who she is. I need to know about her and show genuine curiosity in her so that she feels, and truthfully so, that she's not just a piece of meat. That I am a man that finds her attractive, sure, but is also wanting to find out what makes her tick. How does her soul and her emotions and her mentalities work so that we can see if we are actually compatible and create some level of intimacy. That's what I'm trying to do with everybody if I want to engage with them. I want it to be an intimate experience. Now I'm not saying that every single person that you talk to and try and investigate will end up being incredibly fascinating to you. You may find them boring or irritating or opinionated or narcissistic or whatever. Good. That's part of the discernment process. I'm not saying that because you want to become curious that you need to love everybody and want to engage with every single person and waste hours and hours of your life listening to someone moan on about something that you don't care about. But in order to know who you want to hang out with and what ways you want to engage with someone by showing initial genuine curiosity, empathy and a real desire to learn about this person and understand them, they may well surprise you. Of course all of us are guilty of judgment in all sorts of ways. Writing people off based on their shoes or their hair color or their political beliefs or a look they gave you. We have the habit of doing this as humans. But the less that you can do that, the more that you can try and remain objective and observer. Someone who is curious and has a lust for life, love, people, experiences. This and primarily this will make you into a fascinating and interesting man. Tip number two when it comes to being a fascinating man is essentially to not believe anything completely. You may have heard the old saying if you don't stand for something you will fall for anything. Now this may be controversial to say this but I think this is a bullshit phrase. Because what it's saying is if you commit to an ideology, a belief system, a religion or something and throw yourself into it wholeheartedly that you will then reach a level of truth and justice and righteousness that other people won't. And if you don't do that, you don't decide to commit to a way of thinking, being or doing, then you will fall for anything that anyone comes along and tries to feed you. I'd say you will essentially be some kind of easily manipulated sheep because you didn't commit to a way of being. I think this is bullshit. I think you're much more likely to become completely brainwashed, completely lose your own sense of personal identity, your own opinions if you dogmatically subscribe to a particular way of being, thinking or doing. What I would say is a better way to look at life is to not fall for anything but to stand back and watch everything. So it's easy to make the mistake to think that one way that I might become really fascinating or interesting is to become an ideologue. As in a person who takes a particular position on moral issues, on social issues, on political issues, says that they are a whatever, a social justice warrior, a libertarian, a QAnon, a hardcore Christian or Buddhist or Islamist of a particular school and so on. And then you can embroil yourself into the community, to the lexicon, to the philosophy that's involved and you can spout it and shout it from the rooftops and presume that you might be fascinating and interesting. You're not. You're extremely predictable. Whenever I meet someone who's hardcore into, for example, QAnon, after a few minutes of conversation, I know what they've got to say. I've already heard these things before. It's not coming up with, I mean, okay, sometimes they come up with some slightly new variation about what happened with Pizzagate or whatever, but there's nothing interesting or fascinating about this. You're just following a narrative and an ideology and I'm not talking about this in any partisan way as well, either. If you're a hardcore Marxist, leftist who has decided that, you know, Marxism is the only way to go no matter how much proof we can show to the contrary that it doesn't seem to work that well when it's being tried and you live, breathe and think that and you're not willing to take on any other ideological point of view, not willing to debate, only seeing the world in black and white, good versus evil, my way and the other's way, and I'm not just talking about this school of thought either. I'm talking about any dogmatic position that you take that gives you a truth means that you have closed all the other potential doors to other aspects of truth. It's so arrogant to presume that you or your school of thought has the answer, has the answers to everything, and most big ideological positions do try to attempt to create a description of the entire way of being. Most religions prescribe everything that you are supposed to do and not do, how you're supposed to think, talk, jerk off, you know, deal with your neighbors and so on and so on, and this takes away the agency of the individual. Now I can understand on broader levels why that exists, because we live in societies man, we need to cooperate, we need to get along, we need to have certain rules and social mores that we work within so that we don't end up killing each other on the streets, but as we've seen time and time again throughout history and as we're seeing right now in parts of the world, entire populations can get easily brainwashed within months or a couple of years to believe complete untruths, completely outrageous incorrect positions, and so they live their life from these positions of essentially lies and ignorance. But let's say even if you are involved in a school of thought that has levels of truth or that we can prove certain aspects of it, it still doesn't mean that it's the ultimate truth. We as humans should be continual seekers. The reason why civilization has arisen, why our knowledge bases have grown and changed over time, is because we built on the curiosity of our forebears and ancestors. Imagine what humanity would be like if every generation we just nuked all of the knowledge that came before us and then had to start again. We would maintain these levels of ignorance. So it is by having a more objective multi-directional viewpoint in life that you will learn more of the truth and you will become more interesting and fascinating. Because if I've dogmatically decided that the world is this and it was controlled by these people and here's my story and narrative of how things are and that is the absolute truth, I won't hear anything to the contrary, I'm a boring boring person. The only thing that's kind of interesting about that is to, as an outside observer, watch and say, wow that person has been eaten alive by a meme, by an ideology. They're essentially an organic machine that carries around an ideology and not much else. That's kind of fascinating that that can happen to a human but I don't think that human being of themselves is fascinating. I think being a centrist in the true sense of the word, being able to hold positions of paradox, things that to be able to hold two different ideas at the same time which might be in contradiction to each other or might challenge each other. These are the marks of an actual intellectual, of a renaissance man, of a person who is actually learning and growing in wisdom, as opposed to someone who learnt some kind of specialised piece of information, digested and accepted the story that went along with it, and the good versus evil narrative and all the things that are associated with it, and sat there. And people sit there in that place for, often for their entire lives. I can understand why. It's because asking big questions, deep questions that we probably will never get completely satisfying answers to, is not good. People don't like that. They want certainty. They want answers. They want to know why things happen. They want there to be a sense of justice and purpose and mission and fate in life. So when someone comes and delivers them a story and says, here's how the world started, here's how it'll end, here's exactly how you're supposed to operate in it in order for a utopia to exist on earth. If you don't, you'll go to hell, or whatever variation on that there is, this is good for most people. They don't want to think big. They don't want to live in confusion for the rest of their life. But if you want to be a fascinating man, you actually have to be confused. Because otherwise, you're not learning. You have to be frustrated. You have to be enthralled. You have to be infuriated by the ever-changing complexity and impossibility of understanding what it is to be alive and be a human in this time and place. But that is fucking fascinating. A little caveat on the last tip, which is that I'm not saying that you will gain nothing out of joining or immersing yourself into a particular subculture or belief system or practice because within many, what I would say, very rigid dogmas, there are also amazing things involved. A lot of these structures have helped to keep communities and nations' sense of identity alive in groups of people throughout history, whether that was through a religious or a political structure or whether that was through particular types of lifestyles and practices. So absolutely, when you're out exploring the world, throw yourself into different cultural practices. Try them on. Absorb them. Take what is nourishing and good for you and be aware that there are always ritualized aspects to it. There is always dogma attached to any type of society or community and you don't have to take that with the practices. I was a meditator for most of my life. I got deeply involved for some periods of time in Buddhist communities. I started to speak the lingo. I had Buddhist statues. I read lots about this. I tried to learn Chinese so that I could try and read the Buddhist texts in their original, which I never managed to do. But I threw myself wholeheartedly into this as an aesthetic, as a way of life, as practices, as a philosophical framework. And that really worked for me for some period of time. Because as a young, kind of narcissistic and nihilistic man, I was lost and I needed some kind of structure and I needed, more importantly, I needed practices to learn about myself. Coming back to my earlier point of saying that you need curiosity, and I mentioned this briefly, you need to be very curious about yourself. Now that doesn't mean just rolling around in your issues or becoming completely self-obsessed and then therefore not aware of anyone else around you. But it means that in order for you to become fascinating, interesting, to become a great connector, to build charisma, you need to understand yourself at a deep level. That means warts and all. That means your traumas, your pathologies, your really bad habits, the tiny bit of evil that's lingering somewhere in the back of your subconscious, your dreams, your hopes, your erotic world. Like all of these things need to be, well they don't need to be, but if you don't investigate them, then you are pretty one or two dimensional. You don't even know yourself, so why would other people want to know you? Why would the world be fascinated in you if you're not fascinated in yourself? So I highly recommend throughout your travels, throughout the adventures of your life, that you throw yourself into different ways of being and doing, which brings me onto this point, which is, I mean my primary tip here is to explore the time and space that you're alive in. At any snapshot in history, if we take a snapshot of the world on this date in 2022, around the planet there are almost everything that has ever happened in humanity is going on. There are still hunter-gatherers living untouched in forests in the Amazon. There are large-scale industrial wars going on right now. There are experiments in all sorts of different religions and societies and lifestyles and subcultures. All these things are going on at once. Right now, on the earth, there are many places which are literally hell on earth, which you would rather die than be in them. And there are places where it is literally heaven and where all of your pleasures and joys and interests can be explored. For a lot of people on the planet, they don't really get much choice at all about whether they stay in their hell or they stay in their heaven or whether they can explore the world around them and take the best of it because of the situation they were born in. Most people who live in North Korea will be locked there for their entire lives. It doesn't matter how many vision boards they put up or how much they hustle or how good their mindsets are. When you live in an absolute autocracy like that, you're fucked, more or less. So there are lots of places in the world where you don't get these choices. But for many of us, especially in the Western world, in the industrialized world, in the more or less free world, and we can argue about how free it is, but the reality is I get to spout more or less what I want on this channel and people will listen to it. No one's going to come and arrest me and put me in a box for that yet. So I consider that to be freedom enough. So with that being said, as a man who is wishing to explore himself and the world at large in a way that is not average or mediocre, because if that's what you wanted, you wouldn't come to a channel like this. You wouldn't seek out advice on how to become more interesting or how to live a better life. You'd be like, cool, this is what I'm allocated, this is the best I'm going to get. It's the median average of what everyone else around me gets, dependent on a bunch of factors to do with demographics and income and looks and so on. And so that's my life and I'll just accept that and it will lead me along as if I'm just sitting on a raft in a stream being taken down the river to wherever it takes me. To joy, to horror, to pleasure, to frustration and ultimate death, who knows, but that will lead me along the way. Most people live their lives to a greater or lesser degree in this way. They are more often shifted by the currents around them than they are steering the boat. But for those men who want to live extraordinary lives, not so that they can impress people with how interesting they are, but because then they get to have had that lived experience for that 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 years or whatever you had on the planet, that you really drank the juice of it. That you really immersed yourself into it, to the people that you're with, to the nature and the surroundings, to the culture and the adventures, to the erotic masterpieces that you can create in the bedroom and out. So what I'm suggesting here is that you look at this world in a snapshot of this time and place that we all exist on together at the moment and you think deeply about, is this place and the people that I've surrounded myself with or have surrounded themselves with me, is this going to give me this juice that James speaks of? Because maybe you're in a third tier city and 100 kilometres away there is a top tier city where all the shit that you want to do and all the people that you want to meet are there, yet there's this 200 kilometre distance which may as well be 10,000 miles. You never bridge it because you don't think outside of the box and you're not trying to or not effectively trying to milk the best out of life. In my life, like when I was a young guy, I used to think, I wish I was born in the 60s in San Francisco because I wanted to be a hippie and look like you got laid easily and there was LSD and rock and roll music and people had long hair and that was cool back then. And I used to think I was born in the wrong time and place. I got over that pretty quickly as I realised that the right time and place was out there at all times. And so when I was 18 and I left high school, I went and worked on an orange farm and had a really bizarre experience living in the desert, working my ass off, saving money, meeting all these strange characters and then went travelling around Asia, India, Indonesia with my best buddy when I was 18, eating mushrooms, chasing girls, going to temples, meditating, exploring the different cultures, the foods, the sights, the smells and I ended up in India getting embroiled with a bunch of very charming gangsters who ripped me off for everything that I had, basically kidnapped me without me even knowing it, extorted money out of my father without me knowing it, sent me back home to find that I'd been robbed, right? And then I go on and then when I'm 22 I go to China with nothing in my pocket because I had a dream and a passion for Chinese martial arts and I wanted to go to the place where it was happening and I went there in 2002 and I met the last abbot of Shaolin Temple and I learnt from him personally, I learnt from, in my mind, the greatest masters that are alive today. Two years later when I went back to that temple, everything had changed. The abbot had died, the Chinese government had taken over, replaced all the real monks with basically kind of Disneyland Kung Fu acrobats and that time and place, for me anyway as a westerner coming in to try and get this particular wisdom and learn these skills, it was over. That two year window, everything had changed. But I was there, I was there at the right time because I took the risk, because I decided I'm broke, I've got nothing but what I want more than anything is to get to China and learn this thing at that point in my life and so I made it happen. That experience of those months in the temple back then has reverberated through my entire life. I learnt particular skills, ways of being, mindsets, philosophies that I have kept with me throughout my life. I also became far more fearless. When a guy in his early 20s decides to uproot, go to the middle of China speaking no Chinese language by myself, figuring it out, learning to go and approach strangers, to ask them for help, to find out where this teacher is that knows this teacher and so on, sitting in front of my hero, this Kung Fu monk and saying, can I learn from you? Because I turned up and I had the audacity and the humility to go there and request and he says, OK, tomorrow five o'clock, let's get started. And so I found myself living in a Kung Fu movie, living within my fantasy world of the young man training on his warrior path with his ancient masters, finding these secrets which are dying out. And that's how I've continued to live my life throughout my time on the planet, is that I want to be where the thing is happening. I want to go to the gorgeous natural places before they're all gone. When there's a popping scene in a place like Belgrade or Kiev like it was the last few years, it was the most amazing, vivacious, crazy city to live in. And now it's not, because things change, because what was amazing crumbles. There are times and places where thinkers, artists, lovers and so many more are popping. And once they get amongst each other, you start to create a scene where people start cross-pollinating ideas or challenging each other. I remember when I first moved to Melbourne in like 2005, 2006 to join the music scene, came with my band and we wanted to play music and we got involved in the scene. And at that time, there just happened to be about a dozen or twenty exceptionally good jam, funk, reggae, hip-hop bands in Melbourne. Really, really good musicians, good lyricists, exceptionally good at playing off each other. And so we would find ourselves playing with these musicians that blew us away. They would get up and shred and we would be shocked. And it inspired us because we were like, we are nowhere near as good as those guys. They have the funk or that guitarist can shred or that horn player can blow. And so that inspired us to become the best musicians that we could be. We were part of that little zeitgeist, that time and space in Melbourne of those ten different venues, twenty or thirty bands that were all vying with each other to see, to outdo each other, to outshred each other, to be more funky. And so everyone grew out of that time and space came exceptionally good music. And then, you know, if I decided to just stay in Canberra where I was playing with my band and there was two other bands in town in one venue, we would have never got any better and we certainly wouldn't have gotten any success or fame or chicks that we did get a little bit of once we moved to the big city. So in order to be a fascinating, interesting man, it's definitely going to help if you go where the fascinating and interesting things are happening. Explore this planet. Explore the world. I've harped on about this for many years, about how easy and cheap it is to travel the planet. Now I'm not saying that it's not for everybody, it's not. Some people have very difficult situations. Some people have passports that are awesome and some that suck. But in general, if you wanted to be a world traveller, you know, in the 15th, 16th century, that was a really risky business. That meant weeks and months at sea. That meant no international law. It meant that people would raid and kidnap you and murder you. It meant coming in contact with weird diseases. It meant complete lack of communication because nobody spoke each other's languages once you went a few districts over. So it was really only the extremely brave or reckless or desperate that did these kinds of travels, or the extremely wealthy and privileged. But in this time and place, you can get on a cut-price airline and go to another city for the same cost as a meal. You can travel and explore the world from your home through the use of the internet, make networks, research, come in contact with essentially the entire canon of wisdom of the history of humanity. It's all there. How much of the time do you choose to spend on that as opposed to watching cat memes or endless YouTube videos? We tend to do a lot of uninteresting things, to put a lot of emphasis and time into actually being boring, predictable."}
