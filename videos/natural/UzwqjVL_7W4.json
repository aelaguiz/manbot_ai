I didn't have to address any concerns that any of us were having. Everyone was really, really open and helpful. Anyone asking questions. It's given me more of an outlook on what I want to achieve and given me the awareness of the process of how to get there as well, which is amazing to look at, yeah. I liked that there was a group of guys who were all in similar positions to me, who I could speak to, make friends with, and we all supported each other, so, and inspired each other. Someone would say, look, this happened to me this week, and previously I might have done this, but now I'm doing something which I'm much more happy with. I spoke to her, I got her phone number, I think she's fantastic at work, people see me as more confident, people see me with better posture, and it was great to hear those stories because it kept me motivated every single week. On a Friday night I'd be thinking, what have I done this week? I suppose I'd better get out there and check things up a bit to see what I can do with the Monday. My perception of the Masterclass changed from initially coming into the program, I'd sort of set myself to say, like, I'm here to have some common time and input from some successful seducers, and that was going to be the area of my life that I measured sort of love or seduction in, and that was going to be the area which was going to improve as a result of attending the class. I pretty much probably in the first night, that was, if you like, blown out of the water and I suddenly realized that the things that were being discussed were parts of my life which probably had common effects right throughout, and that was applicable to all areas of my life as well, and I noticed that what Shea was covering in that first Masterclass was applying the idea that I was in control of my own destiny in all parts of my life, not just seduction but in those other areas I look at too, health and wealth as well, and that evolved, I guess, going throughout the weeks ahead to the point where I was telling everybody that I was discussing where I was going on Monday nights that, hey, I'm going to a class which is actually improving me as a person, it's improving my life focus, my life purpose, and if they could see and do what I was doing in attending the class, I'd recommend it to everybody. I wouldn't say that I know anybody who wouldn't benefit something from attending this class because of what I've got out of it. If you're the sort of guy who is looking for some sort of direction but doesn't really know where to find it, what this class can do is help you decide what you want and make you see that once you decide exactly what you want and when you want, you can't help but get there, and it gives you the skills and the tools and support to do it, and you do it all yourself, so I can't recommend it enough. I think it's fantastic."}
