As you're probably aware, the Master Lover Method is open for enrollments right now, but enrollments close tomorrow. So you have 24 hours left to join the course. After that, I close the doors and move on to coaching the guys who have signed up for the course. Now, I've received a bunch of inquiries from guys asking for more clarification about what is exactly in the course and how does it work. So today, I've decided to take you on a little virtual tour through the inside of the Master Lover Method course to show you exactly what it is, how it works, and why you should think about joining. Check it out. The course is broken up into five separate weeks. Each week, you will get access to around 10 modules of the 50-plus modules of the entire course. These are broken up into different sections. So we cover lots of hands-on practical demonstrations and instruction. We have theory modules, and then we have solo or self-cultivation modules, which is where you get to work on your personal strength and stamina in the bedroom. So let's go through it in detail week by week and see how the course progresses. Week one is called the Capable Lover. Now, if this and only this week was given to every single man in high school, then the world would be a completely different place. In week one, I essentially cover all the elements that go into good, normal sex. We start with the course orientation, outlining the specific themes and how the course is going to work, so the structure and the method that I approach to teaching you this. Essentially, what I'm doing is creating layers of learning. So we start with the simpler things, the foundations, and then we start to layer more complex or more crazy techniques on top of that. So we move on to the hands-on modules, so the practical modules for week one, which include physical leadership. So this is how to take command properly of a woman's body, to be able to use sensual dominance to lead her, to maneuver her around, to put her into the positions that you want her to, to be able to throw her on a bed and take complete command of her physically. We also look at the fundamentals of undressing, how to get a woman's clothes off quickly, seamlessly in a way that's sexy, so she barely knows it's even happened. I also show you kissing techniques and how to adapt your types of kisses to different types of lovers. Then we move on to fingering and pussy play, very important stuff. So how to warm the woman up, how to understand her anatomy, how to communicate with her, different types of fingering techniques, both internal and external to make sure that you're able to get her off every single time. And we also cover correct condom usage, something that most people know, but if you don't do it correctly, you can end up with unwanted things. The theory modules for week one include your apartment and bedroom setup. So how to prepare your environment for seduction to make sure it's conducive to getting a woman into the right kind of mood. And I also go into a lot of detail explaining the particularities of consent. So how to use it in a way that's not rigid or clinical, but that is sexy and clear so that you have proper communication with your partners and that you always know that what you are doing is consensual. Next, we have the self cultivation modules for week one. Every single week, you'll receive modules in this area, which are teaching you all about yourself, right? So how to improve your stamina, your ability to get it up, keep it up, your sexual confidence, moving through any kinds of sexual anxieties or issues that you may have so that you as a man is completely solid entering into the bedroom. So in week one, we look at performance anxiety, common sexual issues that both men and women have, how to deal with them. We also look at your masturbation and porn habits. So the difference between training to be awful in bed by watching porn and jerking off quickly, and then the difference to moving that into a self cultivation type of practice where we can turn our masturbation into training to be excellent in the bedroom. Then we have the sexual stamina practical modules for this week, which include extensive masterclass on hip and spine mobility. It's vitally important that if you want to have good stroke control to be able to play with different types of sexual positions and to be able to introduce formal or informal tantra into your play, you need to have hip game. You need to be able to maneuver in multiple planes to have flexibility and flow through your spine. So this is absolutely vital to move on to some of the more advanced sexual techniques. Week two is called the creative lover. And now that you have foundations of excellent, good vanilla sex, now we start to add some more exotic or interesting or out of the box types of play into your toolkit. Looking at the hands-on modules, we have different touch types. So understanding the difference between air, water, earth, and fire types of touches and how to, and when to use them. Moving into more aggressive, dominant types of touch, grasping, hold, sensual dominance, how to introduce hugs and embraces to both women that you're trying to seduce and to your lovers. And then how to loosen this up and get more rough. Once you understand the technicalities of these types of touches, then we can start to move them more into the BDSM or dominance types of play. So using measured roughness to increase intensity, to have what I would call theatrical violence, which is not, which is consensual and fun, but it includes more of the intensity and roughness that the dominant would exhibit. I also look at breast play. So how to touch a woman's breasts and nipples from the most subtle through to quite intense or painful and how to integrate that into your sexual play. I next go into detail on sex positions. You don't need the Kama Sutra. You don't need 462 different positions. You need to understand the primary ones and more importantly, you need to understand their nuance and their variation. Everyone knows what doggy position is, but few people understand the eight different types of variations that you can include in that. So in this masterclass, we go through doggy, missionary, girl on top, having sex in different locations like over a desk or using a couch or standing and all the different variations, adjustments or angles and postures that we need to do to make those work effectively. Next module is voice commands and dirty talk. Now it's really important that you are not just a silent ninja in bed. You need to be able to communicate. You need to be able to use your words. And a lot of guys struggle with this because understandably they feel like it's weird or silly and they don't want to have to try and invent eloquent poetry to communicate in the bedroom and you don't need to. So I've broken voice commands and dirty talk down into discrete simple components that you can understand and integrate gradually that are easy to do, really sexy, and very importantly, allow you to communicate with your partner in such a way that we can have a dialogue and we can work through the sexual experience together. So in this module, we cover intent, voice and tonality, the use of voice commands and rewards, which is the initial and simplest way to start using dirty talk. And then I move into more of the nasty or creative aspects of dirty talk, which you can gradually integrate over time so that you can blow the woman's mind, not just with what it is that you're doing, but what you are saying and the way that you say it. Theory modules for week two, we look at the five principles of sex. So you're probably familiar with the five principles of natural seduction. And in this module, I show you how those five principles correlate to the bedroom, how to use awareness, intent, emotional impact, pressure release, and decisiveness or pulling the trigger in such a way to deeply and profoundly affect the woman's emotional and erotic state. I also go into a lot of detail on dominance. So how to embody this, how to step into your personal variation of the archetype of the dominant male in such a way that is congruent, that fits with your personality and allows you to start unleashing your wild man, to reveal the beast to your partner so that she can then settle into her reciprocal submission. In the self-cultivation modules for this week, I go into how to do a porn detox. So how to gradually replace your use of pornography with other ways of self pleasuring so that you're actually practicing to be good in the bedroom. I talk about different types of supplements and the use of the blue pill or Viagra and why you probably shouldn't be doing that. And then I move on to the practical exercises for the week where I show you moving meditation techniques. So these are taken from Shaolin temple, from Daoist systems, from Hindu systems that I've studied for many years. And these are ways to coordinate your movement, your breath, your intention, and your mind so that you are congruent. So that when you are presenting yourself to the world and to a woman that everything lines up and you are able to be present time in the moment, really aware of what you're doing, aware of your partner, and of course aware of the coordination between your and her body. I then go deeper into some Qi Gong exercises. So Qi means energy, Gong means practice or manipulation. And so these are ancient techniques that I learned in China many years ago that actually trained me to have the infinite stamina in the bedroom that I currently have by learning to control my arousal state, to deepen and regulate my breathing, and to be able to bring my focus and intention to certain points in my body for specific effects. These types of exercises are fundamental for being able to gain control over your arousal state, to be able to be present with your partner. And especially when you want to start introducing Tantra into your play, then you need to understand these elements. Week three is the kinky lover. This is where things start to get a little bit wild. So building on these foundations of understanding how to do good sex, how to start adding more color and variation to it, we now start moving into more of the impact, intensity, BDSM, and kinky sides of sexual play. The hands-on modules for week three are super juicy. So we start with spice touches. So these are additional types of touches that we would add into play occasionally, and for specific reasons. So it's really important to understand the difference between types of touches that you would do regularly, transitional touches that you'll be putting into play all the time, and ones that you'll be pulling out of your toolkit occasionally to have very specific effects on the woman's psychology or body. Then we move on to bondage without tools. So you're probably all aware of handcuffs and ropes, and that's what you would think of as a bondage, which it is. But you can do most of the things that you can do with tools without them. So in this module, I show you how to bind a woman into different locks and holds, distress positions, bondage positions, without the use of any type of tool. So just using your body as the bondage tool. Then I move into more specific techniques in the BDSM sphere. So this includes a hair pulling masterclass. It's not as simple as you may think, and there are multiple different ways to pull a woman's hair that is comfortable and not painful, but extremely dominant. The same goes for the choking masterclass, which is something most people are familiar with as an idea, but this is one thing in this course that you must get 100% correct. Just trying to just trying to kind of intuitively figure out how to choke can lead to damage, and we don't want that. So it's very important that you learn the exact techniques. And in this masterclass, I show you all the different ways that you can safely choke a woman. And then finally, in the practical modules for this week, we have a squirting masterclass. So in this module, I demonstrate the correct techniques to get a woman to squirt, but even more importantly, how to introduce this to a woman and when to do it. Lots of guys have heard of squirting, and they may even be familiar with the idea of the squirting technique, but many complain that it doesn't seem to work or the girl doesn't really like it. That's usually because they're doing it at the wrong time and they haven't warmed the girl up enough with preparatory techniques. And in this masterclass, I show you all the way from warming the girl up for play right through to being able to get her to squirt. The theory modules for week three include busting BDSM myths and misconceptions, coming to have an understanding of what healthy BDSM is and why it's not abusive and why many women who are not kind of leather clad kinksters still want to try it. We go deeper into understandings of dominance, not just in terms of what you are physically doing to a woman, but how you are dominating her mind, fantasy, and imagination, which leads onto the module of unleashing women's wildness. So this is how to take a woman who is, you know, girl next door, librarian type, who hasn't had much in the way of crazy experimentation in her life, and to coax and lead her into the space where she can completely submit to you, where she feels safe and non-judged, and where she can reveal her inner wildness and crazy sluttiness. Continuing with the self-cultivation modules for this week, we pull apart your lifestyle and libido. So looking at different areas of your life that may well be affecting your sex drive, your masculine fire, and your ability to access your dominance. Plus I give you partner communication strategies and templates to be able to cleanly and clearly communicate with your partner to be able to work through any issues that you have sexually. And then I give you practical instruction on different types of breathing to integrate into your sexual play, whether that is belly breathing or sectional wave breathing, which gives you different expressions of your masculinity and also allows you to control your arousal state. Week four is the nasty lover. This is where we take what you've learned in the previous week of understandings of basics of BDSM and restraint, and now we start to ramp that up and move into some of the more crazy stuff. The practical modules for this week cover bondage and restraints. So I show you how to use wrist cuffs, neck collars, and a variety of other restraints. I also show you some basics of rope tying. Now this is not a shibari course, but there are a couple of rope tying techniques which I think are really effective. They're quite simple to learn and they're super sexy. Plus I'll be showing you how to integrate bondage into sexual play. If you just tie a woman up by all four limbs, like you might see in an erotic movie, it may look good, but it's not actually particularly functional. So I'm going to be showing you what are the more effective and practical ways to be using these tools in conjunction with having sex at the same time. Then we move on to the spanking class. One of my favorites. All women love spanking, except for those three that don't, and almost all men don't know how to do it properly. In this very important module, I go into my eight completely different, unique types of spanks, the exact anatomy, anatomy and positioning of these. Technical masterclasses done in excruciating detail, including super slow motion replays so that you absolutely get it correct. And then again, I'll be showing you how to integrate spanking correctly into sexual play. It's not just something that you would want to do just like... one random slap on your girl's butt. I mean, that's fine, but there are ways to integrate spanking to turn it into a ritualized, deeply immersive event. Good spanking sends shockwaves through the woman's pelvis into her pussy. It has a massive psychological impact and creates a huge polarity between the sexes, creates a lot of dominance and submission frequency. And so it's really, really important that you understand how to do it correctly. So pay careful note to the spanking module week four. Then I pull out the sex toys and show you in great detail all the different types of vibrating and suction sex toys that I recommend and exactly how to apply them in real life, including doing them to a woman as a separate thing or integrating toys into the sexual play. I also look here at penetration and stroke control. So it's really important that you understand, especially for the first three strokes, how to enter a woman, how to idle, how to allow her time to interact with your body, to relax into it. There's also troubleshooting techniques, which you may need to help a woman that's not relaxed. So ways to direct her breathing, to direct the muscles in her body in such a way that she can relax into it so that those first moments when you penetrate are excruciatingly exquisite, don't cause any pain or discomfort. Then you can move into some of the harder fucking. The theory modules in week four go deeper into female sexual psychology, also starting to understand some of the pathologies that can occur during sex. So understanding things like the Madonna-Whore complex, sexual shame, both for men and women, going into important, not fun, but important topics around sexual abuse and trauma, and also very important that we go into detail about sexual health so that everything you're doing from this course is fun and safe. In the self-cultivation modules this week, I go into premature ejaculation and how to do it. No, how to not do it. So how to solve this problem, which many men experience at some points in their life so that you can last as long as you want in the bedroom. And I also share with you my pre-sex physical warmup. So I'm not exaggerating. Every time a woman is coming over and I know she's on her way to visit me, I spend the 20 or so minutes before she arrives physically and emotionally and psychologically preparing myself because I wanna be relaxed. I wanna be in my body. I want my body to be fluid, stretched, that my blood is pumping, that there is no rigidity. And so I have a specific routine which integrates Qi Gong, stretching, Swimming Dragon, Kung Fu, Taoist exercises, all done in a very simple and quick routine that mean that when your lady arrives, you are ready for action. Which leads us finally to week five, The Master Lover. In this week, I round out your sexual education to introduce you to a range of more specialty advanced techniques and tie together all of the modules and all of the methods that you've learned so far. Hands-on modules for week five include a Pussy Licking Masterclass. So these are all of my best techniques for going down on a woman, including speed, pressure, various types of methods, and very importantly, how to communicate with your lover so that you can find the right spot, right speed, right intensity to get her off every time. Plus there's a module on Blowjob Training and Technique, not for you, for her. So how to get your partner to learn how to give world-class deep throating blowjobs if that's not something that she already knows how to do, and how to lead her into giving you head without needing to negotiate or plead like a lot of nice guys do. Plus I have a detailed Anal Sex Masterclass. Not everyone's into doing anal to women, a lot of them are, and if that's something that you want to do, then in this masterclass, I show you exactly how to do it in a way that is easy to apply and that is comfortable and painless for the woman. Very important, along with choking, I would say anal sex are the two technique groups within this course where you have to be completely exact. You need to know exactly what you're doing. You can't just fumble around and figure it out because otherwise it's going to hurt. So in this explicit module, I show you how to stretch open a woman's butt, how to get her to take you no matter what size you are, and how to get it so that she really enjoys it and wants to do it again. In this week, I also introduced to you informal tantra. So you're probably aware of what tantra is more or less. It's some kind of spiritual yogic sex. Yes, more or less. But most guys who are interested in trying this don't necessarily want to go to India and spend months becoming part of some religious cult and having all of these bizarre dogmas and ceremonies, nor do I particularly, but there are some excellent techniques within these systems. So I've taken the most practical, easy to apply aspects of tantra and given you ways to introduce this into your sexual play with partners without them needing to even know anything about tantra, without them having even heard the word. So you can coach your partner in real time to deepen connection, to get more intimacy, to slow down the arousal state if you're trying to ride the cusp, and to create a very different vibe and aspect to your sexual play, which is in delicious contrast to some of the more intense impact or BDSM play. The master lover is able to balance both these extremes. He knows how to take a woman past her edge. He knows how to dominate. He knows how to lead, but he also knows how to create intimacy and connection, how to down-regulate both your nervous systems, how to be more subtle and intuitive. And then when you blend those together and you modulate between them, that's some incredible sex. Theory modules for week five go deeper into, again, female sexual psychology, understanding the use of consensual theatrical violence to intensify play, the integration of both kink and tantra, and let's say normal vanilla sex into a flow that's really juicy. I also go into a lot of detail on fantasy creation. So this is about how to discuss and find out what the fantasies of your partner are, how to communicate your own fantasies, and then how to make them real. And I mean real. So how to create a scene, how to bring costumes and dialogue and a narrative into your play, which is something that is profoundly powerful to do from time to time. I'm not saying you need to dress up every single time you have sex, but knowing how to create a fantasy scene, especially one that is a fantasy that a woman has been holding in her mind for God knows how long. If you're the one that's able to make it real, then you become a lover that is completely unforgettable. Almost no other man is probably ever going to do that for her or have the ability to do it. And in this module, I show you how to communicate, set up, and then execute an incredible fantasy scene. I also look at how you could study this course as a couple. I know most guys who are buying this are probably single or actively single, or if they have a partner, maybe they're not sharing this with her, but studying this course as a couple would be the best thing that you could do. So in this module, I show you how to adapt the course to study it as a couple. There's also a grooming module where I show you how to manscape and groom in such a way as to make you the sexiest that you can be. Then I finish up with a course conclusion where I show you how to integrate all of the methods and techniques that you've learned so far into a holistic, complete package so that you are the master lover who has a massive toolkit of techniques, has a deep understanding of psychology and emotional states, and is able to create almost infinite variations of pleasure and erotic experiences for you and your partner. So there you have the primary course split up over five weeks with its 52 modules, 60-plus hours of never-before-seen material, detailed instructions, theoretical breakdowns, everything you need to be an incredible lover, but that's not all. You also get access to a private Telegram group where you get to interact with me on a daily basis. So as you're going through the course modules, you can check in with me, ask questions, ask for clarification on any particular techniques that you're confused about. Plus, you get to interact with all the other guys who have signed up for the course. From my experience, these private groups have morphed into international brotherhoods. It's a great place to meet like-minded guys who are working on their seduction journey, on their dating, on lifestyle creation, and their sexual abilities, a place where you can discuss things in an open, non-judgmental manner and get all of your questions answered. Plus, to celebrate the launch, I'm also throwing in seven major bonus modules into the course. So this adds another 40 hours of never-before-released material. So let's go through those bonuses now. Bonus one is four live masterclasses with my personal sexual mentors. So I've been in the space many years and I've collabed with some incredible specialists who have agreed to come on as guest instructors. So these include live question and answer and lecture webinars where you can interact with these coaches, ask them any questions that you want, and pick their brains about their incredibly valuable skillsets. Joining me will be Dr. Seda Desilet, who's a favorite amongst my guys. She's a sexual psychologist, has decades of experience in teaching men and women how to have extremely intimate, juicy, and crazy sex lives. Also, Shea Matthews, TNL head coach and specialist in Tantra. Sol Sebastian, who's a world expert on male sexual potency, so how to increase your stamina and release your beast mode. Sir Dominic, who is Australia's highest paid and most respected male dominant. Women pay him to make their fantasies real. So he'll be revealing all of his dark Sith Lord sex secrets. Plus, I'll be running one live webinar where I am joined by one of my sexy assistants so that we can troubleshoot and go through any technicalities that you wish. So if you need clarification on spanking or choking or some technique that you see in the course, ask us about it. We will demonstrate it live on camera for you so you can make sure that you've got everything down correctly. So that's over eight hours of live classes and that's just bonus one. Bonus two is six long form interviews with different women about intimate topics related to sex. Often women find it difficult to express themselves and explain what they do and don't want to reveal their fantasies, but I'm particularly good at getting below the surface and getting women to reveal their hidden truths. In these fascinating interviews with a variety of very different types of women, I ask them all the burning questions that you might have. Understanding their masturbation, their fantasy habits, their kinks, their desires, their turn ons, their turn offs. This is an incredibly valuable resource coming directly from the types of women that you're probably wanting to seduce, allowing you to understand their sexual psychology at a much deeper level. Bonus three is that you get 10 live Zoom classes with me where we go through my sexual warmup routines. So I'll be taking you through 20, 30 minute classes to warm you up, get you stretched, get you into your body, understanding different types of breathing, qigong, movement technologies, so that you are prepared, supple, flexible, and ready for action. Bonus four is a guest module that Dr. Seda has put together for us. In this, she explains and demonstrates the fine art of pussy mapping. So I've given you lots of pussy techniques in this course, how to finger, how to squirt, but this goes levels deeper. This module shows you how to map your partner's pussy to find all the specific spots that are uniquely stimulating to her, from the G spot, to the A spot, to the cervix, and understanding the anatomical complexity of the woman's vagina so that you can actually master it. She's also included a self-cultivation audio where you can listen along to her sultry voice as she guides you through a self-cultivation session to bring back a lot more sensitivity, sensuality to your own body, which is very important if you wanna be able to bring that to your partner. I've also thrown in five hours of recorded webinars between Dr. Seda and I that we've done over the years, which brings together all the highlights, the most important questions and answers that students have asked us in the past. Bonus five is an advanced sex toys masterclass. This is where I pull out my entire kit, do a show-and-tell, show you all of the simple tools I use through to the most advanced ones, and then demonstrate all the techniques and how to use them on a real-life girl. Bonus six is a juicy one. So I've taken four real sex scenes that I did with me and a couple of partners, tastefully shot. Don't worry, you won't have to see my junk, but you'll see everything else. And then I've created commentaries over the top. So this is showing you how I am in real life applying many, many of the techniques that you've seen in the course, and then breaking them down in real time so you can see, okay, this is what it's like in real action. This is how it is applied in real play. So that demystifies the transition between like, okay, I know how to do this thing, whatever the thing is, how do I actually bring that into the bedroom and integrate it in a way that's seamless, that's fun, that's not awkward, and gets both of you off. And finally, bonus number seven, which is my favorite one, is a masterclass on how to use James Marshall's silk loop tie. Now you've probably seen me demonstrate this in various videos, and you may be thinking, well, that's all well and good, but I don't have one of those, and I can't be bothered learning how to sew to make one. Well, I've solved that problem for you. What I have done is I have gotten a good friend and seamstress of mine to make 100 of these handmade. And so for the first 100 guys that sign up, they will get a free handmade James Marshall silk loop tie mailed to you wherever you are in the world so that you can take this very simple but profoundly powerful tool and bring it into your play. This is probably one of my favorite things to do in the bedroom, and every woman that I've done it with, it's blown her mind. It turns them on so much. They look incredibly sexy. It's very functional, easy to get on, easy to get off, easy to do whilst in the middle of sex. Doesn't require you to learn complicated knots or to spend five minutes preparing things. You can just pull it out from under the pillow, out of your drawer, and within seconds, she can be tied up like a pretzel. Excellent stuff. So there you have it, your brief virtual tour through the Master Lover Method. As I said at the beginning, this is a five-week course where you get around 10 modules per week split up into practical theory and self-cultivation modules, plus your massive array of bonuses, which are drip fed to you week by week as well, plus access to the Telegram Brotherhood where you can interact with me and the other members of the course. Once again, you only have 24 hours left to join. After that, I'm closing the door."}
