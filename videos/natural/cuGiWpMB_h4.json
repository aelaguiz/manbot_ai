Through an ad in the newspaper. Tell me more. What's up guys? This is Alex from The Natural Lifestyles. I'm back from New York and I got myself a nice little new microphone. And why do I have this? I wanna ask girls a bunch of questions in a new series that I'm going to do. Despite this fucking eye that I woke up with. I don't know what happened. Like one eye just has blurry vision. But that didn't stop me to hit the streets and ask the girls a bunch of questions. Today we're gonna ask them how did you meet your boyfriend? No matter if they're single or not. How did you meet your boyfriend? How did you meet your ex-boyfriend? And then we're going from there. So I think it's a cool question. I wanna know. I wanna know more about how women relate to men. And let's get into it. Do you have a boyfriend? Yes. Do you have a boyfriend? Yes, I have. Cool. Alright, bye. Do you have a boyfriend? Yes. Not currently, no. No. Did you ever have one? No. I don't, no. No. I'm married. Any of your daughters have boyfriends? Do you have a boyfriend? Why not? Because it's too complicated. Are you married? Yes. How long have you been with him? One year. Eight months. Okay, pretty fresh, right? Not. For three years. How long you married? It was 23 years ago. How did you guys meet? We met on a demonstration. In Starbucks. Yeah, he used to work there. And I went there five times to, yeah, catch him. To catch him? Yeah. Gotcha, bitch! We went to high school together. He ran up to me on the beach and told me I was the most beautiful girl he'd ever seen. In the gym. I meet him on the boat to Finland. At a club. I met him on Tinder, actually. My date. Yeah, we got drunk in the street. As you do. That's very English of you. It's very English, yeah. How did you meet your husband? Through an ad in the newspaper. Tell me more. I put an ad in a newspaper and my husband answered the ad. That's fucking cool. I've never heard about that. No, people do that all the time. Well, maybe they do it on the internet now. So what is your thinking on Tinder, all the online dating stuff then? Well, I've tried it. I've had a boyfriend from Tinder for like three months. But it's not the same as meeting in person. And it's better in person. What do you think about meeting guys online in general? Or other people meeting their boyfriends and girlfriends online? It's okay if they want to use apps like Tinder. It's okay, but I don't want to try yet. Maybe in the future sometime. It's not an easy way to find your love with online dating. Because you don't have that emotional, personal experience. What do you think about online dating? Well, obviously, I find my husband that way. So it's good, right? I don't know. I don't like it. Do people sometimes talk to you on the street? Like walk up to you, say, hey, you're beautiful or something like that? Yeah, it happened. It's not the best to do, I think. It's like desperate. Sometimes. How does it make you feel? A bit awkward. Don't really like it that much. Rather, they didn't. Bro, not cool, not cool. Yeah, actually, yesterday as well, when I was walking up to... It just happens, you know? Do you ever get approached on the street? Yeah, a lot. Yeah, actually. No, they don't. Never happens. No, never. It actually happened to me the other day. I was walking past this restaurant. I was like, I had a new outfit on. I was like, feeling pretty fresh. I had my headphones on. And this guy chased after me. And he was like, yo, I just think you've got a really cool vibe. Like, do you want to go out on a date? And I was like... What did you say? I said, yeah, but I went on the date and it was really weird. Well, it's kind of normal. No, I mean, it's also sometimes crazy because you are just stopping someone. But yeah, nowadays, you cannot meet your love without like this. And how does it feel? Um, it's cool. I mean, if you know how to talk to people, it shouldn't matter, right? It's a bit strange to you that guys approach you and ask you for a date on the street. Yeah, that is. I mean, I don't even know him. First, I need to talk with him in social media. Maybe he wants to kidnap me. You never know. Depends on the situation, really. How they approach you or, you know, what's the first step. Yeah, I think there's no rules, really. Like, you know, some people prefer, you know, social circles. Like, most people meet through friends or school or work. You just meet online and that's it. That's cool. It was really strange. He said that I look really great and he thinks that Hungarian women are the most beautiful ones. And he wanted to grab my arm and wanted to hug me. But it was really strange. So I told him that I have to hurry and then I left. So I think it's great if he tells you that you look beautiful and you are nice. But it was just too much. So maybe that we should, I don't know, I give you my name and we can talk on social media or something like that. Yeah, you can go to someone in the street. It's like the thing I noticed that it would be fine. But most of the people who come to me in the street and start like, you are cute. They seem desperate. But I think you can do this like normally too. There are some unconventional methods through which you can meet people. Even if you meet them at the gym, I think it's perfectly fine. As long as their approach to you is, you know, with respect and, you know, with a kind heart. I think that's all that matters. And, you know, it sounds like a cliche, but I think it's true. Maybe one tip you would give every man if you had the chance. Just be genuine and treat your lady right. And you should have no problems. You got to chase the girls. So you have to chase the girls like I did. So it's cool to do it. Yeah, I think so. I think that you fall in love. So I believe in love for the first time. Really, I do. So if I think that I would fall in love for the first time with a man, I would go to him. I would be brave enough to say that, hi. I would like to meet you and I would like to know you. Guys struggle to gauge where women are. Like, I think women actually have like a bit more intuition with sort of like... Way more. Yeah, yeah. So like guys find it, guys struggle to, you know, know where they stand and like how far to go and if they're okay. So like, I get it. Like it's difficult, but I don't know. Just read the signs, man. The thing I like in boys, it's when they love something a lot and they are like searching for it and knew about it a lot and they can talk about it a lot. So if I see them being in love with something and talking about it a lot, I like that. We have our own paths and we are going together like that. Let's say I don't want to do online dating because actually I don't. How should I meet women? I met my first husband in real life, graduate school. What if I don't go to school? Well, then I don't know. Then like... It's really interesting, right? Like if I don't want to do online. A co... Like a colleague? A colleague. I only work with men. Just talked to a lady from the US. She met her husband through an ad in a newspaper. I mean, you know, how desperate you can be. Well, it was before the internet. So that was the Tinder from 1980 or whatever. Like 20 years ago, right? Thank you. And wait, you're really beautiful. I want to meet you for a coffee. So be it the newspaper, the modern art museum, the boat, the online funnels, the street, the club, a different city. Girls want to meet guys. I think we've proved that for the last couple of interviews. They want to meet guys in the right way. We at The Natural Lifestyles teach guys. We teach the kind of guys who don't want to rely on online dating. They don't want to rely on female colleagues that they can talk to. They don't want to rely on hopefully a hot girl will join my gym. They don't want to rely on a girl that they looked a bunch of times and flirted with, then hopefully reaching out on Instagram. We teach the kind of guys who want to take action and want to do it the right way.
