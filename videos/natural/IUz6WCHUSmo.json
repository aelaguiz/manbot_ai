I do. I actually love to be spanked. Asking him to spank me sometimes feels right. Because I would say that actually a few guys are really shy to do that. I don't know why, but... Because they think that it's abusive or they don't want to hurt you, probably. But it does not hurt. It makes you feel good. Honestly, it turns out not so much when you ask for it. Do you find most men know how to spank? Or have you had bad spanking, for example? Oh, sometimes it goes to the wrong place. You have to hit the booty, not the lower back. Even for myself, if I touch it, I know where I would want it. It's kind of like on the lower parts of your booty. It's not on the upper parts. It depends on the position. Yes, it does. But you do want it... Under the cheek and then around the pocket. Yeah, you have to hit it right. And it's not a hard thing to do."}
