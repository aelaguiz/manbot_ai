I've just arrived with the team who are out currently teaching in the streets, and it's always an amazing thing to be back in New York, a city where people don't give a fuck, do exactly what it is that they want, express themselves in all sorts of wacky and weird ways, and have strange little dogs with a cool... like the dogs are dressed cooler than I am in this city. Everyone's very stylish and fun. It's great to be here. So while I'm in town, I thought I'd do a quick Ask the Naturals for you. This one is from Tom Guerreux, and it says, James, I'm a fairly good-looking guy and a thoughtful person. He's a catch. When I'm alone, like walking down the street or entering the bus, etc., a good number of women check me out. However, when I'm with my friends, three or four other dudes, I feel like I'm losing my power. I feel like I'm just another dude in a big mass. Mass. Girls don't look at me, or if a girl comes to our company, she may or may not want to learn about me. Is this normal? Could someone project in a group as well as when he is alone? P.S. I don't know if you care about others' opinions. Why the hell did you get such a big tattoo, man? All right, well, I'll answer the tattoo thing first. I'm an extremist. If I'm going to do something, I don't usually do it small. I usually do it big. I think that small tattoos look pretty silly on a dude if they're just like a little sticker somewhere. I don't think it looks very cool. And I had a dream 10 years ago about this tattoo on my back, and I thought about it for 10 years, which is my recommended length of time to think about getting a tattoo before you actually get it. So there, no, I don't give a shit about your opinion, but thank you for asking. Now, in relation to your actual question, so you've said you're a good-looking guy, and when you're alone, girls are checking you out sometimes. That's cool. And you're worried about that when you are within a group that you don't have this power. Now, the main issue here is that you are relying on and that you are invested in girls checking you out at all, right? Now, to be honest, I'm a better-than-average-looking guy, and I dress very well thanks to years of hanging around people who have got good style and working with what I've got. I work with my face structure and my hair and so on. So I do get looks from girls sometimes, which is fine. And of course, once you start walking around the streets with presence and awareness, once you hold your head up, once you start facing the world at eyeline, once you dress well, you know, once you walk with confidence, then you'll start getting more feedback from girls. You'll start getting looks. And this doesn't mean you have to be a model, good-looking dude. Any man that walks with confidence, dresses with a cool style, and knows, you know, knows who he is and has some presence about him, will start getting looks from girls. Every day, every girl that's not, even if she is amazingly in love with her partner, she's checking dudes out. And so you will get these, what they say, IOIs from time to time. However, as nice as it is to get some kind of validation or attention from a girl, if you're relying on that in order to be able to approach a girl, then you are going to fail at this miserably. And I know this because this used to be my game. Well before I got into cold approaching at all, my game was, such as it was, was be in a band that wasn't very famous, play gigs, hang out at the bar afterwards, stand there, trying to look as cool as I could. So I'd, you know, do the cool things. It's just like, pick your pose and sort of stand there. And this is before mobile phones, so I couldn't pull out my phone. So I just stand and, you know, I had a few moves at this one. I had the one where I'd glance, I'd look and I'd see the girl looking and then I look away and then I look at her again. That was one of my moves. And, uh, I had the ones where I walked past the girl and she'd look at me and then I'd look at her. Had that move. And, um, yeah, that was pretty much my moves. So that had the result of making me sometimes feel like I was kind of cool. And sometimes girls would look at me and if we're going to use decimal points, these would be girls that were below the, you know, seven range, uh, because they were looking at me and going, okay, he's more attractive than me. And so I'm going to try and get some of those genes in me, in my genetic hypergamy or whatever drives women. Um, but it didn't actually get me anywhere really. Like occasionally I would say something to a girl or maybe a girl would say something to me and then something will get started. If you're relying on your looks, whatever they are to get girls, then you'll always, the best you're going to get is girls that are less attractive than you who have got some game and are trying to move up, trying to hunt guys that are more attractive. And in my workshops, I deal with all sorts of guys, right guys from every age range, every looks, uh, demographic, every height, weight, cool, hairy, race, whatever. And every workshop I have one or two guys that you would consider to be very attractive, right? There's every, every workshop. You're just like, Jesus Christ, this guy is beautiful. And often those guys are nice guys. As you said, you're a thoughtful person. And what the danger is for those guys is if they don't learn game, they don't get to be good at seduction. Then at some point, a girl who is not hot, who has game, who's charming, who is, uh, got, got a bit of sass and he pulls the fucking trigger. He's going to get that guy and wrap him around her finger and keep him because she knows that she's hitting well above her league. And because the guy doesn't have confidence, he doesn't approach girls, he's not able to go for what he wants. Uh, she's going to be able to get him, right? Because once, once a girl decides to suck a guy's dick and, you know, get him, get him in bed, most guys are going to give into that unless they're very, very living in, in huge abundance. So it's vitally important. If you think you're, you're a hot guy and you're relying on looks like you're relying on attention from girls, then you're failing at this already. You should, I remember reading once like on a forum, an internet forum, seduction forum years and years ago. I can't remember who wrote it, but it was a cool thing. It said something like, except, accept with an A that you are ugly, except that you're a hideous human being when you're going out to approach women. Right now, that's not necessarily objectively true. You're not, you may not be hideous or may not be an ugly human being, but the idea behind it was approach women as if your looks are not going to assist you in any way at all, right? As if you can't rely on anything visual from the girl because that mindset means that what I'm attempting to bring to the female is everything else aside from my, my visual representation. Now, I'm not saying it doesn't matter. Yes, girls discriminate based on looks. Uh, girls are into certain types of dudes, particularly things like style make a massive difference. If you dress well, that is going to have an effect. So I'm not, so I'm not saying be a slob and don't, don't look after yourself and don't work with what you've got. And if a girl gives you a compliment and says you're attractive, we'll take it. That's fine. But again, relying on that means that you have no agency, that you have no control over what's going to happen. You're just basing it on like going, okay, does she find me hot? And is she going to pick me? And uh, if so, awesome. And if not, well, I'm fucked. Assume that girls don't find you attractive visually straight away. Assume that you are an attractive human being, right? That you have, uh, that you have something to give her and work on those aspects which you can have an effect over, which is of course your approach skills, your mindset, your internal states, your belief structures, your logistical understanding, your touch skills, all of this stuff which we work on in seduction, uh, is what you should be focusing in on. Not whether or not I can, I'm able to be hot alone and hot in a group and whether that makes any difference, right? So stop fussing about it. The guys that I've found the hardest to teach are the ones that have stupendously good looking and have had women choose them in the past that are invested in looking cool. Back when I went, back when I had my moves, I was really invested in being cool. And maybe to like the outside observer, if they walked in the bar and went looking around going, who's cool? And they see me there doing this and doing my thing and going like this, maybe they go, yeah, that guy's cool. Being cool is stressful. Seriously. Cool people have to spend all day being cool. They can't be silly. They can't make mistakes. Coolness is the, uh, the perception that you are always at ease, always in control, always know what you're doing, uh, you know, always smooth, always know the right thing to say, the right thing to do. That's what being cool is. Uh, when actually real cool, real cool is Liam McRae. It's was a guy, Matthew Silver, the guy we'll see in Union Square later. Uh, you know, people who are actually able to be them fucking selves, uh, silliness and all make mistakes, um, trip over their words, say the wrong thing, accidentally spill a drink on a girl and still be okay with themselves. In my opinion, that's what actual cool is. But the investment in like, okay, I'm an attractive guy who's situated, who knows what he's doing, who fits into the social scene, who's got things covered. That guy is not going to get nearly as good ever. He can't, he cannot get as good as the guy who goes, all right, basically I'm a dork. The world sees me as a, as a weirdo, as a loser, as, as an outsider, as, uh, you know, a strange man, all these things that people are going to judge me in all different ways. I'm going to accept that most of the planet doesn't want to fuck me on site, right? Accept that most of the women on the planet don't look at you and go, yes, I want to fuck you. Sometimes they do. And there will be, there will be a dozen girls every day who look at you no matter what you look like, because people have all sorts of tastes and go, yeah, I'd fuck him. But even that doesn't really matter. It doesn't help you unless you go over there and make a move. Assuming that you have no inherent, uh, you have, you're not entitled to anything, right? You're certainly not entitled to women wanting to fuck you just because of the way you look, right? Even, even though I'm an above average attractive male, I have to go and hustle just as much as anyone else. And I'm going for girls that are hotter than me, way hotter than me, right? So when that, when I'm walking up to a girl that's technically a 10 and I'm a whatever, less than her, she doesn't perceive me as, as, uh, particularly being interestingly attractive. She just goes, all right, it's a man. And from that point, I have to work and prove myself to myself to her, uh, and make something actually happen. So that's my main answer. Stop fucking worrying about whether you're good looking or not good looking. And guys are always talking about this. They're worried about do looks matter? Uh, you know, girls are only interested in this kind of guy, whatever it is. Um, yes, women discriminate. Some girls are only into super tall guys. Some girls are only into black guys. Some girls are into whatever. People have tastes. That's, that's a reality. Uh, and if you hold onto that, then that limiting belief, whether or not it's based in some elements of truth, it doesn't matter. It will not assist you and therefore you cannot progress. With regards to the second part of your question, talking about, can I project something? I guess you were saying you were referring to, can I project attractiveness within a group of men? Uh, the answer is absolutely yes. And this, the best way to do that is to make sure that the group is working together, right? So I roll with a group of very interesting, powerful seducers. You know them and we're all different looking. Uh, none of us are like absolutely technically beautiful, but we all have a cool style. We all have confidence. We all have our own thing going on. And when we move around together, whether that's out at night in the day, hanging out with our girlfriends, someone bringing a new girl into the group and so on, we don't have a competition. We don't have one-upmanship and most groups of men are not very good at assisting each other. Uh, the best way to get really good at seduction is to do two things to, to, well, three things is actually work on your internal state, develop your internal confidence, your mindsets, your inner game. But externally, the two things are to master approach skills, particularly in a day because that's most relevant to most people. And secondly, to be able to pull together a group of, uh, men and women, if you can, that's even better, a social circle that works together because you blend cold approach with good social circle. And good social circle doesn't just mean cool people. It means people who are actually working together for each other's vested interests. Then you have the ultimate combination. And so that's the way that the TNL crew and our extended groups of, of male friends and, and, and wing girls and people we know work is that if Liam or whoever brings a girl home or to a social event, all of us immediately start shifting the way that our roles work. Tony brings a girl into the group immediately, he's the alpha and all of us move to make him look good, to support him. There's no, there's no jostling. There's no one-upmanship. There's no trying to prove that we're cool. If, uh, you know, we meet, meet his new girl and we are polite and friendly and charming and silly, but we are certainly not flirtatious. We're certainly not trying to make him, uh, like make ourselves look cool. Um, or in any way trying to, um, be the alpha dog. We immediately shift our roles to adjust, to assist the person that needs the assistance, right? And this is very, very rare in groups of males. But when you work together in this way, it means that everybody wins, right? It means that, okay, over time, everyone is going to get laid more often. Everyone else, everyone gets to play the role of leader and support structure. Even though I'm the boss of this company, um, very consistently, I change my role and shift it to the needs of the situation, which is that one of my brothers needs me to be a dork or needs me to deal with some logistics or go and grab the drinks, uh, or make him look good in some way or another. And this is vitally important. If you're starting to look at what's the social group that you roll within and how are they assisting or not assisting you, then start to take stock of that and recognize, am I with a group of males that make each other look good, that support each other? Uh, or am I hanging around a bunch of douchebags who, uh, are invested in one-upmanship, in being the toughest and making their friends look like fools, right? So if you're in a group of dudes like that, then yeah, it's not very easy to, to seduce girls whilst you're in that group. And it's better than to just lone wolf it and try and find some guys that are actually cool. However, confident men can bundle together and not have to worry about whether they are the coolest man in the group or the most attractive man in the group because girls don't see that. They, they, girls have a kind of a cheerleader effect thing, um, the same way that we do. Attractive girls, we suddenly perceive them to be much more attractive than they are. If you are hanging around a bunch of guys that dress well, that are fun, that are confident, that are having a good time together, then girls want to be a part of that because girls want to come into social worlds where there are interesting things going on. If a girl like dates one of us, she doesn't just get to hang out with the person that she's chosen. She gets to hang out with an interesting social circle, do interesting things and be around a variety of different characters who have different things to offer. Within our group, we've got guys who are really funny, the guys who are serious, the guys who are spiritual, the guys who are artistic, the guys who are organized. And within that, being a girl within that social circle is awesome. You get to experience all sorts of things within one kind of group. So ultimately, the answer to your question is to develop enough self-confidence so that you're not intimidated by being around your friends, right? That's ultimately an important thing as well as having a clear bro code and understanding between your friends that you don't step on each other's toes, that you don't try and flirt with each other's chicks, that you're not trying to ever make one of your friends look shit in front of his girl. And if that is the case, then you need to sit down with these guys and actually explain the situation to them because most men don't know inherently how to wing. And winging is not just talking to the fat chick when you're picking up girls in the bar. It's all these things that follow. And if the dude doesn't hear this advice and is not down with it, then move on and find some new friends or just hang out with those guys when there's nothing to do with girls. So that's the answer to my question. Stop fucking worrying about whether you're looking good or not. Dress well, hold yourself well, groom yourself well, and then forget about it and go out and pick the girls rather than waiting for them to pick you because that is a loser's game. This is James Marshall reporting from Washington Square Park, New York City. See you soon. The most common question that men ask me is actually not specifically about dating and seduction. It goes something along the lines of this, James, how is it that you are able to stay so calm, relaxed, and centered even under high pressurized social situations? Now I guess a lot of men presume that that's just my nature. I'm just a chilled out, relaxed, Aussie, surfer kind of dude. The reality being that I grew up being somebody that was highly stressed, angry, and cynical. And I went through a long process of self-discovery to be able to bring myself to the calm, centered position that I am in today. How did I do that? In one word, it's through meditation. I went on a long journey, both internal and real, around the world seeking out masters from ashrams in India, Shaolin Temple in China, and seeking out a whole bunch of different modern and traditional teachers of awareness, mindfulness, and very specific and powerful meditation techniques. For the last eight years, I've been coaching men live in my programs around the world in these techniques because it's my opinion that if you want to get good with women socially and improve your confidence, then it's vital that you look inwards, not just projecting out into the world. I take guys through heavy and deep inner transformation during my live programs where I teach them these techniques that I've distilled from all these masters around the world. Unfortunately, I'm only able to teach around 50 to 80 guys live per year, and so many men from around the world constantly contact me asking, Okay, what's the best meditation technique? I know that it's something that is going to be useful for me, but I don't want to have to go and travel to the ends of the earth to find the right techniques. I don't want to get conned by charlatans, and I don't want to necessarily have to sit in a meditation retreat center for days on end to try and figure out what works for me. What I've done over the last year is I've distilled and boiled down all of the most powerful, effective, and quite simple-to-learn techniques that any man can take and utilize for say 20 to 30 minutes per day to have a vast and powerful effect on his internal state, his confidence, and his ability to be focused, clean, and clear in his interactions. I call this the Marshall Meditation Method, and I will be releasing this breakthrough product which is a six-week course on the 2nd of December, 2016. If you'd like to stay up-to-date with the launch as well as receive behind-the-scenes bonus material, then all you need to do is click the link below, put your email in, and I'll be contacting you immediately. The first thing that I will send you is an exclusive, powerful meditation technique which I originally learned from my master in Shaolin Temple many years ago. At the time, I was learning this technique to develop powerful martial arts applications, but over time, I realized that it had a lot of applications for the man that was trying to develop himself socially and sexually. In particular, it allows you to focus your attention and your energy in a way that is clean and clear. Rather than getting lost up in your head or giving in to anxieties and fears, it means that you can get focused, clear in your body, and transmit the message that you want to to the women you're communicating with. Another very powerful benefit is that it allows you to gain control over your sexual arousal state. This is a very common problem that men don't last as long as they would like to or as long as their partners would like them to in bed. This happens because you don't have control over your physiology, your body gets too excited and nervous, and therefore, you lose it. With this technique, you will literally be able to last for as long as you would like to. So, if you'd like to receive this technique as well as a whole bunch of bonus material that's going to be coming out in the next month, put your email in, and I'll be contacting you very soon."}
