Because it feels right. Because it feels right to do it. They don't do it because like, oh, I should get as much sex as I can or because there's some logical sequence of, all right, tick boxes. She's like, oh, he's a good, you know, he's athletic and he's got a good job and he's a something or something. She may use that kind of rationalization to choose a boyfriend, but to choose a guy she's gonna sleep with, which she may turn into a boyfriend or may not, it's because it felt right. Why do women decide to have sex with men? It's vitally important that if you want to get something moving with a girl, that it has to happen fast. The idea of leaving weeks in between meeting a girl and seeing her again is totally ridiculous. When I talk about the five principle, the fifth principle in terms of pulling the trigger, this is very important to do and very important to do quickly. You get a number from a girl, let's say on an evening out, Friday or Saturday, and you hook up and get a girl's number. By the next Thursday, she's already been out again a couple of times and she's had other guys who are just as cool or just as good looking or more, who've got better game, who've asked for a number as well. People forget strangers' faces very quickly, within 72 hours, according to something that somebody told me once. Unless you're stupendously hot or amazingly ugly, people just forget your faces. If you're a cute girl who's meeting a lot of people, you're social. Even if you're a bit shy, but you go out to this night here and this club here and this event here and this party here, you're meeting lots of dudes and every man is like, okay, there's a girl, she's more or less attractive, I wanna have sex with her. And they're trying and they're trying. And so you just vanish into the crowd of random guys very quickly. Even if your game was tight, even if you went in super bold and direct, you need to move on this shit fast. So when I'm teaching guys in workshops, one of the cool things about the workshop is we have a tight timeframe. We got seven days, 10 days. And I always tell everyone on the first day, if you come into this workshop with the attitude that you're gonna spend a few days figuring out how to open and a day or two, figuring out how to do good number closes and then maybe you'll ask a girl on a date. Yeah, you'll go for the seven days and you won't get a date. If you go in with the attitude though on day one, that even though I don't know exactly what I'm doing, because I haven't been trained properly yet, I teach the guys on the first day how to open effectively, how to close effectively, how to present themselves with good posture and body language. And then the rest, all the nuance, all the excellent conversational stuff, all the mid game, all of flirting, all the qualifying, doesn't matter so much. Okay, we wanna learn that because it makes our percentages better and makes our chances better. But if you learn how to go in there and open, which is pulling the trigger and close, which is pulling the trigger and you say to a girl on the first day of you, let's say the first day that you went out and tried to approach girls and you went out and you went, okay, I'm gonna go out today, I'm gonna try and meet girls for the first time. So I've watched a bunch of James Marshall and a bunch of Liam McRae and a bunch of those other guys we don't wanna mention. And I'm gonna go and try some of this stuff and I just go up and I start going, hey, what's your name? And nice to meet you. Listen, do you wanna get a coffee? She's like, when? Now? Can't. Tonight? Can't. Tomorrow? Yeah, okay. That's what you should be aiming for. If a girl meets a guy and she feels any spark of attraction to him, she wants that to increase quickly. And if it doesn't, it will dissipate within a matter of days. Right, it's like the romantic arc that a woman goes through, the way that she has her feelings activated by a man, happens quickly and then it escalates and it needs to come to a powerful resolution which is essentially sex, unless she's super religious or something like that. But it needs to build to a physical connection within one, two or three meetings which should happen ideally within maximum a week's time. You know, from the day you met her to the day you got her into bed shouldn't take really more than a week. Because after that, there's too many other distractions. It starts to feel like it's losing momentum, right? The reason it's important to understand this is because men don't operate like this. If you met a really hot girl today and then you couldn't see her for some reason and then six months later you bumped into her and she said, do you wanna have sex? You'd be like, yep. Would you maybe want to have sex with me? Right now? Yes. Of course, let's go. So you'd be like, yep. As long as she's still more or less the same size and still as hot, it doesn't matter to you how long has been in between, how many other women have come and gone, what kind of stress level you have, you know, what your mood's like, you'll just be like, yep, sex. Okay, let's do that now. Women don't operate like that. It's like, she feels something. She met a guy, there was a spark, right? Why do women decide to have sex with men? Because it feels right. Because it feels right to do it. They don't do it because like, oh, I should get as much sex as I can or because there's some logical sequence of, all right, tick boxes. She's like, oh, he's a good, you know, he's athletic and he's got a good job and he's a something or something. She may use that kind of rationalization to choose a boyfriend, but to choose a guy she's gonna sleep with, which she may turn into a boyfriend or may not, it's because it felt right. And women always talk about that. If you're asking them how was the date and they'll just say, oh, there was no chemistry. What does that mean? Like, humans, in terms of like our attraction chemically, we are attracted to lots and lots of people. And sometimes you'll meet somebody and their smell, just their smell, will drive you fucking wild because you have some particular, like very, very niche compatibility that your bodies just go breed with each other. You will create superhumans. But for the most part, it's like the ability to have chemistry between a man and a woman is not rare, all right? Something can happen very, very easily between all sorts. One woman can have chemistry with fucking literally millions of men on the planet if he does the right things. If, I mean, if she's open, of course, if she's not already attached to somebody else and has a whole lot of kind of a hormonal attachment to some other guy, if she's more or less single, there is literally millions of men on the planet that if they met her and did the right thing, she'd hook up with them. It's not that she's looking for someone particularly special. She needs to find someone who's able to activate what is naturally and potentially there. And so when a girl says, oh, we didn't, I just didn't click, we didn't have chemistry, it's not really so much about the fact that her and that guy were totally incompatible. It's that that guy didn't understand seduction. It's that that guy didn't, maybe didn't have enough experience in this case, but just simply did not activate her through his awareness, through his projection of intent, through his eliciting of her emotional responses, through pumping pressure, through demonstrating what a cool and chill and sexual guy he was, and very importantly, through him pulling the trigger and leading things from this first meeting, which could just easily fizzle out to something where there is a narrative building, where there is a romance happening. So it is vitally important that you understand that if you wanna get good at seduction, don't think of it like, okay, I'm gonna go and practice opening for a year or a month or something. Think of it like I am trying, even though you may be a dead beginner, from that first interaction that you go out and you try and make something happen. You go, okay, even though this is fumbling and I'm not sure what I'm saying, I'm just gonna, if she's there, she stands there for a few minutes and talks to you, she doesn't just blow you off, then say, all right, let's meet now. Let's go and do something now or tonight or tomorrow. But guys do this on a much less extreme level all the time where it's like, okay, I'll try, got a number, I'll leave it for a few days and then I text her and by that time, she's like, who's that? Oh yeah, I met that guy in the street, right? Yeah, okay, I don't remember anything much about him. He asked me some questions about my job and he said that he was in, I don't know, he did something and nah, probably not. Probably she'll flake. Maybe she'll politely reply. You know, you might have a bit backwards and forwards and it's not unheard of. Like of course, occasionally a girl doesn't have a lot of options going on in her life or she particularly liked you. So there was something very specific about the interaction which made her think, oh yes, I'm willing to invest in this guy even though we don't know each other. But for the most part, they won't. They will just vanish because some other guy has come in, in her social circle or has moved faster than you or has moved more intensely than you and you just slip a rung or two in her order of preference. It's not personal. It doesn't mean that you're worse a dude than him. It just means that we are definitely dealing in a Darwinian race for sex here. There are so many men trying to fuck all the pretty young girls, right? There's so many of us out there trying to do that and the ones that move hard and fast and get the job done are the ones that end up succeeding. The ones that fuck around and faff around and think about girls for months and often a man will justify that in terms of it being romantic. He'll be like, oh, this girl's special. No, she's not. She's, I mean, she's a, yeah, she's special in the sense that all human life is a fucking miracle. We're all so special. Isn't it amazing that we're alive? That's special. But in terms of her being like a snowflake, you don't fucking know that, dude. You met her for 10 minutes. She's just another chick. She's as special as a 22-year-old who's studying HR can be, right? She's just another person. And if you romantically create this big story about how she's the one, that is simply because you don't have enough options. You just haven't met enough women. And as a result, you will overinvest, you will try too hard, you will try to impress her. She will absolutely sense that and the only woman that's gonna respond to that is a woman who is also needy, who is also living in scarcity. And if you guys hook up, this would actually be the worst case scenario. Because if a woman is willing to put up with that bad level of game, then it suggests that she is gonna be codependent and needy and you guys are gonna ruin each other for a couple of years before it all falls to shit and then you come out on the other end and go, uh, back to the natural lifestyles. I know I'm being hard on you. That's my job, tough love, to tell you the stuff that nobody else is gonna tell you. And to make you understand that there are some brutal realities in life and one of them is that women who are cute and young have infinite options. And that if you fuck around, you'll just drop. So everyone out there, hit the streets today, ask that girl to come with her on an adventure now. Not right now, tonight. If not, tomorrow. And then after that, accept that your rates of return or the likelihood you'll see her again is gonna massively drop off and go and meet another girl. Gentlemen, if you'd like to learn how to vastly accelerate this process, get things moving fast with women, how to meet them, approach them, date them, get them into bed and relationships, then I highly recommend you join us for one of our incredible workshops next year. We have four seven and 10 day workshops starting in April in Budapest. It's gonna be epic. Click the link below, get on a call with one of our team members and we'll see you in the next video.
