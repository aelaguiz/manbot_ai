Excuse me, excuse me. Are you a mother and a daughter? Yes. Okay, I want to say that you look really beautiful today. You're going through a kind of a special forces process, okay, so don't be easy on yourself in this week. This is a great boot camp, this is a great time to push yourself, and you might get a bit tired, and you might be challenged, and you might have moments where you're like, I can't do this, or I've never done this before, or this is my limit, and I just want to quit now, and like anything, it's a workout. You know, it's going to work you out, it's going to exhaust you, and it's really good that you're tired by the end of the day, because it means you did a good job. And rather than believing in your limitations, start to put power into what's possible, and where you can sort of start to emerge and evolve. I want you to really actually recognize that one day you're going to die. You're not going to exist anymore. All this shit's going to be gone for you, and you won't be able to have any of these kinds of experiences. And if you were to, let's say, ratchet up the pressure on that, and let's say, okay, you've got 30 days left to live, you're not allowed to tell anybody about that, but you've got to maximize your time, and you've got to just sort yourself out, and get your values sorted, get your experiences fulfilled, get yourself into the place where you really want to be as aligned as possible to your true self, let's say, then that's going to help you to kind of really put the shit aside, and realize I don't have time to be worried about my comfort zone. I don't have time to worry about all these little bullshit details that I often let my mind get a handle on. And some of you guys have already had moments where you got a buzz out of something. Has anybody had a buzz out of an interaction where you felt like, wow, I feel really good now? And notice how quickly you can go from feeling kind of hopeless and helpless to feeling like, ah, there's purpose in the world, and this could work, and this is fun, and maybe some good stuff's happening. So sometimes all it takes is a little bit of a shift from, let's say, a mindset of lack to a mindset of abundance, a mindset of experience, and then all of a sudden, you start to open up into this whole new world of possibilities. It's really useful to come at this with as much of a beginner's mindset as possible, and recognize every day is a new day. Every opportunity, every moment is a new moment, is a new opportunity, and every interaction is like a fresh deck of cards in the poker game of life, and you don't know what's gonna happen. You don't know what's gonna happen. So just show up and play. Welcome to a little infield behind the scenes session. I'm gonna coach Marty. It's basically his first day in field. What we're gonna do now is just go into the city, find women who are waiting to be approached, and then see what happens. How do you feel right now? Excited, a little nervous. My feet are a little tingly, but I'm ready. What's your goal for today? What do you wanna work on? Today is to find the small hints she's giving in the conversation and really latch onto them, like to be interested and to hear really what she's saying. Right, be present, listen, active listening, get to a personal level, I guess. Yeah, definitely. All right, them and ask, are you a mother and a daughter? And they're like, yeah. And I'm like, wow, you're so beautiful. Hi. Oh, quick. Excuse me, excuse me. Are you a mother and a daughter? Yes. Okay, I want to say that you look really beautiful today. Like this? Yes, with the mask and without. Beautiful. Just like that? Yeah, just like that. Thank you. Yeah, nothing else. Very kind. Have a nice day. Thank you. All right, mother, daughter. Yep. Why did you end it so quick here? I don't know, actually. I was like, I don't know what. Maybe a bit uncomfortable. Yeah, yeah. Because the mother was very on or something was off. Yes, and the girl, she was pretty young, so I didn't like feel anything. Are you a pretty young? Huh? Yes, I am, I am. Okay, you wanna, I understand that and I get the feeling and feeling energy is obviously important, but stay a little bit longer in every interaction, then you feel comfortable. Because obviously your tendency now is to not be 100% comfortable, right? Because it's all new and it's strange and there's even cameras. Recognize that and be like, oh, this is a bit strange for me now. All right, I'm still gonna stay for another 10 seconds and 20 seconds. At least ask one question. Yeah, could have done that. And then even try to close in some way. Even, as I said yesterday, even if you feel like this is not gonna work, I'm never gonna hear from her again. This was not my best approach. Still be like, hey, do you have Instagram? It's good to train that muscle of closing. Not even to try to get on a date, but just to be the kind of guy who closes people. Yeah, exactly. Excuse me, excuse me. Okay. You know, I saw you there walking past. I just had to come here and say, you look like stunning. Thank you. You are so cute. I'm Martin. Hi, my name is Doreena. Zareena? Doreena. Doreena. Yeah. Okay, where are you rushing? I go to Siunda. Siunda. Yeah. What's that? This is a clothes shop. Ah. So you're shopping? Yeah. Okay. Why do you like, you need new clothes? Why do you like shopping? I don't know. I think that it's interesting. Interesting? Yeah. It's like, why? Like. I don't know. You don't know? I think you are just like, like. Interesting how his approach was like a bit bumbly and actually he talked really slow and couldn't get the words out, but she was so charmed because it was so real, so honest. So like, you know, kind of in control. So it's cute to listen to. I could be this guy or this, I don't know. Yeah. I don't know. Okay. Well, what else? What do you, what else do you like? I like shopping and sunglasses. Sunglasses? You like glasses? No, thank you. No, thank you. No. No, thank you. Sorry, but I have to go. You have to go? Yeah. Are you really in a rush? Nice to meet you. You want to change Instagram? Yeah. Okay. Sure. Because I'm here for a while. I'm doing this workshop thing, like with communication and lifestyle design. It's really interesting, like learning new stuff all the time. And yeah, I don't know when I'm going back. So I like to meet new people. So are you shopping all day? Yes. Yes? Yes. Okay. Any plans in the evening? Shopping then? I will make dinner. Okay. Yeah. What do you like to eat? I like cooking. Really? Yeah. Okay. Cool. What do you like about cooking? I think today I will make pasta. Okay. Italian. Italian. Yeah. Okay. Bye. Nice to meet you. Listen, I will put you a little text. Okay? How do you feel? Good? Good. Yeah. It was very cute to listen to it because for some reason, like the approach was like raw and real because at the beginning, you know, you kind of stumbled over your words. I don't know if it was on purpose or not. And then she felt that honestness and realness and that you actually mean it. And then she was really, yeah, enchanted by that and loved that. So in a moment like that, there was, it was going really well, but there was so much potential that you didn't use. Yeah. Yeah. I felt like that as well. You did a great job with pausing. Why do you like shopping? I don't know. I think that it's interesting. Interesting? It's like, why? Yeah. Well done. You know, like building pressure, asking her something, letting her struggle a bit, you know, just putting that pressure on her. You see how she constantly had to release. But for example, when you asked her, what do you like to eat? I like cooking. Really? Yeah. Okay. Cool. What do you like about cooking? She couldn't really come up with anything. Yeah. Which was, I guess, a mix of pressure on her and language barrier. And then she was like, oh, I need to go. Right? So she kind of wanted to come out. So that's when you should release the pressure in some way and maybe suggest something. You're nervous or your brain is frozen, or hey, it seems like you cannot give me an answer. Well, what I really like is this and this and that. You know, so you give her some chance to then either latch on to you or you give like, are you this kind of girl? Yeah. When she clearly struggles, give her a little bit. I like that you used the time during the close, because I guess you felt there wasn't much yet. And then you did ask her, what do you do later today? Even setting up the date already a bit. So that's well done that you used that time during the exchange to get a little more out. Yeah. So yeah, well, really nice. Okay, here we go with an example where a girl we want to approach gets approached by another guy. And the immediate reaction is always like, oh, I missed the chance. Right? No. Yeah, yeah. Right? Like, fuck. Now she's gone, you know? But basically I had that same feeling a lot and I'm thinking now, well, what if she would have approached, have been approached three minutes before and we didn't see it? Yeah. You know, it's kind of the same situation, but then we would have approached. So just us seeing that she was approached shouldn't really change our desire or our intention to still say hi to her. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. You know? Wait a sec. Wait a sec. Just saw you there. You were approached, right? You were approached. And I was about to come to you as well, but then I saw, so. Sorry, I really hurry. Hurry? Yeah. Where are you going? Meet my friend. Your friend? Yeah. You're meeting a lot of people today, right? I don't, I don't wonder why. Why? What do you mean? You look like fresh, really fresh. And... I was in the gym. Gym? Yeah. Well, that's why you're like pumped here. Okay. What's your name? Joanna. Joanna? Yeah. I'm Martin. Martin? Martin. Martin. Yes. Where are you from? Why would you guess? Germany? No. No. Second one. I don't know. You don't know? Finland? Yeah. Okay. Have you been there? Yeah, I was, sorry, I was in there, but I can speak Norwegian. You can? Yeah. Why? Because I was living there. Living in Norwegian. Okay. So you like to, you like to travel? Yeah. Okay. What about travel you like? How does it feel like for you to travel? What makes traveling for you interesting? I don't know, with my friends, yeah. Okay. Hang out. You have to go? Yeah, I have to go. Let's change Instagram before you go. Oh my God. Oh my God. Well, this is what happens when you're a pretty girl in a big city, right? I will put, find myself there. What are your plans today? Going home, nothing else. Nothing else? Okay. What do you think? If I write you, ask you out for a coffee? Today? Is it too soon? I'm here for a, well, I don't have a return ticket, so. Do you live in Budapest? Yes, I'm here now at the moment. I don't live in Budapest, I live in there by other cities. Okay. Is it a long way here? A little bit. Okay. Two and a half. Two and a half? Yeah. Okay. Well, I will text you and we will figure out something. Maybe tomorrow. Maybe tomorrow? Yeah. Okay. I will put you a little text. Okay. Okay. Bye. Bye. That was very interesting. And I, to be honest, didn't know what's gonna happen, but it's kind of proof what I said, right? It doesn't matter if she has been approached a minute before, five minutes before, the day before, and we kind of crushed that mindset for everybody. With the calling out, be a little more careful, in my opinion, because you repeated it a lot. So, the first thing, you want to make clear what you even meant, because I think she didn't quite understand you at the beginning. She saw you there, you were approached, right? You were approached. So you have to choose your words better, you know? You could make it easier and say like, hey, I saw you over there, and as I wanted to say hi, the other guy said hi, but that didn't stop me. You know, that's now compressed into one sentence. Yeah, simpler. Simpler, yeah. Then she's like, okay, that's what's happening. And then, you called a few times out, as you say, right? Oh, you got approached, that's what happens in the city. Oh, you talked to everybody. Not too bad, but if she isn't like, oh my god, this is so strange, or oh wow, I don't know what to do, you know? Then you can relax her and be like. You know, it's fine, that's what happens, you're a pretty girl. But if she doesn't even mention it and she's just having a conversation with you, then just have a conversation, you know? Don't mention the thing that even happened in the past. Especially, you might make her even feel bad with it. Like, maybe not, but it could be that she feels like... not like a slut, but like... you know, like... that you judge her for being so open. You did not, because you actually said, it's cool, I like that. So you really like to spend time with people, other people? Cool. Well, I can see that, because you're in a rush, but you still stop here. Yeah, I can talk to you, talk to him, talk to anybody. You're open, I like that. I like that. But still, she might get that idea. Because right after you called out, hey, you said you're busy and you walk, but you still talk to people, that's really cool. It still came off a bit negative. Basically, we are at the topic of calling out things. When there is tension, it's good to call it out, like with the first girl. But when there's none, and she's really happy and she's comfortable, then just get personal, you know, don't talk about the past or the future. Just be there with her. Excuse me. Hi. Yeah, I know this is a little strange for you, maybe, yeah? But you know, I get this French vibe from you. I'm not French. You're not French? I'm Hungarian. Really? Yeah. But you look really beautiful today. Thank you. What's your name? Lutsa. Lutsa? Yeah. I'm Martti. I'm Lutsa, hi. Hi. Where are you rushing today? I'm meeting my mom because we're going to lunch. To lunch? Yeah, we're having a pad thai, yeah. Pad thai, you mean Thai food? Yeah. Okay, cool. But what do you do in life? Well, nowadays I work in a little supermarket for a summer job. And I started to learn to drive and I go to school. Okay, okay. How's the driving here? What do you think? It's good, it's good. I mean, yeah. You feel safe? Is it much traffic? Yeah. My mom's calling me. Okay. Okay. So I might go, okay? Or actually, can I ride in there? Because the internet is not that great. What do you like to do for fun? I like, I mean, I like walking around the city because I really like this city. And everything. I mean, when something is fun, I like to do that. Something fun, everything. Everything is fun? Yeah. Okay. Cool. Yeah, maybe we can go for a walk here in the city. Yeah, okay. You can show some crazy places for me. I'm here for like a while, so. Okay, so I'm going back because my mom's there, okay? Cool. Bye. Bye. That's how we do it. What happened? The opener was good. It was something I noticed about her. Yep. Maybe I should have, like, continued for a little while. I'm not sure, but obviously she was meeting her mom. But maybe I could have managed to have her stay for a while. Or? I don't know. If she really needs to meet her mom and she doesn't want to let her mom wait, you could walk with her a little bit. Oh, yeah, exactly. If it's between totally over and continuing a pleasant conversation, why not walk a bit? You know, obviously I don't recommend walking. But in this case. Yeah, we already changed Instagram, so I could have walked with her. How did you do? Because your goal at the session was to latch on to personal things more and get more personal and listen. How do you feel, like, did you get personal? Did you share about yourself? Well, she likes to walk around here. That's what I got from her. You asked her what she's doing. Oh, yeah, she's working in a supermarket. Yeah. But then I felt like, okay, supermarket. I think I thought, like, two steps ahead. So how can I relate? I wasn't sure if I can relate. So I wanted to find something else. And you cannot relate to working in a supermarket? Probably I can. Because you never worked or because you never worked in a supermarket? In a supermarket, no, I haven't worked. But I could relate. Right now, if you think about it. Yeah, definitely. I'm learning how to drive. You know, that's putting pressure on you. You have to go to the lessons. You do the exams, you know, you pay a lot of money maybe for it. And she's going to school. So what's the big picture here? She's doing a lot of things at the same time. She's maybe very ambitious, you know. She's working hard. She's trying to pack a lot in into one summer, you know. So that's a lot of things she's telling us about her in that little thing. But then what you took out of it is, like, how is driving in Budapest? Yeah. You know, like, I could Google that. Like, how is the traffic in Budapest? Yeah, well, I think that's when her mom called. So I, like, got cut off. It's a great example. Because basically, you were waiting for, you know, an opening or a thing. But she already gave it to you. Yeah. It was already there. Yeah. So you have to use that, right? And then you got punished with a call. Yeah, I know, I know. Yeah, exactly. But that's..."}
