Could you guys talk about why you prefer day game versus night club game? If so, could you go through the fundamental reasons why one is better or not? Okay, you probably get the impression from our videos that we never go out at night because we don't film much at night, because it's kind of hard to film. We get kicked out of clubs when we try that. We do go out at night. I do do night game and have done so for decades because I've been a musician for a long time and I've been kind of a social person who goes out quite a lot. So firstly, I'm not saying you should never go out at night and that it is completely pointless. However, what I would say is that in terms of making consistent and measurable progress, day game is going to be the area which is going to be most important for the following reasons. When you're working in the day, what you're dealing with is the girl as she is more or less. When people go out at night, especially when they're in night clubs which are based on some kind of social hierarchy. So if you have kind of VIP night clubs where there's a line to get in, where there's a door list, girls go in there and they start operating and guys all start operating in different ways than they would usually. Because there is competition, because there is a hierarchy, there's a VIP area or if you know the promoter, you're going to get treated better. If you're particularly beautiful or dressed up to look particularly beautiful, then you'll be treated in a different way than you would in normal life. So girls who under normal circumstances walking down the street will act like just themselves more or less, whether that's grumpy or friendly or open or not open or whatever, will start acting in all sorts of strange ways. They will become often quite cold and bitchy to men that they do not perceive to have social status. They will bundle into groups. They will start working on jealousy plot lines with each other against each other and working towards certain men they perceive to have higher status and so on. So the thing is, if you only go out and do a lot of night time work in your seduction, you're not getting an accurate view of what women are really like. You're getting the what girls are like in clubs at night kind of girls. It's like, does he really have to do it right now? Seriously, is that door that important? He has to just walk into my shop and he's like, I have a beret and a thing, so I must walk into this shop. I don't know why. Maybe he's not French. Anyway, that's why when we're teaching workshops, we do take guys out at night in all of our workshops but not every night and we do the bulk of our work in the day. Because when I'm listening to a student with a microphone and I see him do 10 approaches in a day, I get to actually see what are the patterns of his behavior and then therefore how are the girls responding to that. Whereas if I go out with a guy at night, there are advantages to that in the sense that when people get tipsy, they're more open and friendly. Often in night time environments, they can be more social overall although they may be more resistant to certain types of men depending on what type of club it is. If it's a really friendly backpacker bar where people are coming from around the world and they're just there to get drunk and get laid, girls will be really open. If it's some very exclusive club in LA where you have to suck the doorman's dick to get in, then they're going to be playing this kind of status game. But at night, when I'm working with students, there's a whole lot of anomalies going on. There's a whole lot of gradient of changes of the way women are. The same girl who would act fairly consistently being approached in the day will suddenly be really bitchy or really, really friendly and open and want to fuck you. That's not really giving you necessarily the most accurate view of where you are at in your seduction. Other reasons why I think day game is better. I'm a 36-year-old man. I've been going out for decades and I'm kind of sick of it. I don't want to go to clubs where they play top 40's hits or generic dance music with pounding four on the floor bass beats until I'm a 50-year-old man. However, I do want to sleep with attractive, young, amazing women from now and forever continuing on. For guys who are in their late 20's at university and they're going out a lot because that's what they're doing in their social world, well cool, go out and do heaps of night games. I work a lot with guys who are in their late 20's through to mid 30's, 40's, guys who are usually white-collar professionals who look after their fitness and their health. They don't want to go out to clubs or it's not realistic to go out five nights a week to clubs. If you only go out on Friday and Saturday, and even if you approach 30 girls on that Friday and Saturday night, that is nowhere near as effective as talking to a couple of girls every day. Going out and just doing your normal life, walking down the street and seeing a girl and going and speaking to her, that fits in with your life, with your general life of work, study, socializing, fitness, and then you don't need to stay out till four in the morning trawling for drunk chicks in a club. Hello, nice to have you here, very good. You don't have to do that, you can just go to the shops on your way to work and chat to a girl. You don't need to necessarily change your entire lifestyle in order to meet women. So it's much more pragmatic for guys who have busy lives, for guys who don't want to go out and get smashed every night of the week, and for guys that want to meet girls every day. The other reason why I think day game is generally superior to night game is that you will meet girls in the day that you'll never meet in a nightclub. There are plenty of girls who are sick of clubs. They go out when they're 16, or earlier, because they've got tits and high heels, and they get in, they do all that stuff for a few years, they get the glamour and the cocaine and the dancing and the drama and the gossip and all that stuff that girls are interested in, and then a lot of them, especially when they're intelligent and want more out of life, by about 19, 20, 21, they're done, they've done it, it's boring for them. So they'd rather go and do yoga in the evenings or go to a wine bar and talk to someone intelligent or go to see some theater or get involved in some kind of activity than they would go out every night to the same kind of generic clubs and be beautiful. So when I look back over my lifetime of amazing girls that I've met, very few of them I met in nightclubs. It doesn't mean that those girls never went to nightclubs, but in general, they don't go often, they do other stuff. They may be involved in a social scene, so a music scene or a dramatic scene or a queer scene or whatever, something that's more niche and more revolving around a set of interests, but they don't generally, the girls that I'm interested in, go out to pounding loud nightclubs four nights a week. So there's a whole range of women that don't meet that many men often because they're not going and doing this kind of lifestyle, but they are exceptional women. They're very beautiful, they look after themselves, they're intelligent, they're progressive. These are the kinds of girls that I would generally want to meet and most of my clients are not looking for sorority girls who are totally fucking smashed and trying to hustle drunk chicks into bed. They're looking to find quality women that they can connect with, they can have an emotional connection with, that they can have a sexual relationship with, that they can match each other in their intellect. I'm looking for special girls and those girls are everywhere, walking around on the streets. I don't need to get involved in a very niche VIP echelon club in order to meet an amazing woman or a model or an actress because those girls still have to walk to the shops unless they're in LA when they're just in gated communities and getting shuffled between VIP lounge to VIP restaurant, another reason not to live in LA. Most cool cosmopolitan cities, you have beautiful women walking around on the streets, going to cafes, going to bookshops, going to malls, going to the park, all of this kind of stuff and so you can just meet women wherever it is that you go. I do think it is important to get a sense and a handle on night game, even if the only reason is that at some point, if you're with a hot, young, vivacious girl, she's going to want to go out somewhere and you need to be able to function in the night time, in night time venues. So I do get students who come to me and they say, I only want to do the day game, I never want to go to a club, I don't want to hang out with girls who go to clubs. Well that's all well and good but even the girl that mostly goes to yoga still sometimes wants to go out and party, right? She wants to go to a salsa class, she wants to just go and let off steam on her holidays and get drunk and dance and if you're unable to go and hang out with her in night time venues to hang around with her friends who you may find vapid or you may find them just young and silly but if you're unable to do that, then she's going to see you, particularly as an older guy, as boring, as dull, as a killjoy, as a party pooper, as someone who can't go and hang out with the girls or hang out and party. I'm not up to speed with what the latest music is or what's cool or which clubs are that awesome and the most coveted and VIP, I don't give a shit but I can hang out with a girl and go out at night with her and just go and do something with her. I can go into clubs, I can dance, I can talk to some dudes, I can talk to nitwit, idiot chicks who are just kind of brainless but are kind of fun and silly. I can do that kind of thing because I've spent a lot of time in night clubs and night time venues over the years. They're not my choice of where I want to spend my Friday and Saturday nights. Mostly, I'd rather be sitting in the bath reading a book with my girlfriend and our girlfriend than I would be out in a bar till 3 in the morning but I certainly do do that as I'm coaching, as I'm traveling and I'll meet somebody and then I'll just say, hey, do you want to come out? And then I'll go, cool, let's just go out and then who knows what adventures I'm going to get into. So I would say in terms of your seduction evolution, if you want this to be a way of life where you don't have to become a creature of the night, then spend most of your time working on day game. And that can mean right now, in about 45 minutes, it's going to be dark here, so it's evening and I would still call that day game. So it's a Saturday evening, in 45 minutes, it'll be dark. I can be strolling around the street and talking to girls. That's not night game in the sense that it's not like a night club. It's just the evening where people are going and having a glass of wine and relaxing for their weekends. And so that kind of night game or evening game is more conducive to a guy like me who's low energy, who's a bit older, who's not that into being super aggressively alpha in a club battling against other men. But it has a different quality to it because it's the evening and people are chilling out. So learning to be able to operate in the day and there's different qualities of day, which is day, middle of the week, girl rushing to work or from work has a different quality to Sunday afternoon day game in the park where she's chilling out and killing time. The kind of twilight day game, which is now until the next couple of hours till the evening also has a slightly different quality because it is a time where people are starting to relax and loosen up. And so there'll be girls who will respond to you in different ways. So learn to become competent in all these areas. Learn to be able to go out to bars and clubs, evening events and make it work. But for the most part, I would say for guys that have got a job, they've got a life that don't want to trash their bodies forever, particularly guys who are in their later twenties, thirties, forties, for the most part, day game is going to be your friend. So I hope that answers the question, why is it better to do this in the day than the night? Unless you're like some super nighttime specialist, and I've met a few of those in my life, Tony Solo, for example, is more of a nighttime guy, although he's incredibly good in the day as well. He goes out every fucking night. He lives in it. He loves it. He's a really good dancer. He's really vivacious and social. For him, that's a really cool environment. And remember, he's pretty young, he's still in his early twenties. I'm sure in 10 years time, his priorities will have changed as well. So take it from the position of where you are at in your life. If you're going out a lot, cool, integrate that into your game. If you're not going out at all, start going out a little bit, but for the most part, make it your mission to walk down the street, on your way to work, to university, to go and get the paper, see a pretty girl, and go over and say hello. James Marshall, Natural Lifestyles, signing out. Hello. That looks like an interesting text. You've got a cheeky smile there. I'm waiting for someone, so... Are you on a date? Yeah, kind of. First date? Yeah. Good. That's good, because when he arrives, he'll be a little bit jealous, which will make him want you more. And then I can pretend to be the gay friend and confuse him. Who are you? Who am I? I'm James. How do you do? Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you as well. So, is it actually... Are you alone? What do you mean, alone? I'm with you. Oh, is that weird to walk around in the same hotel?"}
