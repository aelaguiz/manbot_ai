You don't have to be ready to go all the time. There's not one definition of what it means to be a sexually virile male. Sexuality is complex. As men, we are not just fuck robots. It's not just cool. There's a chick, we get it hard, we want to fuck. There's a whole lot of assumptions that I think most men operate under. We're fed through the basic mythology of the society that we live in that a man should and always basically is, until he's an old man, a virile, horny, fucking wanna fuck everything fuck machine. The male desire, like everyone jokes about it, it's ubiquitous. It's like men can get turned on by being on a bus that's bouncy up and down, which we can. Some of those buses are pretty sexy. You know, that will fuck anything with a hole. That men only want one thing, right? So there's this kind of overall myth that the male sex drive is ubiquitous, it's ever-present, and it's something that just is inherently part of every male. The reality is that the male sex drive is delicate. It fluctuates. It's influenced by a whole lot of factors, physical, sociological, social. The partner, determined by the partner that you're with, when was the last time you were having sex, your sleeping patterns, your stretching routines. There's all sorts of things which will influence how much you feel physical sexual desire, as well as how much you're in tune with your sexuality in general. You don't have to be like some porn star. You don't have to be ready to go all the time. There's not one definition of what it means to be a sexually virile male. However, if you're in a situation like this viewer is talking about, where he's really not feeling the desire for women, and he's quite self-aware in the sense that he's guessing and trying to investigate, does this relate to the way I feel about myself as a man? Am I self-sabotaging from reaching success because when I get there, I don't feel like I'm gonna be good enough to deliver what the girl wants? He hasn't specified, but let's assume that he's in the bedroom or as a man in general, that he doesn't really feel like he's enough. Therefore, the drive to go and make something happen with a woman is being muted because he doesn't associate the pursuit of women, going on the dating, seduction, escalation, romance, all the stuff that you need to do to make an intimate connection. He's not associating that with pleasure or with success or feeling intimacy or feeling loved or having a crazy wild fuck. He's associating that idea down the line with rejection, humiliation, failure, et cetera. And this I think is probably a key point to pull out here. Yes, it is normal for your sex drive to fluctuate and to understand that that is correlating to a bunch of other factors in your life. So I would look at it as a symptom or as like a warning sign that okay, there's probably things you need to be getting into alignment. The answer is not to avoid women, right? And this is something that I've seen with clients. A lot of my clients come in with varying degrees of sometimes traumas. Okay, so they may have had shitty fathers who beat them or fucking alcoholic mothers or a shaming grandmother. I remember one client who was caught jerking off by his Catholic grandmother and then was grilled for an hour and told that he was going to go to hell and left indelible scars on him for his life. There's early childhood patternings or experiences of shame or rejection that can imprint you that okay, this pursuit of sexuality or exploration of my sexuality is tangled up with pain. And our sexuality is complex. Like we're not, as men, we are not just fuck robots. It's not just cool, there's a chick, we get it hard, we wanna fuck. We have emotions, we have an ego, we have a sense of identity, we have a pride, we don't wanna look like a fool. We want to please, we want to perform, we want to be able to show her that we can do our job as a man, which part of it is to be able to please our women. And if we're not able to do that, then inevitably men will feel levels of shame. And then a common thing to do is to retreat. You know what, she just left. And I've seen that with many clients. They come to me and they've had some experience, a bad breakup, an experience where they couldn't get it up in bed or something like that. And then sometimes in the client file it says, and then five years passed. And it's like where he basically retreats from women for years because he associates going and doing all this stuff, putting in all this effort with a painful outcome. So what's the solution? I really believe it is not to take long, long breaks from women in general. There is something to be said for taking periods of, let's say, chosen celibacy. And I do that, not long periods, but I do that every year, right? At least a month a year I choose to be celibate because I wanna go and do something else. I wanna go and work on my spirituality or I wanna dive deep into a creative project and I wanna channel my sexual energy that way. Or I just need to remove myself from all of the kind of hooks and chains and complex dramas that I've got myself into and just come back to a clarity of like, okay, here's me solo. What is it like to just be me alone? I think that is really good to do. And some guys that, I've done this and I cyclically do it if I don't watch myself, is you get involved in pickup and you get good at it, it can become a never-ending cycle. Like where do you take breaks and get more self-awareness and see, okay, where does this fit into my life? Is it still benefiting me? Am I still growing? Is it time to adjust the type of relationships I want? And so on. So it is good to be able to take time out. But to retreat from women altogether for years because you're afraid of what might happen if you get into bed with them, this is just gonna compound the issue. \u266a\u266a\u266a"}
