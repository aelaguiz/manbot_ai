I think you should consider a new career in my industry. You'll be a very good teacher of seduction. What does it feel like for a woman to be led very well and also very badly? Wow, that is a very disappointing feeling when the men lead badly or don't lead because we don't know what to do. That is not the same thing that we must be very, how do you say, obedient? Obedient, yes. Yes, like yes sir. It has a connection with your before question about the role of the woman. Then, if you don't act your role very well, then I am forcing to take your role. If you don't give me one very clear direction, I take the direction that I want. Then I start to lead and you follow me. That's not bad. It can be a play. But when you more develop your role in the mask, polo, how do you say polo? Polo. Polo? Polarity you mean. When you learn more to be more masculine in your role, then you give me the space to be more feminine in my role. And the play starts to be very interesting. Right, right. When we are close of the limit, we don't know who is who and the play starts to disappear. It's not clear. So there's no tension, there's no, you don't get to express yourself as a woman properly. The man is confused, he doesn't know what's going on. Therefore, you have to take his role. It's not fun. Then it's not about a machista, machist dance. I say, no, machist dance, you give one order and I follow you. It's the universal play between the mask spirit and femme spirit playing between them like the yin and yang. It's a perfect play between the mask energy and femme energy. Each one with their own color, maybe a little point from another color, but playing together. It's really a very big pleasure for the woman to be lead, because she rests, she enjoys. Sometimes, a lot of times, you can see the woman in the milonga, the salon, closing the eyes. I've seen it, it's very beautiful. It's only, let's be lead. That is the depression of the woman. We can be more active. Like I say before, we can propose to the man with some femme. Some flirting or suggestion. Yes, in a fun way. Don't take that direction. Maybe I suggest you to take that direction, because I would like to do some things. Wow, you are open, you can listen to me. And then we take, you have enough time to open your ears and take my propose and play with me again. We are both active in the relationship of Daniel. That's also almost like a test or a challenge that the woman would do to see what the man can do. Like to see how spontaneous he is or see how he can improvise. Yes, that is, if he is not too rigid. Not about the body, in his mind. Because the times was changing. You mean the cultural times? Yes, because the relationship now, the modern relationship between one man and one woman are not the same relationship that in the last century. The tango dance was changing too. Because, for example, before the man has all the knowledge or the way to make move the woman. And the woman must be very, how you say? Docile, subservient. Yes, docile. He wanted to move to her. She don't need to know too much about the tango dance. Now is the moment when the woman need to have the same knowledge, but not to take his role. To share the responsibility in the life, like in the life, in the dance too. To help him if it's necessary. To know about the structure of the dance and share that knowledge and play each one in their own role. To support him, to inspire him, to challenge him. Of course. Then the way how the men treat to her in the dance changed too. Our embrace was changing with the time. Because when I started to dance, for example, the man was more, not rigid, but more like authoritarian with the embrace. Today it's possible to find a man who embrace is more soft and don't dominate to her into the embrace. They give some space, they give some breath for the woman to live into that comfortable house. Do you think that's better? Of course. More interesting? Yes, of course. I don't want to dance with one man who try to don't let me move. I can't express myself into his space. It's very uncomfortable today. I like to work introducing the topic of the energy. Yes. So do I. In tango lessons. Right. I have some play, plays? Plays? No. I have some juegos. To play, to play. Play. Yes, I know play. Play. Play with the energy. Play with the energy. To show to the student that he need and must to take that tool to dance. I put the movement, the energy. Sometimes I am working with the chakras, with the roots, on the floor, with the emotional center. We need to integrate ourself and know ourself to come give something for another person. When you don't know yourself and you are chaos or you, for example, only have one big head and you forget your body, how you can have one relationship with another body? You are like dissociated and then you can't communicate. It's important the communication inside you to communicate with another person. I see that all the time with my students is that many of them are very, very intelligent, very analytical, guys who work with computers or numbers or finance or lawyers or whatever, and they are not very connected to their heart, to their sexuality, to their core and their center. They approach the task of learning about women as if it was a mathematical problem. They try to figure it out logically. What we see is that, as I know as being a teacher of this, is that a woman is not a mathematical problem. She is a very complex and shifting and changing ball of energy. In order to really learn how to connect to a woman, you must learn how to connect to the other aspects of yourself. Yes, yes, of course. I like to ask what is the profession of the people who I teach. Because always there is a parallelism between what they do and what part is more important to keep his life or economy part of life, and how they use the rest of the body. Then, it's like you say, the intelligence is not only about the brain. We have one intelligence in the body too. We need to explore and explode that. That's the same, the modern life makes that we go far away from the center of the chakra, the chakra that is more close to the ground. That is the center where you have the hate, the instinct, the sexuality, or to eat, or fear. We need to put all that part to dance tango too. We need that element to make the food cook. When it's supper. Yes, you can't dance or live only with this part of your person. SUPPORTER-MEMBERS HAVE MORE FLAMENGO"}
