In the broad world of personal development, self-development, personal change, there's an area that I feel is kind of overlooked. And this is in relation to how you're feeling day-to-day in terms of your motivation, your self-esteem, your moods, your levels of positivity or negativity. And often there is a bit of a cult of positivity within this world, or toxic positivity, which basically states that the way that you feel about yourself and the way that you're feeling about your hustle, your motivation, your drive, your passion in life, is all dependent on you. So the type of mindset, the type of positive thinking or internal tools that you're using defines your success to a greater or lesser degree. So this idea of manifesting your own reality. And I'm not here to say that that's incorrect or it's a bad thing because whatever it is that we imagine, that we hold deep within ourselves, that we project out into the world, yes, this will definitely affect the trajectory of our life and the good opportunities that come along and how we go about utilizing them. However, this doesn't really take into account the realities, the really real realities of life. And there can be a tendency to kind of victim blame. So I've seen this in lots of kind of positive self-help worlds where somebody is struggling or if the course that they're doing, whether it's a getting rich quick one or manifesting the secret, getting what you want in whatever way, that if you're not doing that, that it's your fault. That you're not holding the right types of mindsets, you're not being positive in the right type of way. Of course, you're not taking the right action steps and as a result, you don't get the things that you want. So as I said before, of course, it matters what you think, it matters how you feel about yourself. It matters whether you see your life and the planet as a series of negative circumstances and struggles and things to complain about, things to project onto, so to place blame elsewhere. So this is an issue, but on the other side, we have to look at there are real things in life which suck. There are periods of time when the things are out outside of your control where you don't get what you want and you don't feel amazing. And that's what I want to address today because I'm filming this today on this strange hill covered in ancient windmills in Portugal early in 2021. And over the last 12 months, most people on the planet have had their lives disrupted in smaller or often in massive ways. And that's as true for me as it is probably for you and most people watching this. We got smashed. We got fucked. Coronavirus arrived and derailed all sorts of plans that you may have had, particularly with guys that have come to this channel to learn about socializing, about seduction, about meeting women. Suddenly, it's illegal to meet women maybe in your city. You can't leave your house or if you can, you can only go to get groceries. There's no parties, there's no bars, there's day game opportunities are limited. So for a guy that's been investing time studying this and working on it and going out in the field, to then have 12 months where that's completely derailed can be a massive upset. And that's not your fault. That's not a mindset issue. That's not because of your lack of positive thinking. That's because a fucking virus has hit the planet and meant that the world is scrambling to figure out what to do. In the process, they're locking and unlocking the doors every couple of weeks to try and figure out how to manage this thing. In terms of how you're feeling about yourself, this is another area that for a lot of people, their self-esteem has tanked over the last 12 months. They're feeling more depressed, more anxious, more lonely. And this has been proven in the statistics that mental health issues are paramount. Not that mental health was not an issue before this, but continues to be and is exasperated by the issues of being isolated primarily from your communities, from your family, from romantic partners or potential romantic partners. And so there is a situation where a lot of people are struggling with loneliness and solitude. And so I wanted to have a chat today about this and to look at, okay, so what are some of the strategies, like effective strategies that we can use to deal with this time? But also some of the more, let's say, I would say subtler strategies in terms of coming to terms with what is going on. Because it's not necessarily going to help to just grin your teeth and say positive affirmations in the mirror and hope that the universe is just going to deliver to you because of some thing to do with the secret. If you put it out there, positive thoughts out into the universe, that it's always going to come back to you and deliver to you in kind. I don't think the universe necessarily works like that. I think karma is a lot more complicated than put positive things out there and then your dream car, woman slash career, all that will just appear to you because the universe loves manifesting stuff for people who put vision boards up. I don't really think it works like that. It's more complex. In terms of strategies for success, there is a blend of elements. Yes, the mindsets, the way that the technology of thinking that you carry around in your brain, how you process your emotions, how you plot goals and work towards those. Yes, these things matter and they are important. But at the same time, okay, we're living on a planet with an economic system, with a health system, with travel restrictions, with mandatory distancing from other humans, all these other things. And we have to accept that this is our reality and sure, take responsibility for the parts that we can. And the guys that are succeeding in this time are the ones that are more nimble, more adaptable, who are able to go lean, maybe move countries, who are working out ways to work remotely, that are adjusting to the dating, new dating world. Whether that means more online game or having a period of involuntary celibacy that is used effectively and so on. So these things matter and these are things that you have choice over. But when it comes to, okay, if you're someone who's been locked in an apartment by yourself or within your small social distancing bubble of people that you're allowed to hang out with, this is going to have an effect. Loneliness is a bit of a taboo to talk about. Like, it's not really that accepted to admit that you're feeling lonely and isolated. It's a lived reality for a lot of people on the planet right now, but it's also something that people have shame about or that they don't wish to discuss. And when a guy is looking at trying to have excellence in his life, often the tendency is to always take responsibility for everything and try and suck it up, to tough it up, to, you know, don't be a pussy, to not let your emotions get in the way of your pragmatism and so on. And I don't think this is going to be useful to you when you're in a scenario where you can't necessarily affect or change the outcome. So what do you do with this? Like, if you're someone who's going through shorter or longer, and for many people it's quite extended periods of isolation and therefore loneliness, then the question is, how do you come to terms with this? There are two main things we can do. One is to get less lonely, right? So we'll talk about that a little bit later in terms of, okay, strategies for dealing with the reality that you're in. You can't go down the local pub, you can't hang out with your friends, you can't go and visit your family maybe. So therefore, what can we do to be less lonely or be less isolated? Okay, that's on the one side. But firstly, and I think more importantly, is to look at what are you doing with your internal world? How have you been dealing with this period? Now, the most common way that people deal with uncomfortable situations, particularly ones that are ongoing, is through distraction. And inevitably, over the last 12 months, you and I and everyone else has been guilty of plenty of distraction-type behaviours, whether that means spending long periods online, watching Netflix and YouTube and doomscrolling, or the many other ways that we as humans distract ourselves, whether that's through stimulants and addictive behaviours. But for the most part, it's going to be kind of digital distractions. And if you haven't already, I encourage you to put an app on your phone to look at what is your actual phone usage, especially compared to back in the good old days when you could walk down the streets and wave at a stranger. Inevitably, you're spending hours more probably per day on screens that you were. And this is like, well, on the one hand, the big message I want to bring in this video is to have self-compassion, right? So there is something to be said for kicking your own ass and getting yourself moving and digging yourself out of a rut, for sure. But on the other hand, you need to have compassion for yourself in this really bizarre time and throughout your life, because there will be many periods where you can't just positively think your way out of something. When the secret is not enough to fix the problem, it may require you to wait, to just deal with a real reality that you can't necessarily affect. And so what can you affect? You can only affect the way that you respond internally to this, your reactions to the external circumstance, if we can't change the external circumstance. So the first big takeaway I want to give you is the idea of looking deeper into your solitude and your loneliness and having compassion for yourself and allowing yourself to mourn, right? To be sad for the things, people, situations, opportunities and so on that you have lost or that have been plans of yours that have been derailed, an economic situation that maybe you worked really hard for and then you lost your job or you've lost your housing or you've had some economic hit. Relationship lives where maybe before the pandemic you were dating or you had some girls on the go or you had a social life that was either in its infancy or it was in its ascendancy and you were getting the advantages and the benefits from that or you were at least a guy who was working on these skills, trying to adapt and change and figure out how to become more social and seductive. And that's been ripped away from you, that's been taken from you or made much more difficult. So allow yourself to be sad for that. Give yourself a mourning period and if you've been living just in distraction for the last 12 months and you've found that to a certain degree that period is past in sort of numbness, then I would say you haven't really gone through the mourning process or the mourning period yet. What's this going to involve? It's going to involve firstly switching off the distractions. I would even try this, you could give yourself just one evening for example where you pay homage to your loss and you allow yourself to feel the grief and the loss and the frustration and the anger or the sadness or whatever it is or blend of those things and to express them. So the way I would suggest that is literally turn your internet off for an evening, spend some time in meditation and you can do this formally or informally, but to sit yourself in meditation and go inside the space, go back over the last 12 months, the time before it, note the areas that you were building, the projects, the social situations and so on that you were involved in and then note, okay, when this thing hit about a year ago, what was taken away from you? What were the areas that were made a lot more difficult or impossible? Who were the people that you were unable to see? Maybe you haven't been, like myself, I haven't been able to see my family for a year, probably won't see them for another year because they're in Australia and it's completely locked and that's something to grieve. For probably two years, I will miss the opportunity to spend time with those family members and all my friends in Australia. It's a loss, right? It's not something I can positively think my way out of. I can't change the facts of that right now. So what can I do? I can observe and allow myself to feel those feelings and go through the emotional processes that involves. So take an evening or maybe it takes a weekend or give yourself time where you properly switch off, right? So rather than this being like I'm disconnected but I'm still constantly in relation to all of this media which brings me out of the present moment, which distracts me from immersing myself and feeling and actually observing what's truly going on for me. So I switch all that off and do the thing that most humans in this day and age are terrified of, which is to be actually alone, right? So if the reality is you're physically alone, are alone, or you're either by yourself or you have a limited number of people that you can hang out with, or you're severely restricted in that, then the thing that we will often do as humans is we will try and buffer ourselves against this discomfort and this pain. And we do that with all of those distractions, Netflix and pizzas and vaping and anything else we can to create padding around ourselves. Because we are terrified ultimately of being actually alone. It's an old cliche that you're born alone and you die alone. Everyone understands that in some ways the human experience is one of solitude. It's a personal lived experience in relation to other people, but at the end of the day it's your life that you're experiencing from beginning to end and you do it alone. And that's a really scary prospect for people. Most people are really uncomfortable with being alone, especially for any extended period of time. And the problem with that is multiple fold. One of them is that you never really get to know yourself. Because to truly understand yourself and experience who you are as a human being, yes you can do that in relation to other people through romances and love affairs and collaborations and we will learn about ourselves as we interface with the world. But we will learn a lot more and a lot more depth about ourselves by going inwards. By actually stepping back from all those distractions and needs. The need for validation or affection or constant attention or being around people all the time. And to actually give ourselves the space to sit in this. What is this space of solitude and loneliness? Because there is a difference, right? They're the same lived experience. If I stay up here by myself with these windmills for the next 48 hours, I'll be living in solitude. I will be alone. But whether or not I feel lonely will be my subjective experience of it. I'm not saying it would be better or worse to really sink into this feeling alone. But at the end of the day, it's an interpretation of my experience, not the experience itself that affects me. So the first thing to do, I think, is to really go lean into the loneliness. As opposed to it being something which you're afraid of and you're worried about the loss and the fact that, okay, now I've got 70% less social contact than I had one year ago, for example. And to feel the fear and the loss of this and the worry that you're falling behind, the fear of missing out, the sense of urgency, the sense of neediness for affection, for love, for human contact. So these are all very natural things and they're part of the human condition and they can't be denied. But they're only one aspect of it. We are able to sink into our loneliness. Most of us don't want to live like hermits and spend the rest of our lives alone. That's not going to be nourishing. And it's certainly something that for introverted guys or guys that have, let's say, cobbled together their emotional needs through an online space, usually through video games or online chatting or the consumption of media in various ways that tends to put a large portion of male populations in isolation even before this situation. Yes, you do need to address that because that's not an effective long-term strategy. The people that succeed in life, and by success I don't just mean millions of bucks, I mean those who have a sense of fulfilment, it comes through, primarily it comes through community, through your personal interactions, through the deep friendships, through the love affairs, through the tribal bonds that we have. As tribal and social creatures, we need those relationships in order to feel good overall as a baseline. Some of us are more addicted to those than others, some of us are more independent and autonomous than others, and I think it's really important to be able to exist within both sides of those experiences, to be able to sit in solitude and to experience that for both its pain and its joy, as well as, on the other side of that, being able to go out and make connections, be vulnerable, be raw and real with people and really actually have the human element in our lives. So the first thing I recommend is take an evening and think back over this period of time, think of what you've lost, think of the beautiful nights with a woman, or close experiences with friends, or the bonding of returning to family, or the freedom and exploration that comes from travel and being able to move around freely. Sit with it and allow yourself to feel what have you lost, and don't try and mask it up with positivity and how things are going to be great. Yeah, things will get better and they'll get worse, that's what things do. Things get better and they get worse, and they get better and they get worse, and people have a variety of experiences. So this constant thing of like, oh, it'll end up fine, yeah, I mean in the grand scheme of things, yes, but if right now it really does suck and there is really pain to be investigated, then investigate it, don't hide from it. Allow yourself to mourn, and that means for men, squeeze out a few tears, and for a lot of men that's difficult. I talk to clients all the time and they say, you know, I haven't cried since somebody died or since I was a kid, or like some major traumatic event, and then they hold in their emotions for the rest of the time, and some guys just never cry. And why is that? Because they're taught that real men don't cry, that you have to be tough, that you have to have a stiff upper lip, that you're going to be a pussy faggot if you do that. And I thoroughly disagree. You can be an extremely tough, robust, adaptable, effective human being who is emotionally expressive and cries, and I think you're more likely to be if you can do that regularly. And if there was ever a time to cry, it's now, right? Okay, you've been experiencing this for a year and you've figured out ways to survive and to adapt, but it's still, we've all been through a traumatic event and are continuing to do so. So allow yourself to fall to bits for a period of time if you need to. Allow yourself to cry and scream it out, to go and kick a punching bag, you know, or go off into the forest and break something. Express yourself in a way where you do let out this sorrow, this anger, this frustration, because it's not your fault. It's not yours. You didn't make this. And to carry it all on yourself, thinking that, okay, I need to grin and be positive and hustle and not be a quitter, and all these kind of self-help platitudes, it's not bad advice, but it's not holistic advice. It doesn't look at the full lived experience, that there is no trajectory where everything just gets better. It doesn't work like that. So as you are experiencing this shit time in life, have a how, have a cry, have a complain, all right, about how unfair it is, how unjust it is, how the timing sucks. You know, let's imagine you're a young guy and you just started to go out and go to bars and clubs and meet girls on the street and you're really, this is your time to be a youth going out there and grabbing life. And then suddenly, no, you have to get locked in your house for kind of a year to two years. That's a big chunk of your dating life just ripped away from you or of your youthful experiences or being a young guy who wants to go to festivals and, you know, meet girls as you travel the world for example. Let it out. Let yourself experience that. And don't be ashamed of it. I don't suggest you should wallow in it and stay there forever, but allow the grief process. If somebody close to you dies, and I've had that experience before where the grief doesn't hit you immediately, and it's really weird and difficult to kind of imagine them not there and they're not there anymore and you don't really feel some emotion, yet at some point a song comes on or you look at a photo or someone mentions something about them or you're watching a sunset and you remember a moment with them and it all floods in and hits you. So this is the human animal has this kind of internal process of like receiving trauma and damage, whether it's physical or emotional, and then being able to scar tissue it over and just walk wounded as needed. So that happens in life, right, where something really traumatic happens, but you don't have the luxury of mourning this right now, or maybe you don't have the emotional capacity to deal with it right now. It's just too much, you've got to stay on point, you can't even process or conceptualize the lost, and so your body just goes, alright, patch that up internally some way and we'll keep walking wounded. That's good and it's okay in the sense that, yeah, it's amazing how humans can do that. We can come out of a war situation or see something truly horrific or go through something that's really damaging and then we can survive, we can maintain, we can procreate, we can continue even though we are walking wounded. But what happens over a lifetime is that if you keep doing that and you just add layers and layers of scar tissue and compensatory behaviors or mindsets or distraction kinds of techniques, it means you move further and further away from understanding or experiencing yourself completely. So maybe you experience the hustle and the workaholic and the get shit done side of yourself and that's great, but you don't experience the sensitive side, you don't get to process or purge these emotional experiences. Women tend to be better at this, right? They feel upset, they cry. Not all women all the time, but this is pretty common. She feels an emotion in real time, she expresses it, which is why women tend to cry more often than us. And men are scared of women's tears, but women aren't scared of women's tears because when we see a woman cry, we're like, oh no, she's broken, it's the end of the world. And for her, it's like, no, this emotion is real now. I'm crying it out because that sadness in whatever form it was needed to be expressed and then she cries it out and then it's gone. Or if it's not gone, at least it's had its expression. And as a result, instead of just adding more layers of scar tissue, there is some kind of healing process going on. There's some resolution going on so that over time, something that was a major issue can gradually dissolve and become something that is just a memory, that you've found a strategy to work around and as a result, you feel better and you grow from the experience as opposed to just accruing damage over time, which is often what men do. So in this time where we are getting smashed, where the damage is being inflicted upon us, where it's mostly not your fault, don't take fault for it. Don't beat yourself up about it. Switch your phone off, think through it, really dig deep into that pain and explore it. Allow yourself to feel it for all it is. And when the emotions rise, don't fight them and don't try to plaster over them with positive emotions. It's like, feel the despair, feel the loneliness and howl and scream it out. Another layer to this is one that I recommend but with a little bit of caution. And this is to really stare into the abyss. There will be a number of times in your life, sometimes referred to the long dark night of the soul, where the experience of being human, the raw terrifying ultimate reality of it is revealed to you. Now when I say ultimate reality, I mean this in a subjective sense. There are all sorts of aspects of your lived experience which are real. On one level I'm a mammal, on one level I'm a male, on one level I'm an Australian, on one level I have these likes and dislikes and these beliefs. We have all of these conditioned and genetic aspects of ourselves which are real. But there is some aspect to our lived experience which if we look into it can appear to be extremely negative and also true. Which is a viewpoint of nihilism, like unless you believe in a great creator who created you for a very specific purpose which was to follow ten rules and then if you follow those ten rules for your life then you get to sit on a cloud feeling happy for eternity. Unless you believe in that kind of thing which sounds kind of comforting but it's a bit late for me, I'm not going to pick that belief up. So if you believe that we're born, we die, we're a genetic organism, there is this abyss that we can look into which is that our life is pointless, that it intrinsically has no meaning, that we are alone, that all humans and organisms are self-interested and so does anyone really even care about you or do you really care about anyone else? These are the big existential questions that you can dig into or that may become apparent when you're going through this kind of mourning period, this looking deep into the darkness. Now the warning that I want to put here is that if we stare too long into the darkness then we can get lost into it and someone who has chronic depression or anxiety or someone who lives with an extremely negative tinting of reality throughout time or for large periods of their life, they become lost in this way of viewing things because it is only one viewpoint. There is another equally valid viewpoint which is that we are all interconnected, that we're all vibrations humming throughout the universe, that love is an ever-present force, that intrinsically we have meaning and purpose because we're alive and this is our lived experience and purpose is unfolding moment by moment."}
