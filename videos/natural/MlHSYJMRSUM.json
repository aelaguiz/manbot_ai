Do you like it and under what circumstances? Being honest, I started to like it after I met you. So you showed me how anal sex can feel like and I was surprised that it wasn't painful. So what was it that I did that made it pleasurable? Well, it's about the skill. Also, I noticed that it's super important for me personally to make it without a condom. And the same uncomfortable feelings I'm getting with toys. So only natural dick can feel good for me in anal sex. And yeah, I started to get pleasure out of it physically. And before I was getting more like mentally, yeah, because it was still painful. But I liked it to give myself a sacrifice for a man. So like the psychological turn on was that you were like letting the man use you in whatever way he wants, something like this? Yes, but it only works with a guy who I really like as a person. So if there is trust and kind of warm relationships between you, because without it, it would be just using. But in this case, it's serving. It's you serving the man when it's like he owns this or he deserves it, or you respect him enough and desire him enough that it's a turn on to let him use you in that way, let's say. Yes, exactly. Okay, so aside from the psychological elements of it, so you said when it's done well, so you get physical pleasure. Is the physical pleasure mainly in your butt? Is it in relation to your pussy? Is it when you rub your pussy at the same time? Like how does those combinations work? It's actually super hard to explain because I feel this pleasure concentrated closer to my pussy and cleats while I'm having anal sex. So it's kind of giving a signal or I don't know how it works. So it makes your pussy hornier if there's good anal sex? I mean, like not just hornier, like it's simulating, but just not so directly, but in some way I can feel it with every friction in my pussy. Okay, and with anal sex, is there something about it being naughty, dirty, taboo, kinky? And you could say that about various extreme things like very intense deep throat or something. Like is the kinkiness of it or the nastiness or the dirtiness of the sex act a turn on as well? It's a hard question because I think I already lose this sense of kinkiness and dirtiness a long time ago. So I don't consider anal sex or deep throating like something too special, you know. But for some people, I think it can work this way. So it's more like when you feel comfortable with your partner, you're not thinking about these are certain things, these are the nasty things. It just blends together and you go with what feels right. We are both grown up persons, so everything we like to do with each other, I don't consider to be dirty or bad or something like that. I mean, there should be a line, yeah. I didn't find it. Okay, yes. I found my lines. There is a line somewhere. Do you like anal sex and anal play? Maybe sometimes. And under what circumstances? I've used only two in my life. And it was good. It was interesting. But don't do it so fast. Men need to feel women. It's not easy. And yeah, just feeling, just be soft, touch, talking with shape. Right. So you need to really relax and feel safe with him and take time. Women need super relaxed atmosphere. Yeah, because you said, yeah, it's not easy, so you can't rush. You have to take it slowly. You said you only tried this with two people. So other people maybe tried and you said no. Yeah. Okay. Why did you say no? I think all guys ask me, can I? No, of course not. So why was it obvious to say no in those circumstances? Because firstly, I don't want it. And so next day I don't trust men. I don't see that it will be good. And yeah, I think it's too late. Okay. So if you feel like the man knows what he's doing with other things in sex and other stuff, and you feel relaxed, you feel turned on in that circumstance, then you might be open to it. Yeah. Okay, cool. And when it's, when it is that like that, does it feel good? Like if it's that situation? Yeah. And why? What is, what feels good? When men have anal sex with me and touch my pussy, it's like double enjoying. Right. So you're adding layers of pleasure. Yeah. That's hot. Squirting. What does that, how does that feel different from say a clitoral orgasm or inside your pussy orgasm? Like what's, yeah, what's that experience like? Obviously, it's a little bit more intense. And I don't like squirting too often. And I definitely wouldn't do it every time I'm having sex. It's something like special for a, for a desert time from time. So, yeah. Why is that? Because it's exhausting. Yeah. It kind of sucks me dry and I'm always having this time of recovering back after squirting. But in a moment, yes, it's, it's cool when you're having like come in a way that men have. So you're also producing something. Like it's an erotic moment because it's unusual. Yes. And I just think I haven't met a guy who wouldn't like it. Everyone likes it. Definitely it's good for men's egos. It makes them feel like they know what they're doing. Okay. And then, all right. So it's something that you wouldn't want to be doing all the time. And that's, I think for the guys to note that, that, uh, yes, it is desert. That's a good way to look at it. Um, and can be very exhausting. And yeah, if we were, if I was trying to force that every time, then that would be something tiring. And you have expectation on that. Yeah. And it was related to this guy I was talking about, uh, who was putting too much pressure on me. Yeah. Triana bring me pleasure. Yeah. He always wanted to make it to the squirts. And I was like, what for? Right. Yes. It's a good question. Cause if it's not for you, then it's for him. Um, cool. Yeah. So that's something that guys need to communicate with or communicate with their girl to note. Cause I know I've met some girls who squirt like every minute, just no matter what you do. Uh, and you know, they, their response to it is different from someone else. So it's something that you need to kind of negotiate and work out with your girl. How often do you masturbate? Oh, not too much. Really not too much. Maybe one a week. Okay. One, two a week. It's like, uh, if I have a normal graphic, uh, without too much work, I am feeling good. So I feel in the relax and, uh, I feel in more sexy because when I have work, I don't, uh, think about masturbate. I don't think about, uh, sex, about mans, womans. Uh, I just want to die. And so when I have holiday weekend, I think, Oh, nice. You remember. You're like, Oh, sex. Yes. Right. Okay. So that's interesting. So it's for you, it's like if you, if you have stress or you, or you're not, you, it's kind of like you're in a different type of yourself. I can masturbate, uh, to be more beauty. It's like makeup. So before a photo shoot, you might rub your pussy to make your cheeks. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Firstly, I masturbate. And secondly, I have my makeup. It's yeah. So that's the secret combination. Yes. You should teach that special makeup tutorial. I would watch that video. So, okay. So you only, you would only masturbate when you, when you feel relaxed and sexy in that space. Yeah. Or when I need to be super amazing in meet. Right. Date. Yeah. Okay. So really, so for you, it's like a preparation. It makes you feel confident and sexy. Yes. Yes. I just want to be more, uh, with endorphin, woman lifestyle, cat lifestyle, and masturbate. And next time I come to business lunch and hello guys, how are you? Nice one. I don't know if that would work for me before a business meeting. I just jerk off and like, here you go. I think that's, that works for you. Men's like it. I'm sure they do. I'm no doubt. How often would you say that you masturbate if you're not seeing someone to start with? Maybe if not every day, then, um, just day after. So more or less every day. And sometimes you take the weekend off. Of course it's also depends on, uh, mental condition. Uh, if there is a low period, uh, like, uh, I feel, uh, a little bit depressed. It's, uh, maybe, uh, I'll do it, uh, not that often, but still one few times, uh, in a week. Yes. And so is your sexuality like, do you, I mean, it sounds like it, that it's fairly consistent or do you find that like there's periods where maybe you don't feel sexual or you might feel sexual, but you don't act on it. Um, so it's pretty much, it's a consistent part of your life. Okay. I just have a really high, uh, constitution and, uh, Sex drive? Yeah, sex drive, uh, maybe, maybe it's stronger than, um, my girlfriends, uh, who I know, uh, have. So, yeah. But I'm glad that I have this sex drive. Oh yeah, I'm not trying to say it's too much. I wouldn't change it. Yeah. I wouldn't, uh, say I'm getting tired of it. It doesn't make me, uh, struggle with, uh, wanting sex every time, like always. No, I mean, I can't control it. So, uh, I wouldn't go crazy if I can't have sex or masturbate for, uh, weeks. It's okay, but still, yeah. And how would you, well, let's say if you're, if you have a man that's good, knows what he's doing, How much sex would you want in a day or in a week, let's say? For sure, um, I prefer to have it every day. So, uh, less than this would be, uh, offensive for me. Uh, it can make me feel unwanted or something. About how many times per day, uh, I can tell sometimes I really want to make it, uh, the whole day. Sometimes, uh, one time, uh, before going to sleep, uh, is totally okay. So yeah, depends on partner. So if you're someone who's, you know, has a high sex drive, you want some kind of sexual activity more or less every day? More or less every day. Um, do you find like, how do you go about, let's say, okay, you don't have a lover right now somewhere and you're horny most days. Do you, cause like from a man's perspective, if we could, we would just, every time we're horny, we'd have a woman. Uh, it's most men would prefer that than masturbating. Yeah, you know, I'm kind of separating sex from masturbation, like for me it's different things that are not intersecting. Yes. Why not? In what way? Because it's just about different things, I don't know, I can have sex every day but I still want to masturbate on my own, you know. Even if you had orgasms with the man? Even if I'm totally satisfied by him, yeah. Is that, do you think it's more about like having personal time, sensual time? Yes, I guess so. And where you're not, where now your sexuality is not about serving someone else, it's about pleasing yourself? Yes, yes. Okay, that's interesting. The same way I wouldn't be offended if I got to know that my partner is masturbating while he's in the bathroom, so I don't know it, so no, it wouldn't be offensive. Well with you, he probably wouldn't have any energy to do that.
