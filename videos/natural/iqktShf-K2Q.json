Now in the lead up to the Five Principles relaunch coming very fucking soon I decided to go out on the streets and meet a bunch of chicks just to test my skills and see if these principles still work which they do and I did very well on this day and so what I wanted to do was break down a whole bunch of sets that I did for you guys keeping in mind everything from the from the Five Principles perspectives so that you can get kind of an insight into how my mind is thinking what is my processes that I go through whilst I'm infield and how that relates back to these five principles how it is that I'm able to on the fly utilize each of the principles in a way that is seamless and natural every time so that it doesn't come across like I'm scripted or or rehearsed which I'm not so let's check out some infield excuse me hi there I just saw you walking by and I thought you had awesome glasses and a nice elegant posture so I wanted to meet you what's your name? Ulia. Ulia? Yeah. What's your name? James. James? Yeah you're obviously not Hungarian. Firstly the opener nothing too fancy but it was specific as I saw the girl walk past I noted that she had nice upright posture that she had cool set of delicate kind of hipster glasses and she looked Asian but not way East Asian Central Asian so based upon that small amount of information that's how I went and spoke to the girl simply commenting on those two aspects about her so that's a that's a direct compliment but it is very specific and tailored to her it shows my level of awareness and it shows that I'm actually specifically interested in her not just in her as a generic hot girl I'm always going on about this if you're going to give a girl a compliment try to give her a specific compliment if all else fails sure tell her that she's beautiful that's okay it can work for sure but if it's specific it shows that you have chosen her out of all the other girls on the street which helps to make her feel validated and like this is a moment in time a special movie moment rather than you just grinding through your day game. Yeah. Neither am I. Are you from England? No I'm Australian. Yeah and what about you? I'm from Mongolia. Oh really? My brother and his wife are Mongolian specialists. Yeah they lived in Ulaanbaatar for a long time and they're here for a conference this weekend. Are you here for the conference? No. All right did you know it's something to do with Mongolian Buddhism it's happening here this weekend. You didn't know? No. Yeah all right. What are the chances this chick's Mongolian my brother's wife is a specialist in Mongolian Buddhism that's true and literally they were in town at the same time as this girl right so they were in town from a conference on Mongolia right and then there's a girl who's from Mongolia and I have been to Mongolia how fucking awesome is this like this is the best thing that could ever happen right because she's Mongolian I've been to Mongolia my brother's in Mongolia there's a Mongolian this I'm so getting fucking laid from Mongolia no no not at all this was the mistake this was my mistake bit of the interaction and it's something that I definitely tell students not to do and in this case I fell into it because I was like whoa so many Mongolian coincidences but no one gives a fuck right this is a common thing that a guy finds out a girl's from Sweden he's like oh my brother went to Sweden once and she's like yeah okay or you or you you went to the same school but in different years or you're into the same sporting team or there's some same thing no one gives a fuck doesn't matter right so don't don't try and and often guys are like hunting around they're throwing out topics hoping that you will have some vague commonality and this is what's important to understand is this is not a commonality between her and I this is not about how we're both introverted or about how we both uh like have an impetuous capricious passion this is not a personal personality commonality it's just a fact she's from Mongolia and I've been to Mongolia it's no offense to Mongolia but Mongolia is shit actually it's just like endless steps of of grassland going forever and very drunk Mongolian men that was pretty much my impression and everyone lives in yurts which have a satellite tv and then a goat carcass hanging for a minute it stinks like yak shit one of my least favorite places to go sorry Mongolia however if I talked about that my experience in Mongolia which I didn't get a chance to because we're having a short interaction and then like talked about the culture and how she would what whether what the culture meant to her and whether she was a typical Mongolian and what the dating scene was like and stuff okay then that would have been fine we could have had a chat where Mongolia was the theme but just looking for commonalities in facts doesn't help and as you can see this girl's not I think she really thinks I'm lying right here she's like oh yeah your brothers okay they're here for a Mongolian conference oh yeah what's it about I'm like and I was stumbling because I'm like there's so a Mongolian conference oh boy but I couldn't explain it well enough and now she thinks I'm lying about Mongolia all right don't do that I went there once yeah to Ulaanbaatar and then I went very far north to a lake which I can't remember the name of yes here I am just lying about Mongolia again she's like we're in Mongolia I was like Ulaanbaatar the capital and the lake and I was like I went to a lake what is it called she's like Hofscot I'm like yeah that's the one uh no one believes me now no one everyone thinks I'm lying about Mongolia very intense journey to get it was very beautiful but it was like 40 hours in a Russian jeep over the steps it was a very um rugged just here to talk to you um no I live here yeah uh well I live here on and off for five years like half the year I'm here half the year I'm in Australia or I travel quite a bit um but yeah now I'm here for the rest of the spring summer and you yeah studying what maybe we can stop for a second because I don't want to follow you like all the way we can just chat a minute this bit boring I'm bored you're bored it's just chit chat we're just talking about where who's from where and what they're doing here this is this happens in the interactions it's not a big deal don't need to stress out all I'm doing here is just finding out some basic information and then we're moving to something else what I do do is I ask her to stop now the main reason I asked her to stop is because I know that Alex my cameraman is like running along trying to hold the camera straight and it's better to film in field on a stationary girl that's for you guys to get a better shot but on a practical level I do this often anyway walking with a girl and I and I see after a while she's not in a super rush and she is asking me questions she's relatively invested so she's happy enough to chat and it's totally cool to walk alongside a girl like approach her and then keep walking you don't always have to stop her straight away some people are very militant about this I'm not and I think it's good it's a nice thing to just kind of cruise along with somebody but it's if I keep on walking and walking with her firstly she's thinking is this guy going to follow me home and secondly yes her attention is still forward and mostly not in a conversation so I'll do this after a while I'll just say hey as I did here let's stop and chat for a second which now draws the focus to me completely and it's an easier way to stop the girl than stopping her at the very beginning uh I studied tourism uh-huh yeah so I have like two more years sorry two more years you like it here yeah you've got mixed mixed emotions it's you can be honest I'm not I'm not a patriot but I'm not gonna stay here right what's the what's the not okay bit for you feel people a bit grumpy yeah they are yeah are they to asian people to non-white people right so you've experienced that right yeah well I guess they're um it's kind of like a bubble where they've only just come out of the soviet era so they're still discovering the world one of my friends who I live with is black and he gets mixed like some some people love him like like almost like a fetish but others yeah he gets treated weirdly so yeah and what do you do for fun standard question what's she doing here she's studying and rather than ask her I did ask her what she's what she's studying tourism and I was like yeah I don't really want to talk about that particularly she didn't say it in a way that she was like tourism I'm so into it she's like studying tourism so I decided to just shift to the personal which is does she like it here as in in Budapest where she's not from uh and then I saw in her face you can't probably see it in the in the shot but she went and I could see her scrunch her face up a little bit and then so I preempted and said you've got mixed emotions about that and she's like yes yes so it turns out it's because apparently Hungarians are racist to Mongolians which is which is uh not cool especially because considering the history the steppe tribes actually came to Mongolia if you know your history you're closer more closely related to Mongolians than anyone than the Slavs Mongol Hungarians so you know don't be racist to Mongolians but anyway that's a different issue um so all what I'm doing here is I'm using my awareness so much of my what directs me into inner seduction like which direction I'm going to go whether I'm going to follow a topic or not whether I'm going to accelerate my pace whether I'm going to hang back whether I'm going to uh escalate on her whether I'm going to give her space it's always keep coming back to the first principle awareness it's without being hyper aware of yourself the girl and the surroundings you will never be a very good seducer right take that on board it doesn't matter how effective you get with your escalation doesn't matter how many lines or gambits or even like principle-based kind of uh conversational frameworks you learn if you're not able to be really really aware and move on a dime just adjust as the moment dictates then you'll just fuck it up so many more times you'll just not read stuff correctly and the girl will just read you as socially uncalibrated or feel a little bit weird and then therefore she just doesn't want to see you again girls don't like hanging out with or giving numbers to guys that where they feel a little bit off and so me just noticing that little scrunch of her face little furrow of the brow and and then showing that okay I get that she's not that into Hungary just shows that I'm a person that's listening to her and it creates a little bit of rapport now we get into the topic of racism here which is not a topic I want to necessarily talk about for a long time it's kind of a loaded topic and and I'm white and she's not white and I don't can't remember which what I'm supposed to say or who I'm allowed to call what color or whatever is whatever is the dumb thing these days so I mentioned something about how Tony sometimes gets some something and I realize I'm digging myself into an area which I shouldn't talk about and so I just go all right so what do you do for fun do you have time for fun or not yeah yeah I go out party you don't look like a party animal are you a secret party animal I'm not a party animal right I like having fun uh-huh what's the difference that I like having fun yeah but I'm not that crazy okay all right so you're a refined yeah I have my boundaries oh yeah that's good that's important uh it's good but you don't have the boundary of not talking to a stranger which is a good one this is where it gets a little bit flirtier and it's it's subtle okay so she says she likes to party and then my tone of voice changes I lower my voice make it a little bit more sexy and say oh you don't look like a party animal and now I'm looking her in the eyes with clearer sexual intent all right because now we are getting into and she says you know she likes to party and she's implying I don't know what exactly maybe she's implying she likes gang bangs or maybe she's just implying that she likes to like have a shot and dance to Beyonce I don't know whatever that means to her but I allow myself to be insinuated or for her to insinuate herself into something a little bit sassier I know that's not the most clear way to describe that but this is to do with the vibe this is the intent if you watch this again you you'll you'll feel a phase shift from like okay we're chatting we're talking to all right this is a little bit sexier now she's talking about how she likes to party but she's not a slut or something along those lines and she has her boundaries and then I just use that that uh topic direction and then I reinterpret it say okay but you don't have the boundary where you don't talk to strangers which is a good one and then the camera cuts out for a few seconds that's true well we can have a conversation um would you like to have a conversation over a cup of tea sometime all right awesome well I presume you have a phone number I do but I don't know it so I have to look it up I don't know it either I don't know mine either so that's the finest thing sorry can you tell me your name again oh it's like a Russian name right kind of yeah oh yeah do you speak Russian as well uh not really I just know like basic I don't speak it either like this yeah do you live on campus or are you no I live uh close to everything's going good here doing a pretty good number close which is just casual this is pulling the trigger is the fifth principle and an important thing about pulling the trigger is understanding when to release pressure I don't want to make a big deal and make it intense when I'm going for the number so you can see that I'm actually asking her chit chatty questions whilst I'm like typing her her name in yeah so I'm just asking if she asked Russian or whatever speaks Russian or whatever I'm doing that deliberately because I just didn't want there to be a dead silence in that moment uh and then when I ask where she lives and she looks around we looked at the we looked at this footage later and she looked dead in the camera and I got fucking busted there and that's why this number flaked very certain of that fucking well done Alex couldn't have just like pretended to be in damn I've never had sex with a Mongolian now I'm never going to yeah I live just there uh right next to Forensic just this street here so we're neighbors two seven five nine four six nine is that right let me call you oh hang on I've done that all And what are you doing right now? I'm walking to this Russian supermarket. It's not a supermarket, it's a market. Like an outdoor market? No, it's like a very small shop. It just has some Russian stuff. What do you need? I need to buy my rice. Is your phone ringing? I'm calling you by the way. Did you think I was calling someone else? That would have been rude. No, I got you. You've got to get rice and vareniki. I'm going to make some Russian soup. Nice to meet you. I'll talk to you soon. Bye."}
