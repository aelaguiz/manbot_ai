Welcome to the train to nowhere. It's the Shaman here coming at you through the wilds of Czech Republic and today I want to talk to you about something very interesting. I was looking over a lot of the ask the natural questions and you know a lot of sort of repeating ideas and some common things and a lot of questions that aren't really useful questions basically and what it got me thinking was that rather than answering some questions that aren't really that useful why not talk about asking good quality questions and learning how to manage yourself in a more effective way. So basically I want to give you guys a really cool formula today to get you moving from a place of really not thinking very clearly to a place where you're trusting yourself a lot more effectively. I know this is really useful because I use it myself and I work with this same kind of technology with my clients all the time and it has very very profound results. So the first thing I want you guys to recognize is that you are amazing at being able to understand and create your interpretation of reality. You're doing it all the time. You can't not do it. You are always taking in information processing it making stories out of it and then making up beliefs and ways in which you interact with the world and as soon as you do that you create that reality. It's it's like a powerful mechanism to be able to take this field of possibility that could mean many things turn it into something and then make it exactly what it is. So what I wanted to talk to you about first of all is how to stop asking dumb questions and how to start asking good questions. Something that's really common that people do is they ask themselves questions like How do I do that? I'm not sure if I can. I don't know how to do that or you know, what do I need to do to be to to really get the result and it seems like fair questions, right? We're asking ourselves prompting questions, which which move us in a certain sort of direction But the problem is when we ask those questions, but we don't really look for answers and we don't trust our own answers so there can be a tendency when we are looking for a solution to something to ask questions, which then put us into a kind of a feedback loop or a spiral of Not really finding useful information For example, it's not really useful if you want to get better socially to set that goal and then start to think well I don't know how to do that so I'm not sure what I should do and then basically hang out in a sense of doubt and Insecurity and what does that do it starts to wire your brain up in such a way that it has Doubt and insecurity as part of your programming part of your expectation part of your projection of reality And I'm going to get to that a little bit more But one thing I would encourage you to do is to ask questions, but start to look for your own answers start to Set up the possibility that you can just find an answer. So for example, I don't know how to do that Okay, what if there was a part of you that did what if you could create three possible reasons? Why it might work and then start to develop and work with that. Why do you do that? Because it starts to develop Self-trust it starts to develop intuition. It starts to develop a connection with what we could call the unconscious process and The unconscious is really what we want to get into harmony with It's a part of us that is really working very hard to keep us Alive and to keep us happy according to the best that it knows and if we don't work with it consciously then it will just tend to push and pull us through life in a very kind of reactive way and Most of the time when people say, you know I'm feeling frustrated or I'm sabotaging myself or I can't get what I want or I don't know why I can't do this thing that I really want to do. It's because they're out of alignment with themselves. They're out of alignment with their unconscious mind So one of the ways that you get alignment is you start to trust that it's got Sorry, you start to trust that it has information for you You start to ask it questions and then listen for the feedback and be patient with it So that's the first thing I want you guys to work with is when you ask questions You notice yourself asking questions Start to create possible answers that might be useful and then play with those answers. Maybe they're useful Maybe they'll help you. Maybe you'll get some results Think about it most of the greatest innovations breakthroughs transformations information, you know Most of the biggest things that have happened In terms of developments have come from people that have basically just made shit up So I'm not just saying just pluck ideas from nowhere and don't qualify those ideas as being useful But I'm saying open your mind to the possibility that you already have answers within you that you can trust that you can start to Work with that. So that's the first thing is stop asking Questions that are not so useful and start trusting that you can reframe yourself to be able to ask Questions that are going to give you answers So how do I do that? Okay, how do you do that? Well ask the deeper parts of you that know how to do that to give you some answers now and trust Start to work with that and I know this is a little bit weird Maybe if you're not used to doing this kind of thing because I'm asking you to work with yourself at a deeper kind of level Which brings me to my next point. So The next point is that you are creating your relationship with reality all the time with your focus and When I say that I mean the habits of your focus create what you feel how you think who you think you are how to interpret your world around you and If you understand what I'm saying, then you'll realize that It's the feelings the thoughts the internal dialogue The the ways in which we focus on the certain aspects of evidence the certain things that are going on around us that create The Sensations the experiences the opportunities that you have around you now Do me a favor think about something that is not useful for you at the moment. Think about a problem Something that makes you feel uncomfortable or something that makes you feel frustrated something that makes you feel Like you don't really want to feel like that Got it Just take a moment Got it. Good now. I want to ask you a really cool question. How do you do that problem? What do you have to focus on? to create that problem in such a way that you think it's a problem that feels like a problem and You will find if you pay attention when you ask that question, what do you have to do? What do you have to consider? to pay attention to Focus on to have that problem and As you do that, you'll notice that there's an actual code to it. There's a certain set of feelings thoughts internal dialogue You know information focus on certain information certain pieces of the environment around you that create that kind of experience and when you do that, guess what it does tells the nervous system to fire up a reaction and Every time you fire up that reaction it sends out neurochemistry that neurochemistry Influences how your physiology feels what you respond to what kinds of information you have access to what kinds of states you go into and you what most people do is they Focus on something they don't want they feel bad about it. They don't like the feeling of feeling bad about it So then they ask themselves bad questions about why they feel bad about it And then they find more evidence and they fire it up again and again and again and again And they just keep refiring the nervous system to to have these kinds of reactions to the environment around them And what does that do over time? It sets up pathways strong neural pathways habits. It sets up chemical Tendencies and almost addictions inside of the brain So what that does is that creates who you are over time and creates your tendencies The truth is that you are constantly changing every part of you is constantly changing physically mentally emotionally energetically Everything's changing some parts more slower than others, but ultimately everything's changing There is literally nothing inside your body that will stay the same over an extended period of time So the real miracle is how do you keep creating problems? You have to work hard to keep your problems there So start to change your focus First thing changing your focus is realize that you're creating it in some ways you're doing you're doing it You're making it happen to a degree And the next thing you start to realize well, what can you do to shift that? Well, I'll ask you a more quality question. The next question which is important is what were you not considering? That is not the problem. It's got nothing to do with the problem that is going on around you That is basically good that is basically fine that is basically useful neutral or Changing in the way that you want So what is it that you that you are that you're not considering that is not the problem. That is basically good that is Transforming changing and moving in a way that you would like to or it's supporting you in some way And guess what? The whole world is going on around you. It's not your problem Then your body is taking care of you There's people and places and situations and systems that you may not have been paying attention to that are all in place to help You to do what you need to do right now. I'm sitting on a train. It's a miracle I get to drive along in this amazing machine It takes me from one country to another and it's taking care of me It's getting me where I need to go and I can focus on that I can focus on there's this huge expansive environment outside this perfect biosphere of Weather and light and you know, there's people around me is everything I basically need It's all here to basically support me and I can trust in that I can use that I can start to feel How that makes me feel now when I think of a problem and I think of all that other stuff All the other stuff is way way way way way bigger than any problem So, what does that do it starts to make you realize that your problems are pretty insignificant small in the face of all the cool Stuff that's actually going on Now the next question is how does it make you feel? To consider all the things that are not your problem that are changing in the ways that are useful or good or helping you in some way and I'm gonna take a guess but when you really consider those things, it's gonna make you feel Either neutral or really good So you're gonna start to feel quite stable and quite strong inside yourself And I want you to spend some time really doing that notice the changes inside your nervous system because you asked a good quality question What was I'm not considering that's not the problem that is changing the way that I want So to think about that How does that feel feels good? Okay good now you feel good now Take a look at the problem again, except feel good when you look at it and notice what's different Notice that you can't look at the same problem with a different state and not change it So this is something very interesting as well. We can't have the same reactions To old problems if we have different states different perspectives different information now We're talking about real in a game here real change work It's like adding new information new perspectives new shifts to how you're operating and you can do it that fast You can do it very quickly with the right kinds of questions and the right kinds of focus Look at the problem From this new perspective Notice, what do you see? What do you feel? Maybe it's different. Okay, cool. I'm not gonna say it's completely gone But maybe you just see something a bit different to what you've seen before you feel something a bit different to what you felt before And now the question is what? Were you not considering? That is now changing about the problem in a way That is useful or that you do like or what is now changing about the problem that you weren't considering That you're learning from That you're growing through Now what does that do it starts to add more change to the process it starts to show you that the idea of your problem Is not a thing the idea of your problem is a process the idea of your problem is actually something that's fluid and can transform and can change and You can transform and you can change because you are constantly changing and you know what the brilliance of your being is You are a genius at that You really are a genius at that your body your mind your nervous system, it's designed to be adaptive to be Spontaneous to upgrade itself to learn fast to put habits into practice So use it start to program it effectively start to use your focus effectively and you can use that very simple formula I just showed you I've got a problem. How do you know you've got a problem? What do you need to focus on to think that you've got the problem got it cool now? What weren't you considering that is not the problem that is all the things that are changing cool got that now? How does the problem look different feels different cool now? What's changing about the problem that you weren't considering? That is changing the way that you would like or changing in a good way or changing some way. That's helping you learn Got it cool and now cycle through the questions again And guess what you're gonna start to break the problem you're gonna start to break the habits You're gonna start to break the way in which you hold your attention and I would Suggest you start to ask yourself good quality questions along the lines of what was I not considering that is useful in my life right now What was I not considering? that can help me to grow to be who I need to be and start to Direct your unconscious direct your imagination direct your mind to find those kinds of answers because they're the kinds of things that are really going To help you along the way Now another really cool thing along the lines of that is To also to also consider To what extent? You can learn to take this newfound feeling of all the things that are changing the way that you want and to Move it into all kinds of areas of your life so that your unconscious mind can really show you new possibilities Not just in one area but across multiple domains across multiple areas when you do that you start to generalize change You start to move one skill that operated in one area across multiple domains, multiple areas. Very, very good thing to do. Yet again, another cool thing, by simply asking the question, to what extent can I begin to consider all the ways in which my unconscious mind can use this skill in other areas? Pretty cool, huh? Okay, so that's asking good quality questions, starting to create positive habits of focus. Now my next point is to open yourself to the process of change, transformation, trust. Now this is not always going to be easy when you first begin really doing change work because the tendency is that you need to be in control. The thing that I see a lot in questions and a lot in students is this kind of idea that they need to have it under control, they need to have a system, they need to know the future, they need to be able to predict and control with certainty what's going to happen next. And all I can say is if that's the way you want to look at the world is you're going to live in a very small world because the world, reality, whatever you want to call this experience that's going on, is far more mysterious and expansive and filled with miracles than we can consciously gather. So it's better to get out of the way and start to go with the flow, to stop questioning so much and to start feeling, to start operating from a place of moving towards what it is that you want with positive expectation, considering all the things that are helping you along the way, knowing and trusting that even though you maybe once upon a time had problems that now you are considering new things, you are moving, you are changing, you are becoming something different, something more, something unexpected. And it's always a nice surprise when you start to become what it is that you want in unexpected ways, right? What I wanted to move on to next was that this is really about trusting in the process and when you trust in the process then you can start to focus on what works because that's really what I'm saying here is stop asking things, focusing on things, doing things that are not useful for your nervous system, start asking things, doing things, feeling things that are useful for your nervous system because when we feel good, when we go into positive physiologies you could say or resourceful physiologies and we tend to be able to go for what we want a lot easier, we feel neutral, we feel unreactive, we feel resourceful, we feel fun, playful, spontaneous, all kinds of good things and that's what I want you to feel. And how can you focus on what works? Well, draw from the environment all around you looking for things that help you to be inspired, to feel good in your body, to trust yourself. So to recap, notice when you're using your mind in ways that are starting to limit you and catch yourself doing that and stop, just stop, like stop and start to reframe, reprogram and refocus yourself. For example, if you're saying, I can't do that, what if you could? I don't know how to do that. Well, what if there's parts of you that can start to lead you to the answers? How do I do that? Go inside, start to trust and feel what that might be like and follow that trail. I've got a problem, I have this feeling, I can't do it, how do you do that problem? How do you know? Okay, you got it? Good. Now, what are you not focusing on, what are you not considering that is not the problem that is all the other things that is good, useful and helpful in some way? Work with that. And now, what were you not considering and not focusing on about the problem that is now changing, now feeling different, now looking different? Cool. Got it? Now, the problem is changing. Move through it more and more, start to realize you can transform it, you can change it until it doesn't matter anymore, it doesn't hold any meaning, it doesn't hold any attachment. And what does that do? It frees you to be in the process of fluid motion, transformation, liquidity, just being who you are and that's a good place to be because you don't have to be responsible for everything, you don't have to try and control everything, you don't have to know everything, you can just work with what is, keep your focus where you want to go and keep moving and it'll take you there because your unconscious mind is your friend, it wants to help you get there. This is about focusing on what works. Now, one thing I'll say to end this is start to make friends with yourself, start to make friends with the unconscious process and give gratitude, appreciation and thanks to yourself and to the environment around you on a regular basis at an internal level. Basically, just do this by feeling good. Do it with women, you want to get better with women, focus on women and feel good, focus on how you can have a higher aim and a higher purpose that you share together, a purpose of feeling good together, creating things together, helping them to find themselves, to be more happy, to be all the things that they need to be because a lot of the time guys really mess themselves up because they're so focused on what they want to get, not focusing on what they can give and what they can share. So that's a very powerful hack and maybe I'll make another video about that later. In the meantime, thanks for watching. Me and Jeanne Boudard are going to continue our train trip here.
