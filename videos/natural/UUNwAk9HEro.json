Now there's only 24 hours left for you to join the Master Lover Toolkit. After that, I close the cart and get on to teaching the guys in the course. We've already got hundreds of guys signed up who are checking out the first week's material and being really active in the Telegram group. So come and join us. Now, my support team has had a bunch of emails from guys asking what exactly is in the course. Understandably so. And there's a lot of details on the link below. If you just click in the description, it explains the vast majority of what happens in the course. So today, what I thought I'd do is take you on a little guided tour through the naughty world of my five week course and show you exactly what happens module by module, week by week. So let's get into it. The Master Lover Toolkit is broken up into five separate weeks of material which you receive drip fed each week, and you get lifetime access to this complete library of information once the course is finished. Each week, I will cover both the hands on extremely practical technical sides of things, as well as theoretical lectures which give you a broader understanding of what's going on. Plus, we have the masculine stamina module to help you last as long as you wish in bed. Also, two live webinars with myself. Once you've had time to digest the course, we can discuss it, work on any issues or questions that you have. And then we have the massive bonus library of a whole range of extra components and modules which I'll go through as well. So let's have a look in detail at the course material week by week, starting with week one. We start with a couple of videos introducing you to the course, to your teacher and explaining how to work through the course, giving you an instruction or template to absorb the information, take it out and practice it, come back and reflect upon it and continue to build your toolkit. The hands on practical toolkit for week one is very expansive, starts from some of the most simple things, the basics of foreplay right through to how to finger a girl and get her off giving her different types of orgasms. So lots in week one, practically. Start with leadership and what I call manhandling, which is the ability to maneuver a woman around physical space. So whether that is getting her up, getting her down, throwing her on a bed, maneuvering her through space in a way that feels like she's dancing. All right. Because a lot of guys tend to yank and pull all their two tentative. And this doesn't set up a good leader, follower, dominant submission kind of framework. And it means that often the woman doesn't know what you want and then sex becomes clunky or just doesn't happen. I show you the fine art of throwing a woman on the bed, which is one of those sexy, powerful moments that really affects someone, you know, in a profound way. So safe ways to launch her off the ground and put her onto the bed where you're then going to ravage her. Sexy stuff. I give you modules on undressing. Now, of course, everyone who's had sex has managed to undress one way or another. But there are ways to do it extremely smoothly and where you can take a woman who's wearing a whole bunch of stuff, jeans, belt, top, bra, coat, and get her from that to completely naked in about 30 seconds in a way that doesn't feel rushed and just feels like the clothes are melting off her. Doing the same with a dress. It's very important to understand how different types of dresses work so you don't rip them and ruin them. And you can, again, get them to just basically fall off the woman. So she's like, oh, my. Like, yes, my dear. Next is the kissing module. Again, one of those things that almost everyone's done. You know, if you had a girlfriend, you kissed her probably thousands of times. But there is a real fine art to being a good kisser. And women often report that it is the first or the initial kisses that tell her how the man is going to be in bed. And she can even extrapolate what the relationship is going to be. Whether that's realistic or not, that's her perception of it. So it's really important to be a very delicate, responsive kisser. And so I give you different ways, different techniques, different variations and ways to match, mirror the vibe and the kissing style of each individual partner. Then we move below the belt and I give you modules on pussy, warm up positions and fingering techniques. So this is vitally important. Few men actually know how to map a woman's pussy, how to adjust to the wide variety of different ways that women like to be touched on their genitals. So I give explicit, detailed, step-by-step instructions on how to first warm the woman up, how to get her slowly aroused, how to manipulate the lips, how to penetrate and then how to finger in different ways to bring on different types of orgasms. Next module is correct condom usage. No one particularly likes condoms, but we need to know how to use them because they save us from unwanted diseases and pregnancies. You all know that. We learnt this in high school. But do you know how to put it on correctly? Do you know which one is the right size for you? Do you know at what point you should be applying the condom and how to do it in a way that isn't like all fumbly and weird where you're kind of in the corner, like just trying to put it on, where you do it proudly and in a masculine way that doesn't break the flow of the interaction or the sexual play that actually adds to it. And the final hands-on module for week one is looking at bedroom set up. So how to create a space that is conducive to affecting all of the senses of the woman and of you as well so that this creates a mood, right? Foreplay is not something that is just like kissing and groping and then we get to sex. It's how are we affecting the woman's senses in general, right? The way that she feels, the temperature, the smells, the lighting, the way that the layout of the room is set up. And if you're going to be using any toys or tools, how you can have those easily accessible. So this is a fun little video where I show you the do's and don'ts of how to set up whatever space it is that you have. So when a woman walks in there, she goes, yeah, I wouldn't mind being fucked in here. The theory modules for week one look at safety and responsibility. Sex is fun, but sex can be high voltage and supercharged and can cause people traumas if you do it incorrectly. So we look at ways to set up good consent to make sure that you're able to have safe words and ways that you can negotiate with a partner to make sure that all of your play is safe and healthy. I then go into sensual self exploration, which is a mindset and a way of practice of looking at this as play as opposed to work, as exploration, as opposed to a chore. Now, it's vitally important that if you want to become a master lover, that you learn to bring joy to yourself, that you're able to express yourself, that you're able to use this as a journey for personal exploration. And for a lot of guys, they're not particularly sensual, right? They're a bit more mechanical. And that doesn't make a great lover. You've got to get into your senses, baby. Moving on to week two, we have our hands on practical modules, starting off with a deep dive into touch. Now, there are all sorts of different ways that we can touch a woman. And I've broken these down into four elements, right? So different qualities of touch from the most subtle and delicate through to rough, assertive and aggressive and an understanding of how to blend between them. So we look at the delicate, what I call air touches, moving into more fluid water touches, moving into more grasping, holding dominant earth touches, and then adding the spice through fire touches, through things such as spanking, choking, grabbing, clawing and so on. I also show you how to embrace, how to hug, how to transition between different types of touches, understandings of different types of erogenous zones and how to figure out what are the particular erogenous zones that triggers any individual woman. One woman, it might be touching her hair. One woman, it might be rubbing your beard on a neck. One woman, it might be a light bite on the collarbone and so on. And you need to be able to communicate and calibrate to the specific touch needs of each woman. Then I move into sex positions modules. So I take what would be some of the common sex positions, missionary, doggy, girl on top, and then blow them out to show you how much nuance and variation there is possible with each of these positions. I also show you how to adapt all the different positions to different locations. Sex shouldn't just happen on a bed with the lights off. Definitely not. How to do it over a couch, how to do it standing up against a wall, you know, bent over a kitchen table or a counter or whatever. So there are variations that you need to understand in the angles, in the adjustments of the leg height, leg width, the different ways that you can be using stroke control and so on. And then I have a very important module piece, which is looking at penetration. So I demonstrate the first penetration particularly and then building up your strokes. How to do this in a way where the woman welcomes you into her body as opposed to you just kind of stabbing into it. So many women complain that men rush the first stroke and that that can lead to soreness or for the woman's arousal state to not have matched yours yet. And so she's just simply not ready. So I show you how to take your time, how to build her up, how to gradually penetrate in a way that means that often she's already close to the edge by the time that you're fully inside. And then very importantly, how do you use your strokes? It's not just about pumping and pounding. I show you a variety of different undulating, rotating, reversal strokes, which mean that you are essentially going to be massaging the full interior of the vagina as opposed to just poking at one spot. This is the type of stroke control that allows you to bring a woman to multiple different types of orgasms to be able to stimulate her G-spot, her A-spot, her cervix and basically massage and engorge the entire pussy. Theory modules for week two are going to introducing different techniques, layering and calibrating, right? So throughout this course, you're going to be given dozens of individual techniques, which are all awesome and very functional and very easy and clear on how to apply them. But the thing that's going to take you from the guy that is the like has a bunch of tricks in bed guy to the masterful lover is the ability to calibrate, to layer different techniques, to understand with the subtleties, building up with intensities, taking a woman through a different ride of peak sensations and down, down regulation. So it's vitally important to be able to communicate and use your awareness and reading of the woman's body to know which techniques to use when. The next theory module for this week is looking at debriefs and aftercare. None of us are mind readers. Trying to become amazing at sex by just using your intuition or silently trying to figure things out rarely works. And it certainly doesn't work as well as being able to discuss things. So in this piece, I give you templates for debriefing with your partner, how to talk about sex after the event in a way that allows her to feel comfortable, to give you feedback. That means that she's being kind and not, you know, destroying your ego. And also for you to be able to express your desires, the things that you really like, the things you want to try in the future. And we also look here at aftercare, how to seal off any given play scene or sexual experience so that at the end, everyone feels cozy, comfortable, clean and looked after. And there's no like residual worries or fears that could come out of particularly, let's say, more intense sexual play. Vitally important to be able to conclude the experience with your partner so that then you can come back down to earth and move on with your lives. Week three, we start to get into some of the kinkiest stuff. So in the hands on practical modules, I start off by teaching you a bit about restraint and bondage, but without the necessity to use any tools. You don't need any collars or cuffs or fancy BDSM gear. You are your own bondage machine. So I'm going to show you how to restrain a woman with different locks, different holds, different restraints using your body to, let's say, control and overpower her, but in a way that is really gentle. So we're moving into this understanding of sensual dominance. I also give you an introduction into the use of rope bondage. Now, I'm not a professional bondage rigger. This is not something that I'm an expert at, but I've played with over the years. And there's a couple of techniques which I definitely do use, which I found have really profound effects. So I'll show you one particularly saucy rope tying sequence, which is not difficult to learn. It laces the woman up into a beautiful package that makes her look sexy and also gives you dominant control over a body. Next, we look at breast play and nipple play. So most women love to have their breasts touch, but there's a wide variety in the ways and the force and the intensity that they like this. If you're just mashing away at a girl's breasts in an unconscious kind of way, it can feel really uncomfortable or objectifying in a not really fun way. So I show you different ways to touch the breast and also, most importantly, how to communicate in real time with your partner to figure out the pressure, the speed, the type of intensity that she likes, whether it's, you know, her nipples being pinched or whether she likes gentle caresses. To do that in a way with a sexy, simple dialogue so you can figure that out within a couple of minutes and know her body. Possibly better than any other partner she's ever had. Then we have a module on use of vibrators. Now, it's there's no shame, absolutely none to using sex toys. They're an amazing addition to your repertoire. But there's obviously a lot of variation in all sorts of different types and quality of sex toys. Some of them are more useful for solo play for the woman. And then there's others which are really useful to use when you're working as a partner. So in this module, I show you correct technique, different speeds, how to affect both her clitoris, her cervix, her G-spot to use vibrators in conjunction with your physical body to absolutely blow out the pleasure that she experiences. In this week, I start moving into dirty talk, the use of intent, voice tonality and ways of speaking in the bedroom that can add a whole lot more intensity to your play. A lot of guys struggle with just being completely silent in bed and not knowing what to say, feeling like it would be cheesy or weird or awkward to start, you know, reciting erotic poetry or talking like some guy in a porn movie. And yes, that's not necessary and often not what's called for. But being able to use clean, clear and sexy vocal commands and then to be able to give her rewards and encouragement is the foundation for dirty talk. And it amplifies the intensity of the situation for both of you. It opens a channel of dialogue where you can both instruct each other and give each other feedback on the fly to improve what's happening in real time. Theory modules for week three, we look at unleashing women's wildness. So how to hold a psychological and emotional space for a woman, for her to be able to reveal aspects of her sexuality that usually she wouldn't be able to. So many women carry guilt, shame and fear when it comes to their sexual desires. They have latent fantasies, things that they've always wanted to do that might be tied in with taboo or fears of being judged. And in this module, I show you how to communicate in a way where you show her I got you. It's OK within this space between the two of us. Anything goes. You can tell me anything. And I will doesn't necessarily mean you have to do every single thing that she wishes, of course. But it means that she is able to express safely. And as a result, you will unleash her wildness. Within almost every woman, there is boiling in the subconscious of them, really powerful sexual desires and energies, which she requires a mature, respectful, but also powerful and dominant man to activate. All right, so this module teaches you how to do that. And finally, for week three, we have negotiated verbal consent. So consent is extremely important. Obviously, there are different ways that consent is given, both implied nonverbal as well as explicit and verbal. And I'll show you how to do these in a way that's actually practical, right? Because for example, it's not going to be practical to always check in verbally at every single step of the escalation that takes the sexy fun out of the escalation. There should be some sense of mystery and some sense of organic flow happening. But we can set up at the beginning and also in an ongoing manner, ways to communicate that are pretty much dirty talk, right? So they fit within the realm of sexy talk that's happening in the bedroom. But at the same time, what they're doing is checking that you have consent and also giving you tools to be able to modulate and adjust because it's not just hard yes, hard no, right? It's yes, this is good, but it needs to be adjusted or that's a bit on the edge or maybe I need a break, right? So there's all sorts of, you know, delicacies that are happening within the play, which we may well need to modulate by checking in with ongoing consent. This module shows you how. Week four, hands-on modules, I move into one of my favorite topics, which is spanking. Now as a spanking research nerd, I have identified eight separate distinct ways to spank a woman on the butt and not just on the butt, but primarily. And it is vitally important that you understand this because most women enjoy a bit of slap and tickle. Not all women are into extreme kinky bondage or, you know, being tied up to the ceiling, but most of them like to experience the force and the power and the pleasant physical sensations that come along with a good spank. So in this module, I break these eight types down to very specific details with lots of slow motion demonstrations on juicy butts so that you can apply this in your play. Most men are pretty bad at spanking. I've taught many, many live classes, and this is one of the things that guys struggle with a lot because there's too stiff and too rigid and they don't understand the body mechanics of it. So it's very important for your toolkit. Next up is a pussy licking masterclass. You like oral sex. Women like oral sex too. And if you can give a woman good head, you become extremely valuable and vital to her as a sexual partner. Lots of guys either don't do it or they just don't know what they're doing. They dive straight in like a pig into a truffle patch or something like that. There are very specific ways that you should warm a woman up, that you should move between the outer and the inner labia to be able to identify where the clitoris is and which part of the clitoris she likes to have manipulated in which different types of ways. So I show you a whole bunch of explicitly demonstrated techniques for licking pussy and also how to communicate in real time with your partner to adjust, to know what is the right speed, the right spot, the right pace, the right intensity or pressure so that you can get her off very, very easily using your lips and tongue. Last practical module for this week is the art of pulling hair, right? So in terms of like some of the more dominant moves that most women like, choking, spanking and hair pulling are top of the list. But if you do this incorrectly, you can end up irritating or hurting her. Just tugging and yanking at the hair is not pleasant. And I've identified multiple different ways and different positions to scoop the hair up and to take control of her head. This puts you in a very dominant position and looks very, very sexy, gives her the sense of being controlled by a dominant man who also is able to be responsive and careful with her. So it's not hurting her. So it feels amazing. Week four's theory modules going to some of the heavier side of sexuality. It is really important that you understand you're dealing with high voltage energies when you're having sex with anybody. Everyone brings their own baggage, their own fears, sometimes shame, guilt and fear. And it is important to understand what's going on for you and what's going on on the female side. So here in these theoretical modules, we dive into an understanding of the female shame cycle to do with the Madonna whore complex, the way often that men and society at large can judge women in these two ways as the virginal Madonna and the slutty whore. And what is really important here is to come to an understanding that women are women. They are sexual beings. And if you can hold a space for them to be as they actually are, then they will unleash and they will express their full sexual potential to you. I also look at sexual shame, both that experienced by men and women. For a lot of guys, they can also be carrying shame around their sexuality from religious institutions, from their family, from society at large, being told or taught to repress their healthy, natural sexual energy. So we go through this and start to unpack what are some of the conditioned responses that you may have been affected by and how to get out of them. And then on the female side, understanding the particularities and the differences between the male and female experience of sexual shame, again, so you can hold a space for her where she can feel okay, right? Where she can feel non-judge, where she can actually relinquish control, where she can release and express her fantasies and her desires again, so that both of you can move through some of these murkier aspects of sexuality into pleasure and self-expression. And finally, a module on sexual health, understanding the risks that are associated with sex, as well as what are the realities and the likelihoods of coming in contact with anything that's nasty in the bedroom, so that you can make informed decisions about how intimate you want to be. If you're going to become fluid bonded with a partner, as in not using protection, how to make sure that that is safe and you're protecting each other, or if you are using protection, understanding under what circumstances and what types of infections and diseases that you're protecting against and how to do that. And finally, week five, we move into the practical modules for this week, where we get into some juicy stuff. First up is blowjob training. So surprise, surprise, most men enjoy amazing blowjobs. Some women are incredibly good at it and others need some practice and instruction. So in this module, I show you how to teach your partner to give you excellent head in a way that makes her feel good about it, that she doesn't feel like she's being pressured or being judged or being criticized, right? So to use words of encouragement and instruction to teach her the specific ways that you like to receive a blowjob. Then we have an anal sex masterclass. Not every guy is into putting it in a girl's butt, but lots are. And in my scientific research over the many years that I've been looking into this, around a third of women absolutely love anal when done well, around a third will really learn to love it when done well, and around a third are going to be somewhere around the absolutely not and or probably not, not until I really get to know you. This is one of those things that you cannot just kind of fumble around and improvise with. Anal sex is a very specific skill set, right? It's a very tight muscle to penetrate. And if you do it incorrectly, it's going to hurt her and you're never going to get to do it again. So this explicit module shows you all of the warmup techniques that you need in order to make her ready for this, how to use toys, fingers, and then of course how to penetrate with your cock and how to build it up and understand the responses of her body to know when it's time to start increasing the friction or the intensity. Vital, vital masterclass for those who are interested in more backdoor action. And finally, for the practical modules, I give you instructions on manscaping and grooming. Some guys are really, really well-groomed, uh, not just in their face, but all throughout their bodies and others are wookies of various types. So it's not about becoming a silky skinned, completely waxed metrosexual. It's not something that most women find attractive. It's totally unnecessary, but to understand how to make the best of what you got to clipper or shave your body hair and facial hair in ways that make you look like a sexy beast, as opposed to an actual beast. Theory module for week five goes deeper into the art form of dirty talk, right? So moving beyond just giving commands and just giving rewards to being able to show words of sexy appreciation, to get some kind of dialogue happening and also to move into, if you wish, different types of fantasy role play. So giving each other characters, giving each other names, working out a sexy language that is exist just for you two, which creates a whole lot of intimacy connection and like a shared secret, right? A shared experience, which is really very specifically unique to that partnership. And then I wrap it up with a course conclusion, recapping some of the major themes, also giving you some ideas for further study. This is an extremely comprehensive course, which will give you more than enough to become an excellent fuck, to become one of the best lovers, if not the best that any woman you've been with has ever had. However, of course, there are lots of other areas that we can explore. And so we start to give you ideas about where you want to move to. If you want to deepen your understanding of intimacy, frequency and tantra or moving into more of the kinky BDSM side of things, this is a nice way to wrap things up. Also giving you ideas of how you could explore these type of skill sets with your partners. So this course can certainly be used as a couples study course, and many couples have actually used it in the past to amazing effect. So how do you introduce these techniques to your partner in a way where you're working on this together as a partnership, which ultimately is what we're looking to do here. You're not learning the master lover toolkit in order to be able to do a bunch of things to women, right? On one level, yes. Okay. You're applying a whole bunch of techniques, but at the end of the day, it's about educating and training your partner so that she can become an equally proactive part of the sexual partnership so that you two together can grow and adapt these techniques and make them into your very own set of play methods. So that's the five week syllabus in a nutshell, but that's not where the course finishes. There's a whole bunch of supplementary resources that can help you to expand your understanding in different areas. The first one is the masculine stamina solution module. The unfortunate reality is that many men simply do not last long enough in bed. Averages are somewhere between the three to seven minute range of penetration, which is not enough time for you to enjoy yourself and certainly not enough time for you to play with and try out all of these techniques, and it's absolutely not enough time for most women. They require somewhere around the 20 plus minutes worth of not just penetration, but whether that's stimulation through your fingers or toys or your cock, incorporating foreplay and everything else, but she needs an extended period of time. And so it really is vital that you learn to control your arousal state and learn the art of relaxed arousal. So many men are too tense when it comes to sex. They're doing a whole bunch of things where they're training in their private time with their masturbation and porn habits to be lousy lovers because they're practicing for a sprint, not an endurance. So in this module, I have seven different instructional videos that take you through practical solo tools and practices that you can do in your own time to develop much more of an understanding of your own body, of your hips, of your spine, of your breathing, and very importantly, of your arousal state, giving you practical step-by-step guide to work on your solo practice, you know, you're jerking off, being hanging out with yourself and pleasuring yourself time to use that as training to become excellent in bed, learning how to ride the cusp, learning how to use both PC pumps and your pelvic floor, learning how to use different types of chambered breathing, because most guys and people tend to breathe too shallow up into their, uh, the top of their lungs. And so they're not actually having a full bodied experience with their breath. It's one of the simplest ways to slow down the arousal state is to slow down your breathing and your heart rate. So I give you all of my techniques that I have studied and sourced over the years from Shaolin temple, from martial arts, from meditation, from tantric study, and also from being with many different partners and working consistently to really understand my own physiology, as well as I'll give you my pre-sex warmup routine. Now I don't do this every single time when I have a partner coming over, but many times I do different stretch, breathing, rotational methods, focus methods that you can do before the main event to make sure that you are relaxed, aware and alert so that when you get in bed with a partner, you can last as long as you wish. So there you have the Master Lover Toolkit, but that is not all. As part of the launch, I'm offering five incredible bonuses for the guys that sign up, remembering that you only have 24 hours left to make your decision to join the course. After that, the cart closes and I'm moving on to teaching the guys in the course. The five bonus modules that you'll receive when you sign up are as follows. The first are the interactive live components of the course. So this includes two live 90 minute webinars with myself. So this is an amazing opportunity for you to go through the course material and then to come back to me, ask any questions that you have, get clarification, talk to me about your specific needs or experiences or troubles that you're having so that we can solve those in real time. Also a great way for you to interact with the brotherhood, which brings us on to the private telegram group. This telegram group so far has around 300 members from the previous launch of the Master Lover Method. A lot of guys who've got lots of experience and are really proactive and happy to help guys out as they go through this journey. Also I'll be on there every single day answering any questions that you might have. This is a really proactive group of gentlemen from around the world who are there to support and help each other through this journey. Bonus three is a sex toy masterclass. So this expands out from the general understanding of how to use a single vibrator into showing you the full range of what's possible on the market today. The things which are just basically gimmicks and you should avoid and the types of tools that can really add a next level pleasure to your play. So I give explicit demonstrations on all of the different tools and toys that I recommend showing you how to use them to affect different types of orgasm for the woman. Bonus four is the date to sex sequence. So obviously this course is about what to do when you get in the bedroom. Go to Beadaholique.com for all of your beading supply needs!"}
