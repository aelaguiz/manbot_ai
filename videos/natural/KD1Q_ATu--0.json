It can have very, you know, strong side effects, like being intoxicated on psychedelics is not a very pleasant thing. Psychedelic use is not an end in itself, in my opinion. It's a way to see things and adjust to the world in a different way, but it's not something that actually gives you lasting transformation, because the tendency is you have an altered state of experience, maybe you have some peak states and some insights, and then you come back to your everyday consciousness and it tends to slip away. It tends to go back to normal fairly quickly, and it can be somewhat frustrating because then the idea is that people go back and they take more, and I've seen a lot of that. People in psychedelic communities or, you know, taking medicines and things, and they keep coming back over and over and over again for years and years to try and get some resolution or transformation inside themselves, and really, it's not actually serving the purpose. What I've also seen, though, is that people that use psychedelics sparingly in conjunction with healthy lifestyle, in conjunction with things like getting into their bodies, being fit, knowing themselves, doing self-inquiry, you know, taking care of themselves with things like meditation, and doing actual, like, work, like real spiritual work or real self-transformational work, then psychedelics can really activate that structure. Psychedelics can really bring out deeper levels of understanding and experience of those kinds of practices that people are doing, and then as that happens, they can integrate that, and it becomes like a kind of an anchor that then they can work with over time to keep coming back to raise their levels, their baseline of understanding of what's going on. It's one of the virtues of things like psychedelics, is they can give you an insight into a world that you may have never seen before, and as a result of that insight, it's going to give you a kind of access to different states of consciousness for periods of time. So it can open things up, and there's plenty to be said about the fact that having psychedelics can often open you up to a kind of extra-dimensional slash mystical experience of the world, which many people have never had before, and it can be an extremely game-changing kind of experience if you're ready for that kind of thing."}
