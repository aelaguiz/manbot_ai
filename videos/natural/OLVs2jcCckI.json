Now Virag has been working with us behind the scenes and assisting in workshops for the last five years. And over the last 12 months, she's been promoted to full executive TNL coach. She's an incredibly empathetic, feminine, and wise human being, as well as bringing the female perspective to the crew and an incredible person to work with, both for us as TNL team members and for the students. So check it out. There's going to be a lot more material coming out with her and by her in the future. And if you want to come and work with her and the full team, then check the link below for full details about our upcoming live workshops all around Europe. All right, check out the video. So this is from Peter. So from a woman's perspective, during initial meetings and the first few dates with a guy, what are some good signs, but also red flags or deal breakers us guys need to be aware of that would show you what he'll be like in the bedroom with regards to how he behaves around you, touches you, touches himself, no, carries himself, et cetera. Women has this kind of radar built in themselves naturally, this female radar where they can feel you. Radar. Radar. Radar. Radar. Radar. Radar for anyone who wasn't sure what that is. I'll just occasionally translate. If you don't understand everything, just say like, what is a radar? But anyway, we feel you. So if you come there insecure or not that kind of like, you are not centered enough and you don't feel your masculinity at place yet, then women will feel that. So make sure that you go there with the right energy, you know, relax yourself and try to be that masculine energy that she will be attracted to. Your question was about like the meetings and first dates. Well, I don't know what's the background, like how much you talk about the escalation and the touches. It's really looking what from your perspective, if you're looking at initial meetings. I just don't know what you told them already or not. Just pretend I told them nothing. Basically, we prepare the touches and all the escalation from the beginning. So once you got the number and you set up the dates, even from walking next to each other, you know, these incidental touches where accidentally you touch the other person, you prepare them for the physicality. So it's not surprising them. For example, if on a date, you just do this, that, oh, and you never even touched them before, like you never escalated and never prepared for closer and more direct physicality. So actually, if your touch is not sure, not prepared, that could be a sign, like even if they don't do it consciously. Unconsciously, they feel like these guys maybe he doesn't know what he wants or what he does. But how we teach that we try to prepare it from the beginning. And then when you really feel that it's the place and you're talking and your legs are like, now our legs are touching each other, but just because we are comfortable with each other and we already find all the touches. But when you meet with someone new, this is another thing what you can do just to prepare her unconsciously for your touches. If you- Let's just show them a bit. Okay. Because if we're looking at like red flags and good signs, this is all happening in flow and in motion, right? So as she said, coming in with a good masculine energy and feeling grounded is awesome, but how does that reflect? How does she even know that? It's like, okay, let's look, do we look pretty cool or what? I always look a bit cooler next year, that's for sure. If I meet for a first date, hopefully we can get all this right. So let's say she's waiting there nervously, let's hope, text on her phone, whatever, whilst I walk into the scene, right? So from the very get go, as the Aussies would say, if I see the girl like 40 meters away, I'm like, all right, there she is, she's waiting for me. I'll do that thing like everyone does where they kind of do a bit of like, all right, what's the best coolest thing to be like, oh, I just noticed you there, right? All right, that's okay. I don't wanna be like staring at her and then she catches my eye and I'm like, oh, fuck. Now I have to recover. So I see her from across the street, I feel my feet, I walk over and I look at her the whole time because if she looks at me, glances at me on the way there, then there's a smile there. And so I'm making that contact as I come into the like 10 meter radius, which is where that's going to, she's gonna pick me up in her periphery usually within some meters. So I'm coming with the same energy, let's say that I left her when we first got the number, which is like, all right, well, it's been awesome to hang out, da, da, da, da. I should get your number, let's meet sometime. We get the number and then maybe I give her a parting touch or maybe it's just a look, this kind of look where I'm giving her like a bit of the sex eyes and then I turn and trip over, no, then I turn and walk off. So she's left with that impulse and then when we meet again, ideally it's a continuation of what that was, right? Because if I now bring it back down to this cold thing, like, oh, I'm basically meeting a stranger again, then, okay, can we build that back up? Yes, if both of us are invested and we click, but it's easier for me to come in with that sense of like, here we are continuing off where we were and building on that, right? So I'm so glad to see her. So usually I'll just offer a hug, I'll say great to see you and she steps in and then I wrap around her, wrap around her, I don't pat her, I don't press her, I don't stick my butt out, I don't crush her, I don't try and go for a feel, all right? It's just like that and then I unwind and I tell her something good. Oh, you look sexy today or like awesome dress or you look lovely. All right, did I say that one already? Probably. And then usually I would maybe take her arm, one option or take her by the hand and just lead her off, like, okay, we're going on this thing or direct her in a direction, let's go for a walk here or let's head to the cafe here or whatever and then probably release and there we are, right? So within the first seconds, we've set this tone where it's an escalation from where we last left off. I've assumed that it's okay to give her a hug or sometimes, okay, a girl might not want to and if she's masked up and gloved up, well, maybe that's not gonna work but usually I would do that or I'll give her a kiss like so and the kisses are, again, you see on this side, it's a little sensual moment. I'm just air kissing, which is the correct way to do it. Yeah, I don't wanna do two air, I wanna do cheek, I wanna do cheek and air, you know? Kiss, kiss depending on which part of Europe it might be eight kisses or two or one, Australia is just one, Europe is two, what is Hungary? Two. Two and there's other places where it's three. All right, and then that here and again, maybe I take her off like that or maybe I just let go. I'm not gonna be clawing all over her straight away and if I walk off arm in arm and wrapped around her, then that's probably too much but just giving these brief fleeting touches and then we're off and then as we're walking, maybe we're walking along and as Virag was saying, this incidental touch, which is not overt, it's not me grabbing at something but it's physical flirtation because if we're walking this close because girls are very aware of physical space, you know, I mean, how do you operate in a club to avoid men's touches? Oh yeah. You just have all these little dance moves to snake away. So this isn't happening accidentally, right? In the sense that if she didn't want this or she wasn't comfortable with it, she would just maneuver over a little bit or put her hand in a handbag or something or you know, do this and I see this like relatively often, I can pick a first date where a guy is really uncomfortable because you have the girl walking upright and then you have a guy walking into a space but putting his arm behind his back in some way. I've seen it quite a lot of dudes who are like, I can't touch her and I better not even bump her, right? I definitely want to bump her. I definitely want to have this going on as we're walking along and then, you know, these kinds of touches when I direct her somewhere or lead her in to open the door for the thing and then lead her in there, right? So I can apply this really simple, not invasive, not fancy, not like still gentlemanly types of touch which has a mixture of some overt touch where I'm doing something specific or I'm taking her body, I'm leading her in some way and then preferably a bunch of other ones which are non-specific and non-directed at a purpose but they're just us feeling comfortable in sitting or standing or walking with each other. And then, wait just a second because that's another essential part of it but what you said, what you were asking that what are the signs? Like for example, if it's like this and she's not comfortable yet with your touch then she will pull away or just she will move like that or if you do like any kind of like, if your legs are or just like that, your legs are touching then she's pulling away. So you have to read the signs, like you have to see her reactions, her facial reactions as well but more like the physical contact if she's not ready yet for that. But you can try it later, like have more personal conversations, dig deeper in her soul and then maybe after she will be more comfortable with your touches. So you know, like right now, okay, we have knees touching and this is what I would want on a date. Another reason why I don't sit opposite, the primary reason why I don't sit opposite on a date, I wanna sit like this or like this so that then it's easy right now, I put my hand on her knee while I make a point, it's not public, she doesn't have to think about it, it's not me reaching out across the table to like hold her hands, oh, those ones are awkward too, you're holding hands across the table because then you're committed to it right now, we're like, oh, now we're doing hand holding. Here I don't have to commit to anything, just touches come and touches go, we lean in here, whatever is going on, I check, you know, she shows me something on her phone, I hold her this, I can, you know, I can check out her badass earrings which she's not wearing today, do you have a wearing? No, nothing. Okay, no, doesn't need them and so on. But it's like, in terms of like, what are the good signs? It's, yeah, we're presenting ourselves as here, I am as a good grounded man, but the signs are in action. This physical conversation makes her feel ideally comfortable, relaxed, and that she enjoys being in his presence. And it also takes out some of the need for the conversation to do all the heavy lifting, right? Because if we're feeling at ease with each other physically, then we don't have to stress too much about, now we're sitting apart, now we've reached the end of a topic, what are we gonna do? And now I need to quickly rebuild it again to create energy. There's energies being circulated between us by the nature of us being tactile. What's up, gentlemen? If you'd like to join myself, Virag, and the full TNL crew for one of our live workshops, we're rolling and running them here in Kiev, Ukraine. Coming up in May, we've got a four day.
