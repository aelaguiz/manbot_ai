That is the one shortcut in life that will massively accelerate you. Finding a mentor that can package those insane learnings that he took so many years to gain and can literally just give it to you. The smart way is finding people that went through the struggles already. Finding people that are at a 9 or at a 10. Finding those people that overcome and overcame those challenges, that know the dangers, that did all the mistakes already and which can package all those learnings and give it to you in a way shorter amount of time than it would take you to learn all those things. And those people we call mentors. Those people are out there. Sometimes they're hard to find but they're out there and they are ready to help you. Some people may think why would a mentor even care about me? Why would he help me? Like he's already good at that thing. He's accomplished. He probably makes a lot of money because he is at that expert level where people paying a lot of money for the skill. Why would he help me? You might be surprised. A lot of mentors either just enjoy giving back. They enjoy the process of teaching in itself. I hear that a lot. But, and that gets me back to a point I made before, they really value people who can solve problems for them. Because they have problems too. Different kinds of problems. Mostly time problems. For the most mentors that I've met, for the most successful people that are in my life and that I get in contact with, time is their most valuable asset. Because that's what they don't have enough of. Because they have so many things to do. So if you're a guy who can really see through their problems and create solutions, have this problem-solving mindset, then you're a guy they want to have in their life. And this is an extra video that I will do in the future of how to properly approach mentors. Because there is an art to it. There's a specific way of getting their attention, getting them interested, delivering, over-delivering the way you should approach their problems and deliver that to them. But that's a whole different video. Now I just want to mention that this is the magic bullet. That is the one shortcut in life that will massively accelerate you. Finding a mentor that can package those insane learnings that he took so many years to gain and can literally just give it to you. He's almost like a godfather in the mafia, you know, with a lot of money, drugs that he can spend to make your life easier. He often could, and we see that on workshops, completely change your reality in a couple of minutes with knowledge that took him a decade to know. So the best example is this company, The Natural Lifestyles. Us, the coaches, spent five, myself, 10 years, 12 years living, breathing, thinking in this area. Lifestyle design, seduction, dating. And we now, because of that, have the ability to massively reframe and change mindsets of the students that come to us. So I'm sure you have a lot of mindsets and limiting beliefs that you have based on your experience in life. You know, you had experiences with a certain amount of women, you have been in relationships, and this formed you. But maybe you're lacking information. You're maybe at this plateau level in this graph of diminishing returns, and pushing harder, pushing through, it just takes a lot of effort. That's why people come to us. They pay us a lot of money so that we can really feel into them, ask them a bunch of questions, make themselves ask questions, and then massively change their view on life. Totally resolve certain limiting beliefs, change mindsets, change the whole outcome of their happiness, and change their worldview, change the way they approach life in this area. So I want to ask yourself, how do you want to proceed in life? Thanks for watching. I hope the video resonated with you. Real quick, before we get to the very end, there is still some spots left for my upcoming four-day residential in Kiev, Ukraine. So check the link below to check out our workshop calendar, where we list all the live workshops that we are going to do in 2021. It's a bit more difficult this year, of course, to run live workshops, so we're not doing as many as usual. So even the more reason for you to take action very soon. If you, for whatever reason, cannot make it onto a live workshop, there is the opportunity to train with me online. I do have certain online coaching zoom packages, so check the website, you will find it, and I would love to mentor you in whatever area you want, but obviously particularly relationships, dating, sex, and lifestyle design over online. So that's always a possibility. If you just want to follow my lifestyle, I'm posting quite often on my personal Instagram, so you will find a link for that as well. Give me a shout out, give me a follow, and we'll be in touch there. So thanks for watching and see you soon."}
