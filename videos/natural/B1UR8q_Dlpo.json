James Marshall here in my house with my wonderful friend and colleague, Valeria. It's me. Hello! How are you? So, I was going to go out and film some normal infield today, but then I thought that sounds pretty boring. So what I thought I'd do instead is do a head-to-head battle of the sexes pick-up competition with Lara. So we're going to have one hour each on the mics to see how many numbers and Instagrams and meat we can pick up off the streets. And we'll see who's going to win. Who do you think is going to win? Of course me, but actually I've never done it before, but you know, understands it. Who is winner? Lara is winner. I'm going to use my 20 years of experience, of blood, sweat and tears, of deep understanding of human psychology, of countless hours in the field, and you're going to use what skills? My beauty, my energy, my eyes. Oh, fuck. I guess it will be enough. All right. Okay, so here's the rules. So, one Instagram is one point. Okay. But you can't cheat. You can't just go up there and say, you're six to give your Instagram. You have to talk to them first. Okay. Okay. Two points if you get a WhatsApp or a Telegram or a phone number. Okay. If they kiss you on the cheek, minus five points. No, three points. And then we'll see what happens. Okay. Okay? Easy. Easy peasy. All right, let's get ready. All right, go get ready. Lara, are you ready? Yes. Let's do it. Do you feel nervous? Yes. Oh, you do. Yes, because I never did it before. Yeah. Like, actually, guys, like, when I meet with me, not like... Are you afraid of rejection? Yeah, I need to think, like, with what to start my conversation. Mm-hmm. So... I'm not going to give you any tips. Maybe they will be so shy to give me their number. It's possible. Because, like, I'm so beautiful. Remember, it has to be someone that's cute. You can't go and talk to some old man. Right? It has to be someone that's hot. Of course. Whatever you think is hot. Maybe for me it's hot or guys. Well, okay. That's fine. Okay. I'm going first because I don't want to be demoralized by watching you wipe the floor with me. All right. Setting my timer now. One hour begins... now. May the best man or woman win. Hi. How are you doing? Very good. Can I be instru... Excuse me. Hi. How are you? Hello. Excuse me. How are you doing? Good. I'm not selling anything. I just thought you looked awesome today. Oh, thank you. Are you in a little bit of a rush? Not really. You just walk with purpose in general. Yeah. All right. Cool. What's your name? What is it? Hi. I'm James. Hi. Nice to meet you. And did you say you just finished work? Was it a long day? Yes. And how are you planning to relax now? I'm just going for my... I have to write my homework because I'm learning my... Some exams? I will be an interior designer. Oh, really? Yeah. So you have some exams for this? Yeah. What style of interior designer are you into? Like old sort of style? New? Nouveau, riche, gauche? Both. But you like the classics and the new? Mm-hmm. Okay. I'm into design too. Mostly old style stuff, let's say. Gothic, classic, Sumerian. Different what? Difficult to explain in English, right? Because it's kind of technical. I see. And what are you doing in life otherwise? Normal things? My life. Normal life things? Are you enjoying it? Life? Yeah. Yeah? All right, good. Cool. Well, did I say what my name is? Yeah, James. Yes. So yeah, I'm an Australian. I live here in Budapest. Oh, really? Yeah. How long? On and off for about eight years. I live between here and Portugal. Mm-hmm. But yeah, this is my second home. I like it in the summer. In the winter, not so much. Yeah. But it's very hot. Yeah, but that's good. Because, you know, you have such brutal winters. And it means the Hungarians are less grumpy now. Okay, they're having a big conversation. And now I need to start to think, like, from what I need to start to talk with the guy. But I guess she will give him number. Let's go. Listen, I was just with my friends. I'm going to go back. Would you like to be Instagram friends? We can have a chat sometime. I have a boyfriend, so. So, do you still want to give me your Instagram? She told that she has a boyfriend. Okay. Of course, of course, of course. Why do you think she waited so long? I don't know. Because, like, he started to follow her. He started to be so annoying. That's why. And I'm sure that she doesn't have a boyfriend. I'm sure. She just don't want to give a number to him. Okay, are you going to get married? Huh? Because, like, I feel it. Usually girls who don't want to give a number or even Instagram, they just tell, sorry, I have a boyfriend. Okay. What's that say on your phone? Show me on the back, on the back. No, no, on the back. A bold attempt is half success. Yeah, cool. All right, I'm going to live by that for today. Nice to meet you. See ya. She gave? No? I'd be careful with my fucking phone. Like this, like this. Hand. Okay. That's it. Listen, dude, I'm on the clock. I've got one hour challenge, so I actually have to go right now. What do you need? I'm sorry. No, if you're in an hour challenge, just so you, we have a big community here. If you want to take a drink tomorrow, maybe. I'm teaching all this week. I'm totally flat out. What's your name? I am. Good to meet you, bro. I'm actually, you know, organizing the groups here. So if you need anything, let me know. Okay, cool. You'll see me here on the street. You'll see me around. I'm in and out of Budapest a lot. Enjoy the day, man. All right, I've got to beat this chick in my one hour challenge. All right, that's one point. It's kind of cheating, but yeah. Yeah, yeah, she had a boyfriend. So what? I'm going to do any way I can to beat. I'm going to cheat. I'm going to use every trick in the book to try and level the playing field against Valeria. Excuse me. Hi. Hi. How are you? Fine. Very funky sunglasses. Thank you. Yeah, they're cool. Thank you. Are you a funky person in general? Yeah, I think so, yeah. Yeah. What's your name? I'll just give you a fist bump because I hurt my hand. Hi. I'm James. Yeah, and what are you doing today? You look lovely. I go to work and I'm in a hurry. Okay, in that case, I know this is totally crazy, but you are interesting, I think, and so am I. We should meet sometime for tea. Can I get your Instagram? No, I'm sorry. I have a boyfriend. I'm really sorry. You probably wouldn't like that. Can I get your Instagram anyway? Another girl, she have a boyfriend. Can I get your Instagram anyway because I'm doing a challenge and I really need someone's Instagram right now. See ya. No, I'm sorry. It's not his day today. I'm sorry, James. Do you think that was a real one or a fake one? Fake one. It's on. It's not your day today, babe. Hey, this is normal. This is a good day for a man. I tell you what, she's like, how come you didn't get sex yet? Listen, it's different, all right? James, bye-bye. It's not your day today. This is totally my day. It's not your day. It's so my day. Babe, go home. I'm in the state. I'm in the zone. The stars are aligned with me. Ladies love me. Ladies love me. No one loves you, babe. I'm sorry. Sorry. People appreciate me for my personality. It's not your day. You need to go home. You're old for it. Enough pickup classes. Hi. How are you doing? Sorry. Sorry about what? Why are you sorry? I don't know. What? You don't know why? What? You're sorry that you need to go somewhere right now and you feel awkward about me talking to you. I understand. See you. Excuse me. Hi. How are you? I love how you're matching your sunglasses with your shorts. Was that a plan? Can I walk with you a moment? Say yes and then I'll walk with you. I'm going to take that as a yes. What's your name? It's much simpler if you just say no. There we go. Hi. Did you just get your hair done? Sorry? Did you just get your hair done? No. It looks great. Love the curls. Yes. What's your name? Cool. I'm James. Nice to meet you. Yeah. You too. Are you Hungarian? No. I live for you. Yeah. I'm not Hungarian though. I'm an Australian. Oh. But I mostly live... Good for me. Yeah. It is pretty good I guess. Is it good to be a Hungarian? No. Sorry. You're Hungarian. It's okay. You're doing the best you can with it. And what are you doing now? I'm getting a package actually. A package? Yes. I ordered something. Oh. Is it something you can tell me about or is it a secret? It's a secret. It's a sweater. It's a just what? Sweater. Oh, a sweater. But it's maybe a little bit wrong season for... You're ready for winter? Yes. And what's going on in your life in general? I'm working right now. Yeah. Like a summer job? Yes. Are you saving up to go on some kind of an adventure? Sorry? Are you saving up to go on some kind of an adventure? No, actually I'm saving to go to university. Oh, that's very responsible. Are you going to put yourself through university? Yeah. Respect. Good for you. Independent lady. Yeah. Well, I never finished university. I started. Yeah, but I gave up. Yeah, but I gave up. And then I started a business. Oh, I just didn't want to do it, mainly. Okay. Yeah, I was doing pretty good and then I quit and then I started a business and that worked for me anyway, but I think for most people it's probably good to go to university. So, listen, I've got to go back to my friends over there. Okay. However, I would like to take you out for a cup of tea sometime. Okay. Cool. Can I get your WhatsApp? Yeah, sure. Alright. It's ***, right? Yes. No, it's a J. Oh, ***. Yes, but it's pronounced ***. I know. Like this? Yes. Is that a Hungarian name? Yes. Okay, cool. Okay, he got the first one. But I hope it will be the last one. Type in the rest. Okay, have fun today. I'll talk to you soon. See you. Three points. Three points. Three points. Three points. Three points. Three points. Three points. Three points. Three points. Three points. Three points. Three points. Three points. Three points. Alright, I'm on the board. I can do this. I can do this. Just because she's super hot and young and charming and a woman doesn't mean that I can't do this. I'm the man. I am the man, which is actually a disadvantage right now. Three points, ***. Why three? Because I got one Instagram. And number gets two points. You got her number and her Instagram? Yes. No, I got first girl's Instagram. First? And then the other one's *** phone number. That's three points, ***. Come on. No, but the first one didn't give... Yeah, you listen later, you'll see. One of them said no, one said yes. No, two girls told that you have a girl, they have a boyfriend. But she still gave me her Instagram. The first one? Yeah. And this one Instagram or... No, number. I got the number. **** you. Yeah. Now, I know you're feeling a little bit nervous. A little bit? Yeah. And I understand, it's your first day approaching. So, I want to give you some encouragement. And I want to tell you, you're *** awesome, Lara. You're sexy, you're funny, you're charming. And you look like this. You should be fine. Just work your charms on the streets. All right, go get them. Okay. I believe in you. Already? Yeah, off you go. No. Just walk normal. You just go for a walk and we'll be somewhere behind. And just start by saying hello. Say hi to this girl. They're only homeless. You just go for a walk. Go on. But... You just go like this. Hi, how are you? And then they'll talk to you. Okay, okay. And sometimes if they look suspicious... Let's try. Yeah, we will. But if they look suspicious, you say, I'm not selling anything. Because that's the only thing they might think of. All right. Hey, guys. I'm so sorry. Can I ask you about a favor, please? We need to go back. Sorry. I just came for it. No? It's fine. Oh, first rejection. But why? What did you say to him? What did you say? Can I ask you about a favor? Oh, ask for a favor. But another friend, like, the guy stopped me. He said, I'm not selling anything. Ask for a favor. But another friend, like, the guy stopped me. He said, I'm not selling anything. He said, I'm not selling anything. Yeah, of course, like, he started to smile. And then, no, no, we need to go. Oh. Maybe don't ask for a favor. Just say, hi, you look awesome today. Give him a compliment. No, it will be so strange. And they will think that it's really funny. No. Just do it sincerely. Well, okay, try what you want. Okay, let's try this way. Yeah, just tell him he looks great today. Because men don't get compliments very often. It's nice. Yeah, that's why it will be so strange for them, no? Yeah, but if a hot girl comes up to me and gives me a compliment, I'll just be like, oh, cool, hi. Because men are stupid, so it will work. Oh my God. It's harder to hear from them no goodbye. Yeah, that's why I'm good at this. Because I've had that happen hundreds of times. Yeah. Try this guy here. Which one? With a beard. Alright, try another one. You just don't take it personally. Alright, try this guy who nearly got bitten by the dog. No, it's so visible, you're too close to me. Hey, how are you? Can I ask you about a favour, please? I just need internet for a few seconds. I'm trying to find my way to home. Yes, hot spot. Yes, please. What is your name? Valery, nice to meet you. Where are you from? From Turkey. I've just been there two weeks ago. And you? I'm from Ukraine. Do you live here? Yes. Do you like it? It's my first time here. It's my second day just walking around. I really like it. It's very good. I'll be so happy because I forget the road and I'm trying to find it. Okay, just a second. Do you see it? Ah, okay. Sorry, remind me your name. Your name? Valery. Yes, Valery. And you again? Nice to meet you. Sorry for disturbing. I just need to open Google Maps. By the way, I'm really new here. It'll be nice. Maybe we can grab a coffee at the evening and walk around the city. What do you think about it? I know good working. Yeah, what about evening? Today? It'll be nice. Do you want to give me your number? Yeah. Looks good. I like your style. Thanks. I don't remember. Sorry. It's fine. Okay. Yes, thank you so much. Okay. I'll call you, so you'll have my number. Yeah, it's me. So, I'll text you by WhatsApp, yes? Nice to meet you. Have a nice day. Bye-bye. All right. That's two points, right? Yeah, nice one. How do you feel? I forgot his name. That's all right. He'll text you, don't worry. All right. Nice one. You did it. It was so stupid when I asked him, like, sorry, I forgot your name, and again I did like, my name is Valery. He looked at me like that. Oh, newbie mistakes. I like it. All right. Well, that's your first approach, and you got a number, so... Okay, cool. Well, feel free to have a 30-minute break, or do you want to do another one? Remember, you're on the clock. Well, it was hard. Okay. All right. Go get him. It's two points or one? Two. You got a number. Hey, guys. How are you? Sorry, can I ask you about favor, please? I need hotspot, like, I'm trying to find my way to home, but I don't have internet. My name is Valery. Nice to meet you. Hello. Valery. Nice to meet you. Where are you from? Hungary. Ah, yeah, you live here? Yeah. Nice. This is my password. Gerg\u0151. Wait, wait, wait. You need internet? Yeah. Okay. Thank you for helping. No problem. I've been so excited. Sorry, my English is poor. It's fine. No worries. But I try. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't you need to refresh once? No, not working. I have it, too. So you have? Yeah. Okay. So you live in Budapest, right? Yeah. Nice. Like, uh, two months. Two months, but where did you live before? In Hungary. Hungary? She used the old I need hotspot excuse. I guess that's pretty good, actually, using an indirect opener on guys. She knows what she's doing. I'm from Ulgarod. It's, like, city on the border Hungary and Slovakia. Oh, Gerg\u0151. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you so much. So what do you usually do here? Like, you like Budapest? I'm really new here. It's my second time, to be honest, and I came alone for a few days, because after I need to fly. And where are you from? I'm from Ukraine. Yeah, and my next stop will be in Ukraine. So I decided to be here for a couple of days and just walk. Thank you so much. So maybe it will be nice if you can meet together and walk. If you want, of course. Just like to walk around, to have a coffee. Yeah? Can I take your Instagram? She's getting the Instagram. You can find me. She can't believe he's like, we could meet? Yeah, we could meet. He's trying to act cool right now, but inside he's not. Okay, find me. Yeah. See ya. Oh, my God. Yeah, it's me. Yeah, you're usually like, girls not coming like this and guys. I know, I know. I just want to make friends in New City. I'm a very friendly person. Yeah, I'll find her. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Yeah, it will be nice to see you again. Bye-bye. Have a nice day. Bye-bye. Two Instagrams. Two Instagrams, two points. So three now. Yeah. You could have got their numbers. You made it six. Yeah, I know. I need to like, try a conversation from like, not just hotspot. I need to think about something else. Just be direct. Go and say they look great today and then ask them what they're like. Hi, you look great. Yeah. Hey, hey, hey. How are you? What's up? Hey, hey. How are you? Doing good. What about you? What is your name? My name is Valeria. My name is ***. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Where are you from? I'm from here. I like your style. And especially your hairstyle. Looks good. Thank you. Where are you from again? I'm from here. Ah, yeah? Nice. I just came here like, for a couple of days. Yeah, and I'm new here, so just walking around alone. That's why I came to you to say hi. Ah, okay. I like how you look, to be honest. Really? Yeah, I'm just trying to say it. I'm sorry. I had a feeling like you're part of a how do you say that? Candy camera? Do you know what it is? How? Making fun of people. Ah, do I look like? I mean, I had a feeling like maybe it's proper for show. No, because I know that it's very rare that girls just come and start a conversation with guys. But, yeah, I'm already second day just walking around alone and I just got bored and I saw you. Really? Yes, and I really like how you look, that's why I came. Wow, it's very nice. Yeah, I know, I know. I know that guys are not used to see that girls come and like, hello, my name is Valeria, how are you? Of course. And where are you from? I'm from Ukraine. You just got here? Yeah, I will go to Ukraine after tomorrow or in three days. So I decided to stop here to walk around, to see the city, because the weather is amazing, so why not? But the problem is that I'm alone here and I don't have friends here. That's why I decided to stop. How was it when you did you go and meet some other guys as well? Randomly? No, just like, you know, inside in my head, it's also hard to me to come to say hi to guys, because usually guys want to meet with me, but I'm, I don't know, decided to say hi to you. Ah, I understand. Hungarian people usually they are like, I don't know how to say that, they are not very open or open-minded to strangers or random people, yeah. For me, I like to meet new people and especially in new city, you know, like I wanted also ask you maybe you have some places which you can recommend me to go there, maybe some restaurants, something like that. There are tons of restaurants. I just been today, I had really, really super good lunch. 26 26 26? Yeah, do you know this place? This one. I haven't been there, but I know where it is, yeah. Oh, your eyes, so beautiful colors. Thank you. No, I swear. Yes, yes, that's true. So, yes, so tasty. Do you know this place, no? I have never been, I have never been here, but... But you live here, no? It's amazing, it's here. You live here? No, no. I mean, you stay here at this place? Today, today. It's today, it's here in Budapest. So, if you've never been, for sure go, it's so tasty food, everything. Yeah, it's good? And how's the situation in your country right now? Bad, to be honest, yeah. So, like, I just want to stay here, like to walk a bit, to calm myself down, cause, like, I understand that my way to home will be so hard, around, like, 18 hours by bus. Ah, okay. Yes. And you came here for a few days? Yeah, just for a few days, cause, like, after here I'll take a bus and I'll go straight to my city, that's why. Like, going back? Yes, yes, for a couple of weeks. Why did you, why did you choose Budapest? Cause it's close to my city, so I'm from Uzhgorod and it's, like, on the border Hungary-Slovakia, so we can take a bus here from here, from Budapest and then go straight to my city, that's why. Like, more comfortable and closer. Ah, okay. That's why, yeah. I understand. Yeah. Can I get you maybe number and we can grab like dinner or coffee, maybe tomorrow or... I would love to, but I have a girlfriend. Ah, really? Yeah. Okay. But you're very nice and I hope you're gonna have a girlfriend. Or maybe Instagram? You're gonna, well... Just Instagram, it's like nothing, I will not, like, I will not text your girlfriend or something like that, but just good to have some friends in this city. Well, I mean, if you just wanna have, like, recommendations for some places or things like this... Yeah, yeah, I would be happy if you will text me your number. I will not text you every day, blah, blah, blah, just, like, I will be really grateful for recommendation cause I'm new here. Do you have Instagram or Facebook Messenger? Ah, yeah, Instagram. I'm sorry that I disturbed you. No, it's okay. Yeah. Thank you so much. Thank you, have a nice day. Yeah, wishing you a nice day too and all the best. Thank you, thank you. Bye-bye, have a nice day. I didn't hear all that, but I think that guy might have rejected her cause he had a girlfriend and she was trying to convince him that she just wanted recommendations for restaurants. I think so, we'll listen to it in post. Oh, she's sneaky. We're neck and neck at the halfway point. Stay tuned for the riveting conclusion on who is better at picking up people on the streets. The professional who spent multiple decades focusing almost solely on that, or the beautiful woman. What do you think is gonna happen? There is a big surprise and twist at the end that you could never expect. So stay tuned for part two coming next week. Now, if you happen to not be the 23-year-old model who's got confidence and character and is funny, and you're a man, then you're gonna need to learn how to do this. For Lara, all I had to do was just go, go on, and then she seemed to be fine. But for most dudes out there learning the process of going from a guy that's not comfortable or confident at talking to strangers, at going and approaching women, at asking them out on dates, on taking them on dates, and taking them into the bedroom, then this is a learned skill. It's not something that you're just born with. Myself, my colleagues, and literally thousands of clients that we work with over the years have gone through that process from, I don't know what to do, to, I can do this. As you can see in these infield videos, I get rejected a lot."}
