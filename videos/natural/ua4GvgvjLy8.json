You have this look. Huh? You have this look. Yes. Which is incredible. Thank you. You look like you're a model strutting down the runway. Just like going back and forth. Thank you. Did I get it right? Are you actually a model? Yes. Ah, okay. I understand. Cheers. Hey. What's up? What's up? What's up? What's up? I walked past you. I don't know. We walked past each other and I saw your eyes and I was like, oh my God. No, no. I don't look at you. Sorry, please. No, no, no, no. I wanted to say I thought you had very pretty eyes. Ah. So I wanted to come talk to you for a second. Yeah. Are you off in a rush? Sorry? Are you off in a rush? No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. Are you off in a rush? Sorry? Are you maybe, it seems like you're maybe in a rush. Rush? Yeah, like rushing. Ah, rush, yes. Yes. I need to go. Okay. Okay. I'll walk with you for two minutes and then I have to go back this way. Okay? Okay. Okay. Maybe we can get to know each other just a little bit. Sorry, but I'm married. You're married? Yes. Ah, okay. Breaking my heart already. Okay. But. Thank you that you came. Anyways, I hope you have a good day. Okay. Fine. What can we do? What you gonna do? Stop for a sec. You were dressed absolutely fantastic and I had to come say hi to you today. Thank you very much. What's your name? Yeah, my name is Kevin. Nice to meet you, Kevin. You seemed like you had this very determined walk like you were going somewhere important. No, I'm usually a little bit like a. Oh, you're like a very driven person. You're like a very driven person. Yes. You're like a very driven person. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. You're like a very driven type of person. I guess so. Sometimes maybe. Maybe, can be. Yeah, I feel that too. Sometimes I get in these modes where I'm like, okay, cool, let's get shit done. But then I, you know what an introvert is? Yeah. So sometimes I just need to like go and talk to or like be alone and not talk to people to kind of like rest and recharge. Or go and talk to people. Or go and talk to people, yeah. Which one are you? I think I'm like a very introverted person. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And like, I think I'm in the middle. Mm-hmm. I guess. Like I can talk if I want to. Mm-hmm. But usually I don't want to. I also sometimes like introvert. Say again? Introvert. Right? Yeah, introvert. Yeah. So for you in a party, are you the person who's more in the center of the party or kind of on the outskirts? If I'm drunk, I'll be in the center. Ah. Okay, I understand. So, so as soon as you get a little bit of uh, liquid courage. Yeah. Then you'll be dancing and. Not dancing, but I'll be the soul of the party. Ah, I understand. Is it like that? What do you think that is? Why do you think that we have this weird, kind of like back and forth? Weird what? Why do you think it is? I mean, like you and I, it sounds like we're both very similar. And I've never really figured out why I have both sides of this. So, I don't know. What do you think? I think it's gay. Mm-hmm. To be like gay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, gay... To be like weirdo sometimes? To be weirdo sometimes? I like you! Ha ha. Ha ha! You've got this cool vibe, too. So. Why are you stopping? Because I thought you were cute, and I wanted to come say hi to you, and I wanted to get to know you a little bit. Because I thought you were cute, and I wanted to come say hi to you, and I wanted to get to know you a little bit. That's a problem, because tomorrow I'm flying away. Yeah. Well, of course. You'll have to postpone your flight for us to have our wonderful adventures together. For me, it was actually, I really liked your outfit. Oh, really? Yeah. I thought it was... I mean, you know, because... You know, pretty people, right? It's like, they didn't really do anything for it, you know? It's like... They're like, somehow stylish. Yeah. Well, and... But I think, like, so what I liked is that you... Because you chose this outfit, you know? Which is maybe a little different than like, oh, I was born beautiful, you know? I was on a dating site once, and this girl was like, oh, you're tall. And I'm like, and? And she's like, that's enough. I was like, wait, what do you mean that's enough? Like, I didn't do anything to be tall. Like, you know, tell me I'm funny, tell me I'm honest, tell me I'm, you know, something else like that. But, uh, tall. So, anyway, I had this, like, little epiphany in my head, where I'm like, oh, this is what pretty girls get, when guys come up, and they're like, oh, you're pretty, and they're like, yeah, and? Yeah. What else? Yeah, what else? So? So? I'm having trouble seeing your eyes. Do you want to take off your sunglasses? And I was just talking about, I'm not going to tell you that, because you get it all the time, don't you? People tell you your eyes are pretty all the time, don't they? Thank you. Yeah. I tried. You did. Let me tell you. Your parents did such an amazing job. Okay, thank you. If you want, I can give you my Instagram. Ah. I mean, I guess it's probably a good idea. We should probably see each other again, of course. Okay, but I have to admit something. I literally don't know how to use Instagram. So, we can do this. Um, do I follow you on this? Yes. Okay. That's my nickname. Yeah. All right, well, I'm going to shoot you a message then. Mm-hmm. Sweet. Okay, have a nice day. Bye. Bye, you. Okay, listen, that was fucking good. Overall, it was really good. Appreciate it. Smash it now. Smash it. Hit it. When you told her that you liked her after she did something cute, that's great, right? So, giving her validation based around the way she was. So, when she said something about weird people or something, it's good to be weird or something, and you were like, I like you. To be weirdo sometimes? I like you. Okay, that's excellent, where the girl reveals something about her uniqueness, and then you compliment her in that moment. Very good. Be aware of this one. I want to get to know you. Like, I had to say hi, and I want to get to know you, which you did twice. Like, at the beginning, you did it, and then later on, you did it again. Because I thought you were cute, and I wanted to come say hi to you, and I wanted to get to know you a little bit. Because I thought you were cute, and I wanted to come say hi to you, and I wanted to get to know you a little bit. Now, maybe I do this occasionally, but in general, I'm not going to tell the girl that I want to get to know her, I'm just going to get to know her. Because it's kind of meta-narrating what's going on, which is not necessary, especially at the level that you're at. So, if I go in and I go, hey, listen, I just had to stop you, I want to introduce myself, I don't need to say that, or I had to stop you and say, you look fucking sexy, what's your name? Rather than calling out that he's exactly why I'm here, and kind of pulling the magic out of it a bit. It's a beginner's thing, and you're not a beginner anymore. Cool, yep. I liked you contributing, getting into the conversation about beauty and height. I was on a dating site once, and this girl was like, oh, you're tall. And I'm like, and? And she's like, that's enough. That's depth, right? Like, when people, sometimes a guy's getting confused about, oh, I need to get deeper into something, and thinking that it means, how do you feel about this, or whatever. But no, that's actually finding common ground, relating and sharing a human experience together, and that creates depth. So, that's really good. I'm not 100% on what I think about this either way, but maybe the playful banter is a bit too much. It's quite American, right? Like, I know, when I talk to girls in America, there is that shit-talking, fun banter that kind of goes on the whole time. It's great for general rapport, but it's not really seductive. So, when we were talking earlier about, okay, the difference between high energy, low energy, or more intensity, less intensity is probably a better way to think of it. It's like, yeah, you're light, you're fun, you're playful, and then I drop it for a moment, I look her in the eyes, and I say something, whatever I'm saying, and I zap her with the sex words. Right, so, because your reflex response is to do cheeky banter, which you're good at, and it's an excellent skill. It's something that carries energy along with it and makes it fun, but maybe you're relying on that a bit much. I'm either side on that one, because that interaction to me was lovely. That was just the thought. I was like, okay, there's lots and lots of banter there. Maybe it could have been a bit less at some point, but, you know, I'll watch another couple and see how you go with it. Yeah, that's it. That's good. Hey. Hey. Stop for one second. What? Stop. I thought you... That is cute. That's a really cute move. Thank you. Why do you look so great? I don't know. You don't know? Yeah. You're looking fucking incredible today. Thank you, thank you. I'm actually meeting with a friend, so I have to go. You're late. Okay. I'm going to walk with you for two minutes, and then I've got to go back. Okay. What's your name? I'm Kevin. Nice to meet you. Are you Ukrainian? Mateusz. Mateusz. Mateusz. Mateusz. Do you have a family? My family, yes. Okay, but you must have lived in America for a while. Yeah. Pretty much my whole life. Ah, I understand. So we're two Americans basically meeting on the streets of Kiev. Yeah, I guess so. It's like something out of a movie. Where in America are you from? I'm originally from Chicago. Oh. But I have been... I left America in like 2014. Uh-huh. And I've kind of been living in a whole bunch of different places. Uh-huh. And Kiev has been my latest destination. It's amazing here. I've... I always come back here. You must have family here? Huh? You must have family here? Uh, not really. My mom actually moved a few hours away from Ukraine, but that's about it. But you're living here. Yeah, I go back and forth. Just like a global citizen of the world? Pretty much. Why not? Seems like you have a little bit of adventure to you. Like a mischievousness. I don't know. Hmm, you don't know. Things to discover and find out, huh? Something like that. You're like, I'm just a box of mysteries. I, uh... So, me... I actually am sometimes the opposite. I tend to talk too much. So I'm the guy who's always, you know, won't shut up at the party and everything. And everyone's like, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it. Stop talking? Yeah, stop talking. You know, it's the problem of loving to hear myself talk, you know. I was told I ought to be a lawyer. Yeah, well, there you go. Be professional. You know, just in case this whole traveler thing doesn't work out, right? So... How does not work out, Trev? Say again? How does traveling not work out? I like this attitude. And you must be quite traveled. Yeah. If you're going back and forth between Ukraine and America. Something like that. Something like that. Oh, you got Instagram or something? You got Instagram or something? Look at that. It's a good sign to go. What is it? I like your vibe. You have, uh... You got like a little bit of California girl spunk in you. How would you know? Because I lived in California. Yeah, you're the mystery man. Okay, nice to meet you. Come on, give me a hug. Don't give me that. Okay, bye. I'll see you soon. Alright, so... If a girl does something like that, you got Instagram or something, don't make a deal out of it, because that's where you're like, oh, you're a something, something girl. It's like, got Instagram? I do, but let's do WhatsApp instead. Alright, bam, bam, bam. Cool, I'll see you. Let's meet up soon. Because she's like, here's what I can handle. And you're like, oh, you're an Instagram something, whoa. You got Instagram or something? You got Instagram or something? It's like, you're making a thing of it, instead of just going, she wants to exchange contacts, let's do this. Okay. And that's, okay, this is where the like, the default to banter can hurt you. So it's just like, alright, she's direct, let's be direct. Cool. And then the same thing where they're like, a bit like, oh, you're a box of mysteries, and you must be, there was a couple of assumptions there, which I would have preferred to just orientate myself to figure out what's going on. Okay, so explain this thing. You're bouncing back America and here. What's the story? Just because you were like, oh, you must be an internationalist, you must be a something. Yeah, okay, those are fair enough assumptions. But that's where I would have wanted to find out enough information to go. And then it also helps me orientate in terms of how long have I got with her? Is she flying away tomorrow? Does she live here? Yeah. Oh, and she might have been like, oh, you know, I have a husband, we bounce between the things. Oh, okay, that explains it, right? Your default is quite banter and funny, and it's good, and that's a good skill, and it will help with the energy of interactions. But always remember, what are we trying to do in the interaction? We want to get to know her a bit, we want her to know me a bit, and that will include our humor and the way that we communicate, but it also includes finding out what's going on for her, so that I can find out something I like about her to see her again. And good that you did tell her, you know, I like that about you, whatever the thing was that she was... She did this thing, and it was like, right when I stopped her, she did the thing, it was just adorable. Okay, cool. Yeah, good. All right, so you're noting those things, calling those out, yeah. But you can see now that a blend of cheeky banter and be a man, get shit done, is going to be more powerful. With her, I almost wonder, like, I mean, let me let you think, I almost wonder what the right move she would have been like, let's do her Instagram and be like, oh, you know, I want to get to know you a little more or something like that. No. Nah, it's like, she's like, like that kind of thing where she wants to go and finish it, but she's giving you an opening. Yeah. I would take that. Like, maybe I would make it more solid, so she's like, Instagram, like, all right, let's not do that, let's do WhatsApp, I don't want to see you again soon, maybe tomorrow. Okay. And then I can make a tentative, like, date. Oh, okay, okay. Right? And then, okay, so it's a solid close then, as opposed to a, cool, let's do lunch, see you later, kind of thing, which was what she was doing. I don't think she was disinterested in it at all, that was just her vibe. Okay. Yeah, I kind of felt like I didn't really get to know her, like, we kind of did only the banter, you know, and I kind of wanted more of the connection, I think. Yeah. And sometimes we don't, sometimes we just, the vibe is the only thing that we get, and it's enough. Like, plenty of the times you'll have it where it's just like, she gets a feel like, well, that was fun, I don't know anything about him, but fuck it, I'll see him. Like, that can totally work. Simply don't know what you don't know. And although I highly recommend that you go out by yourself and try your luck with the ladies on the streets of your city, nothing compares to having a professional dating coach by your side, pulling apart the autopsies of your interactions in real time, giving you feedback that you can apply straight away so that your improvements are immediate. And that's what we do a hell of a lot of on our seven day residential, which is coming up here in Budapest, Hungary from the 9th of May onwards. This is seven days around the clock with myself, the TNL team teaching you all of our secrets when it comes to natural style seduction, lifestyle design, in a game, and much, much more. If you'd like to join us, click the link in the description, get on a call with one of us, and now back to the video. \u266a\u266a\u266a Everyone's all right? Yeah? I can't sleep. Can't sleep? Yeah, I know, me neither. We're different. No, I mean, I have pretty bad insomnia. Like, you mean on this workshop or in general? Yeah, that's, everything's on. Your adrenaline's, like, pumping. You're in, like, super high definition experience of life. That's pretty normal. You're just, you're wired from the whole experience. That's, I mean, that's primarily a Eurotour issue. Let's start with our spine today. Basically, its main job is to get rid of pain. And we all, like, I mean, I'm 41 now, and I can feel like if I don't maintain my body, I'll just be in increasing levels of pain until I die. Whereas when I do this a few times a day, I feel young and I feel good in my body, which is a big part of seduction. If I feel good in my body, I enjoy being inside this bag of bones, then I can share that with somebody else, as opposed to I'm up in my head and I'm a stiff, painful block. So check your posture, and then let's start with our cracking the whip hip action. So first, we'll just work the hip and the lumbar. So we drop the knees, roll the hips forward, straighten the knees, roll the hips back, and then there's this extra bit. I don't know, can you guys see this? All right, so I drop here, I roll forward, and now as I'm rolling back, I actually project the lumbar spine out. All right, as opposed to this, which is just the hip, which is fine, this is with the lumbar extended out, and then forward. See the difference? It's like we're f***ing a goat. Now you gotta get in under the tail, and then yeah, and then yeah. Have a play with it. Keep going, let me have a look. Mm-hmm. Okay, so you're skipping a few, so drop. And then, so stand up straight, so drop, tilt the hip forward, and there, there, there, there, because you're missing all this. Okay, all right, so do it slower. There, there, put the head, and then the hip drop back, and then forwards. That's better. Yeah. Even if you're not enjoying it right now, can you see how this would be enjoyable? Yes. Hi. Hi. Hi. You have this look. You have this look? Yes. Which is incredible. Thank you. You look like you're a model strutting down the runway, just like going back and forth. Thank you. Did I get it right? Are you actually a model? Yes. Ah, okay, I understand. Hi, my name's Kevin. Are you off in a hurry somewhere, or what's your day today? I want to meet with my friends. So this is like your after work, after runway kind of chill. Actually, I, I don't know, I just want to meet with my friends. I have not enough time, so I want to. Okay, I'll walk with you for two minutes. I'll walk with you for two minutes, but then I have to go back that way, okay? So maybe we can chat for a little bit before you stride on off into the sunset. So. Actually, I don't have good English. It's okay. Okay. I am. I didn't study at school. I am a patient person, you know? I talk slow. So I am patient, I talk slow, and we understand each other. Ah, that's okay. Yeah. So what are you doing here? I actually have some friends here, and right now I live in Mexico City, but I have friends here, and they said, hey, you want a break from Mexico? Come to Kiev. Kiev, no COVID. You think Mexico is better? Why is that? Which way? You're going this way? Here. I want to live in Mexico. Yeah? Why Mexico? Huh? Why Mexico? I don't know. It's like crazy country. So for you, beauty and art is important? Yes. For me, I like visiting art museums when I visit a new place. Art museum? Oh. It's interesting you think that. I used to think this, but then I dated a girl who was very interested in art history. Yeah, yeah, I'm too young, so I'm just staring at art. Ha ha. You've spent too much, not enough time, huh? Yeah. Yeah. Okay, cool. Well, I'm going to have to go this way anyways, but I'd like to see you again. Do you have a WhatsApp or? I have Instagram. Okay, let's do Instagram. What is your Instagram name? What is this? It's quite strange. Do you have to count every single time? Yes. Look at you. Ha ha ha. Okay, well. That's funny, it's so. Yeah, you have this fun little cheerful energy, so I'll go ahead and message you on Instagram and maybe we'll grab a coffee sometime, okay? Nice to meet you. I hope you have a good day with your friend. Oh, Black Betty, bam, blam. Oh, Black Betty, bam, blam. God damn, that girl was fucking hot and I kinda hate you a lot. Bam, oh, Black Betty, bam, blam. Is that what you're composing while you're listening to the conversation? I'm just always rapping and rhyming and doing it in time because my raps are so tight, I can go all night. If you want to get in a fight, then that's all right too. Yeah, Aussie raps. All right, great opener. Called out the way that she was striding down the street on a runway. The rest was some, fine. Now, you say you live in Mexico. She's like, I want to live in Mexico. Oh, so what does Mexico mean to, do you tell her? You're the one who lives in Mexico. I was kind of afraid to like, trample all over her in this particular case. You didn't, because she said one thing, which was like, I think it's good or something. Beautiful, yeah. Beautiful, okay, and then you can say, well, let me tell you, let me break, let me crush your dreams, sweetie, yeah, well, actually it is. I don't know. I haven't been talking. I don't know what Mexico's like. If you're closing a real model, then it's usually, like how many followers did she have? I have no idea. Didn't even check. Many. Generally, you don't want to get Instagram if she's a actual model, because then you're one of 10,000. So I can call that out, and she's like, go see Instagram. I'm like, I'm not following your model Instagram. Let's chat on text. Okay. So what that says is, I know what models are like, which means I must know something, which means I'm like, ah, no, no, I'm not gonna be one of your followers. I want to chat to you properly. Sweet. In general, I want to get WhatsApp or Telegram, because if she doesn't accept my thing, I'm just another number, right? So it can certainly work. Some girls, especially if your Instagram is good, then it can be beneficial, but in general, I just want to get a WhatsApp or a Telegram, because then it's just us talking as opposed to all the other distractions. If she absolutely won't do it, then fine, I'll do the Instagram. And a lot of girls do just communicate on that kind of messenger, so it's not necessarily a blow-off, but it's now we're in amongst all the other chodes vying for her attention. Cool, that's all. God damn, that girl was hot. Let's go for a second. Can you take them off? I can hear you. Oh, you can hear me? Okay, cool. Well, I won't, maybe I talk not too soft. Okay. I thought you looked absolutely incredible. Thank you. So I wanted to come say hi to you. I wanted to come say hi to you. You look like you're a very, very beautiful woman. Thank you. You look like you're a very, very beautiful woman. Thank you. You look like you're very focused. Maybe you're coming out of the phone world. Maybe. What is your name? I'm Kevin. Kevin. Kevin, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. So what's your day-to-day? You've been crazy and stressed all over the place? No. Ah, okay. Work, work. I was gonna say you seem like maybe a little like kind of dreamy. Always. Always. Maybe you do like lots of meditation or something? Or like yoga or something? To be honest, I actually really love to meditate. I actually really love to meditate. My friends taught me this exercise where you stand in the middle, like here, and you just meditate. And it makes me feel really good. Like water flowing around, you know? But what are you, where are you off to? What? Where are you heading to right now? I come to my place, I wait for friends. So this is your, maybe you start a party? No. Not a party. Not for you? You are maybe not a party person? Sometimes. On Fridays? Friday, Saturday, but not on week. On week, very serious. I can tell, you are a very serious person. You, of course, never smile, huh? Always smile. So, isn't this crazy? Like meeting a random person on the street? Yeah. Why are you laughing at me? So, tell me something about yourself. Maybe not now, maybe tomorrow, or after tomorrow, but because I need to go. Mm, you need to go. So how about this? I'll walk with you, maybe, because I have to go this way, but I walk with you into that corner, we talk a little bit, and then if we'd like each other, maybe we... I have a scout who's there. Oh my God. It's not far. I got you just in time, before a pretty girl walked out of my life. Maybe we can change Instagram and chat after? We can do Instagram, yeah. Do you have like WhatsApp or Telegram? I prefer... WhatsApp, Telegram. Yeah, okay. Plus three eight, plus three eight, plus three eight, oh? Mm-hmm. Okay. I don't want to make you late for your friend appointment, but you're pretty cute, and maybe I'll send you a message on Telegram, we can chat a little bit, yeah? Okay, nice to meet you. Was trying to add pressure and ask questions, and I don't think I did well at either. Like ask more interesting questions. Yeah, that one was clunky. Yeah, that one was clunky. Yeah, that one was clunky. Yeah, that one was clunky. Yeah, that one was clunky. Yeah, that one was clunky. Yeah, that one was clunky, because, which just doesn't matter. Yep. In the grand scheme of things. But I think what you were trying to make that more complicated than it needed to be, it could have just been really simple. Especially because you're, again, kind of making too many assumptions based on not enough evidence, where like you must be, seem to be dreamy, fine, and then you're like, oh, you must be meditating, and she was like, nope. And you're like, all right, let me talk, do a weird thing about meditation. Maybe you do like lots of meditation or something. I actually really love to meditate. My friends taught me this exercise, and you just meditate. There was no indication that that was good. You could have just been like, oh, okay, well, you look chill and it's working for you. Okay. Anyway, so, and then I move on to the next thing. Like same kind of thing with like, oh, maybe you start parties, maybe like this is now a habit I'm noting with you. Maybe you start a party. Nobody. It's great to be able to make assumptions based on evidence. Because it shows that you're reading her and you're learning stuff about her and you're making guesses and you're present with her. But if I do that all the time, I'm gonna get it wrong a lot of the time. And it sounds like a thing. It sounds like, oh, you must be that kind of girl. You must be, too much assumption. It's just like, ask another question. You're not in danger of asking too many questions. Most other guys are. Okay, okay, okay. You're contributing plenty. That's not your issue at all. Yeah, for other guys, it certainly is. Then when there was a little pause, then by going, oh, isn't this crazy? Two strangers meeting on the street."}
