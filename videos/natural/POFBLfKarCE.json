But, but, I can tell you definitely out of personal experience what they don't want. Things that turn them off, things that make them go cold, things that make them not say yes to a second date. Because there's nothing worse than, you know, having a girl that is into you, that wants to meet you, that agreed to meet you, or even met you, turn totally cold, not see you again, or just flake on a date, or stop responding. So let's look at three turn-offs that you should avoid, that you should cut out, out of your behavior, to prevent girls from flaking and ghosting you. Number one is neediness. No girl wants a guy who is needy. It's bitter, it's weak, it shows so many negative attributes about you, and I could tell you a million stories when I was too needy. Yes, I was a needy little boy once, and I'll tell you one, okay? I'll spare you the other ones for later. I was in university, and I was studying marketing, and you know, there was a bunch of girls in our class, a bunch of guys, and I remember after the first year, I hope this girl is not watching this, after the first year of studying, a new girl arrived in our class, and she was by far the cutest. She was interesting, she was funny, she was quirky, she was hanging out with the boys, you know, she was kind of cool, but she was also really good looking and sexy, and I was really into her for two years, because the whole bachelor course was for three years, and we would study together, but we never got like close. I never made a move. Time's passing, finals are coming, and I'm probably gonna leave Vienna. So in a grandiose gesture, I decided, or after like a week of thinking about it, that I will call her, and I will tell her all of my feelings for her, and how long I've been into her, and how important she really is for me, and just, I went from zero to a hundred. So I call her up, and I'm telling her like, hey, I know, blah blah blah, I'm really into you. I'm cringing as I'm telling this. I'm really into you, and we should meet, and I would love to meet you and take you on a date finally, after being classmates, and da da da da da. And she was just weirded out, and she was like, yeah, sure, but tonight I'm busy. And then the worst part is, I think I saw her the next day, like in a club, and I like gave her like a goodbye hug, and she like tapped me on the shoulder, and not even hugging me. It was horrible. What was so bad about it? Shouldn't we be honest? Shouldn't we be direct as men? Yes, we should, but we also have to keep in mind, we have to play games, especially at the beginning. We have to create attraction, and attraction is not just being created by being so giving, you know, basically telling them, I'm so into you. You got me. You won. You didn't even have to try. You're amazing. I will give you the world. You are everything for me. You can do that with your wife. You can do it after you have a strong emotional bond, after, you know, she respects you as a man, and she sees you as a strong guy in her life, and you did something for her, and she done something for you, and so on. But at the beginning, this is weak. It needs to be balanced. The investment needs to come from both sides. So if you're the needy one, can be easily controlled, you already lost her respect, and then she can basically decide, do I not want to date this guy, or do I want to use him for his resources, for his finances, you know? So often when I hear stories about, oh, she's a gold digger, or she sucked him dry, or she took everything off him, blah, blah, blah. I'm like, well, it was still him giving it to her, right? Yes, maybe she had evil intentions. Maybe she's a gold digger. Maybe she does want to suck some guys dry and use them only for their money. But keep in mind, it was still a guy on the other side of that relationship who agreed to these terms in some way. So second thing is no escalation. I assume most of my viewers don't have the problem of being too straightforward with women, being too aggressive, touching too much, getting rejected, because they push too hard on a date. This is a thing, and obviously there's guys out there who are too aggressive, and they need to calm the... But I know from my clients over many, many years of coaching, being on a lot of calls, figuring out discovery calls, which you can book below, by the way, figuring out what guys want and what they struggle with, and just knowing myself and knowing how the viewers resonate with me, is I was unable to escalate at all. I would sit at a date, and again, a little story here. I was actually in Bulgaria a couple of years ago. There was this... She was, back then, probably the hottest girl I've ever seen. And still, remembering her dark, long hair, strong eyebrows, full lips, damn, hot, the way she walked, everything, she was hot. And I stopped her on the street, and I got her number, and she agreed to go on a date with me. So we met up for a coffee, and I was super excited, and we talk, and we talk, and we talk, and we talk, and we talk about interesting stuff, and we had some stuff in common, and we even like the same bands, and we wanna travel to the same country, wow. And that was like two hours, and then I was like, all right, bye, okay. And we hugged goodbye, and that was it. And then I, back then, was still excited. I was like, all right, cool, first date. But when I texted her to meet up again, she was basically saying like, hey, you're a nice guy, but I didn't feel the spark, something like that she wrote. And back then, I was like confused. Like, what does that mean? Like, everything went, she went on a date with me, she talked to me, she answered my questions, she shared a bit about herself, I shared about me, we made a connection. But then later, it took a while, it hit me of like, oh, I'm just like a fucking dude who talks. I'm not a man who escalates, who takes initiative, who leads, who takes her somewhere, who tries to create a sexual environment. It was just very friendly. From the outside, I could have been an old school friend, I could have been her cousin, I could have been her gay friend. There was no clear intention from my side of like trying to move this forward and just establishing the frame of, I'm a man, and it's my job to escalate, and it's her job to accept it, or to verbally or non-verbally say yes, or no, or not yet. And then it's my job again to read these signs correctly, and then do the right thing. But I didn't do any of that, because I was young, who can blame me? I didn't know how to escalate. I was too afraid. It's not like I didn't think about it. I was just too afraid to do it. And yeah, I was just afraid to be called out. I'm like, what, you want to kiss me on a date? You want to try to touch me? I was too afraid of that. And it took me a while to actually overcome that. It took some mindset shifts, took some coaching. And that's just natural. So if you want to share similar thoughts like that, you can join the Social Academy below, which is a group of men. It's a digital tribe where we come together, share our strengths and weaknesses, talk about what's happening in our dating life. And yeah, it's a good support group of men. Number three is being salty. Now, salty is a bit of a vague word, but basically being annoyed, the opposite of calm, weirdly challenging about the wrong things, right? There's a good way of challenging a woman, and there's a bad way of challenging a woman. For example, let's say you're agreeing to meet a girl for a date, and then she's late. Maybe she's 15 minutes late. Maybe she's 21 minutes late. You know, these are kind of normal numbers. You know, I know there's always the heroes in the comments who are like, oh, if the girl is late, even by one minute, I will leave her and tell her my honest opinion. And because I respect my time. And if she doesn't respect my time, then I need to show her because I'm a man of honor and respect. And she doesn't respect me, and I need to be respected. What's up, bro? Like, just chill out, right? Just be on your phone, work on your phone. If you're such a busy guy, I'm sure you've got a lot of emails and client calls. You can follow up on your phone, check your project management, check your Asana, check your Notion, reach out to your assistant. Now, call your mom for 15 minutes. Point is, girls are late. And the harder the girl, she's probably later and later because previous men showed her it's okay. And then who wouldn't, right? She just adjusts to the world around her. Sure, if a fucking girl lets me wait alone in a fucking restaurant forever, and I reserved a table, and then the waiter is like pushing me because the kitchen is closing soon, or I'm at a theater or a concert, and the concert already started, and I need to fucking get her a ticket somehow, or I'm at the airport, and now, I don't know, we're almost missing the flight, and the check-in closes, and I need to back the check-in to keep it open, anything like that, where it's actually there's a deadline, sure, she fucked up, or you fucked up communicating to her that it's important. Point is, let's say she's normal late. You would be the kind of guy who then calls her out on it constantly. Oh, you're late. Oh, you know, I respect my time of being that kind of guy. Or bringing it up over the date all the time. You're basically salty. You're hurt, your ego is hurt, and you cannot deal with it. You cannot just suck it up, and reset, and chill out. Very bad, because now you're putting your bad energy, your inner fucking storm onto her, which you shouldn't do. You shouldn't be the storm. She's the storm. That's her job. Not job, but that's her femininity. You are grounded. You're the rock. You chill. Whatever happens, happens. There's a reason. You breathe in, you breathe out, you let it go. Same with if she's on her phone. Again, there's limits, right? If she's constantly on the phone on a date, well, either she's just fucking boring, or disrespectful, and that was the last date, and I will not see her again. Or you're really boring, and you didn't engage her properly. You know, there's a fine line between it. You can call it out once, but if you then call her names, or bring it up again, or in also salty ways, also go on your phone, like, fine. Like, okay, right? Often happens more into a relationship. Again, you're the man. You're the communicator. You set the boundaries. You tell her what's okay, what's not. And you don't have to do that in a grandiose way of like, listen up. You know, here's what's going on. Da, da, da. Just like, hey, babe. You know, I'm super busy, and I really enjoy, let's say in a relationship, I really enjoy these 20-minute coffees in the morning with you. And I know you're super busy too, but I would love if we could both manage to not look at the phone for 20 minutes. What do you think? Would that work for both of us? Blah, blah, blah. Something like that. In a chill tone, suggesting, implementing yourself, asking for her opinion. That's a way to resolve it easily. And another way of, where I hear guys getting salty of like, it goes back to what we talked about before. It's like, oh, I paid for her, and she didn't even come home, or she didn't even text back, or she just came on a date for a free dinner, and then she fucking flicked. She didn't respond to me for 12 hours after, or anything like that, where you do something, and then you act like it's out of your generosity. You paid for the dinner, you paid for the taxi, you did this, it is that. But then you clearly expect a certain, very specific action from her right after. And you didn't do it, you didn't comply. And now you're salty, you're angry, and you let her know. And then you call it out. Oh, it seems like you're just after men with money, or you're just after a free dinner. Oh, fine. It's like, bro, if she's so beautiful that you dated her, and she's so important to you, or blah, blah, blah, she can probably get other free dinners as well. And you have to bring it back to, you were just not it. You know, I had that story recently. Good friend of mine, female, sexy, from Hungary. She got invited for dinner. The fucking guy flew in from Switzerland to Hungary, just to go on a dinner with her. She was like, all right. You know, he had hot photos on Tinder. That's all right. I mean, that's basically checking all the boxes. He was already very needy, right? Flying just for her. He didn't even make a big excuse why he goes to Hungary. Just for her, he flew from Switzerland to Hungary. He met her for dinner. He paid. He was fucking boring. He paid for it. And then she was like super, I checked the text. She was still super nice, right? And nice with him. But she was just like, sorry, I don't want to see you again. And he was insanely boring, according to her. And he got really salty about it. He was like, oh, seems like you just want free dinners. And believe me, she's so hot. She can get free everything. She was very nice to him. So he was salty. He didn't escalate at all during the date. And he was very needy by flying in all the way from Switzerland. So he checks all the free boxes. Of course, she doesn't want to see him again. Without trying to ramble on too much. Don't be needy. Don't be salty. And try to be a man when it comes to escalation. There's nuances to escalation, right? I don't want to say, yeah, grab her, touch her. Like it's a subtle thing. You test something and you see how does she react. You're listening. You're calibrated. So how do we fix these things? Well, easy. We do the opposite. We're not needy. We give and we receive. We don't really take. We wait till she wants to give us. And if that takes a long time, that's okay. If the girl that I gave my big speech about how much I like her, yes, I was moving to Hungary back then. Instead of giving this big speech to that girl that I wouldn't have seen for a long time, I could have just said, hey, we've been such good classmates. And I feel like you're a good friend to me now. Of course, be careful with calling it a friend and then doing a date. But again, I wouldn't do it a date. Let's have a drink, say goodbye, right? It's not an erotic offer. It's not a sensual offer. But at least I could have had some time with her and figure out further. Don't be salty. Accept the female nature. Accept women do what they do. Women are late. Women are this. Women are that. And you're the man. Either you deal with it or you communicate, clear your boundaries. And if you communicated your boundaries clearly and they're not from a salty space place, but they're actually like make sense and she doesn't comply. All right, move on to the next one. So what? There's many women. And don't not escalate, which means escalate. Make a move. Take the thing somewhere. She will not do that for you. You're the leader. It's your job.
