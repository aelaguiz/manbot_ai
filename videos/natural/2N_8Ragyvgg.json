What's up? I need to walk though. Can I walk with you for one minute and not get killed? Talking to you is dangerous already. Hey man, what's up? This is Alex from the Natural Lifestyles. Now we're about to jump in into an infield video of mine which was filmed last year in Barcelona. So this happened before the whole world went into crisis mode. That's why there's way more people out on the street. Now this is a little bit more of an advanced video and interesting to watch if you want to become a better seducer because almost every girl I'm talking to in this video has a boyfriend or is in a committed relationship. Now what I'm experiencing a lot during our workshops when I'm coaching guys and we do approaching, that almost every time when a girl brings up you know a boyfriend or a husband or whatever, guys are like almost shocked and they try to get away as quick as possible. Which isn't a bad thing in itself because in a way it shows they respect the girl's boundaries, they want to make her feel comfortable and they realize okay she has a boyfriend, she has something really committed, that's cool right? I want to respect that, that's a beautiful thing. So I don't mind that guys respect that as a whole but if you want to become a more complete seducer and just become really better at communicating and become better at this whole skill of seduction, you kind of need to do two things. Firstly you need to almost train yourself to stay in interactions a little longer than you are comfortable. You know this is how you just consistently push your comfort zone and become more aware, more comfortable and a better seducer and communicator as a whole. And the other thing is and it's really important and that's what I'm doing in this video where you should really pay close attention, the other thing is you should not see it as this one-dimensional thing where either you get a number and you can go on a date or nothing is ever gonna happen with that girl. I want you guys to develop a more broad mindset that when a girl has a boyfriend she can still be a cool girl to hang out with. Maybe she wants to come at a house party of you one day and she can even bring her boyfriend because maybe he's a cool guy as well. Maybe she runs a business and you can share knowledge or you can collaborate on some other projects together. So I feel like a lot of guys who are in this like seduction journey, they see things very one-dimensional and they're very focused on, oh I'm the seducer guy, I need to seduce, I need to get dates, dates, dates, numbers, numbers, numbers and yeah as I say develop a more broader perspective on this whole thing and watch how I do it, how when I do find out she has a boyfriend and she's definitely in love with him, then I turn my seduction switches off, right? So I'm not then trying just easily get her on a date anyway or you know slide into her DMS later or whatever. I'm just a cool social guy at this point and I'm trying to build a relationship that way. So without further ado let's jump into the video. One last thing, we put a lot of work into this so please click the like button, takes you one second and I would really appreciate that and now enjoy watching. We're in Barcelona, one year later after my first infield and it's fucking hot like 34 degrees heatwave. I just came out of 11 days straight coaching for the TNL crew which was amazing, amazing breakthroughs and I'm tired as fuck. I only got four hours of sleep and I'm sweating and I was like hmm maybe I should cancel infield session but I was like no like we teach that you can approach with our principles, our framework and so on that you can approach in any state, in any location and in any mood. So that's what I'm gonna do. I'm just gonna roll with it. It's gonna be good anyway and if not it's fine too. Excuse me, hello. Do you like green drinks? Yeah I do, just got mine. Me too. I also like you. You look good. Thank you very much. I have a boyfriend. No, straight up. I'm sorry. But I like it that you're so like open on the street. I like that. Very cool, seems like you're a very open person. I am, yeah. Where are you from? Germany. Oh, Austria. Austria, then we can speak German. We can, yeah. Cool, where are you from? I lived in Vienna for four years but I'm from Upper Austria. And now I'm actually living in Budapest. But I want to move to Barcelona. Okay, that's a good idea. It's a normal lifestyle here. My boyfriend is also from Vienna, from Austria. How does it work? German, Austrian? Yeah, it works. What are you doing here? I'm studying here. Very cool. Okay, I don't want to keep you up any longer. Nice to meet you. Enjoy your drink. Bye bye. So, as you see guys, I approach, I do something weird like, do you like green drinks? Me too, haha, I like you. You know, like it's not a very complex thing but it's situational, it's fun, it's light. And she straight up says, I have a boyfriend. And I'm like, oh, okay, cool. But you're smiling, you seem like an open person. So, you could handle it as, oh, I got rejected. But no, it was a crazy beautiful interaction. She even says, oh, I think it's cool what you're doing. So, I feel good, she feels good. Hello. Excuse me. You look cool. What's up? Not in the mood to talk to strangers? What? Do you speak Spanish? Yes, I do. Ah, okay. It's my day off today and I'm enjoying it because the other days I was working a lot. Yes, me too. And I like your style, a little weird. Thank you, it's weird. I didn't know. You like brands? Fashion brands? Like Balenciaga? Yes. What's your name? Karina. Karina. My name is Alex. Okay, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. You are either very shy but friendly or very polite. No, I'm not shy. Yes, I'm friendly. I'm just married and, you know, it's a bit weird. That's very weird. I don't think that I'm happy to see you. Is he around? No, he's working. Good. We work together. Good husband. What are you working on? We have barbershops here. Maybe you know Jack Barber? No. No? I'm only here for one month but I will move here soon. So then I will get to know him. Is it a good barbershop? Yes, it's nice. I'm more afraid of barbers than dentists. Why? Because they always fuck it up. No, no, they are all Italians and they work in London. Okay, I will remember it. I'm happy to pay more if they don't fuck it up. Okay, anyway, that's cool. And you, where do you work? I work in a company that does different workshops in different cities. Like meditation, lifestyle design, confidence, dating and so on. And it's pretty cool too. Because I do the business side and I do the coaching side. I enjoy it. And why Barcelona? Why Barcelona? Because there's a lot of people and it's a cool city. Where are you from? I'm from Austria. Where are you from? I'm from Russia. Russia, of course. Okay, it's nice to talk to you. Very nice. It's cool that you're married. I understand that. I'm not going to try to influence that. But it's very interesting to meet people who have businesses. Because I actually want to do a business next year here. A macho shop? Have you been to New York? No. Okay. Do you want to exchange Instagram? Yeah, sure. It will be next trip, I think. Yeah. Do you feel like Barcelona is a good place for business? Yeah. Why? Sure. Because we opened our business three years ago. And now we have three shops here. Amazing. So if you're doing it good... Maybe you will be my mentor. I follow you. And you follow me because I have to accept it. You're excited. That's amazing. Okay. What about Karina? Karina. Alex. Okay. Well, maybe I'll ask you for business advice soon. Okay. All the best. Bye-bye. Well, that went better than I expected at the beginning. Yeah, it was just like reading Balenciaga. Spending time with Russian is worth it because I can now say really quick Balenciaga. Balenciaga. Balenciaga. And that's what made the real difference here. Me being able to say Balenciaga really fast, which were her glasses. No, but for real, interesting set. She was a bit like, okay, yeah. No, thank you. You don't want to talk to strangers. No. And then I thought, oh, maybe he's Spanish. So I switched to Spanish a little bit. Maybe she doesn't understand my English. Okay. But turns out her English was perfectly fine. She was just a little bit... Yeah, just not in the mood. You know, like married girl. Strange guy with hippie style when she's investing 20K in her shoes. But then I kept persisting in a really friendly way. I wasn't like reactive. I wasn't pushy. I kept the distance the same. And I asked, like, basically I called out the little awkwardness of stranger meets stranger, which is always going on. By saying, oh, either you're like very shy and friendly or very polite and friendly. Like basically like, yes, please. No, thanks, basically. And then we got into a conversation. And she's like, no, but I'm married. I'm like, cool. And as soon as I hear that, I'm basically turning off all seduction switches, you know. I'm not running away. But I'm also not like arguing with that. Like she has a husband. There's zero chance that I will seduce this girl. But she's a cool girl. She is fashionable. She was friendly. She talked to me. Hey, why not make a friend? Turns out she runs three barbershops here. Turns out she's thinking about scaling the business. I want to do business here. I'm scaling TNL, you know. Like why not make a cool connection with a person that you're not trying to get into your bedroom. And she have left with super happy feelings. And she will remember me. And maybe we keep in touch later. Pretty cool. That's her boyfriend. Ah, yeah, she's very pretty. I would have. Would have. Could have. Starting to build a matcha brand. So I brand myself as the matcha guy now. Hello. Hola. \u00bfQu\u00e9 tal? \u00bfQu\u00e9 tal? Un matcha latte. \u00bfMatcha? Frio, por favor. Okay. I'll build a matcha empire starting next year. Because I went to New York. And I found this cool place. And I'm going to steal all their ideas. Put it into Barcelona. So I have to try all the matchas that are around Barcelona to see where there is room for improvement. What's your YouTube channel? DNatural Lifestyles. DNatural. Lifestyles. Guys, follow us on Instagram. DNatural Lifestyles. Here we go. Great content. This guy. Do you want to be in our video? Yeah. Yeah. This guy will be on it. So... Yeah. Alright. So Europe is closing its borders. I'm playing this game of Donkey Kong. That's how slow we gain followers. We actually have to talk to them in a cafe. Like, please follow us. Hello, guys. Hi. What's up? Don't want to sell you anything. Yeah. But... You guys look a little confused. No, we're fine. Where are you from? Ukraine. Are you friends? No, no, no. My name is... Excuse me. Hello. You're in a rush. You're walking very fast. Ah, okay. She was 40. That's very beautiful. Hello. Coming in. What's up? Can I walk with you for one minute? Oops. And not get killed? Oh, shit. Talking to you is dangerous already. What's up? Busy. Going to the airport right now. Shit. That's also the worst timing to meet you. Where are you from? I'm from Amsterdam. Okay. Did you enjoy your time in Barcelona? Yeah, but I'm coming back on Saturday. That's great. I'll be still here. Don't worry. No stress. I'll be here. I'll wait for you. My name is Alex. Hi, Alex. How can you wait? I'm very... Malay. Malay. Strong. Business. I'm obviously here because you're cute. But I guess you figured. I do have a boyfriend, though. What? That's crazy. I know, but... I mean, I'm not surprised. How is it going with your boyfriend? Good, yeah, actually. I've been here for about three weeks now. You moved here? Yeah. Oh, how was that? I moved here for work, so I'm currently working here. After I come back, I'll stay here for about three more weeks, and then I'm going back to Amsterdam. Okay. Oh, so it's just a short... It's only six weeks. Right. Because I'm here for a month also for work, but then I will... Oh, he touched my dick. Then I will move here forever, or like for a while. Forever, yeah. It's a really nice city. It's great. Before, I've never been before, but it's really nice to be here. But it's just very hot, and now I'm going to Belgium. Yes. And it's like 10 degrees less over there. That's why I'm wearing long jeans. Okay, do you do any modeling ever? Yeah, that's my job here. Cool, I figured. Stradivarius. Which store? Stradivarius. Oh, you work for them? Yeah. Cool. Like almost every day. My ex was in love with this brand. Me too, me too. So like fittings. Loads of stuff. No, it's like a shooting, so when you look up the site, on the website from Stradivarius, you'll see me. Huge. Yeah. Cool, beautiful. Well, you have a boyfriend. That's good. Yeah. It's very sad. No, that's cool. I do photography. I like beautiful girls, even with boyfriends. Maybe. I mean, I guess you have an agency, and you're not allowed to work without it. No, but if you, because I do testing. Yeah. So if you do contact my agency, it's... Do you have Instagram? Yeah. Do you have one second to... I'll just add you here. Yeah. Alright, screenshot down. How long have you been doing this modeling? For a few years now. I think about four. Still not tired of it? No, I like it. That's cool, you're so positive. It keeps me busy. Can you add me, so otherwise I'm one of the 70 guys per day that texts you? I'll search myself. Oh, yeah. Just say hi. I know how this works. This is not real life. Do you believe in assimilation? In what? This is not real life. It's not real life. Oh, you mean your feet is not. Yeah. Right, that is true. Okay. So, bye. Thanks, bye. I love the blonde girl, because this is how it happens sometimes, right? I'm running after her, she's turning around, and some people might freak out. They're like, now she saw me. Now she saw me before I did my thing. I was just calling that out. I'm like, just like, here I am, you know, because she smiled, which obviously is great. Not every girl smiles. Some girls are a bit like shocked. So she could totally take it. She's beautiful. She's a Stradivarius model. So she gets approached, she can handle it really well. She is in social interactions a lot. Which I called out several times throughout the set. You know, I wanted her to understand that I understand her world. Like, I didn't say, what do you do? And then she would say, I'm a model. And I would be like, oh, cool. I straight up said, do you do modeling sometimes? Because, like, I understand your beauty. I understand the way you, like, hold yourself. Okay, you're probably a model. And she's like, yeah. And I'm like, okay, I guess. I say things like, oh, you do fittings. I don't even know what that is. But it seems like a term in the model world that a lot of models do. So like, yeah, fitting, right? Yeah, fitting. Okay, cool. I get it. That kind of thing I do with very attractive girls. Like, you have to make them understand that you understand them. That you're on the same level. That you are not just some guy who is running after them. Because she's so beautiful. I did wait with the photography longer, you know. Like, I'm not using, because I do a lot of photography. And I do talk to girls because I do want to shoot them. And I want to make videos of them. But I'm not using it as a crutch to be like, hello, I'm a photographer. And you're really beautiful. So do you want to come to my bedroom and take all your clothes off? And then we do a shoot. Maybe I can fuck you then. I'm not doing that. I did it way after she mentioned she had a boyfriend. Literally then, again, as a way of connecting, you know. And in case I meet her for a photo shoot. Let's say it happens. Then I will definitely, again, turn all my seduction switches off. You know, I won't be the guy who is now trying to get into her pants through a different lane. Through like, photography instead of direct seduction. No. I will meet her because I'm generally interested in photography. And I want to make cool pictures of a beautiful girl. And I'm respecting that she has a boyfriend. Of course, I'm heading on Instagram. That for in a year, or in two years, or in six months, or whatever. She breaks up with her boyfriend. And then she starts maybe responding to my stories or liking my pictures. I will be very aware of that. And then possibly reach out to her. Yes, in a seduction way. Yeah, it was just fun. I enjoyed it because the whole structure was off. You know, there wasn't like the stop. Hey, pre-frame. Hey, opener. It was totally free-flowing, you know. I brought the opener as, well, you obviously know I'm here. You're beautiful. Something like that. I'm obviously here because you're cute. But I guess you figured. Again, it shows that I'm very aware of her situation, of her life. And that I'm aware of what she's aware of. Just like, puts me in a different group of men. Hello. Hola. Hola. Dime. Dime. Are you waiting for someone? Yes. Okay. You look so peaceful. Lucas. My Spanish better? Yes, please. Okay. I see you're very elegant. Ah, thank you. Thank you very much. And I wanted to say hello because maybe you're friendly. No. No? I've been with the same guy for three years. The same guy? Yes. Boyfriend? Yes. Okay. Very good. And it's good? Very good. Very good. All good. Okay. Enjoy your day. Thank you. Bye-bye. So far I've approached and I'm counting out of memory one, two, four girls with boyfriends, I think. And the Ukrainian has just walked away. But let's put up a boyfriend counter. Four out of five. Shit. Looks taken. I don't know. I'll try. Hello. You walk so slowly. It's cool to watch. You're like very chill. No, you're beautiful. That's what I wanted to say. Where are you from? Brazil. Brazil. Where in Brazil? Sao Paulo. Sao Paulo. That's a crazy city. Yes. Is it crazier than Barcelona? No. Is it crazier than Barcelona? Yes. Do you live here? No. Okay. Do you have a day where you want to just relax and not talk too much? Maybe. Right now I'm going to meet my boyfriend. Oh, okay. He's also Brazilian? Yes. Cool. Okay. I hope you have a good day with your boyfriend. Thanks. Bye-bye. Five out of six. Bing. This shop is where I bought my famous bunny masks, which I took a lot of photos of with girls. When I bought them a year ago, I would have never thought on how many locations and on how many faces the mask will be placed. So it's a weird cool sign for me how far I've come over the last 12 months. It's really cool. But I will go to the W on Sunday. Okay. You know, there's this cool pool party. Yeah, I know. Next week and then the week after. Okay, I think I don't work on Sunday. Maybe I will go there. We should see each other there. Okay, thanks for watching. I hope you enjoyed this video. And way more than that, I hope you got inspired. I hope you got inspired to go out, to meet people, to work on your seduction skills, to become a better communicator. And I'm obviously aware that right now, as I'm filming this in 2020, the world is in a bit of a different situation than it was last year. But that should not be an excuse. You know, I'm in Kiev right now. I was in Budapest two weeks ago where we're actually going to run a workshop very soon. And people are out on the streets. Girls are ready to be approached again. People want to communicate. People want to talk to people more than ever. So I'm reading a lot of comments where people are like, Daygame is dead. We can never approach again. This is fake because blah, blah, blah. Yeah, just be aware to make this COVID-19-2020 crisis another excuse you're putting on top of your other excuses of the list of reasons why you cannot approach and you cannot take this serious. So please be aware of that. Again, hit the like button if you made it that far because you clearly enjoy our content. And I hope you appreciate what we do. And if you want to take this really serious and come on a workshop with us, then click the link below where you will find a workshop calendar. My workshop in August is actually booked out. So that's full. But I'm doing another one in September. Again, in Budapest, as I said, it's an amazing city to do seduction, to teach and to basically get you into this new level of your life. That's really our goal here that you can start a new life. You become a crazy new version of yourself that goes out, that meets people, that meets girls, that gets dates, that gets laid and all this good stuff. So click the link below, book a call with us. It's totally casual, non-committing. You're going to talk to us for like 30 minutes, either me or Jonathan. And we're just going to try to help you and try to figure out how we can improve your skills and really help you step out of your comfort zone, step into this new you and do that as soon as possible. Because I don't think you want to waste another year. Even though it's been a crazy year, you want to take advantage of the possibilities you have now. That's it from me. See you in the next video."}
