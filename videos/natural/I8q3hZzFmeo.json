Lots of those things happened early on. And I remember at some points, because I had a number of experiences in teenage years of not being able to get it up with my first partners, not because there was anything wrong with me. It was because I was nervous because I didn't know what to do. I had never done it before. And I remember the feeling of like going, I'm just going to forget sex. It's too awkward. I don't know what to do. Maybe I should just like leave it until I don't know, I'm more confident someday. And I made the conscious decision like, no, get in bed with girls and figure it out. Start talking to them. Because my first, I had a number of partners, I didn't say anything to them about sex. We just got together and silently tried to figure it out, fumbling teenagers. And often it wasn't very good. As a result, I had a lover fairly early on who just talked. She just said, oh, what do you like? Or does that feel good? Can you touch me in this way? I was like, oh, that's a good idea. We should use these things, words that we've been using for 70,000 years or whatever to communicate and starting to talk about sex and it becoming fun and silly and being able to have a life."}
