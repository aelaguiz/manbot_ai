Some of them are these. The tribe is held together by debts and favours, by trust, by loyalty. But it's held together because everyone's enjoying being in the tribe, right? If it's like we only suffer unless we're working on, you know, we're trying to win the NBA playoffs and it doesn't matter how much we suffer because that's more important than the enjoyment. That's not what the situation we're in. We're in the situation like with all the stuff I teach, I'm trying to give you ways to enjoy your life more today and then multiply those effects over time. So taking time to with your growth house crew to go and chill or let off steam or do fuck all is also extremely valuable as well, because they actually I remember they had a rule that the 8 a.m. start was regimented. Even if you had if you had a girl, she had to kick her out. All right. So at 8 a.m., the guys would be like, all right, get out. We're going to do our growth house so we can get more chicks. And I was like, I think maybe let's be a little more flexible on that one. If a guy already has a girl in bed, let him sleep in and fuck her. And just a little more on this and this idea of bonding of the tribe. And this is really important that the tribe is bonded, because if we're only dependent on the success fail of any given mission, then if we succeed, we'll be like, oh, all right, nice. Let's do another mission. And if we fail, we'll be like, oh, that didn't work. Well, fucking fuck hanging around with these losers. I have no real bond with the people aside from our attempt to make something happen. It didn't work. So yeah, and you fade off. That'll happen like that may happen. Even the first couple of times you try to build this, that there is just not enough emotional glue to hold you together or you start something and it sort of works for a while and then it falls off. Expect that that happened to me, my first several wingmen, my first attempts, you know, at throwing parties and stuff. Some worked, some didn't. Wingmen came and went. Social scene started and then kind of collapsed again. Right. That went on for years and will continue to go on. But I just have more backup now. I can have a scene fall apart and then I can go and rebuild it or I can rebuild another one much faster. But what are the what are the bonding experiences that really tie a tribe together? Some of them are these getting laid together. So all of the all the things related to going out and hustling and trying to pick up girls and being young seduces. That is a very deeply bonding experience. If you do it well with other wing with with your wingmen, you're going to a type of battle. You're experiencing highs and lows. You're getting shredded in front of them. So you get to see each other eat shit. You get to see each other pull off stuff. We like, damn, motherfucker, that was a slick number close. And that that does bond people very well, as long as you're good wingmen, as long as you don't fuck each other's sets or try and steal each other's girls or any of that nonsense. If you're good to each other, that's bonding. What else? Making money. Business projects where either you're paying somebody or you're working together to create money. These things don't always, but can absolutely bond. Right. So it's it. We can just have a purely transactional business relationship. No emotion involved, really. You know, I hire you to do this job for me. You're a contractor. You help me do this thing. I made some money. You made some money. Thank you very much. Cool. But like all of and I'm not saying this is the I have not I'm not the best businessman, right, because I do get to to personal. Probably I like to have my collaborators close to me and they need to make money. So we may as well all make money on TNL because that's the thing that works. So it is very close. I'm not saying that's always the best idea, like going into business with your best friend or your brother or whatever can be a disaster. But there is there is definitely something that like holds men particularly together when we make each other cash. Show me the money. I have a friend called Chava in in Hungary, and we've been making each other money now for years. And initially he helped me find my apartment for a very good price. He renovated it and then basically increased the value of it by 100 percent. I gave him 20 percent of that. Since then, I've done other apartments flips. He came out here for a while, helped me kind of look at the infrastructure and design work. We've hung out. We we've we do hang out sometimes. Like just to hang out. We have dinners and coffees, but usually we're on a mission together. And usually it means one of us is going to make some money or both of us. And that that has been something that now like over the years, I trust him 100 percent. He's I 100 percent trust him business wise. And I have a lot of fondness for him. I would consider him a friend. And I will do collaborations with him for who knows how long. Next, taking drugs and getting drunk. Now, I don't want to be an advocate of getting wasted all the time, but there's definitely I remember Clary said to me in our early part of our friendship, we'd been at uni together and we hung out for six or eight months. And he said, we haven't even had a bonding getting pissed yet. And I didn't drink at the time, but I saw he was right. And I went, oh, fuck it, let's get drunk. So we had for me, that was three beers. And then we talked about stuff we don't usually talk about. We went did some dumb shit and it was bonding. Now, these are these types of things can be bonding. But they can also destroy the relationship, right? So especially if people get addicted to things, especially if the taking of drugs and booze becomes the thing that you always do together. If it starts defining the relationship, then, yeah, it can be extremely bad for it. However, taking like MD with someone once at a festival at the right time and then having a really intense connection with that person or group over that night. Those are things that can sometimes really hold people together for long periods of time, because you the nature of some of those drugs is you just drop your filters and you get through and you communicate faster and harder. Yes, it's the drug making you do it. So it's not like ideal, but for some people and for me at certain points, that was the way that I could communicate. And I had a really deep night with someone, a lover or friend or whatever. And then after that, you know, we were tight or we've gone into the jungle. Don't know what's good together. That's extremely bonding because we've gone through some shit. What else? Sharing secrets, insecurities and heartbreak. So actually revealing things. We need to be careful because that can be used against us. But as we trust someone, revealing more means people reveal more and bonds us bailing each other out. Inevitably, someone fucks up. Someone gets arrested. Someone did a stupid business deal. Someone organized four dates on the same night and they're all coming now. All right. And and I need help. So here you need to think about your ethics. Like, do you want to bail someone out of something that you would never do yourself and you think they really shouldn't have done? OK, that's a line. That's the Epstein line or whatever you need to decide. OK, should I back this person up? Look, if it's someone if someone got a parking fine, like I've had many times when an ex-employee wrote to me and said, Hey, can you write me a letter that says I was a good employee and something, something? And I'm like, just write it and I'll sign it because I'm like, isn't that hilarious? I get to be the guy that says this guy is a guy you should trust as an upstanding, upstanding member of society. Right. And so I'm bailing him out of the fact he doesn't have a good resume. Cost me fuck all. I'm like, yeah, sure. I'll say, yeah, he was good at all the shit. And signed by James, CEO of the company Corporation. Off you go. Yeah, I'm bail people out of things so many times. They fucked out in money in some way. Yeah, they just overstretch themselves or whatever. And sometimes I say no, too, because it's like, OK, that you made that decision. I can't bail you out of that one. You're just going to have to wear it. Right. So but that that is also a bonding thing. Bailing each other out, knowing you've got each other's back in the hard times or the times where you made it hard and then pulling off a great event, pulling off a party, a picnic, a fucking, you know, conference, a trade, a business, a business launch. Right. We pull something off where you both had to work and invest and then you fucking win super bonding experience. Right. So and they need to be bonded. Your your tribes must be bonded by more than just utility. Otherwise, they're just a team that's together to get a result and nothing else.
