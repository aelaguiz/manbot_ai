And that may just be because he's new. All right, so how do you recommend handling being behind in Korea in relation to feeling extreme imposter syndrome? So that's a new thing that I heard of recently. But yeah, okay. So feeling like you're an imposter in some kind of way. When you try to step further up the ladder after having sat on it, which I did in my twenties, it's particularly exasperating in some ways. Now, as I know, my ex has been seeing really career successful guys after our breakup and my own career feels shameful by comparison. Okay. And feeling like even in relation to this course where there's guys with highly paid or skilled jobs. All right. Well, the problem here, like we're dealing with two things. One is the actuality or the reality of the world in the sense that the world that we live in has been built into extreme hierarchies. And it's not a natural phenomena. It's a result of centuries and eons actually of a types of alignment of humans that have been built by empires and built from a top top down hierarchies. And then those are in since the Industrial Revolution and splintered out into thousands and thousands or hundreds of thousands or millions even of smaller hierarchies that everyone is jostled into and then finds themselves in and then feels they need to fight their way up as far to the top as they can. And how far up they go then defines how they feel about themselves and how the world feels about them. So, there's an interface here between a subjective reality and objective reality in the sense that, okay, it's real, right? The hierarchies exist and it's real that some women within certain hierarchies will definitely be specifically attracted to or hunting the guys that are further up the ladder. And so, it's a real thing but it's not a universal thing. And I think the important point to look at here is, well, yeah, as a man it doesn't matter what you do in your life. And I've been researching a bit of red pill stuff lately, not for my own personal consumption but just for some research for videos I want to make. And there's a guy, Entrepreneurs in Cars, I guess some of you may have seen him. And like I agree with some of what he says. There's definitely truth in what he says and often what he's looking at is that this idea that women don't care about your struggle or your growth, they care about where you go, where you are at the end. Like they wait for you at the finish line is the statement that he says. And that is true to some extent in the sense that women are not particularly interested in how hard you have to work and the things that you need to do or have done in order to further your career or further your life. They do tend to look at the outcomes. But the mistake here I think is to think that the outcomes are all material and they're all career-based. Yes, if you are a subjective loser and by that I mean not a person who is a loser or a person who is not valuable but in the eyes of society and the proof is in what's been happening in your life that you have not been, that you've been lazy or you've fallen off the horse. And it's not like necessarily your fault. It could be that the economy just tanked because of a virus or various other things. But the reality is that yes, women are fairly merciless once you get past a certain age. So in your teens and 20s and even 30s a bit, if you're dating young women, they're much more interested in how you're living than what is your livelihood. So they want to have fun, they want to have good sex, they want to have adventures, they want guys that are cool, that are interesting in the sense that they find them interesting. So it doesn't mean... I know lots of very interesting people and girls are not that into them because the girls are not interested in that thing. But that they find them fascinating in some way. And so many of the pickup artists or good guys that were excellent seducers that I've known and still know of never got their shit together financially. Like I still know a bunch. They never figured it out. They were always just hustling from one scam to next thing and they never really figured that out. But they still get girls because they're still triggering the most important aspects of what she really cares about. So I guess what I'm trying to say here is that yes, it is important to maneuver through the planet and to be effective in your maneuvering. And I think that's much more important than thinking of it as like my job and my net worth. Net worth matters to the point where can you put a roof over your head? Can you pay for basic things that a woman needs to be involved in, right? So going to eating things and drinking things and going into a apartment or house which is warm and has a bed and like not needing to count every single penny. Although I lived like that early on anyway and I and I still did fine. But certainly as you get older that becomes an issue. So yes, you need to be a winner in the sense that you need to have won the human survival race which from throughout most of history meant simply eating, keeping a roof over your head, keeping warm and fighting off things that were trying to attack you, right? So it was a simpler thing. The hierarchies were far less intense. Sure, there may have been a better hunter or a much more, I don't know, much more attractive guy in the tribe or a chief or something who'd got the admiration of other people. But everyone was, you know, like the idea of chasing your goals or your dreams or conquering the world or building an empire or making a dent in the universe or whatever, that was irrelevant. It was just like survive, be able to work within a community and you'll probably get laid, right? So these hierarchies that are overlaid on top of our natural states are not natural. They're products of modern societies. So they exist but they're not rigid and I myself and many students have proven that that you can be of a normal survival level in terms of your resources and you can have women very interested in you. And sure, sometimes a girl will monkey branch to a guy that is more successful but usually if he's going to leave and she's going to leave and move on to another guy, it's going to be a guy that makes her feel more, that she has better sex with, that she feels more emotionally connected to, that doesn't put up with her shit and isn't walked all over, that he's able to stand up for himself. And that's why recently when I moved into an environment where the men around me were worth at least a hundred if not several hundred times more than I am and the girls knew it, it didn't help them. It didn't help them at all. I was the alpha male because I was the one with the more important resources which was the ability to make the girls feel attracted and feel turned on and to see that I could handle them, that they couldn't run rings around me, that I knew their games, that I knew how to settle them down and to put them in their place and also to make them feel amazing. So it's a really dangerous thing to compare yourself to anyone and we all do it, right? Like I find myself doing it from time to time. Especially, you know, other guys in my industry who made a lot more money or I don't know, when I see someone, you know, getting a hotter girl or something, it's like human envy is a thing that is part of us but you've got to be really careful with it and going, oh okay, just because she, like it's not mathematical, it's not like, well because she, my ex-girlfriend is now with a guy who has more money than me, that means I'm worth less than him because we're not together anymore, that's not really logical actually. Like it's pretty rare for a woman to go, all right, fuck you, see you later buddy, I'm going with this guy because he's worth three times more than you. She's going to leave or move on to another guy because she feels more intensely for that guy and that may just be because he's new. Like all of my ex-girlfriends have been with other men after me and I don't like that idea so much for some of them but they have been and will be for the rest of their lives because we're not going to get back together. So does that mean I'm worse than the next guy that she, like I'm inferior to him because and if I try and find him, which I won't, and try and figure out what he does, which I won't and how much he earns and then I find out, oh no, he earns 30% more than me, well that means I'm 30% more a loser. No, it's like we had our time, we were in love, we went through all the emotions and then at some point, like with my ex-wife, she moved very quickly on to another guy after me and it was like, yeah, I went through those thoughts that he was a DJ and so he was cooler and stuff and yeah, okay, it was part of that she wanted to be part of that scene but it was also just that we'd run the course. We'd fallen in love, gone through the relationship, had heaps of dramas, fucking fought like cats and dogs or pheasants and my boot as another way to put it. It's a special eight-step process you have to go through. I'm trying to feed you, you prick. And then we fell out, she fell out of love with me and then she left and then she doesn't feel those feelings for me anymore so another, a new person comes along and she starts a new thing and she's attracted to him for different variations or different reasons and then she's into that guy and is he richer or cooler or whatever? Well, fine, if he is then good for him and maybe that will give me a bit of an impetus to get my shit together if, as was the case in that relationship, I let myself go. I was acting like a loser, not because I am a loser but I was smoking too much weed and I was not focusing on my passions and I was taking the relationship for granted and expecting that just because she loved me at some point and was devoted to me that that's how it would stay which it doesn't because love and devotion from a woman is conditional and so yeah you do need to keep on your game but remember that like as I've seen with these super rich dudes recently they've been on their business game 80 hours a week for decades and they have never developed their social skills, their emotional intelligence, their spirituality, their creative sides outside of the creativity of building a business and so I'm hanging out with them. I see there's a lot of holes in them as human beings. They're good guys and those are things that they could totally fill those holes but allowing yourself to be like all right maybe you did fuck up some of your 20s and maybe you do need to hustle harder and maybe you won't get up to the top of the ladder of whatever scene you're in and okay that is going to be a reality for many people on the planet because they didn't do everything perfectly and they didn't have all the proper resources and legs up and they missed out on opportunities and we don't live forever and we don't stay young forever so okay over time you reach a certain plateau or a place where like oh okay this is as far as I will go or maybe close to in my career okay maybe I can change it maybe I can move it into something else maybe I can elevate it and maybe I can't maybe I do reach a point where I'm like oh this is it in this metric okay so does that mean I stop in all metrics and I go all right I'm a you know low skilled human? No it just means that all right well you'll have to maneuver around those particular economic realities and then become a highly skilled human in all sorts of other areas which do matter far more than the resources after that point of I can look after myself and if I'm older and I want to have a wife or kids or like have a girlfriend who is in extremely high demand and knows that she can get a lot of other resources based around her looks and intelligence and status and all that kind of stuff then yeah okay maybe you will need to you can't there'll be women where they won't perceive you as a prospect in the same way when I was out on the street the other day and one girl took one look at me and even though my game is on point and I'm fucking me she just told me you're too old okay well in that case do you want to go for tea sometime tell me why I have no ego I have no ego ah okay all right I'm not nice but I'm fascinating all right bye and there was no there was no anything I could do and for and I could say in that sense I've reached the end of what is possible with that girl and there's nothing I can do about it I can't get any younger maybe I can do some botox or something and uh it's easy to then go fuck all right that's that's over no it's over with me and that girl because her her metric of what makes a man desirable is not is not one that I can fit okay too bad I'll just need to maneuver on to the next girl that is 19 and goes oh yeah I like older guys ah it's a dangerous game the game of comparison and uh one that you're always going to lose because out there there is always going to be someone richer and hotter and better than you in some predetermined set of metrics in a rigid hierarchy I gave up personally on this game of trying to win in one snakes and ladders game long ago and moved more into the art of collaboration so that is building tribes and networks of gentlemen and ladies around the world who all work together for each other's benefit instead of trying to cut each other down to you know scramble over each other to get up to the top so coming up this Sunday the 14th of March I'm re-releasing my most popular ever online course the Lifestyle Design Academy which is designed to create for you this network this tribe of supportive brothers and sisters around the world who have your interests at heart, and very likely wanna work with you on social, seductive, career, and lifestyle-based projects.
