I want you, I'm gonna do this, I want my needs met, I'm gonna lead you, I'm gonna take you. An area of this study of intention that is often misunderstood or completely overlooked is that intent is not only about masculine active penetrative movement. It is definitely that, and that is the area that I tend to emphasize with my clients because this is the area that those men lack, the ability to go forth and do what they want, to project their desires, to state their will, to ask, to take. So this is vitally important and it tends to be the area that is most lacking in the nice guy or the guy that is waiting for life to deliver the goods to him. However, this is literally only half of the picture. Understand that if you only focus in this way, then it's very difficult for you to negotiate with other people. It's very easy to come across as arrogant, belligerent, pushy, selfish, aggressive, right? Because these are elements of, in a way they are all elements of selfishness and not that selfishness is overall a bad thing. We have to be selfish to survive, right? If I give away every single thing that I have and every piece of food that I have, I will starve. I need to at some point decide that me being alive and me having my needs met is more important to me than doing that for every other person on the planet. So effect, selfishness is the thing that has kept human beings alive as well as altruistic reciprocity, right? So we are reciprocal altruists. There's a lot of debate about whether someone can be actually purely altruistic to only care about others, probably not. But we certainly gain a lot by giving to other people, by receiving and learning from other people. We are social creatures. We've always survived by looking after each other within our in group and then slaughtering the out group across the hill. Right, but looking after our family or our tribal units, knowing our place within that, having our needs met, but also making sure the needs of others are met. This is part of the human condition. When we are completely isolated from that, we live in a cubicle, we order our food from a phone app, we have sex with robots. You know, if there's a situation where you don't need any other human being, you still, you have a deep sense of lacking of this beautiful part of being human, which is giving, receiving, taking, allowing. So it's important to understand that your intentions should not just be, you know, I'm a forceful, aggressive male and I go forth and I get what I want and that's the kind of guy I am. Right, that is still a fairly immature and like not well-rounded version of what a man can be. So for the flip side, there's a flip side to every active, taking, proactive, or penetrative action or intention. And that is the more passive elements of intent or the more receiving elements of intent. And these are really, really vital. This ties in very closely also with awareness. So if we look at this on the micro levels or the smaller levels of communication, if I make a request to a woman, I wanna ask her for a phone number, I wanna take her somewhere, I wanna take her out of this venue into a car, I wanna take her clothes off, I wanna put my cock inside her. These are the desires there. I want you, I'm gonna do this. You know, I want my needs met. You know, I'm gonna lead you, I'm gonna take you. These are all powerful and sexy elements that you must be able to do. A lot of men have a lot of shame around those. Even listening to this, some of you might be like feeling uncomfortable hearing those words. Things like I want to take you, I want to fuck you, I want something from you, please me, give me. Right, if you feel uncomfortable with those ideas, that needs to be addressed because you will never be able to be a fully formed sexual masculine male if you can't do those things. And you'll need to understand at some point or another that women respect that and like that in a man. Of course, if he only does that, then he's selfish, bushy, belligerent, maybe even dangerous. But if he doesn't do that at all, he's a wimp. He's lying that he doesn't have needs and he's only trying to please. She doesn't trust that. People trust people who have needs and try to get them met. And along the way, if they're good people, they will help other people get their needs met as well. And this is the area that we're looking at here. There's this concept of healthy relationships called the wheel of exchange. And you can look at this in terms of what is it that makes a healthy relationship? Many aspects, but one of the most powerful aspects is the ability for both partners to experience giving. Because when you experience giving, it means you get to experience abundance. If I can give somebody pleasure, it means I have an abundance of pleasure. It means that I get to experience selflessness. It means my intention gets to become more emotional and caring. And on the other side of that, in the exchange, when I give, is the opposite taking? No, the opposite is receiving. So if I allow myself to receive pleasure from somebody or service from somebody or words of love or a hug or a blow job, there's all sorts of things that I can receive. And then that gives me a sense of worthiness. It gives me a sense of being pampered, of being a god, a king. If my woman wants to give me pleasure, then I feel awesome. And this is something that a lot of men and women are not so good at. They're not good at receiving compliments or pleasure or help, right? That's something that I have struggled with over my life. I wanna be able to do everything myself. And so I'm not so good at receiving when somebody wants to give me help or assistance or advice or comfort or support. And that's something I've had to learn to have this intention that's more passive and receptive. It's just as important as being able to have the proactive, make things happen, take what you want. Taking, taking is something that I spoke about just before that a lot of men have issue with because it can be associated with abuse, with theft, with violence, with pure selfishness. However, especially in a relationship, if I don't have the intention to take, then the woman doesn't respect me really. She sees that I'm not a man who's able to get what he wants. Remembering that phrase, women love a man who knows what he wants. And then the implication is, and can get it, right? Brackets, and can get what he wants. And what is it that he wants? He wants her and he wants to conquer the world and he wants to achieve things and he wants to be a good father and he wants to protect people and he wants to look after his body. I know what I want and I have ways to go and get it and I'm gonna get it most of the time. And if I don't get it, then I'm not gonna fall into a screaming heap. I'm gonna work out how do I adjust things to then go and get what I want. That's the kind of man that has integrity and she can rely on and trust over time. That's more likely to be the kind of man she wants to get into a relationship with and stay in a relationship with, right? So you must be able to take. But at the same time, you must be able to allow, allow others to take from you, especially in a relationship. What does a woman need from me? And she will need to take it because I'm not always just going to give it. Giving is a different action. This is my choice to hand something over and then the other person gets to receive that. Whereas if I allow somebody, that's not giving. It's like somebody wants something from me and I allow them because I respect them, because I love them, because they need that, okay? And this is an interesting analogy of this or way to describe this is with a blow job. You can give a blow job, right? So the woman can give me it out of service or I can take it. You know, I can say, get on your knees and suck my dick. And now I'm taking in the sense that I'm, I'm not forcing, but I am expressing my desire in no uncertain terms. And I want to use this person in a positive way as a sexual object. What does she get to experience then? And she gets to experience allowing herself to be objectified and to be an object and a vehicle of pleasure, which is also a very validating thing. Of course, if she wants to please me, right? It's very validating because then she gets to experience being desired completely. I'm an animal and I have to take you. To have a well-rounded relationship and to be a well-rounded human being, I think you need to be able to understand that these intentions shift from very proactive, masculine, passive to very receptive. And you can even say feminine. We are not a hundred percent masculine. I have feminine aspects in me. You do too. Learning how to receive information from your senses to be able to listen, to be able to not always be pushing to get what you want, but to be able to feel the nuance of how this flow of different agendas that people have, particularly in a relationship, move, this will allow you to be far more delicate and far more artistic with the way that you navigate through the world. Gentlemen, if you'd like to learn the subtleties, the art form of giving, taking, receiving, allowing, how to be a fully functioning, holistic, masculine man, and specifically in the context of meeting and dating beautiful women, then your last chance to work with us for this year is coming up in Barcelona, Spain, for our last seven-day live seduction workshop.
