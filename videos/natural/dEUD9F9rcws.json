All right, so there's one where she's got the pain And then I insert and then it's totally shifts things. All right Um, so what i'm what you see that i'm doing here I'm going to show you a bunch of different spanks uh but If you look at in general if i'm applying my spanks Into dispersed with within this with these caresses. So this is dispersal, right, especially if I give her a decent hit All right, so then there's the the impact and then there's dispersal of the sting Especially like if I flogged and I flogged a little bit maybe a tiny bit too hard She went ah not coming off, you know rub it because that's what you do when you hurt, you know You hurt something you rub it just dispersal of the pain. Okay, and we can also add in like different types of sensations with With uh nails in between now things like nails and biting, uh to be used like spice, right? So because if I do this once That's going to be awesome But probably if I keep doing it it's going to be more it's going to get a bit of irritating or annoying And I don't do this This kind of right Spank caress and you know, I don't forget the rest of the body even if i'm focusing on the butt And so we've got these kinds of caresses in between so I want to show you how to position the lady for that so we've been Getting her to move her hips in a circle, but we want to be able to Draw them in and start to adjust them All right. So can everyone see what I did there? So what I did was I reached once and I take her hip bone And then I tilt it And I might I can even emphasize it by placing a hand on the sacrum and giving a command stick your ass out All right, so that Combine those three things together very clear what I want All right, because if I want to spank a girl and she's standing directly upright, it's not the best position for it All right. I wanted to pop it out and also that stick together yeah, now I can also do that from our This position here and I can take it and tilt the hips like so or I can take both both and tilt All right, so This this is something you need to get into the habit of being able to do All right So you're gonna play with that just for just a minute. So tucking and this is a good spanking position, right? Because I'm She's completely Held by me because if i'm spanking it out here firstly the the impact is going to move her around Uh, and it doesn't feel secure. All right, so instead I mean sometimes I might hold her like so But if I want to get the hip and tilt the hip, okay, maybe I can adjust here. Maybe i've got a headlock here Right, maybe I can even take the armlock here All right, but i've got the the hip tilted The other way to do it is from the pussy which I won't do which is where I grab just tilt like that That's hard Okay, so we're going to start from the position that we showed you before. So remembering what we did is we Popped her butt out. So i'm holding her in secure So i'm left-handed so i'll work from there so there's a whole bunch of different spanks we're going to use But first let's look at our targeting area When she's standing or let's say Kneeling, but it's more or less upright. There's a different different impact zone than if she's bent over All right, because right now the butt is loose. Whereas when she bends over on all knees, it's on her hands and knees It's getting stretched, right? So right now that the target area is around the pocket. Okay, so this is our main chunk here And then we also have underneath Right and because of because she's padded in this position I can't hit over the ischial tuberosity the bum bone All right, whereas when she's bent over I won't hit that because it's that it's exposed now i'm going to hit the bone itself Does that make sense? So standing I have a lot more margin for error. The butt is loose So it's so it's more of the spanking slappy noise Uh, it's easier to do right so we can start from there So the first thing I want you to do remember when we were practicing this morning with our floppy wrist action Is to just do this right And that is just this it's floppy in the wrist because if what makes bad spanking and if you're doing it badly It's there's no point doing it all is sorry rigidity in the hand All right. So how does that feel? I saw her face. It didn't feel good Right, so that's where you know, i'm rigid. So the impact all lands in one spot and it doesn't disperse right Uh, so no heavy like stiff in the hand and that's what I was emphasizing this morning Is I don't I don't want to push from my arm In from this position. I mainly want to use grab basically gravity, you know, because it's basically more or less going down All right, so we're going to work in here And then we can do under as well So that's remember what we're practicing this in the morning just like lifting through the fingers All right, so it's just it's that right, so For a little little spank that's really just through the wrist and the fingers this one here coming from the top That's coming from below and it's it's lifting the butt up, right The reason and and again if I stiffen my hand it doesn't get the right sound and it hurts it's not good It doesn't get the right sound and it hurts it's not good So it's this looseness and relaxed through the fingers that creates as it lands everything makes impact at once So the so the impact is dispersed across the palm and the fingers all in one go right, which creates a Pleasant sting as opposed to anything where I emphasize one part and it becomes a thudding kind of lump of wood All right, so we'll start with here So So from this position, all right, so she's a bit low so there tuck her in so she's at the right height for you And if she's happens to be no if you bend your legs, she's like that. Okay tilt her cool Position good. Okay. So here same thing. We're working cheeks here So i'm just getting It's much more important to get the form right than to get force And like even with this floppy force I can still like if I just create more Uh height then it's going to increase the impact anyway, but you see there's no pushing through the arm. There's no physical force It's just floppy like that All right, so a couple of variations I want to show you this one's cool so what this is is spank grab All right, so it works Feel good So the feeling that this has is the butt leg is shocked in and then as it's bouncing back it's helped All right, so it's a really powerfully dominant one. So if i'm here getting some warm-up spanks Sorry So it's spank and then I just cup up like that Okay, so we got that one Next what you're going to do is get a girl to sit on your So All right, so watch how I would put her in this position Like that Okay, so this is good because her butt is tilted up And she's comfortable she can like, you know, if you've got a pillow there, which is nice Then she can just lie there and I can spank from here And lying flat is the the easiest position and there's no tension at all. So So from here you get this Now one thing to add is we can do this grasp. So we'll take a chunk of the butt And put it under tension And for more advanced what i'm doing is i'm going spank release We'll get there but right so so it's here i'm grasping and grip So I got my normal spanks Don't forget your sensual touches because like spanking can be really boring if I just go All right, it's got to have some feel to it So it's like and this is awesome, right? Because i've got I can touch everywhere on her body You know, I can put I can hold her by the throat or by the neck here You know, I can come down kiss her whisper things to her grasping Put under tension there Breathe in breathe in Breathe in deep Okay, so sometimes when i'm doing a harder stroke which I won't get you guys to do now because you're not getting they're not relaxed enough for it, but it's Breathe in And Disperse Okay, and then the other one I want to show you from this position is the cobra sting so This one I don't use very often. This is an accent All right. So this is something i'll occasionally do and this as opposed to this which is a thud pain So dispersal pain this I'll just do one see how you like it Okay different feeling yeah, I like it Okay, cool, so this is essentially i'm whipping and I land with the fingertips All right, so it comes in And it's actually going rebound off like the the impact is on the reverse It's more advanced, but you try it out and see how you go with it. So that's one that I would do occasionally To you know add like a sting moment or a like a intense moment to it So Sting yeah, so it wouldn't be good if I had 10 of those, right? Yeah. Okay, but two is good. Yeah. Okay, cool So you see it's like it's intense. So it's not something i'm doing a lot of but do that from time to time. It's awesome Cool, you can also spank on the top of the thigh Uh, which is good to do But I do that with less pressure than I do on the butt because it's less padding There's less fat here than there is here. So it would sting more so I can just do these, you know little bits of Thigh work here as well And sting and then disperse Okay, so you wanted me to show you how I got her in this position again. Okay, can you hop up? All right, so it's literally this Okay And then if she's off there, I'll you know readjust her or wherever I need to And it should be so that both of us are comfortable. We could stay here for ages. How long is a spanking session? Sometimes spanking lasts a while Yeah, because like it's not just spanking. It's ass washing is really what we're doing All right, because I can do all this, you know, I mean later i'll be spreading and rubbing your pussy mixing in with it And so it's not necessarily just i'm just spanking the butt it's like okay cool I'm focusing on in on her pelvis on her vagina on on her butt uh for this session and you know like with dominance with massage You know, we're going to be having a daddy-daughter role play here, you know, did you do your homework today?
