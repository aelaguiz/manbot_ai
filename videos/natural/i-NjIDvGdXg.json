We put in so much effort and work into understanding female psychology and approaching and the mechanics of seduction and how to project intent and all of this stuff that you guys are studying and then if you are shitty in bed or selfish or just ignorant in bed and you only last a few minutes, which is the unfortunate reality, is that most men last somewhere between three to five minutes in bed. If you do that then a girl doesn't want to come back. Why would she bother coming back to experience below average or shitty sex? The good news is it's not that hard to be better than that. If most girls are used to having five minute experiences and understand this, for a woman to be properly satisfied she needs minimum half an hour of foreplay and penetration, if not hours. That doesn't mean hours of hammering away like a porn star. That's another misconception we're taught about what good sex is, based on watching pornography, is that it means slamming away at a girl relentlessly for forty minutes to an hour. That's not comfortable for most women. Most women who are in porn, they're actresses acting. They don't want huge horse cocks hammering away at them for an hour. Their internal organs are delicate. Their sexual response is more complicated and subtle than that. Obviously porn is developed for male fantasies and so that's what we're taught subconsciously or that's what we're led to believe is good sex. So it's not that you need to do that, but you do need to be able to control your arousal state, to be able to last much longer than 5-10 minutes and eventually to get into the position where you can last as long as you want. And the way that you do that is by implementing some of the meditation tools that I've already taught you."}
