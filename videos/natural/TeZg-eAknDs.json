I went on a date with her, we went to the beach, we had sex in the water, we went home and we had sex in my apartment as well. Gentlemen, from today until the end of the 15th of February I'm offering some amazing discounts on our four most iconic online programs for our Valentine's Day sale. So you can take advantage of this and save up to 35% off the marked price of these programs. All you need to do is click the link below, go to the sales page, check it out, take advantage of these sales while you can. And now back to the video. This is an interesting one. We were actually already done filming, so the cameras were off, but then I saw this beautiful, beautiful girl and I approached her. She was sitting by herself. I first established how is her situation? Is she waiting alone? So I'm asking her, Hey, are you waiting for someone? She's like, no, I'm by myself. And I'm asking one or two other questions and I'm sitting down next to her. And then I'm actually pausing again a lot and I'm really giving her space. And then when the camera cuts in, we talked about traveling, how she's traveling alone, which is obviously a present, a gift of the universe to find a beautiful, sexy Russian girl sitting by herself while she's traveling alone, bored. So the most interesting fact about this interaction is that I actually had sex with that girl on the same day. I went on a date with her. We went to the beach. We had sex in the water. We went home and we had sex in my apartment as well. So with that in mind, pay really close attention because if you just look at this, just a chill look at the video, you might think this is just two strangers talking a little bit about Russian, a little bit about music and cinema. And then I'm getting her number and then I'm walking off, which in a way is true, but there are subtle things in there that make it flirtatious, that put a little bit pressure on her and that show her especially that I'm able to take the next step to then be the guy who kisses her, to then be the guy who takes her home. And that's what she needs to know in those moments. It's a little crazy, but is it also the first time you travel alone? I'm here for three or four weeks working. I film and I do marketing. So I'm actually here for work, but I love South Sudan for its vibe. Just like street musicians like this one and the sound and the music. Not like cold Russia. Russia is too much hot, too much summer, some regions of Russia. I want to learn Russian. I met a girl last week and she said she's from Siberia. She was born there. Oh, really? And then she told me, yeah, sometimes it gets 40 degrees and I'm like, really? Because you're right, it's a stereotype. Like people think, oh, it must be so cold and you're all wearing like, I don't know, crazy big clothes. I didn't know. What's interesting about Siberia? Well, very much like my country, it's a beautiful country for nature and for its people. The nature girl. How old are you? I'm 21. What do you think? I love you, Masha. Hi. I need to learn Russian because I meet very many interesting people lately and many of them can communicate way better in Russian because they're Russian or Ukrainian. I can be your coach if you want. Yes. When is first lesson? You should say to me, hi. You know that. I know that. How are you? Yeah, how are you? Oh, that's all I know. And I know one bad word, but I won't tell you. My name is Alex. My name is Daria. My name is Alex. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you is... We have to write it down. Do you want to be a teacher? Where are you from? I don't know. I arrived to Barcelona from Milan. You do Eurotrip? Yeah. After Barcelona, I come to Rome. And after Rome, I come to Seoul. You're so cute. I really want you guys to pay attention to three main things. The first is my body language. And how I'm sometimes moving to her by looking at her. And how I'm moving away. When do I put a lot of eye contact? When do I not? What is the longest eye contact that I give her? How do I smile at her? So, what is my body basically doing and why? You kind of should answer it for yourself. Does it start really subtle and then it gets more? Or do I really push it from the beginning? Am I super serious? Or do I smile a lot? Why would I smile? It's all questions that maybe don't even have one answer. There might be many reasons in there. And it just happened in the moment. And it's not like a perfect interaction. But it's still very interesting to look out for it. So that's the first thing. My body language, my eyes, my smile. Then another thing is how do I physically escalate? And in this interaction I almost don't. But I do a little bit. I find good excuses to touch her. So look out for it. And then the last thing is really feel into the principle of pressure and release. It's a very important principle that we teach at The Natural Lifestyles. How do I build pressure and release it? How do I look at her and then smile? How do I use my words and pausing? Do I sometimes spend a lot of time not talking and then saying something? Or do I constantly interrupt her? Do I leave her space? Do I look at her maybe when there's not even a reason to look at her? Just to admire her? And how do I communicate those feelings to her? There's one interesting moment when she's talking about something and then I'm just staring at her and I'm just like, you're so cute. I'm totally not even listening. I'm just showing her how much she amazes me. How much I'm into her. And a girl needs to feel that. That's a really important point. When you walk up to a girl she needs to have the feeling of, wow, this guy was just walking down the street and me as the girl I was just walking down. But then he saw me and he was so amazed that he had to come up to talk to me and to introduce himself. She should not get the feeling of, oh, this guy is on a mission of talking to 10, 20 girls in one day and he's saying the same thing to everyone. So I think I'm doing a really good job at this with all my approaches that I'm really giving the girl the feeling that I am there with them and that I'm nervous myself. This is special for me as well. And that's why they really believe me. That's why they feel charmed and attracted to me. When do you leave Barcelona? Umm... I think it's... I think it's... I think it's... I think it's... I think it's... I think it's... I think it's... I think it's... I think it's... Is here. Is here. In how long? I have a WhatsApp and Instagram. Today I'm busy. But I would love to get a real Russian lesson. And get to know you tomorrow. Tomorrow? Today you are busy? Tomorrow I can. Maybe after... After 6? In the afternoon? After 6. I go to the beach and then I can give you some lessons. Maybe we go beach together. I want to do two things. Go to the beach, because I did not go yet. I need to go to a very light beach and seaside. Do you see my sign? Here I am. Wow, you are so thin. My arm looks like a piece of wood next to your beautiful... What was I saying? Either beach or I also want to go to the Picasso Museum. So you can choose. I want to go to the museum and meet you. Because I'm arriving to Rome on the 11th of July. So we have tomorrow... We only have tomorrow. I have to make the best of it. Give me your WhatsApp. It's a Russian number. 7 am. I forgot. I was so... Heidi, right? It's okay. It's okay or wrong? You can do this or this. Whatever you like. Like this or like this. It's okay. I like this. Do you know this composer? Is he German? Yes. It's Italian? Yes. It's a song. Ludovico. I got to know him in this movie. The Best Friends movie. One plus one? I don't know how it was. I only know the German title. It was the guy in the wheelchair and the black guy. Yes, I know this movie. That's when I heard the song. I didn't watch the movie before. I know it's a German movie. Do you mean he works for a lot of money? It's all in my English. That's why I want to learn Russian. No, because I haven't been practicing Russian. Do you play piano? I'm a dancer. What kind of dance? Like a ballerina. Contemporary dance. What kind of a job do you have here in Barcelona? I do film. I create videos for YouTube. Really? We have this little start-up. Personal development. Filming and marketing behind it. It's a big creative but it's also business. I also do photography but more for myself. I'm not earning money with it. But I really like it. Basically, I always say... I do every job that I pay for. I'm like the bitch for everything. If you ask me, Alex, can you do this and that? I do it. I don't know how but I will do it. I prefer art jobs. But I'm studying university and I have a job right now, so... What do you study in university? I'm studying for Moscow State University in the philosophy department. Do you like it? Yeah, it's very interesting. It's great. So you're not business orientated or you don't feel like, oh, I need to make so much money, but you're like, I do what I'm interested in, and the rest will just happen. I think that if you like the job, if you like the work, you can get so much money. I understand everything you're saying. I totally understand. Yes, you're very right. If you like what you do, you will have success. Is it mango? Yeah. Let's go to the beach. Eat fish. Fish is amazing. The sea is amazing. I'm hungry. Well, I think I need to go. I need to be somewhere in 10 minutes. It's very cute chatting club. Me too. It's nice to meet you. So I have your WhatsApp. You said WhatsApp, right? I just texted you. I wrote it like this. You look older in this picture. You look like a business woman. You look like a surfer girl. You have both personalities. It's just a picture. Hi. Be safe. There are a lot of pickpocketers here in Barcelona. Keep your bag close to your hand. Because it's your first time here. Do you know what pickpocketers mean? Yes. They are the best in Europe here in Barcelona. They are experts. I heard about it on the internet. From my sister and my friend. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. See you tomorrow. Bye bye. Beautiful. Really good vibes. We really like each other. That hug in the end was not just a quick hug. It was like me stroking her back slowly. I was really feeling that something will happen. That we are in tune. That we are on the same wavelength. It's a very simple example. But I think it's very beautiful that this is how it can happen. All I did was be aware. There's a girl sitting by herself. I had the courage to walk up. I was calibrated. I was not afraid to tell her she's beautiful. I was not afraid to show how she affects me. I was not afraid to touch her a little bit. Even touch her in a more sensual way. Not just friendly. I didn't shake her hand in the end. I didn't do a quick hug. I was pressing her into me. Letting her feel my weight. And slowly finishing it off. It's a cool simple example. What's up gentlemen? I hope you enjoyed that video. As I mentioned at the beginning. From right now.
