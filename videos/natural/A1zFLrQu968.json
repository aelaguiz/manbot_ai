Steven says, nice to meet you, Virag. I'd like to ask, even if my partners love me as friends, even near the end of the relationship, they tend to become totally turned off by me after a while, even if the sex is initially good. I've been told that often my passivity or lack of confidence causes this, it becomes less and less desirable to sleep with me, even when women wanna spend all their time around me as best friends. So I guess it's a friend zone question, how could I better avoid this or navigate this? What are some of the worst habits you've seen from men that result in turning women off sexually over time? Sorry if it's a bit incoherent. No, that's pretty coherent. And don't say sorry for anything, like this is your personal question and opinion, so you totally have the right, and this is the perfect place to ask anything. Let's say that usually the being too nice and what we call the nice guy syndrome is the main, I think, not problem, but like the main cause of getting into the friend zone. And how we can change that? Well, we play with challenging, putting pressure on the girl, even when you are in a relationship that doesn't change on the game. This is where people mistake, I think, the biggest that they think that they already have someone and then it's done. Like, fuck no, you still have the game. You still have to do the same things to make it interesting, exciting. It's just a kind of, you have a bond, but that doesn't change on that she's a woman, you are a man and you have something great connection. For your question specifically, maybe you can, for example, start and find some interesting things on internet and start digging in how to make sex more like fun and try maybe new toys, try that kind of areas in sex, but maybe you can just, for example, seeing porn. Why not to live it? Why not try it out with your partner? Let's see first if she's open to it and just start on like a lower level of stuff, don't show up with a big black dildo like that and I'm gonna put this in your ass now and it's gonna be interesting and fun. So let's make it like a cute, sexy way, but bringing into toys maybe. There are so many forms, like for example, dressing up, doing role plays. And also I like, for example, if the girl feels like she's kind of boring to the man, that you can change hair colors and you just get a new wig, a new different hairstyle or let's imagine I'm a little school girl and I like, for example, this kind of hair. You know, these things trigger the mind. Even if you are in like long-term relationship, why not play with that more often or why not trying out new things? You're not gonna be the boring guy if you bring something like that up, like take the lead, do your research, go and get the thing and just surprise your woman with something. Yeah, I mean, Virag's talking about expressions of proactivity and confidence. These things need to be continually nurtured. It's like you don't just reach a point of confidence in life, I don't believe, and then stay there. It's a fuel and it's a forward-moving energy and it's not gonna be there all the time at peaks, right? So everyone will have some kinds of crisis of confidence or you'll have dips in them, which is fine. And a relationship will survive those as long as there is some forward momentum in terms of not settling into that space and then hoping that the woman is going to just tolerate that indefinitely. And I think that can be a bit of a break of a romantic ideal that probably both men and women have, but I think maybe men have more of that. If they're getting a woman in a relationship and she loves them and she's committed to them, that she's committed to you without conditions. And that's not true. Like no relations, no relationships are unconditional. Maybe the mother and child one, and I mean, they're still kind of conditional on a lifetime of- Let's believe that it exists. Let's just say that one exists, all right? Let's say it exists. If you work on yourself a lot and self-improvement and being conscious with life and the atmosphere around you, it's possible. Sure, possible. But also we have this thing that we're, okay, a girl, like a woman in a relationship still has conditions about what she wants, what she needs from the man, right? So it's like, if he treats her awfully or he is neglectful or one or other or both of them take each other for granted, which I think is typically the major umbrella reason why relationships start to crumble. One or other or both of you have taken for granted the presence of the other person and the needs that they have to be continually nurtured. Okay, we don't need to necessarily be living in the same kind of peak romance that maybe you were in the early stages of the relationship because life changes and you can move into other phases as a partnership. But there needs to be enough elements of that. And if we're not out razzle-dazzling all the time that we need to compensate that for more intimacy or more leadership. And what is it about leadership, again, that a woman wants? Because you said here about passivity and lack of confidence. Why does that turn a woman off? It's because she can't really trust the male over an extended period of time. He shows that he's not capable of handling his life, right? He's not capable of handling either the external, social, internal and interpersonal dynamics, which do require skill and effort and a level of awareness and confidence that has to be continually rebuilt and nurtured within yourself first and in conjunction with the woman that you're with. So, I mean, you've kind of answered the question in the sense that you can't just expect. And I've had this before. I've been in a relationship where I was in love, we were together, we committed to each other. And over some period of time, I let a bunch of things slip. And I wouldn't say it's all my fault. There's certainly- That's why I wanted to say that it's both sides. She has to do it. She has to do something for you as well. Absolutely. And there will be women whose tendency is not, is to take or is to be passive and just expect to receive everything. And there will be women who are very giving and there'll be women who will be triggered by the level of your giving and taking and receiving and allowing, right? Like a good wheel of exchange relationship can be triggered by one or other party or both. And then it has to be maintained and nurtured by both, right? So that the man needs to be able to take the lead. The woman needs to be able to seduce him. The man needs to be able to, and like, and these are also, these are not only gender specific things. I'm just picking some random ones out that you could probably say for both genders. You know, she needs to be able to still feel your power, your sexiness, your self-assurance, at the very least in command of her body and her emotions and her pleasure, right? Because if I lose the confidence, which again is not just some, it's not like a magic pill or some meter that I've lost for some abstract reason. It goes up and down depending on what resources I rally internally and how I direct them at her. Am I emphasizing and hearing about the need to remain powerful in her mind? It doesn't mean flawless. It doesn't mean without vulnerability. But if we start to turn her into more some kind of friend or mother figure by our actions, even if you don't want to do that, right? Even if you're like, I want to have my woman want me and fucking go crazy and dress up and do all that fun stuff. She can't really respond to that until she feels that this is where your internal state is coming from. That you do want to still ravage her and please her and be pleased by her and show her over and over again that you are her man and that she is your woman. That's gonna lead longer term to holding things together for sure. So basically don't get lazy in the relationship. Like do it as you did before. You seduce, keep seducing her. Hopefully she will do the same and then it can work out and it's not gonna be boring. Like it can work for a long time probably like that. God damn it's hot today. How you doing gentlemen? James Marshall checking in from Portugal, just about to head to Kiev to run our final workshop there for the year, which is the 10 day Euro tour from the 1st until the 12th of September. We got two spots left. So if you'd like to learn how to keep the fire alive, or let's say to start the fire first, meeting, dating, seducing amazing women and then being able to project the right type of masculinity, power, self-assurance that means that once you find the lady of your dreams, you can keep her and you should join us. Full details below. Come join us in Kiev. It's gonna be fucking epic. 1st to the 12th of September and I'll see you in the next video. Peace."}
