So let's dive in and start talking about this powerful secret of inner game mastery that I'm talking about today, which is actually physiology. Because the truth is, you are one being. You are whole, you are complete, and that includes your physical, your mental, your emotional, and your energetic being. So we need to work out how to bring all that together. And not only that, we want to bring that together with the intention of being able to interact interpersonally in the world. You can, if you choose, relax. You can, if you choose, start to feel good, to feel better. And that's a very powerful thing. It will relax your body. And if you do it well, you start to feel good, positive, healthy, happy, light, playful, friendly vibrations inside your body. And how much is that going to help you when you put yourself in front of a stranger? How much is that going to help you when you see that pretty girl and you're like, I wish I could go and talk to her. And then you feel a lot of love. You feel present. You feel relaxed. And guess what that presupposes to yourself as well as to her? It presupposes that you're okay. It presupposes that you've got good energy. You've got something to give. And that will be transmitted and translated through your physiology. It will be transmitted and translated through your body language, through your micro communications, your eyes, your smile, even the feelings. Because if you pay attention, you can actually read people and people are reading each other all the time. You know, when somebody's happy, you know, when somebody's sad, you know, when somebody's angry, you know, when somebody's playful, because we've been doing this since we've been babies. We've been doing this forever. It's a big part of what we are as humans. We're reading each other. We're social mammals. We're part of a social world. And our nervous system is reading these cues all the time. So it starts to become somebody that is putting out positive cues, that is putting out relaxed cues, that is being in alignment with what it means to be a happy, healthy, friendly, curious, social version of yourself. Now, I understand this is not always easy because I mean, I spend a lot of hours telling guys this stuff and we do a lot of practices and things. And oftentimes what happens is that they get focused back onto the fixation of the outcome. They get focused back onto the fixation of the technical side of things. Ah, she doesn't like me. I'm not getting numbers. I'm not getting dates. It's not sticking. It's not working. Yeah. Okay. That's part of the process of becoming more technically competent. It's part of the process of playing the numbers game of this social casino that you're part of. And you can't guarantee anything. You've got to go in, have the experience and see what happens. But yet again, the one thing that I want to draw your attention to is you can chill out. You can manage your physiology well. You can start to take care of yourself, which for a lot of people is very, very important. Especially if you come from a past where you experienced trauma or difficulty or suffering or depression or pain or isolation or doubt or insecurity. Because if you've come from those places, your nervous system has become conditioned to feeling lack, to feeling fear, to feeling insecure, to feeling a feeling as if there is a threat, to feeling a feeling as if there's something wrong. And maybe there was something wrong in your past. Maybe there was a threat in your past, but hopefully, and I'm wishing this, that you don't have that in your life right now. And if that's the case, well, it's time to come out of that threat mentality. It's time to come out of that fear mentality. This is also important because if you're coming from fear mentality, lack, insecurity, tension, stress, fear inside of your body, that can telegraph to people around you. People feel it in you. People read it in you. People sense that there's something wrong. People sense that you're insecure. People sense that you don't have confidence. People sense that you've been traumatized. Sometimes that's okay. You know, a lot of people are mostly friendly. I mean, we don't tend to judge people based on this, but it's not attractive. And if you want to be the kind of guy that can walk up to a woman and have an emotional impact, to make her feel alive as a woman, to make her feel turned on like really instantly, to make her feel compelled to give you attention because you're a strong, confident, powerful man in his body, embodied in his positivity, embodied in his confidence, embodied in his vision of himself, embodied in his strength to be able to take her on a mission. If you want to be that kind of guy, we've got to learn to let go of that stuff, that stress, that tension. And that's partly practice. Breathing, relaxing, doing the kinds of activities that I teach guys in workshops. Transcribed by https://otter.ai"}
