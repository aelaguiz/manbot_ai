Right now, I'm on day four of teaching a seven-day full-time residential here in Budapest, Hungary. Lovely spring morning. Before I get to class, I want to share with you guys a video which was of a rant I gave to the students yesterday morning. Now, one of the guys was talking to me about his concerns in terms of approaching women cold on the street and he really had this sense that he was bothering girls, that somehow what he was doing was wrong. And so, I launched into a great big rant about what you're doing when you're approaching girls is actually fucking awesome not just for you but for her. And this talk went off into a whole lot of different directions in terms of what it is that is truly going to make you happy in life. And for all of you overachievers out there who really think that it's money and career and success, of course, those things are important. They make a difference in your life. But truly, your happiness is dependent on your relationships and being able to choose the right type of healthy relationships in your life. And therefore, when you go out and approach girls, what you're doing is actually giving an amazing gift to the world, the opportunity for a woman to connect with you who is awesome. Now, before we get into that video, very important couple of points. My launch of my book, A Natural History as well as all of the bonus course material that goes along with it is closing and going off the market in less than 48 hours. So, if you want to have access to my book as well as the completely new and exclusive material around the six phases of the seducer cycle that is the long-term action plan for your seductive success as well as well over five hours of chapter breakdowns where I sit down and break down all of the major elements of the seductions that are in my book plus a whole lot of other crazy bonuses, then now is your last chance. If you want to get all of this, click the link below and you'll be taken to a page with all the information. Now, I've also been receiving a whole lot of messages and comments on YouTube from guys saying, James, I just want to read the book. I don't want all that other extra awesome stuff. If that's the position that you're in, don't worry. I will be releasing the book by itself through Amazon and on Kindle so there will be a physical copy of it so you can put it on your bookshelf. I'm gonna have a whole row of them. Hide it under your bed away from your girlfriend. But that's not gonna happen for a few months because it takes a whole bunch of time and focus for me to be able to sort out the legal aspects, the formatting, the publishing. I simply do not have time right now because I'm running an intensive seduction course and then I'm running another one straight after this. So within the next couple of months, yes, there will be a standalone copy of the book. Until then, it's only available for the next 48 hours through the course. So that's all for me. I gotta go off to work. Enjoy the video, guys. This is a really important one and I'll see you guys next time. There's something about you. There's something about you. There's something about you. There's something about you. Often when people start this, even if they're not consciously thinking it, they feel like at some level what they're doing is wrong. Yeah, come and sit in wherever you can get in there. That they're trying to take something, that it's breaking social norms in a way that's immoral, that you're bothering the girl, that you're wasting her time, that you're annoying her, all that stuff. You guys have felt something like that at some point, right? Yep. Yep. You gotta think about it. Seriously. Most people's lives are pretty just routine. Most people, unless they are deeply in love and have the most satisfying career and are in perfect health and their family life is awesome, which is not most people, are living in various levels of dissatisfaction and boredom. Most girls that are walking around, unless they are the chicks that have me or him or some amazing thing in their life, are bored, lonely, horny. Bored, lonely, horny. Yeah. And they may be just two of those things or one of those things, but often they're a combination of those things. In the same way that you guys are when you're not living your truth, when you're not living the life that we are building the skills to live for the rest of your fucking lives in this week. So when you go up to a girl, for the most part, you're giving her at least the opportunity to have something that's more interesting than a normal day. Because most girls are not going off to live a Charlie's Angels kind of lifestyle right now. They're going to university. They're going to that job, which they hate or is okay, or they really like, but it has a lot of stress involved in it. You know, they're just going to normal lives. Even if they're disgustingly beautiful, they still mostly have to go and live normal lives. Even if they have a super rich boyfriend and they, you know, there's like all these levels of where people are just dissatisfied and bored with their lives. You going up and doing something that's totally out of the ordinary, breaking them out of their little trance of, okay, another day. Suddenly this man comes up and delivers a sincere compliment delivered from where? Last night. Well, delivered from an intention of a, because I have to, because James told me to. B, because I think that's the thing you have to do to get laid. C, something else. Yeah. Why? Sexual attraction. What else? Other reasons we want to, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Why? What's the point of that? What's the point of that? Right. That's what life is fucking about. Life is about relationships. At the end of the day, the vast majority of your happiness or not happiness is not dependent on how much money you have and how cool your car is. I've never had a car, but if I had a cool car, maybe I'd feel like that much cooler. Probably not. It's about the people that you have in your life and the relationships that you have with them. And anyone who's been in a toxic relationship and has experienced what that's like, I have, you know, many of you guys have know that, uh, that no matter what's going on in the rest of your life means that you're miserable. Yeah. So, and when you have people that you really connect with, people that you really feel listened to and by and for and with, when you have that in your life, then you feel fucking happy. When I look back at the happiest moments of my life, many of them were when I was at my most broke at my most, not having a clue about what the fuck I was doing with my life, but I had these golden connections and right now I'm living that as well. I'm living with the most awesome dudes in the planet. I have a fucking amazing girlfriend and the fact that now I have some money and stuff is useful, good, means that I can just travel and do the shit that I want to do, but that's not, that's not what's making me happy. And I work with very rich guys. I've worked with billionaires, multimillionaires, uh, who are fucking miserable, miserable people. And I've also worked with people who are broke, who are miserable, miserable people. It's not because they have money that they're miserable because they don't have the connections. You guys are going out today to give people the chance to connect. You're giving yourself and that girl the chance to connect. She can choose to not accept that offer and many times they won't because, you know, the main reason why women don't accept that offer is fear. Yeah, it's totally true. It's insidious. The fear of being alone keeps people in relationships for much, much longer than they should be in them. I've done it, luckily not for too much, too long, maybe in a year extra than I should have. Um, you know, people do it for many years longer than they should. And okay, you know, that's part of, part of learning as you go through these cycles. That's the product that I just released is all about that. It's just looking at these six phases that you, that you will go through in your life, which we can talk about not now, but I guess another time. Remind me to talk about six phases at some point. It's kind of a new concept that I've been developing, uh, in the last three months really. But looking at that, um, overall, hang on, what was the thing I was talking about before that? Okay. People staying in shit longer than they want to be out of fear. And most of the time girls reject the offer for you to come and talk to them. Not because you're a loser piece of shit, but because she's scared of things that are, she's not used to. That's really the main thing. And, and, and we don't really understand what it's like to be a woman in terms of how you deal with men, that men are dangerous. Overall, strange men are dangerous. Men that, men that you don't know through your social circle are dangerous because you're complete unknowns. Even if you look like a nice guy, you might be a rapist. Yeah. Or you might be a guy that's going to become a stalker and obsessed with them because most girls I know have had a stalker of some sort. Not necessarily like the sitting outside the window ones, although yes, but the keeping on texting them year after year, uh, you know, rocking up at their workplaces and sort of sitting outside the front of them. Um, like hunting, trying to get into their social circles and doing, doing all this, like infiltrating into it to, to hassle them and being followed and all this stuff is, is a reality for women. Uh, not every woman, but it's very, very common. And even if they haven't experienced it, they're aware that that's out there. They know that you're not supposed to talk to strange men because it's, it's a risk. So the fact that any of these girls ever do talk to us and the fact that that girl walked off with Tom now to go and have a date with him is amazing. Has anyone ever seen that Louis CK clip where he talks about this? Like the, it's hilarious where he's, I won't try and emulate it cause like anytime you like, Hey, there's this joke, this comedian said, and then you like say it and it doesn't really hit. And you're like, but I said the same words as the comedian. Why didn't it work? Because he's a professional comedian with all the correct delivery. If it works and you say, you want to go out sometime, sometimes she'll say yes. And if she says yes, that's her courage. And the courage it takes for a woman to say yes is beyond anything I can imagine. A woman saying yes to a date with a man is literally insane and ill-advised and the whole species existence counts on them doing it. And I don't know how they, how do women still go out with guys? When you consider the fact that there is no greater threat to women than men, we're the number one threat. Essentially saying that the fact that a woman goes out with a man ever is absurd. They are literally the most dangerous thing that is possible in a woman's life and yet they still go out alone with them because they're genetically predisposed to do that. The imperative is yes, I need to take this risk in order to breed and have fun and have a dude. So our job really is to show a woman that we're not a physical threat, but also that we are a sexual prospect. And that's a fine balancing act. And that's where the nice guy tends to go on the definitely don't want to make you feel uncomfortable at all and so therefore there's no pressure, there's no sexual tension and she can't feel your masculinity as opposed to the rapey, grabby guy that's like pushy and overbearing and doesn't hear the word no, which is the dangerous side of men. So we are writing a very fine balancing act and what we're doing on the streets here is a delicate and elite art form. And the fact that we're only on day three, day three now, lose all track sense of time in these workshops, and yet you're starting to see some results in the terms of women talking to you at all. Some women have given some of your numbers and there's some dates starting to happen. It's amazing. And we're going to build from that. So be aware of that. When a girl says no, when she rejects you, usually it's like, oh, I don't know what this is. There's this foreign man, firstly, who doesn't look like Hungarian mens and he's trying to talk to me and wants to, they're telling me I'm beautiful or wants to see me again or something. Oh shit, I don't know what to do, how to deal with that. I better go. Some girls are not like that. Some girls are the fuck it, let's do it kind of girls. Those are awesome girls. There's not many of them. Like I had this girl fly in from, we had never met her. We met her online and I bought her a ticket to come and see us from Holland. And she arrived at 11 PM because of the way that the timing worked with flights. She arrived at 11 PM outside my house. She gets out and because the girls upstairs still getting ready because she just takes a long time in the bathroom. And, and so it's just me on the street at 11 PM in a foreign country. This girl rocks up and I'm like, Hey, how are you doing darling? Nice to meet you. Come upstairs, take her upstairs. And then, you know, we meet her and then we have an awesome night together. And the next morning me and her talking and we're like, she's fucking insane. And we say, what you did last night was, if I was your father, I would be slapping you like I was, and you were calling me daddy. No, this is all weird. Can you explain this please? Uh, what you did last night was totally insane. You got on a flight and flew to another country to meet complete strangers. And the guy that met you outside who said he had this hot girlfriend upstairs, didn't have a girl and you came upstairs, you're a fucking nutcase. And she's like, yeah, I know. I always live my life like that. And I get in a lot of trouble and I have the best fun too. And I'm like, I wish most girls were like you and I'm glad they're not because otherwise most of them would be dead by now. Um, so yeah, and, but girls like that follow their intuition. They often don't, they often don't find them get into really serious trouble because they're very intuitive. And she said, look, when I talked to you on Skype, I had a, I was really vibing with you guys. I felt it. To me, it felt like This is safe, this is a good thing to do. And women will follow that. And we're rocking with that on the streets. So when we come up with the intention of warmth, friendliness, openness, and you're hot, her highly advanced female intuition, which is like, ours is like, very rudimentary. It's just like, basic fear level, hungry, feel cold, male, deadly threat. That's why in that cab yesterday, with the guys that were in the cab with me yesterday, when I got in, and I was like, because I was so frazzled at the end of the day of shopping, I got in a cab that I would never get in. I know this city back to front, and I'm like, we're in a hurry. There was people getting out of the cab going in, I'm like, okay, they're Hungarians walking out, they're getting out of the cab, so I was like, alright, should be fine, get in. The moment that that guy, it was a big dude with a leather jacket, and chains around, the moment he started doing his thing, where he was like, making jokes with us, you like this, you like more, girls like shop, you shop, ha ha. And I'm like, ha ha, jokes. Oh no, I know this guy. This is the Eastern Euro thug, and he's about to take us for a ride, and I'm watching the meter just going, and I'm like, right, okay, here we go. We have a button underneath, apparently it speeds up. Right, okay, yeah, well he certainly clicked that one. The moment we walked in with like 14 bags of shopping, like, oh, we're foreigners with lots of money, and he's like, yes, jackpot. And so, you know, my intuition immediately is like, hmm, I know I can probably take this guy, but I'm going to call for backup, because this is a nasty situation, right? So that's why I texted Liam, said bring all the dudes, wait at this exact corner, so that when we get out of the car, there's eight of us, and he's not going to fuck with us, because the last thing I need right now is to have my face punched in on the day two of the workshop, and then to have to go and teach the rest of it with stitches in my face. So, you know, your intuition for men is often about violence. For women, it's where they really do have an advanced sense of intuition, and they feel in those moments, and they're vibing off your feelings. Now, don't be paranoid and think that means I need to be perfectly cool and calm and collected, otherwise she's going to go, she's a little bit nervous, that's it, I'm out of here. It's the realness, it's the feeling behind the nervousness that she's most going to vibe with. So that's why our intention, what we did last night, that class, whether you know that or whether you accept that now or not, was the most important class that we will do this entire workshop. And we will return to it again, we'll check in again on that drill, but it is the most important thing that I can teach you really, combined with the awareness. Because without the awareness, it's really hard to have enough space inside you to have an intention when there's too much intense white noise happening. But once we have a little bit of space, this locking in with what is my intention moment by moment, this is the secret of seductive success. This is my secret. This is what you came here to get. Gentlemen, James Marshall here with a very important announcement. It is done. What's done, you say? It's my book.
