Let's check it out I've talked about this many times in terms of the act of cold approach itself Like what do we get out of the squeeze of needing to learn the skill of cold approach? Which at the minimum requires you to go out and meet a hundred women? Practicing good, let's say natural style seduction techniques Responding to the reactions of the woman making adjustments calibrating learning how to shift adjust and grow within the Within the dynamic and the interactions and becoming competent at this enough that women will want to see you again Now don't quote me on exactly, you know, if you go into a hundred approaches doesn't Hundred approaches doesn't mean you're going to be a master at this But it's enough to give you a broad spread to be able to see the patterns, right? If you go and approach a hundred women Decently in the sense that you are trying to take the feedback and adjust and shift each time You will see that a very small amount of women will be Rude or extremely dismissive a very small maybe five ten percent depends on the city depends on your delivery Depends on a few variables, but not many five to ten percent will be really open and just friendly straight off the bat and that's again not much to do with your skill level so much as to do with her demeanor and then the most of the Women will be there. Maybe probably not. I'm not sure. Let's see what this is about That kind of zone cool. That's where we start to learn to work and it's understandable, right? Like it's like, okay. I'm a complete stranger woman single, but she's like complete stranger Let's see What this is I'm probably erring on the side of probably not because I don't know this guy I don't know anything about him Don't know if he's a psycho or where he fits into the social world or anything about him or what his sexual ability is or? Anything and so that's where you have to work your game the squeeze that's involved in that Is a period of depending if you come and you know do coaching with a professional coach or whether you try and work it out yourself But it's gonna take some months or a year ish of Common practice that being that you do it regularly I've talked about that many times before in other analogies go to the gym do that once Zero results or do that once a month once every three weeks. It doesn't work You won't get any gains same if you very occasionally approach a girl when you're on coke feeling great. It's your birthday She's staring at you going like this And that's the only time you approach I mean if that ever happens do approach Certainly take that opportunity, but you only ever do that you won't get any results Or if you do that will just be random luck based on that you roll the dice and you and you you got lucky that one time so it's the consistency of like yeah putting a few months to a year into this where it becomes a Focal point for you is absolutely worth it because if it means that at the end of your training period let's say you know That when you are single, which you will be multiple times in your life that you can bring a lover into your life within a couple of weeks This changes your life completely because the alternative is being the man that knows actually that not only Can he not get laid within a couple of weeks he won't he's not gonna get laid this month next month for the next six months or like that becomes that becomes a Measurable reality for you over time I've seen the results of this with you know sometimes I get clients who are virgins or extremely inexperienced even into their 30s and 40s Sometimes and it's not like they didn't live you know they had other joys in life They did things right like but there's a massive piece missing for them, and they feel unloved they feel like they're not Really the man that they could be they feel like they're missing out on something Integral and human and deep because they are again You know the occasional person they may not need this or they're so cynical about it that they're like I only you know I only interact with women When there's money involved right like so it's you know okay women are women are strange and evil or whatever we think they are Yeah, I've got the biological urge to have sex So I'll just either jerk off the porn or I'll visit a hooker from time to time to relieve the animal urge And then I'll go back to being kind of a midtown monk or something like that can that work for some people yeah? Maybe but I mean as someone who slept with a few hookers in my life It's not a it's not a nice feeling all right like you I mean if anyone who's done that You know that the person doesn't want to be with you, and it's it really is just like masturbating using somebody else's body It's it's so unfulfilling like that's in terms of like the juice that we get out of there, okay? It's a little very small squeeze and the cash, but the juice is often far more demoralizing because we are so Disassociated by the nature of that transaction. It's the you know it's built into the transaction So The you know the the whether or not it's worth the effort to be able to get a girlfriend or to be able to get on dates I would be answering that question personally not not based on some Gender wars Ideology not based on some broad sociological trends or where women men and women are going or looking at the stats It's like what about your life? Are you going to be okay? You know holding on to your your reasons your beliefs and your ideologies And that's gonna be enough to sustain you for the fact that you don't get all of these Other points of intimacy and people are telling you older men often that it's not worth it Because what you get out of a woman is he's not even it's not even good in fact. It's in fact It's negative the it's a net negative in your life So don't even bother and it's too hard and the end the game's stacked against you you can't win So give up before you've even tried and at the same time build a resentment about a About half the population and build all these ideologies around it that are not based on your own empirical research But are based on other people's attitudes. Can you see the dangers in this? It's it's robbing you of Your life's journey of love and intimacy and mistakes and heartbreak and betrayal and the giddiness of you know early love and the disappointments that can come with it and the compromises and negotiations and personal growth that you can have within a relationship and then how those things can shatter and you may have and then how you need to go afterwards to You know reassess yourself and do an autopsy on the relationship and figure out what was your part what was her part what you could do differently so that maybe next time when you go into a relationship you can be more evolved and mature and you can have a Better and more powerful relationship and so on like that's just a that's just a random sprinkling of some of the juice That you might get out of being with women in general or putting effort into being a good part The second and kind of more important part I want to talk about in today's video is is around sex You know, I've ranted enough today and many other times about the importance of approaching. But why are we doing that? It's not just sex right just the act of copulation because Okay again, yes, you could pay for that It's it's the it's sexual relationships, right? Where where sex is is a component maybe a very large component of it or like even the primary component of it But that there are other aspects to it that there is a mutual attraction that there is our respect that there is a polarity a feminine masculine dynamic Again, this is not about like strict gender roles that like the woman has to be in the kitchen and the man has to be a lumberjack Right, but it's that the dynamic between the man and the woman in their relationship has these aspects of femininity masculinity And an interplay between them, right? It's that we get to blend and play with these with these aspects that a woman's femininity may bring out some of our own vulnerability and and ability to feel and be intimate Right, my dominance and power over her may then bring her into a state of a state of a state of a state of a state of a state of state of state of And really be in her, you know, in a womanly nature, right? There's so much to that dynamic Which is rich almost magical like I mean, it's it's not magical. It's okay It's based on chemistry and biology and You know thinking Technologies and our emotions and song But they're but there are these things that we almost only get to experience within sexual dynamics. Sex is a skill set. Absolutely and becoming a good lover is I in my opinion one of the most probably of the two things that you need to learn within my realm of specialization is cold approach being good. Fuck right, like those those two things how to how to you know Start an interaction get someone meet someone that you couldn't meet otherwise And then if we get into bed with them to make sure that that is an extremely pleasurable Possibly transcendent experience for both of you and why that might might be a value, right? Because when we put up a bunch of you know Sex related videos and often they do you know, a lot of people watch them these comments come up again This seems like a lot of work right like me me demonstrating how to tie a girl up with a silk tie In reality, I mean, I look I figure that out myself with that particular thing But you know, I can teach that to someone in an hour or two You know if they come to the sex class and I rope a girl up and they practice it ten times They'll have it and that's an hour's worth of you know, study Let's say and it's not you know, it's not the only thing but it's like to add one new vibrant sexy dominant tool to your toolkit, which if you pull that out and do that on a girl I trust me on this is gonna blow her mind, right? She's she's very unlikely to have ever experienced something like that done proficiently And so suddenly you become an amazing lover because you do this particular thing now It's not just about learning one trick, you know how to tie a girl up and every girl thinks you're amazing There's a there's a there's a spread there's a toolkit here, but all of those things are absolutely worth Learning not as a simping exercise, right? Because that would be argument I guess on the other side that All of this effort to please women right all of you know Oh look how much how much work these simping soy boys put into trying to you know Make a woman feel good so that she will Grace them with the presence of her magical expensive pussy from time to time And that the man has to you know Devote himself to a lifetime of the Venetian arts in order to ever experience this several minutes of pleasure Makes a mockery of humanity the things men will do for those one and a half minutes of pleasure One and a half minutes Two minutes Whatever when a spider makes love it is for a month and a half at a time So that would be the counter argument to it and my counter to that would be well It's it's not about doing it just for the woman Do you know like it says to me these men don't know what it's like to be with a woman To be with a woman who wants you to feel amazing It works both ways I'm I know how to give erotic massage I know tantric skills I know how to do g-spot massage and squirting I know how to rope girls up I know how to spank them in nine different ways I know how to caress and touch and move their bodies in such a way as it feels like melting chocolate I've studied those things not because I want to simp to women and you know Bow down at the altar of femininity and hope that they're going to give me something in return It's for a selfish reason and a selfless reason One is I feel like a boss I feel powerful when I'm in command of a woman and it's not about domineering It's not that I don't let her do anything It's like I know what I'm doing I know how to lead this experience into something that is awesome and pleasurable for both of us And her responses to that amplify me feeling like a fucking God When you have a girl screaming your name You know like out of her mind orgasmic breathless with that look of like I can't believe I just I just experienced that Or like I have to rethink everything in my life And that's you know not because my dick is magical or not because I'm I don't know some genetic stud or something It's because I put a lot of effort into learning that and I love the effort It's fascinating for me to learn about the female body The responses that I can get and from a selfless position is like I like to see women having pleasure I like to make them feel good And if you think about that statement and you've got some glitch in there It's like I don't want to make a woman feel good What's going on behind that? Because if you didn't want to make a woman feel good It might feel like it's a zero-sum game If she feels good I feel worse If I put this effort into giving this stuff to her I'm now more in a more powerless position This is not accurate and not healthy to think that way It much more works as a feedback loop of positive You know positive reinforcement You know I go down on a girl and give her head Because I like giving head I'm good at it and I want to make her feel awesome and good Do you think there's you know Do you think there's any question about whether she's going to give me a blowjob? It's not a tit-for-tat thing But it's that I do all sorts of stuff to her and for her in the bedroom And I lead her and guide her or accept when she does those things for me I know that I get to see so much more of what the woman is capable of sexually Than the average man Because a woman is not going to necessarily put on her best show From a logical position Thinking alright I'm going to do my best moves My best blowjob And I'm going to impress this guy because of some factor It's more like if the man activates her sexually Like so many women And this has been studies on this as well Where they explain their arousal in relation to the man's desire So what I mean by that is She feels turned on and sexy and sexual As a result of being triggered by the man's desire for her So the man grabbing her and kissing her Or looking hungrily at her Or you know like eating bits of her body Like it's a meal Showing the fact that he is affected That he is attracted That he's turned on This creates this feedback loop where that ignites that in her Not all the time It's not like a law of nature But it's a very common thing for women to feel that. She feels sexy, slutty, wild, wants to give herself to the man, wants to do all sorts of naughty, nasty, experimental things when the man activates that in her, without judgment, without putting, you know, like saying things to her like, oh that's a bit weird, or you want that kind of thing, or oh that's what you're into. Anything where I shame her for wanting to express her sexuality. Same goes, you know, if a woman did that to me, shamed me for, I don't know, wanted to do something slightly kinky, I would say, well perhaps you need to go and find men over the road at the church, because I'm clearly not the guy for you, right? Like, works both ways, but it's like, if you hold that space of exploration, experimentation, non-judgment, let's be wild animals together, and let's milk as much of the juice as we can out of each other, or create this juice together, this awesome tropical mixed blended juice that we couldn't experience without each other, that's worth the fucking squeeze. And the squeeze is fun. Yeah, and like, I got good in bed partially as a result of a bunch of awkward experiences, where I came too quick, couldn't get it up, fumbled eye in the, elbow in the eye type of sex, couldn't figure out the positioning. Lots of those things happened early on, and I remember at some points, because I had a number of experiences in teenage years of not being able to get it up with my first partners, not because there was anything wrong with me, it was because I was nervous, because I didn't know what to do, I had never done it before. And I remember the feeling of like going, I'm just gonna forget sex, like it's too awkward, I don't know what to do, maybe I should just like leave it until I don't know, I'm more confident someday. And I made the conscious decision, like no, get in bed with girls and figure it out, start talking to them. Because my first, I had a number of partners, I didn't say anything to them about sex, we just got together and silently tried to figure it out, fumbling teenagers, and often it wasn't very good as a result, because I remember I had a lover fairly early on who just talked, she just said, oh what do you like? Or does that feel good? Or can you touch me in this way? I was like, oh that's a good idea, we should we should use these things, words that we've been using for 70,000 years or whatever, to communicate and starting to talk about sex and it becoming fun and silly and being able to have a laugh about it. And that even when that was awkward or I came too quickly or something didn't go well, that was an intimate bonding experience as well, because it was communicated with someone that cared about me and that was also invested in us both having a good time, not invested in shaming me or making me feel like a loser because I couldn't perform like a porn star stud or something. Most women, if you communicate to them in the bedroom, are on your side. I've heard a lot of, because you know I've talked to so many women, so many men about their sex lives, it's part of my work, part of my you know personal studies, and men and women often have horror stories about feeling ashamed or feeling like a loser or feeling unwanted sexually, primarily when people don't communicate, when it's just unspoken and the you know, let's say the guy couldn't get it up, I remember this, and he doesn't say anything and the girl thinks, well it's because I'm fat or I'm ugly or well there's something wrong with him, maybe he's gay or something and she either takes it on board herself or projects it on the guy and then there's said something like, what's the problem? Which is the worst thing you can say to a man who's having trouble getting it up, right? He's like, oh no problem, now there is a problem and this feedback loop happens and then there's an awkward experience and maybe either or both people walk away from that feeling bad about it or having an attitude about men or women about it, right? And I remember that those exact types of experiences. When I started just talking to girls and saying, hey when I'm with a new partner sometimes I feel a bit nervous and so it's, I don't get it up instantly, so can we just take it a little slowly or let's have a break or don't stress about it, it'll change. It solved the problem, right? Because then the woman was on my side, then she was like, oh okay cool, can I help or what do you need me to do, right? Because it wasn't about her being fat or me being gay or whatever, it was about this is not an easy thing necessarily for a man sometimes to get it up on command and she wants you to and she wants you to feel good and she wants you to feel turned on and so she wants to engage in and help to create that awesome juice between you two. So I guess the broad spectrum I would have been looking at here is, you know, why it is worth the effort and acknowledging that there is effort and as I talked about, you know, for a lot of women that effort came kind of as a side effect of being social. During her teens and 20s she went to, I don't know, 50 parties or a hundred events or more or less of some type where she meets five guys in a night, ten guys in a night. She's not fucking them all or making out with them all but she's engaging with them in a seductive game of some sort, right? And so she becomes good at this and then there's the male equivalent. There's the guy that was whatever, worked in a bar, played in a band, had just was kind of social, had girls around him. He too learns over time. His training period, he didn't have to go out and do his 100 approaches in a week or in a month and grind it out trying to catch up and get enough impressions that the average guy that comes and works with me does. He did it over his social life. Okay, we weren't like that or you weren't like that or those circumstances didn't happen to you or didn't or you didn't happen to those circumstances. Right, so you need to catch up and it's not about, you know, a competition of who's better or worse. It's like you need to be able to learn those skills and the best way I've found to do that is a mixture of building your social circle which includes men and women, lifestyle design, social circle stuff and going and meeting women in everyday situations over and over and over again until that's second nature to you until, well, and until you get the results which is that you got a girlfriend now or you're dating some girls and then if you become single again, which you will, that you don't then have two years of enforced celibacy which the best you can do is try and find an ideological justification for your loneliness, frustration and depression and the other things that relate to not getting laid ever and by a woman that wants to be in bed with you. Again, if you can live without that, all power to you. There will be some people to whom that is fine. Their art form, their spirituality, their work or something else supersedes that. They can transmute their sexual energy into something else. Fine. Most men, you know. Are you that guy? Probably not. You're the guy that's like, I would really like a certain amount of sex in my life and how much is it? It's weekly. Like what's the amount of sex that you should be able to have that satisfies a man? That will be different for sure but it won't be much different. It will be the difference between five times a week and once a week. It won't be once a month, once every six months, once a year like, you know, going skiing or going hiking or something like that. I like going hiking, you know, a few times a year and I could live with it with or without it. Whereas I couldn't live without sex, you know, once a week at least. I mean occasionally I will personally take out a block of time a month to go into a spiritual retreat where I choose celibacy for a specific reason which is that I want to refocus my energy or I want to just forget about women for a while. Various other reasons but outside of that like there's a there's a certain amount of sex that you know you would ideally like. Like if you could just go out in the street and go, do you want some sex? And she's like, yep. How often would that be? It would probably be daily, right? Or quite often. So if you if you're not able to get sex in and and when I say sex I always mean sex plus something. Again not just a cold experience with a hooker who doesn't give a shit about you and is like watching the clock and you her. I'd say that's not usually very satisfying. It's the like the woman that wanted wants to be with you whether it's for a night, a bunch of nights, a fling, something which has emotional aspects to it but is more friendship or which dives deeper into you know real pair bonding, oxytocin and serotonin mixtures and falling in love which is like another level of that kind of experience. All of those things can be exceptionally nourishing and and if you have none of those things as a man you're gonna feel lonely. You're gonna feel you know left out. You're not you're unlikely to feel like you're at the top of your game or that you are as masculine and as fulfilled as a man as you could be and so therefore if you if you agree with that and you acknowledge it you're gonna have to learn how to juice it right and if it takes 500 approaches to get that locked in that can still be done in in a few months. So what? Cool. Have two or three hundred women in your life go oh no thanks or sorry I've got a boyfriend or and experience that. Get a bit of a thick skin around it. Recognize it's not because you're a loo. It's just it's just the it's just the numbers. You just got to crunch the numbers and the skill set increases the numbers get better. They never get amazing but they get definitely good enough that it's absolutely worth doing. Yeah I mean I know when I'm single I can meet a girl quickly. I mean I can meet a girl I can get on a date today. I've proven that over and over again to myself and to others. I land in a city I can you know be on a date today or tomorrow no problem right so that's that's an extremely freeing knowledge. It means that I don't have to stay in a relationship that's shit. It means I don't have to experience long periods of loneliness and celibacy. It means that when I choose to interact with women I get a choice about what type of woman that I have. It's not just the one that chose me in a social circle. It's that like cool I get a spread which means that if I choose to move into any type of relationship I'm not doing it out of scarcity. I'm doing out of like out of these number. I choose this one to change the relationship into a more serious dynamic for example which has extrapolations throughout your life. This skill set is not just about like getting laid a bunch like racking up a bunch of lays in your 20s or something like that. That's often an aspect because dudes in their 20s are horny and don't want to get married yet so they want to rack up a bunch of lays. They want to have a threesome. They want to have sex with a bunch of different types of girls. Natural. Normal. Fair enough. Don't judge it. Go for it. Get it out of your system or don't. It's not that I'm saying that's the way you should be forever. I'm an outlier. Most of my friends are outliers. Our lifestyles won't work for everybody. Absolutely not. I'm not trying to create clones of guys who endlessly do pickup because remember it's also my job. I've spent way more time doing it then would be reasonable for someone who also had another full-time job. If I was also a full-time engineer and an athlete then yeah I wouldn't have put as much time into this and I wouldn't have had as big numbers or as big results probably but I still would have been able to choose my mates, choose my dates, choose my relationships. So I feel it's imperative like you're gonna have to do this one way or another. We know the apps don't work on average. For some guys they work. In some countries they work better and worse. Some demographics better and worse. On average they don't work. Your social circles have atomized and been obliterated in the last generation or two. Not because of feminism. Because of technology. Because of geolocations. Because of broad economic changes. But mainly because of the internet. Like mainly because we spend so much time on screens instead of hanging out with friends, family, communities. Yeah people are you know less tied to their to their original cultures for various reasons. For all those reasons okay we can't fight or change any of those reasons. Unless you okay sure go and become an Amish person or join a very conservative old-school community and maybe you can find someone within that and live like old-school values. All power to you. But for most guys out there you know we're not extremists of any type. Not the guys that watch these videos anyway. We just want to bring good sexy women who don't do our heads in into our life. And we want to have a woman who comes and sucks our cock every day and doesn't and we don't have to bargain for it. Who wants me who you know who wants you to bend her over and and bang her often. Who treats you like a god in the bedroom. Who is devoted to you. Whether or not that's a monogamous relationship or whether it's for one night. That's that's the kind of thing I would say that I want and probably most men want. So we're gonna have to just deal with the squeeze. Adding X all those extra layers of ideology ideology on top of it. Sure there might be interesting as intellectual exercises or to like look at broad scopes in humanity. But there's a lot of cherry-picked statistics in order to prove certain points. A lot of it is anecdotal. A lot of it is based around very visible people. Like if we see very visible chads or very visible Instagram models that everyone you know talks about or associates with. We can remember that's a very tiny percentage of any population and also quite a small percentage of very beautiful women. Because not all and not a majority of beautiful women present themselves as Instagram models or as like OnlyFans girls or girls who are like front-facing as beautiful to the world. Like there's plenty of other girls who are beautiful and just don't do that. I've met many of them. They don't have Instagram. They don't do social media. They did it for a while they realized how how bad it made them feel. Or they did that like most girls only club for two three years. All right like the idea that they are they're all out on the cock carousel banging you know a hundred dudes until they're 35 until they hit the wall or something. It's like whose story is that? Like there's some there are some women to whom that might be their story. Most women that I've met who are beautiful and I met a lot of them. I either meet them during their clubbing thing before or after it and for the most part they spend a couple of years going out heaps enjoying the attention, the shiny things, the free drinks. Some of them you know go on to the VIP versions of that. The free trips and the modeling around the world and the boats and the yachts and all that kind of shit. And even those hardcore party animals only do it for five years. Most girls like dabble in that kind of stuff for a couple of years until I realized like it was fun and shiny but ultimately pointless. As anyone who's ever gone to clubs for any period of time knows. I've done plenty of time in in in clubs especially early days when I was teaching. The fact that I often was getting paid to teach there made that made it worth it to me. But in all other metrics I mean I had a bunch of fun nights with friends but so many nights were pointless. It's it's most people realize that going to clubs doesn't yield much over time and so girls do it for a little bit of time and then they quit. They do other stuff. They're sick of you know feeling hungover or dealing with drunk guys at 2 a.m. or grabby guys"}
