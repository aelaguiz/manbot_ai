Of course, it varies drastically from country to country, leading apparently Turkey, according to a 2017 study, with about 14 to 15 sexual partners. And there's other countries on the other side of that spectrum with only three or four on average. Also, even in the US, state by state, there's huge differences. I see Louisiana residents reporting an average of 15.7, while in Utah, the average is only 2.6. The difference is due to religion and church. Personally, I had sex with over a hundred women in my life, and that might sound like a lot, but really it is just, on average, one per month for the last eight years, which is about the time that I've been, you know, focusing on being more sexually active after leaving, you know, engineering school and so on. In this video, I want to talk about the different ways that you can meet women, that you can date, and that you can have more sexual partners. What is maybe, you know, a shiny object that makes you think, oh, this is where the hot girls are, this is where I can get laid. And what is the actual reality of dating in 2023? Before I dive into the different methods, I, you know, want to clarify a few things. First of all, I don't care with how many women you sleep. I'm definitely not saying you have to sleep with hundreds and hundreds of women, or you need to get your body count up, that, you know, your masculinity is directly measured by your lay count. I don't give a f**k, right? I don't care. But there is definitely a bit of a notion of a black and white viewpoint these days, where it's like, either you are a conservative dude who really values family, and, you know, doesn't get distracted and only grinds, or should marry your high school sweetheart, and therefore, you should have a body count of three, or whatever. Or everything on That's Not That is f**k, boy, and you don't appreciate values, and you're just f**king around, you're just a dopamine addict, you're in a hamster wheel, you're not focused at all, you're not really focused on your business, da-da-da. Many people see things black and white. Which makes sense, because in order to win on YouTube, you cannot really have a balanced opinion, because it just doesn't bring as many clicks as you see on this channel. And you have to understand, a man goes through different cycles in his life. What might work for you at 21, will not work for you at 42, right? Logically. Usually, I would say, looking, you know, through the lens of sexuality, a man goes through four phases in his life. He's in a sexless, single stage, where he is single, he doesn't get laid, he doesn't have much going on, and he's not really trying to do anything. Okay, he takes action, he moves into the active single stage. He's going out, he's talking to chicks, he's maybe creating a Tinder profile, he's, you know, maybe going shopping, grooming, so he's trying to get stuff done. And it works, which moves him into the casual dating stage. That can mean you have sexual partners, you might have several girlfriends, lovers, right? You are maybe in an open relationship, you're trying things out, you're not committing to one girl yet, you're waiting till it feels right. And then, once it does, you move into the fourth stage, which is a committed relationship. You're monogamous, you're with one girl, and maybe you marry her, maybe it lasts for a couple of months, maybe it lasts for a couple of years, depends on other factors, right? If it ends, you're usually a bit upset, you're a bit devastated, you're going through a harsh breakup, which often lends us men back into the sexless single stage for a while, because, as you know for sure, it is harder for us men to, you know, instantly find new sexual partners after a breakup. It's not as easy as it is for the female. I want to clarify here, you don't need to sleep with hundreds of women to be masculine or to have to be enough, or your masculinity is not measured on your body count, but you do have to understand, a high-value man has experience, he knows what he's doing. He had several sexual partners. If I would have to put a number on it, I would say between 30 and 50 is a range, where as a man, you know what you're doing. You are in control of your sexuality, in control of your dick, you're in control of your ejaculation, you know when you're coming, you can last longer. You also met different women with different preferences. You've met submissive women, you've met dominant women, experienced certain things, you've dealt with, you know, girls who have a lot of experience, you've dealt with virgins or almost virgins. You know how to handle them differently, you know how to make different women comfortable, how to lead them, how to follow, how to seduce them, how to handle them. And then eventually, there will be your dream partner coming along, and you want to be prepared. Don't you want to be prepared? Don't you want to know what you're doing? Don't you want to be in a position there, when this, you know, amazing girl comes your way and it comes to you having sex with her, that you want to give her a good, no, an amazing experience. How would you assume to give her such an amazing experience if you just haven't practiced? I mean, it's like many other things in life, practice makes perfect. So, you don't have to sleep with hundreds of women, but I do recommend before making a huge commitment towards one partner for life, you should sleep with at least 30 women. Okay, let's look at the different ways that we can meet chicks in 2023 and what is effective and what is not. Let's look at part one, which is online dating. I would definitely say the golden age of online dating is somewhat over. I remember using Tinder the first time, let me think, about seven years ago, and it was exciting, right? Everybody was swiping right on people. It was just cool to meet somebody from the internet, to chat a bit. There wasn't like majority of men yet, it was still quite balanced. People were happy to chat, it was exciting. People had smartphones for the first time in their life, right? They had WhatsApp, it was like this new wave of the internet. Now, not so much anymore. As a woman on online dating, you're absolutely outnumbered. Depending on the countries, for each woman on a dating platform, there is between three and eight men, which means the chances for you as a man to swipe right on a girl is, from the moment you register, already really low. Then we can show this one curve, where you can basically, if you understand diagrams and math a bit, you can see that if you're not in the top 20% of men, looks-wise, attraction-wise, you have basically no chance to get in a lot of matches. Only about 4% to 5% of women would even consider swiping on you. If you're in the bottom 80% of attractiveness of men, which, by definition, most of you are. That's just the reality, right? So, put on top of that, that Tinder, Bumble, and so on are businesses. They're private companies, they want to make a profit. Obviously, the algorithms are designed in a way to reward the people who spend the most money, to show these profiles to the most women, raising the chance that these get some matches. Also, if you've ever spent money on online dating apps, you probably have noticed, the moment you put in $20, $30, the moment you give them what they want, they will show you a bunch of hotties for a couple of minutes to get up your dopamine, to feel rewarded. It's hard. You can still use it, but use it as a supplement, right? Don't use it as your male nutrition, as your main income. It's a little side hustle. You let it run, it's automated. Put up good photos that are really, like, maxed out. Maybe even use Photoshop. Personally, I'm not a big fan of faking it like that, but I've heard it can really make a difference. Write a good bio. Ideally, have some type of assistant do the texting for you, at least the initial texting, until you get them off the platform, and then you can text yourself on WhatsApp or wherever. But at the beginning, it's just such a waste of time. You know, you're a high-level dude watching this. You want to not waste your time texting with 100 girls and then statistically, maybe ending up with two or three on a date. It's just such a bad input and output ratio. Number two is nightlife. Now, this can be fun. Going out can be fun if you are in a certain time in your life. Maybe you are more on the extroverted side. Maybe you enjoy going to bars. Maybe you're having fun anyway with your buddies, and then you meet girls here and there. Good. I know myself and most of my clients are more on the introverted side. They don't really enjoy going to nightclubs. Also, I want to get shit done. I don't want to be up till four in the morning. I don't want to get drunk. I value my sleep these days, and I'm 30 now, right? I cannot imagine how I will be at 40. And it's been like this for a couple of years. I'm not a guy anymore who consistently goes to bars, nightclubs. I had that phase in my early 20s, pushed my social comfort zone a lot there. So I decided to go out a lot. So if you're really young, it can be a great way to become more socially free. But as a consistent way of meeting women, I would say no, no, doesn't work. Also, let's look at the reality. What's the chance that the girl you really want, first of all, is going out at all, is consistently partying, which is kind of necessary for you to mathematically meet at some point. And then especially that she's at that venue, that she is kind of like approachable. She's not like on the dance floor surrounded by other guys. She's not in some VIP table booth with some promoter or some rich guy. But she's just like there by herself, having a drink without any cock blocking friends. Prepare to die. It is a difficult environment to approach, especially if you don't feel comfortable in it. So my advice, only go to nightclubs if you truly enjoy it. I've hearing guys often think that this is the best way to meet women because I guess that's just how it's been for a while. Or there's this notion that, you know, people meet at night in bars. No, there's other ways to meet people if you're not into nightclubs, just don't go. What a peaceful realization. One hack that I discovered though with night game is going out with other women, having a strong social circle where a lot of women are part of and then taking them out to bars and clubs. Obviously that requires two things. Often you have to end up paying for these women's drinks. So only do that if you really don't care about spending quite some money on a night out or you live in a country where it's really cheap. A dollar and 83 cents American. What are we gonna get with that? And you need a social circle that has women in it, which brings me to part three, which is social circle. Now, social circle is a great way to attract women to get laid because it gives you more time. You get to know people over a longer period of time. So that's great, but, right? There's always a but. First of all, you need a social circle that is attractive for women. If all your hobbies is playing Counter-Strike online and going jujitsu, probably the flow of females coming into that social circle is not big enough for you to consistently getting laid or just having enough female energy around. So it should be a type of hobby that is attractive mainly to females, or it's at least 50-50. Also, you have to take quite some initiative there and it takes a while to build. I am getting great results of social circle now because I've been exclusively focusing on that from especially last three years. Today has been a conscious effort of mine after I've been exclusively focusing on cold approach, which I will talk about in a minute. So it can work if you have a long vision. It's not really great if you say, oh, I wanna, you know, I wanna be an active single. I wanna have casual relationships. I wanna have multiple girlfriends. That's not great, because first of all, if you have multiple girlfriends out of the same social circle, there might be some conflict coming up there. You don't wanna build a reputation as the guy who always approaches the girls in the gym or in the yoga class and always asks them out for coffee, right? Social circle works if you already have strong charisma, if you know what you're doing, you're taking it easy, and you kinda let the girls come to you. It's not a great place to be actively approaching, to be actively asking girls out. You might creep people out really quickly there. Let's move on to my favorite way of meeting women, which is cold approach. Cold approach is amazing because you can do it anywhere. It's free. You can do it sober, and you're gonna meet the girls in real life, right? Not like Tinder, Bumble, Hinge. You're actually gonna see a girl on the street. You see how she looks like. You can then walk up to her, introduce yourself, show yourself as a whole man, not just some profile with five photos. You don't need to Photoshop yourself. Yes, put on a nice outfit, know what you're doing style-wise. Yes, be groomed. Yes, don't stink like sweat. Then you can get to know each other, and that's beautiful because it gives her the opportunity to really see you. It gives you the opportunity to show yourself as a whole man with your confidence, with your charisma, with your voice, with your posture, with your weaknesses, right? And she will excuse that as well. I've talked about in another video how I've approached over 3,000 women in my lifetime, which again might seem like a lot, but really it's just one per day on average over the last eight years, just like I've slept with about one per month over the eight years. It is an incredible tool to meet women. It is an incredible tool to build yourself as a man. It helped me enormously with confidence, with loving myself, with negotiation, with character, with communication skills, which obviously, as you can imagine, helped me a lot in building male networks, with building businesses, with becoming a better leader, with becoming a better employer, becoming a better businessman. So the ripple effects are also tripling down in other areas of life. And it's really a great way to live life, to be able to go out. My morning routine is I get up, I put on my shoes, I walk in the sun, I get a coffee. And on the way, I usually see one or two girls and then I approach them and I say, hi, maybe they have a boyfriend. Maybe they're in a rush. Maybe they're not that into me, but I train my social muscle every day. I don't have to wait till Friday and get drunk to be social and I'm in goblin mode the rest of the week. No, I do a little bit every day. It's a little bit of a stretch, right? I have my social yoga routine and that gives me so much more opportunity. Just think about it, imagine you would talk to one girl every day for the whole year. And imagine at the end of that time, you would have 50 calls in WhatsApp, 100 girls on Instagram. When you post a story, girls reacting to it. You have friends in the city, you know, some girls have boyfriends, some girls want to date you, some girls want to show up to a house party, some girls want to bring their friends to an event you're doing. Just different forms of social interactions. How much would that change your life compared to what you're having now? The problem with cold approach is, it's hard. It is scary. It takes some effort to get into. You need to overcome that initial fear. I understand this social anxiety better than anyone else. I was so scared to give a true honest compliment to a woman on the street, to be honest, to be direct. It took me a while and the time it really clicked was when I met my mentors when I had a strong tribe of men around me that normalized this way of living. There is another kind of secret fifth way of meeting women that I want to talk a lot about a little bit, and it's called social media. It's quite new still, if you think about 10 years ago, people didn't think to use Instagram as a way of meeting women. Some dating sites have been around already, right? You would make an account, you would fill out your profile, you would write out your preferences and your hobbies and your favorite movies. But using Instagram as a dating profile is kind of a new idea, but it can be an incredible powerful hack. I use it incredibly successful. I made a whole like social media dating guide on that topic that has been purchased by hundreds of guys, helping them to build a social media profile that is optimized for dating. The main thing here is the misconception of using it to DM girls. You cannot DM girls. Most women get dozens and hundreds of DMs all the time. Also, maybe the girl you really want doesn't spend that much time on Instagram. She doesn't check her DMs all the time. The real distinction here to make is you want to meet a girl in the real life. You want to create a connection, but maybe you don't have much time. Maybe she's in a rush. Maybe you need to go. Maybe her tram comes, her bus comes. And then you want to have an opportunity to continue the conversation. You want to have an opportunity to keep getting to know each other over time. Do you have Instagram? Yes. Do you want to switch Instagram? You will see on my Instagram if I text you. Do you want to exchange Instagram? We can chat on Instagram. Let's text and see where it goes. Which can work on text messaging or calling her, but we know how it is. Sometimes she doesn't respond to the first message to the second or she gets busy or you leave town for a couple of weeks and then you come back and you kind of forgot about each other. Social media enables you to keep telling stories, right? Literally like stories on Instagram or just keep communicating about yourself online, more visually, more engagement happens. She can double tap, she can react to stories, stuff like that. It's much better than texting in that sense. So use social media to triple down on the cold approach. Meet people in real life every day a little bit and then continue the conversation through either direct messaging or stories or posting. I can literally be just posting memes, posting fun things you see during the day. You will see how girls start watching stories. They like your stuff, which kind of is an invitation to have a communication with them. Can really be super helpful. I've been testing so many strategies over the years and this is the one that is by far the most effective. Cold approach into social media and then as the absolute top of the pyramid, creating a social circle on top of that, which means creating events, creating house parties, going on holiday with a bunch of people. This is where it gets a bit more, you know, sophisticated, which is usually stuff I'm only teaching my mentoring clients, but this is the way. If you enjoyed this video, maybe you feel inspired to take action to have more women in your life and you're not satisfied of you becoming an average number of, you know, having seven to 10 sexual partners in your lifetime.
