We both messed up. Very simple. I have this as well. I remember it for the first few minutes and then you engage, like, you go into a conversation. I think that's a good sign. It is, because I think if you're bored and not into the conversation, then you have more time to remember it. Right, you'd be remembering the name because you're like, what am I going to say? I guess I'll say their name again. Oh no, this is boring. Cool. Would you like to go out for tea sometime? I mean, yeah, if you want. Well, I wouldn't ask if I didn't want. That would be strange. Yeah, it would be cool. Okay, cool. Do you have a WhatsApp or something? Yes, I do. Carry on. It's just YouTube. Who gives a shit? Come on in. You're famous now. Good day, gentlemen. It's James Marshall here on the streets of Barcelona on a rainy afternoon and by public and popular demand, I'm going to go and talk to some girls dressed in this ridiculously awesome outfit. I know there's people thinking right now, like, what the fuck? Don't you just usually wear a leather jacket and denim shirt? Yes, it's in the wash, so I had to borrow Adam's. I went to a psychedelic sex party once and this is the outfit. Whatever. All right, so let's go and talk to some girls and see what happens. By the way, I've been locked on the farm for the last five weeks, so I haven't seen this many humans in five weeks. It's all a bit strange. I mean, I'm strange. Let's go. Excuse me, madam. Excuse me. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. No, no, stop. You're only half stopping. It's the brakes aren't great, right? What? Do you speak? What languages do you like? Spanish. Okay. No English? No. Okay. Mi espanol es muy mal. Pero you look muy bonita on tu bicicleta. Vale. Pero me estoy mojando mucho. I know. I know. You've got to go. Okay. Vamos. Mi amigo. No problem. No problem? Okay. On Monday. You'll see me. Okay. All right. Now I got it on tick. All right. Muchas gracias. Lifestyle design in action. Me and this gentleman have been doing chai deals for about six years now, I believe. He knows who I am. None of us had a euro and he knows I'm good for it. And he knows that if I don't pay him, there'll be problems. So, there'll be problems. Hello. How are you? Hi. Are you happy with the shots? Yeah. Good. I saw you posing and now I can see you like, hmm. This one, yes. This one, no. Excellent. Good, good. What are they for? Instagram? What? They are for Instagram, I presume? Yeah. Oh, surprisingly. You're worried I'm going to steal? How would I do that? What's your name? Yeah. Cool. I'm James. You want a fist bump? James? Yeah. Yeah. Nice to meet you. Can I guess? No, you can tell me where you're from. No, no, I get it. Morocco? You will never guess. Morocco? No. Somewhere in that region? No. Okay. You can tell me. From Palestine. Palestine? Okay. Excellent. I'm from Australia. Hello. How are you? Nice to meet you. Yes. What's your name? Those are really great names. Say again? Those are really cool names. I just have James, which is very basic. James. And what are you doing in this wonderful city? Vacation. Just vacation. Good choice. Yeah. I live in Portugal, usually. Nice. I'm an olive farmer. What? You know olives? Ah, yeah, yeah. I farm olives. Ah, nice. And make olive oil. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Very nice olive oil. There are too many olive trees in Palestine. Yeah? What do you mean too many? You can never have too many. You mean there is many? Many. Do you have like really old, old trees? Yeah. How old? It's famous in Palestine. For like ancient olive trees? Yeah. Okay, cool. Because I, sometimes I buy like very old ones, like two, three, four hundred year old ones. Wow. And transplant them. That's my hobby. Nice. Yeah. What's your hobby? What's what? Hobby. Hobby. Maybe you know, you know what her hobbies are, right? No. Shopping. Wow, surprisingly, like most women. And? Also? Also, traveling. Excellent. Yeah. And what kind of traveling do you prefer? Like, you know, like some people like to go and sit on the beach, but do you like to get into the culture? Yeah, all kinds. All kinds? All kinds. Well, that lady like touched me there and I was like, oh. You know, you have to be very careful of people. And they're really good. I've had three phones stolen and I don't know how. Wow. I just don't know how. Really? Yeah. This is the pickpocket capital of the world. Aww. Yeah. Oh, mate, well, you got another place that's better? They are so good that I feel like when they do it, I'm like, respect. Because if they manage to get that out of my pocket without me noticing, and I wasn't drunk, that's pretty, that's a good skill. So be careful, especially with that, because they can come by. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Oh, that, that's asking for trouble. That's easy. That's easy. Yeah, well, that's a little bit harder. Yeah. Maybe you should, yeah, put something spiky like a cactus in there. And that might work. Cool. All right, so what's the plans for your time here? We're, we're here till Saturday. No, even it's Sunday. And we're using up on half of bus today. Good idea. We're moving to the touristic places. Excellent. Yeah, you go to Montjuic. Yeah. Montjuic. It's the. Montjuic. The big hill on the, it is the hill. Yeah, I guess we're going there. It's beautiful, amazing, like, what do you call it? Botanical garden. Yeah. Old stone structures. Yeah. Amazing view. Yeah. Yeah. And just wandering around Elborn is my favorite area. Just over there. It's, it's very hip, very cool. Yeah. All right. It means sunrise. Sunrise, wow. Yeah. I don't think James just means James. And you're. It's like a gift from God. Oh, wow, you guys have really, really impressive meanings in it. It was just like James. It was in the Bible or whatever. It's timeless. Yeah, it's nice. It's not going out of style, right? It's always been in style. It's nice. Yes, yes. Okay, do we want to Instagram friends? Do you guys do that? Okay, yeah. Yeah. All right, let's see. I, what if I speak Arabic? You do? No. Yeah, you can speak Arabic together then. I'll try. Tell me one, not rude thing, a nice thing to say. Habibi. I know that one, habibi. Helwe. Helwe. Like, you are beautiful. Helwe. Helwe. Helwe. Yeah, yeah. You just go up and say that? Helwe? Yeah. Really? You don't have to say something first? Like, if I just walk... You are beautiful. Again, say? Ente helwe. Ente helwe. Arabic sounds cool. It's hard to learn. All right. I'm sure it's very hard. All right, you can type it in, but don't steal my phone because I can run. If you want chai, this man here, one euro, really good chai. This, I'm drinking some now. Highly recommended. Really? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like, do you want one? It's really good. What kind of chai? Chai. It's from India, so it has... Ah, I know. I do it for chai. Okay. Thank you. They don't want. I tried. I tried. Thank you. Me and him have been doing chai deals for like five years now. I got this one for free because I didn't have a euro, and he said, pay me next time. Oh, I got it. So that's how, you know, I'm in with that guy. I don't know his name. Okay, you just... Did I just follow you? Yeah. Yes. Okay, fantastic. All right. Well, we might see you around. Like, I'm obvious because I'm dressed like this, so you'll see me. It's okay. All right. Lovely to meet you. Nice to meet you. Take it easy. See you next time. See you. Bye-bye. Peace. Okay, so for the first multiple minutes of that interaction, they thought I was trying to steal something, which is pretty common in Barcelona. A charming stranger comes up and tries to distract them, and you saw that the one lady ran off to get her bags because she thought I was doing her laundry. I was like, what? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? Okay, nice thing, because she thought I was doing her like 2-step shuffle fucking hustle, which I wasn't. And then after a while, so I stepped back, give them space, and then later on gave them a warning about the robberies, which is exactly the type of thing a pickpocket would probably do. Anyway, lovely ladies. Now, they were from Palestine. You know what I didn't mention? Oh, oh, I've heard of Palestine. And whatever I'm about to say next is not a good idea. Cool. They're from Palestine. That's interesting. So that's as much as we need to deal with from that kind of stuff. So be aware when you meet someone from Syria, Ukraine, Palestine, or any other country where there's shit going on. Don't mention them all. All right. That was fun. They were nice. Let's go and do some more. That's an awesome combination there. Fantastic. Is your mother? How did she get such cool style? Yours is good too, but I mean, come on. It's fucking nice. And what? Come on. Yes. Thank you. It just occurred to me that there's going to be guys in the comments who said, yeah, it's only working because James is peacocking. Fuck. They're right. Mystery was right. Peacocking does work. It's just the style has to change, Mystery. You can't still wear the old thing. I mean, it was a good idea back in 2002. But now, you know, keep up, Mystery. Keep up, Eric. Olyona, Olyona. Love of Ukraine, motherfuckers. If anyone knows Olyona, please hook us up. I want her to play at my festival. We'll fix it in post. It's all good. Excuse me, ladies. One question. Please explain. He said be quick. He said be quick. It's a man behind me saying be quick. Are you French? Because of the slim cigarettes and the elegance, obviously. Thank you. You're welcome. Well, no, I don't speak any French. Is my time up? He doesn't like me. Ciao. Alright, so you might be asking, what are you doing, James? How come you're just talking to people but you're not trying to pick them up? Or you might be thinking, that's not a good return on investment because you approach nine girls in front of a photographer and how are you going to pick them all up? I probably wasn't, and I didn't because the photographer told me to fuck off. What am I doing is called being social. Now, I don't always do that. Sometimes I'm an anti-social cunt. But today I'm feeling pretty social. And for guys who are trying to approach, if you view approaches as I'm in my box. No, no, not you. No, no, no. Yeah, actually, hey, how are you doing? You've got a lovely smile, you too. Do you want to come back and say hi? Yeah, why not? To me? What's your name? Yeah. Okay, my name is James. And you are? And? James. Yes, where are you from? Israel. Okay, awesome. I'm Australian originally, but I'm now a Portuguese resident. That's where I stay. Nice. And how are you enjoying Barcelona? You look like you've kind of arrived recently. No. I'm here for one month. For a few days. Yeah, you have that fresh, like, I can't believe it. Is it your first time here? Yeah, it's gorgeous. Absolutely gorgeous. Yeah, cool. And what's the plant? Oh, can I have a look at this? What type of flower is it? I honestly don't know. You know, we can actually use my app and we can find out. Do you want to do that? We can try. We'll try. Okay, so this is called Picture This. I'm not, it's not, okay. I've never done it through Amber before. But let's see. It's for flowers? Wow. Well, it says that it's a giant duckweed, but I don't think that's correct. I think all of the other golden things is influencing it. Alright, let's just try one more time. Alright. Come on, little machine. That's about as close as we can get. It's like the algorithm is confused. Now it says it's Bermuda grass. I don't think that's going to work. Yeah. Anyway. Well, I won't know, and we will live with it. I guess we'll just have to live with not identifying the Latin name for it. So, okay. Well, did you have fun? Yeah. Are you a bit confused? Excuse me? Yes. Well, I guess we'll just have to leave it like that. Okay. Mysterious. See you later. Bye. Have a great day. Oh, yeah. Alright. So you might ask me why I did that. Because I felt like chatting to the lovely Israeli ladies. So this you could term as warm-ups if you wanted to be really, you know, clinical about it. But to approach people you need to minimize the distance between you and the world. If you're in your box and then you try and step out only when you approach a 10 that you want to pick up, you will probably not get good at this ever. However, if you interact with all sorts of people and bounce the energy off them, then you'll probably get good at this quickly. If you want to do that, come and train with me very soon. When's our next workshop, Bob? Budapest. July-ish. Check the link in the description. It's all there. You want to look at it, don't you? You were looking at it and you were like, what is it? Yes, it's psychedelic pornography. Oh. Yeah. Nice. Is it an optic illusion? Is it an optic illusion? It depends. What are you seeing? We need to take a picture of an optical illusion. I'm basically an optical illusion. Yeah, yeah. We take a picture? Yes. Oh, thank you. Alright. I'll do my optical illusion pose. Hang on. Thank you. Thank you. You want to come in on the pornography, right? No, it's good. Okay. Thank you very much. I hope that helps with your course. That one's mine. You might ask, why that stick? Like, what is it about that stick? What? What is it about that stick? Because you ran to it and you're like, that one. We need to do a challenge. We need to make a word with organic vegetables. Ah, right. Any word? Gaza. Gaza. As in the strip? No, a house in Spanish. Oh, casa. I thought you were talking about the Gaza strip. No, that's a different thing. Okay, right. So, okay, how many more sticks do you need? And how much time do you have? No gracias. We have time. Yes, indeed. Because it looked like it was a big rush. And I don't want to, like, slow you down. Oh, no, no, no. And what happens when you finish writing casa? It's just a part of the challenge. We need to do several challenges. And who's in charge of this? Is there someone, a challenge master, watching you or something? Yes. All right. And you're Germans, right? No, no, no. Belgians. Belgians, right. Okay, cool. So, okay. And, right. But do you want to sing a song with us? Yeah. Yes? Which song? Do you know dos cervezas, por favor? No. Yeah, yes. Okay, okay. A different, well, it has to be a specific song? Yes. Okay, teach it to me. I'm sure I can figure it out. All right, you sing it once. Can you speak Spanish, or? I can say whatever you're going to say in Spanish, probably. All right, I'm ready. First, you need to say dos cervezas. Dos cervezas. Por favor. What's the tune? Dos cervezas, por favor. Dos cervezas, por favor. Okay, is there any more to it than that? No. Okay, all right. Elke Spanjaard. Elke Spanjaard. No, that's complicated. Yeah, that's complicated. Elke. You do that bit. Is this in Belgian now? Yes. It's Dutch. It's Dutch? Yes. Belgian, you speak multiple languages, right? French, German, and Dutch? And Dutch. And is there an actual just Belgian, or it's a mix of all of them? No. Okay, I've got a question for you. It's unrelated, right? Okay, so I live in Portugal, right? You know, on a farm sometimes. One day, a couple walked by, 60-something years old, right? Right, now they said, I said, where are you from? They said, from Belgium. And I said, okay. And then I said, oh cool, what part of Belgium? From, what's the capital? Brussels. Brussels. And then, shakes my hand, right? And she shakes it like this. Pleased to meet you. And I'm like, you're not from Belgium. You know where they're from? Poland. South Africa. Obviously. Because we're going, yo, yo, yo, we're from Belgium. And I'm like, not with a handshake like that, you're not. Oh, I know. Grand-grandfather was from Belgium, moved to South Africa. Afrikaans, 90s, things changed. Then we come back, we say we're from Belgium. Do you think I'm right? Okay, cool. Right, that's, now I'm confirmed. Alright, where were we? Two, three, four. Dos cervezas, por favor. Dos cervezas, por favor. How many times? Dos cervezas, por favor. And then you do the, now you do the Belgian bit. But you need to do it. Okay, show me how. Elke. Elke. Spanjaard. Heeft. Heeft. Een. Een. Snor. Snor. Elke. Dutch is very interesting. Alright, well, I'll try, and then you guys just keep going. Let's not spend all day trying to teach me this one Dutch one. Is that okay? Yes. Okay, okay. Okay. Alright, what's your names, by the way? And? I'm James, lovely to meet you. See, you're Belgian, because that wasn't an Afrikaans handshake, that's for sure. You guys aren't Boers. Raat. How do you want to do it, like a selfie something, or what? Better to ask somebody to do it? Not that guy. Look, look. You've got a leechedinger, is that what I'm called now? I thought you were like, I've got a leechedinger over here. Leechedinger, that means to sing a song? Yeah. Wow. Hello. Hello. How are you? Yeah, okay. Alright. Alright, alright, hang on, let me get ready. Okay. This is por favor. This is por favor. This is por favor, the Belgian bit. Por favor. Por favor. Wow. Thank you. Awesome, we're going to be in a Eurovision Song Contest next year, obviously. And Finland was robbed. Alright, see ya. Thank you, bye. Peace. Excuse me. Excuse me. I know you're in a rush. Okay, we need an assistant. Can you walk along with us for six hours and hold the umbrella for him? Is it? Five. Make it five. How much does it pay? Oh, right, right. Oh, here we go. Now I like it. Okay, what have I got in my pocket? Sorry. I need to go to the bathroom. I need to go to the bathroom. I need to go to the bathroom. What have I got in my pocket? Sorry, I need more than that. You don't know what I've got in my pocket. What are you guys doing? Just filming a bit of YouTube. You're an influencer. I hope not. You don't want me influencing the planet, because then it would go insane. No, we're just doing some fun filming on the street. Cool. Should I follow you on Instagram or something? Sure. What is it? What's your Instagram? Oh, it's nothing to follow. No, it's... What is it? That's how we stay in touch these days. Yeah, yeah. What is our Instagram? The Natural Lifestyles. Right. Lifestyles. The Natural... Lifestyles with an S, not a Z. Dot com. No, no, that's not it. Yeah, that's it. Where? Well, just type it. The Natural Lifestyles. Yeah, Lifestyles. No, it's already set without an S. Yeah, there we are. The first one. First one. You love it. Cool. Yeah. Now I know who you are. Alright, cool. I'm Mama... Okay, Mama... Like, he's... Okay, got it. See you on the ground. See you around. Alright, peace. Excuse me, madam. I know you're on the phone. And I know this is... Did you just hang up on them? No, it was a voice note. Oh, right. Okay. I didn't want to be rude, but I thought I couldn't pass the opportunity to tell you how awesome you look in white. Thank you so much. And to say hi, I'm James. Hi. Nice to meet you. How do you do? Hi. Good strong handshake. Are you Dutch? Yes, I am. Thought so. I'm Australian. Okay. Yeah, yeah. And what are you doing right now? I just came from work. Okay. Story checks out. Yeah, so you've been living here for two years? Yeah. Cool. And you prefer it to living in Holland? Yeah. Right. Why did you... What was it that made you go, alright, that's it, I'm leaving? No, I still love the country, but I just feel like the stereotype culture is not really my thing. And is the stereotype correct? Not for everybody. No. I feel like my family is definitely not the stereotype culture, but I just don't like the life of efficiency, you know? It always has to be super fast, efficient, not thinking about how you actually feel about certain things, so... Right. Which means you get to the end faster and then you... Exactly, exactly. And then what? Well, that's irrelevant. It was done efficiently. But for me it is. Yes, well, I'm Australian, so we're more on the... less on the Dutch-German side and more on the Mediterranean. More on the southern. Yeah, I mean, I'm a relatively efficient Australian, but that still means I'm... I wouldn't be very efficient in Holland. No, it's good to have some balance. I'm not saying that I'm not efficient, like I'm super... still perfectionist OCD kind of spectrum, but... You've taken the edges off by living here. Yeah, like, going abroad and living in other places really has helped me to let go. Yes. That's when you see that other things are more important. Yeah, I mean, the fact is you stopped to talk to me and that wasn't efficient. Like, you could have finished that voicemail and been, like, a hundred meters down the road by now. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, cool. Awesome. Do you want to ask me a question or anything? Well, actually, what are you doing here? Well, I live in Portugal most of the time. I'm an olive farmer and many other things. And I'm here to teach a meditation type of workshop. Oh, that's really nice. And to see friends and to... Because I was on my farm for the last five weeks, which was awesome. In Australia, right? No, no, in Portugal. Okay. Yeah. And then I thought it might be nice to go and see humans again. And it is. It's a good place for that. Yeah. And when I've had enough, I'll go back and hang out with my olive trees. Yeah. That's really good. But I come here often, so... Okay. So you live in Lisbon or somewhere else? No, no, it's literally on a farm in the north of Portugal. Okay. It's a gorgeous valley. I mean, I lived internationally for many years, traveled for the last 12 years. And... How's your hair? That's okay. You don't care at all? Well, considering that such as well. Ah, yes, of course. Right. And then I decided country life would be a good balance to my insane city life. And so now I do both. That's a good one. Yeah, yeah. I like that. And how is it going for you so far? Where? In the city life. Oh, I just got here, yes. I mean, I've been here a million times, so it's normal for me. I mean, it's like, oh, all right, humans and that. It's totally good. Yeah. What I like about this place is that you can go into nature very fast. Yes. And you're there in like, what, 30, 40 minutes? Yeah, totally. That's good. Yeah, it's very good. So you're doing meditation classes? Yeah, like, have you heard of movement culture? Like, let's say it's moving meditation types of exercise that are embodiment types of exercise. So, yeah, it's not, I mean, I do, it's not sit down meditation. It's more for people, like, most people are not very good at sit down meditation. They get bored. Yeah, yeah. So, yeah, learning how to be embodied, how to understand your, like, primal movements. It's, yeah, a bunch of different kind of technologies from Kung Fu and Qigong and movement culture, which is an Israeli school. So, yeah, a mixture of that. And you're doing that here as well? Yeah. Nice. I do it many places. And is it self official, like, up to join? No, it's like, it's basically private groups for primarily German, Austrian, Dutch engineers. And, like, what's the side of the brain where it's a little logic? The Dutch side, what's that one? You know how left brain, right brain, I can't remember which one's which. Whichever is the one that makes people become engineers, that's typically my client. So, you know, very intelligent, but very stiff. And so, that's my niche, let's say. Yeah, I don't teach hippies because they already know how to do it. That's good. Yeah, yeah. I see that. Yeah, I mean, it's a good market because they know that they're stressed and they know that they're not, they're stiff. And what I like about, especially Germans, is they're not proud about that. Like, they'll happily admit it. Yeah. And, which is cool. That's really the German culture. Or the stereotype. I mean, the stereotype's, in general, correct. But, you know, a lot of people are too proud to change, whereas I find the Germans, Austrians, maybe the Swiss, not so much. Yeah. Are totally cool to change. The Dutch, I think, are a bit pig-headed, bull-headed. Yeah, I think they're a bit more proud. Yes. If you compare them to Germans. Yeah. I would say so. Yeah. That's true. But they're based on something. Yeah. Tend to be. Yeah. Your name again was? You're sorry? James. James. Yeah. We both messed up. Very simple. I have this as well. Very simple names. Like, I remember it for the first few minutes and then you engage, like, you go into a conversation. I think that's a good sign. It is. If you forgot the name. I think if you're bored and not into the conversation, then you have more time to remember it, I think. Right. You'd be remembering the name because you're like, what am I going to say? Yeah. I guess I'll say their name again. Oh, no. This is boring. Cool. That's true. Would you like to go out for tea sometime? I mean, yeah. If you want. Well, I wouldn't ask if I didn't want. That would be strange. Yeah, it would be cool. Okay, cool. Do you have a WhatsApp or something? Yes, I do. All right. No. But I do really have to ask in what kind of way? Just, like, in a cool way. In a cool way? Yeah. Well, I'm open to various things. I'm open to friends, but only if they're actually real friends. I only have room for, like, one or two new friends a year. I understand. Because I'm pretty serious about my friends. Yeah. You've got a boyfriend? Yeah, I do. Okay. Well, in that case, we might do a friend audition. That's cool. All right. What's your... Do you want to know my surname or...? No. No. And I don't want to do that nickname. Yeah, White. Okay. All right. Eva White. Eva White. Eva White. Eva White. Eva White. Eva White. Eva White. Eva White. Eva White. Eva White. Eva White. Eva White. Eva White. Eva White. Eva White. Eva White. Eva White. Eva White. Eva White. Eva White. Eva White. Yeah, that's a really good name, actually. You could be... That's a... It's like an alias. Yeah. It could be. All right. So you can type all the numbers and whatever's in there? Yes. What's your boyfriend like, in general? Very fluid, like a child's mind. Yeah. Down to earth, but... Yeah. Okay. Cool. That's how I would say it. That sounds nice. I like him. All right. Cool. Lovely to meet you. Very nice to meet you. Take it easy. See you soon. Have a nice day. Bye. Okay, so why did I bother to get that lovely Dutch lady's number when she had a boyfriend? And was it a real boyfriend? Yes. I'm sure it was. Now, we had a cool chat. We were doing a lot of good stuff in there. I can't even remember what I said now. I'm sure we'll check it out later. So I asked her out and she says immediately, yes, right? And then she says, oh, in what capacity or whatever way the Dutch say it. And then I, from memory, I jump in and say, you've got a boyfriend, right? She's like, yes. So, and I said, let's just be friends, right? Now, I don't always do this. And I was being very truthful when I said that becoming my friend is actually harder than becoming my lover. Actually, I didn't say those words exactly to her, but I actually, I didn't go, oh yeah, we can be friends so that one day I can awkwardly try and hit on you. And then for her to go, dude, really? Six months in, I told you I had a boyfriend, but I'm like, yeah, but I'm using the boyfriend destroyer. No, no, no. Think about that. She's a hot girl. She lives here. I'm just coming through. I don't, I come through here every now and then. If I want to build my social circle and I get a solid friend close and I asked about the boyfriend, he sounds cool. I mean, I don't know how we're going to arrange that where I meet and go, hi, so I'm the new friend. I mean, I'm now friends with both of you by proxy, whatever, who cares? So whether or not I'm ever going to see them again in a friend capacity doesn't matter. The lesson stands. Okay. I'm in a new city. What do I want to find? Lovers, friends, and hot girls who friend zone me or I friend zone them."}
