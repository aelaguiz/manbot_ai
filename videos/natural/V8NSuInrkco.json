The fantastic coach in the world! It's the morning, you know how I feel about that. We've just finished a pretty intense coaching run around Europe, and now we're in Barcelona. And now we're going to get on a flight and go to Lisbon, Portugal, to see Sasha Daygame. What's for breakfast, James? Airport horrors. When's the last time you saw Sasha? I feel like he's always there, but I think I saw him last... I don't know, a year ago? In Belgrade, maybe? It's been too long. I think he's changed quite a bit. He's quite skinny and happy. Very good, very good. On the edge of the swamp, let's practice to start. It's like what happened was that a formerly relatively wealthy family lost a lot of money and had to move into a shitter area. So they brought a lot of old, antique things that are really nice. Like this. It's much better to have the TV there, because then you can just be watching it and have your drink right there. That's so convenient. Old, antique-y stuff as well. A lot of hard times. They literally brought the CD player. It was $8,000 when they bought it. Yeah, exactly. Unfortunately, he died of the whooping cough. One of 14 children. I'm cold. I was born to be a star. I was born to shine. I was born to die. How are you? I'm good, James. You're going to get diabetes if you carry on. That's the last thing that's going to happen. Someone of your body type and weight. That could be the straw that comes back, mate. Type 2 diabetes, right around the corner. Green screen for natural lifestyles. Yeah, that's ours. Making meeting women on the street. Yeah, yeah. We have an audition, like a lengthy audition, for the big part of the homeless dude who comes in to ask for money when you're in the middle of the set and kind of annoys you a bit. We spend days trying to find that guy. The commenters on YouTube on like a sachet, a bunch of Instagram posts, they're like, We spend days trying to find that guy. The commenters on YouTube on like a sachet, a bunch of infields, many of which there's a girl going, No, thank you. They're like, fake. It's like, why would you fake a girl being like, No, thanks. You're giving your flaky kind of... Yeah, yeah. I don't know. James Marshall, what are we waiting for? Uber? Because we have entered the realm of the Uberfication of life. All right, let's go. What's his name? Pedro. Pedro. Where's the conference? Downstairs? Talking about health. Oh, yeah, that's right. Oh, yeah, that's right. He's always watching for those perfect entrances out of the bathroom, into the STD clinic. Why the haircut? I didn't mean to. The hairdresser was very attractive and I was a bit sleepy. And then she had such a confident look that I kind of dozed off for a bit and I woke up and I looked like Richie Rich. Just to be honest, I haven't prepared anything because I just didn't want to deal with the stress of preparing something. All right, I should get nervous. Practicing some of my jerky erratic moves. Practicing nervously presenting. Like these looks like... I mean, probably. Now, what do you think? Here's an idea I just made up. That's that look. Let's see. You've got to keep pacing, that's right. Don't make eye contact with anybody in the audience. Come over here and tell them that I didn't really prepare things, I just wanted to kind of keep it organic. That's always a good line. I just wanted to keep things kind of organic, guys. You know, more of a conversation. They're like, we didn't pay you to come and have a conversation with us. I know, but that kind of insulates me against the cringe, I hope. Did it? No, it made it worse, didn't it? All right, I really wish I'd just settled down with the first girlfriend that I got together with and had children and worked in the government. It was all a big mistake. Can you still talk? What's up? Big fan. Nice to see you. James, how's it going? Hey. What's up? This is my number. And my name is Sophia. You never got a number. You never fucking got a number. You got a number. Good to see you, Andrea. Hey, James. Hey, buddy! How you doing, man? He lives! I was like, who's that kind of... I'm ready whenever, so sure. He's probably, I would say, the best person in the world at what he does. That's right. Which is seducing. He's a seducer. So, please, if you can show him some infinite, infinite man love. The fantastic... Well done. Thank you. I was gonna ask, is there anyone here who knows who I am? And then, no, I don't need to ask that. That's good. Yeah, it's true. Sasha and I have been on many, many adventures. I'm one of the few people alive who's watched him scream and howl at the moon, vomit all over himself, himself, himself, all of them, and shit all over himself for six hours straight on Ayahuasca. So, I feel very close to you. And it's a pleasure to be here. They plan their careers, their finances, their investments. Their cars, the physical built environment around them, and yet they don't go, hang on, what kind of relationship life do I want to have? They're just like, I'm alone, I'm alone, I need to put my cock in something, and then this girl is passable on those metrics, and then here I am five years later going, what? What is wrong? Why do I hate myself? Oh, yeah, because I didn't make a choice. I was funneled into something. Right, so, and then that happens too with business partners or friendships or jobs. You just kind of get funneled into it, and then here you are, and you'll reap the consequences of whatever the environment and people around you are. And if you're lucky, cool, they'll support you, and if you're not, they'll fuck you over and you won't even know it. You won't have any systems in place for dealing with screening people, for understanding how people work. That's why seduction is the most important skill in correlation to all these other skills. It's not about hustling girls into bed, I mean, it is, but it's not only that. It's about people. Seduction is the art of negotiation, the art of influence, the art of charisma, the art of helping someone through their fear to their desire. That's what a salesman and a seducer do. And if you are a good seductive negotiator, a good seductive communicator, then you can start to read people and understand what they need, what are they hiding. Now, I've decided to build my own arc, and I've surrounded myself with a bunch of fucking weirdos, and I've identified pods of them all around the world, and I can bounce between these different communities, and I have a sense of belonging, even though I don't belong. Even though I'm at washing in this world, I feel at home wherever I am because I have the people around me, because I understand a bit about the culture, because I can go out in the street and meet a lover, probably today. If not today, probably tomorrow. It's not going to take me very long to start something where I'm like, oh, okay, I'm part of this place. I'm banging one of the girls. I've got a friend, a buddy here. I'm doing a deal here. I've got a couple of people on the road with me. That, to me, makes way more difference than if I made X amount of money or had some other physical metric of success. So, everybody, please make some noise! Make some noise! Hey, Mr. Pestmite. Yeah, nothing. You're fucking loaded. I know. It seems like, oh, yeah, this is the thing that I know how to do. I know. I knew it was a nice little trick. Mate, just 10, 15 minutes, mate. Do a little rant, and then it'll be fine. Good. Nice one. Good trick. My personal opinion, if we're looking at verbalizing consent and verbalizing in advance, I don't think this is a good idea often, because nothing pulls the power and magic out of a kiss more than me mentioning it, that it's coming. And I think, yes, you can talk your way out of nice situations, because often a woman, like, when does a woman decide to have sex with a man? Anyone? Well, she just, yeah, basically, she decides to do that, doesn't she? She doesn't usually decide to do that in advance, right? I mean, if we could, we would. We'd be like, cool, at 3.05 I'll be having sex, and I'm hoping 4.05 is going to be sex too. Women make those decisions emotionally and physically in the moment, right? So, which is why you need to be aware of when am I putting pressure, and I'm talking about pressure in the sense of, like, if I lean in to kiss, there's pressure here, right? Suddenly there's an expectation of what's going to happen. I used to verbalize a lot of things with girls, like that I was going to kiss them or that I wanted them to come inside and have sex with me or let's go to the bedroom and things like that. And I got enough feedback from girls of seeing the temperature just plummet to recognize that there was something overall wrong with this in terms of some girls liked it, but most of them didn't respond that well because she doesn't feel like saying yes right now. It's like if I'm at the doorstep and I'm like, do you want to come upstairs, have sex and it's cold outside and she's not quite, she's not going to make that decision then. She doesn't want to have to make a decision. That's why we make it easy by saying, hey, do you want to come inside and have some tea? Release of pressure, no hassle. She can come upstairs. A girl says to me, I'm not sure if you should come up and I say, you can kick me out at any time. I'm just releasing pressure off this point where she has to make a decision. She's like, I don't want to make a decision about sex right now. Don't, just chill. And we'll just progress. And then when we get to this next stage, we'll see what happens. Now, of course, I'm not doing this in a way where I'm like trying to slime past her resistances. It's that, yeah, as I reach resistance points where she decided that her boundary is here currently, if I now make a big deal, okay, I lean in to kiss her, she turns her head away from me. That's not a bad thing. If she goes, whoa, that's bad. She wasn't expecting me. If she just goes like this, if I now talk about this, okay, all right, so you don't want to kiss me right now. Let's talk, in whatever way, no matter how well I do it, I'm making this a big deal. Instead, if I just stay there for a moment, breathe on her neck for one breath, come back, smile, and then change the topic. I have dealt with the consent here, right? I am doing this, and it's very intelligent. Okay, I went to make a move, and we're having a conversation. I'm going, I'm coming to kiss you. She's like, not right now, and then I don't react or freak out in any way. I go, cool, this is gonna be all right. Let's stay in this sexy little moment for a second. Are you cool? You all right? I'm checking with her. You all right? Yeah, all right, cool. And you got any pets? And now what's happened, what's happened is in that moment, she is desperately full of all sorts of delicious emotions because she resisted me for one of many reasons. Sometimes girls will do it specifically to see what I'm gonna do. Often they just go, oh, I don't know, and turn her head. She just feels under pressure. Maybe she wants to kiss me or something, or there's, her ex is over there, it's in a bar, it feels trashy or whatever. She turns. Now the conversation is like, I don't feel comfortable right now, right now. And I'm like, okay, I see that in my emotions. I'm like, I see that. I'm not gonna freak out about it. So let's just stay in this little moment. And now let's shift it into something else. Now I have had a conversation about consent here. I just didn't do it with words. I'm reading things moment by moment because a woman's boundaries will just slide. She can have a hard no, and then I just show her that I'm cool with that hard no, then it's all gone. Because she just needed to see that I would stop if she needed me to. Oh, I don't need to let him do, I don't need that anymore. I don't need that anymore. So I'm trying to teach people very alternative ways of living, and I want to give them the full picture of what that involves. It's like, it's not simple or easy, and it has its own dark sides. And then if you navigate it well, then you can, means that most of the time you're gonna be having a great life. And when it's shit, you'll be able to get through that faster. Thank you, man. I appreciate it. I appreciate you, bro. Thank you so much. I've been around a lot of spiritual communities and I've met a lot of people who talk about spirituality, and they just have different types of phrasing and lexicon or buzzwords where everyone talks about energy or whatever, but they're still just normal people with their same ego, they just have replaced it with their spiritual ego. I'm not saying anyone here, I'm not saying that that's what these people in this community are like, but I've experienced that, and I'm not interested in that. I don't want to sit around and talk to someone about energy or spirituality unless it's practical to do it. I'm not cynical about spiritual practices, I just don't want to hang around and talk about spirituality. It's like a coffee table kind of subject because it actually makes me feel hypocritical what I'm doing. Like, if I'm talking about meditating more than I'm meditating, then what am I doing? Skinny Sasha. Yeah, it's crazy, right? I know. Have you seen me with my shirt off? No, but I'm kind of scared to. There'll be all these bits of you missing. James never, he's never done a bad talk. He's never done a bad talk. I've seen, I don't know how many I've seen you do. Lots. And they've either been good or really good, but I've never seen him do it and people are like, eh. Nah. Nah, hasn't happened yet. I kind of want that in some way. Yeah, yeah. Just experience, like, seeing it all not quite hit. People like, do I want you to get it? They're like, come on. No, you just didn't do it. I know, I've seen him do a talk that the host of one of the events didn't like very much, but I thought it was fine. I was like, yeah. To be honest, I wasn't blown away by that one. It was fine. It was the best. It was the experimental version. Yeah, yeah, but I wasn't like, ah, no. How was my talk? It was fine. It was fine. It wasn't, to be honest, I wasn't in the space of creating a new masterpiece like I have previously, so I thought I'd just chat about things that I like and I know when other people ask me questions, so it was fine. I mean, it's good to see Sasha in his power. He's looking much happier and skinnier. It's nice to see how these conferences have evolved from being, like, dirty pick-up conferences to now being about infinite love and light. I'm just the only one left over from the dirty days. Oh, mate. I'll tell you a few dirty tricks if you still want. That's my role. Anyway, it was fun. And now I'm finished with all obligations for six weeks, so I'm just going to do a bit of this.
