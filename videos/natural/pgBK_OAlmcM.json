They may be, but they may well not be. You know, the thing that differentiates the hangout buddy, the drinking buddy, and the real friend or the real collaborator is... So what is collaboration? Best way to look at that first is what is not collaboration? And I would say that many of your relationships that you've had throughout your life were not collaborative efforts. They were hangouts, right? So you've got someone that you hang out with because of proximity, because you're in the same class or the same job or the same sporting team or whatever. And because of proximity and the amount of time you spend together, because you're next to each other in this event, whatever the thing is, you form a bond. And you can be mistaken in presuming that that is a real tribe member or that you're part of a real tribe. Sometimes you are, right? Sometimes, OK, proximity leads us to bond with people. And that's often in the younger years, high school, university, early events, when people are young and social and expanding, going through their experimenting and expanding processes. And if you kind of hang out with those people whilst things are going on, there's uni events and there's parties and there's Friday night drinks and barbecues and whatever. You can have the impression that, OK, I'm bonded with this person and they are my tribe member. They may be, but they may well not be. And the thing that differentiates whether they are or not a core member or a tribe, you know, a brother, someone that you can rely on, someone that's got your back, someone that you can go and conquer the world with. In my mind, my opinion, the thing that differentiates the hangout buddy, the drinking buddy and the real friend or the real collaborator is the investment, right? It's the investment of the currencies. And we've talked to, I think everyone understands the currencies exist, that they have greater and lesser values to different people. Sometimes you can, a currency is worth nothing in one place and it's worth a lot in another place. An example of that is my Australian accent. You know what that's worth in Australia? Nothing. Fucking nothing. You know what it's worth in the rest of the world? Something. And some places it's worth a lot. Some places I open my mouth and girls like, wow, you sound like someone who's destroyed the English language. And I go, yeah, it's right on aye. You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you just fucked it up. And some reason you like it because no one hates Australians. Fuck I know. That's more or less how I used to speak. And I never would use the word speak either. That's how I used to talk when I was Australian. And sometimes it's just you, right? Like, again, me and Liam and the other guys moved from Australia to Eastern Europe, where us as males of this type was worth a lot more than it was in Australia. You know why? You know what Australia has a huge glut of? What has way too much of? Hot men. Australia is full of fucking hot dudes. And on average, Australian women are not as hot as the Australian men. And you can see that in different countries, right? Russia, men. There's a saying in Russia, a man should be a little more attractive than a monkey. Just a little more, right? So having a punched in kind of potato face in Russia is no problem. As a dude, you can still sweep up Siberian sirens that would make the rest of us weep if you got some game and balls or just you're there. So it's like when I when we move to Eastern Europe, where the men are objectively less attractive, less have less money. Depends on the country. Some of them are super alpha, like Serbs and the Russians are like there's plenty of alpha men there. But places like Hungary, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Slovenia, the men are less forthright, have less game. They're they're easier competition. So we start to say, OK, we are currency or we have multiple currencies of various types. We trade them and we must invest them in other people or in in in a collaborative event or project. And we have to take risk on losing those currencies. Otherwise, we're just drinking buddies. Right. So what does that mean? That means that I have to be willing to lose and I will lose multiple times along this lifestyle design process. Like when I look back over the many events that I've run or co-run or been part of, a number of them were complete failures in in the sense that their outcome, which was to create money or create a party with lots of girls, for example, didn't work sometimes. And early on didn't work oftentimes or, you know, half the time. And I lost on many deals. Right. So one time me and John put on a benefit concert for Afghanistan back in 2001. Basically, 9-11 happened. The world was, you know, understandably upset about that. And we decided to put on a benefit concert because at the time, like Bowie and everyone was doing benefit concerts for the victims of 9-11. And so we decided to do a benefit concert for Afghanistan, which was now having the shit bombed out of it. Not to the Taliban. We weren't providing money to the Taliban. Just listen. Oh, fuck. Now I've said that on film. Now I've got another file. And we weren't funding the Taliban. All right. We were trying to send money to poor people who were getting their shit bombed out of them. And so we threw this huge benefit concert where I got all these bands in and I invested a lot of my own money and a whole bunch of people helped me. Like all my crew helped me put it together. And we needed something like 200 people through the door to break even. Because we paid money to a big event and a big location and to bands and whatever. And we sold 187 tickets. And so we not only didn't make a single cent to send to Afghanistan, I lost $3,246 and that's all I had. It was a failure, right? I mean, it didn't achieve the outcome. Didn't have all the people I wanted. Didn't have the money that I wanted. And, you know, it was a big event that we tried to. We really had our heart in the right place. We put a lot of effort and time and money and creative talents and so on. And then it just didn't didn't pay off for anyone, certainly not Afghanistan. You know, that was another one in the string of many events that, say, John and I or me and the band members threw in everything, succeed or fail. We now have a tighter level, a tighter level of trust, a tighter bond. Sometimes something can fail so hard that it splits the group apart. All right. But these are these are good tests of how it actually works. So always keep that in mind. And I want you to go back over your lists when you looked at early on week one, we're looking at dividing our groups into inner circle collaborators, Facebook groups, and have a think through like people that you have collaborated with or that you do collaborate with and have a have a look at the actual dynamic of the relationship. Are you really collaborating in the sense that is the other person just turning up to your thing? Are you taking all the risk and the other people just turn up? So where do you where do you exist? Are you just someone who turns up and doesn't really provide any value? Do other people just turn up and not provide value? Do you just sort of hang out and kill time together? And there's nothing wrong with that. Like I kill time with people a lot and I spend time with my collaborators doing fuck all right. We just sit around shooting the shit sometimes or take a bag of chips and fucking roll around on the ground. Like we're not always, always collaborating on high level things. So it's fine to shoot the shit, hang out with people and waste a bit of time from for fun. OK, that's fine. But if that is the bulk of the way that you interact with with your social circles, then you're not really collaborating. Therefore, you're not designing a life or you're not designing a life collaboratively. Maybe you're doing stuff by yourself, which is which is definitely legit. But lifestyle design is massively about the people, the networks and the effects that you have as groups or as tribes.
