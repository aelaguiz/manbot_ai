I've been doing it for many, many years, six, seven years across different countries, different cultures, and I got amazing results with it all the time. The problem is, most guys approach badly. When you're a young guy, going out for the first time, you know, doing your first approaches, standing in front of a girl, being like, oh, you're very beautiful, you know, and it's kind of awkward, it's kind of cringy. Nobody taught you. I can't really blame you. It's amazing what you do, and it's amazing even when you take a step out of the house with the intention to approach. That's already growth. Do you think women love swiping on Tinder, getting the same text all the time, doing the same texting, getting ready for a date to talk about the same four topics like university, do you have pets, what do you do as a job? It's boring for them as well. It's an amazing kind of alternative to just like being surprised positively by a good, confident, masculine approach."}
