I'm not completely redundant in my technology Then you only get the benefits of what that group Has right so remember that's what we talked about from the very beginning We're looking at like okay when you did your social inventory you're like cool I got six friends. We're all of this type of brain, and we do this same type of thing That's a problem because we don't have new blood. We don't have new ideas. We don't have variety of genders We don't have a gay guy. It's cool having a great gay guy in your crew. We need one We haven't had a gay guy in years actually we need a gay guy Steph find us one cool one Because you're limited by what each other What each other's currencies are sure if you want to go to learn a specific skill like I would Totally go to a nerdy blacksmithing course to learn how to make my own swords And I will do that that's been on my list for a while And there'll be one blacksmithing chick there who I will not be into and it'll be a bunch of weird old dudes Who are very particular about the way that they forge swords right? I'll choose to go and do that because I want to learn how to do swords And I'm and I like meeting nerds who are of any type really nerds who are really into something Okay, but that doesn't yield me Anything in my lifestyle with regards to women or to expanding my social circle probably maybe who knows maybe I'll meet someone there Who's a mover and shaker who also is into swords? But probably not so you get get it out of your head that you know what you'd like Fucking forget your opinions You don't have a right to have opinions about what you do and don't like in terms of social scenes if you haven't experimented with them I Don't want to ever hear anyone say and I don't want you to say it to yourself. Oh, that's just not me really Really? What's not you? So what is you these four things that you've done for ten years the rest of the things that are available in on the entire? Planet now, they're just not me fuck off go and find out what else you are All right, go and see. Okay. I've gone to all sorts of events where I'm like, oh, this isn't me And I go just fucking do it too bad. Okay, I'm here at some hippie dance fest and I feel weird about that I'm not the kind of guy who's what do you mean? Just okay Become the kind of guy who today is gonna learn how to do a hippie dance thing and then I find out something about myself About the way I move about my ego about that Actually, I really enjoyed this thing that I thought I would hate or no I really fucking hate this thing that I thought I would hate and okay now I've got a now but did I did I set Myself up to hate it. Did I go in going? I'm gonna hate this and then prove it or did I go in neutral and go? All right, let's let's deal with the uncomfort discomfort. Let's let it move through us Let's just join in the process and see what we can get out of it. Okay, this is gonna be important I know that still for some of you or many of us the world is not yet open There are lots of groups that don't yet haven't got back to grouping. Okay, you research you try and do online versions And then as soon as it's possible to safely go and do a tango class or a whatever class then go and do it There's only four days left for you to take advantage of the lifestyle design Academy This is my second iteration of my most popular ever online course And I'm releasing it with over a hundred hours of extra bonuses So if you've been sitting on the fence thinking is this for me? Am I the kind of guy that should then hopefully this video has cleared that up for you. You don't have the right To decide what type of lifestyle it is that you really want or the type of guy that you are and aren't until you've gone Out and experimented because otherwise you put yourself in an unnecessary rat maze in a restrictive box that defines you by I like this and I don't like this the LDA gives you an incredible experience of experimenting with a wide range of thought processes of Emotional processes and of course taking that out into the real world to make real world changes. This is going to involve Challenging some of your tightly held beliefs. It's going to involve you facing your ego Your fears you're going to have to be a fool Sometimes you're gonna have to be a beginner sometimes because if you want to move into new areas of mastery You have to come in as a humble student. The LDA is a school of life It's for myself and for the guys who have joined it to go out and explore Themselves in relation to the world to find out what else they are not to just be like, I don't like that I do like that bit. It's like okay drop that Approach life with a beginner's mind and in that way you'll be able to Milk much more out of it So once again, you've only got four days left to join the LDA after that I'm shutting the doors taking everything down because then I'll be moving on to coaching the guys in the course full details Click the link in the description. Hope to see you on the first lecture You"}
