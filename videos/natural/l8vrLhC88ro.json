Anyway, today I have something very special for you. This is time to celebrate the one millionth view that the National TV has had on YouTube. So, as a special thanks to all that one million fans or, you know, I guess I've been hanging around Sasha too long when I'm doing that. To say thanks to the one million fans or possibly one really weird fan who watched it one million times, what I wanted to do was to drag something out of the archives. No, come back. That's wrong. No, don't approach me like that. That's not right. So, in 2004, I was in China. I had a shaved head and I was a monk, essentially. And believe it or not, I appeared on Chinese TV. What was I doing on Chinese TV? Well, nobody knew for the next ten years because the file type that this video was connected to was some obscure Chinese file that was totally incomprehensible. It wasn't until 2013 when I met the amazing Arthur Moore, who is now behind the camera, who finally cracked the code and was able to pull this piece of footage out, and now it is to be presented to the world. So, as a special thank you to my fans, to Arthur Moore, to Sasha Dagan for helping to make me famous, to all the awesome people that we've met on this incredible ride, and here's to many, many, many more hits in the future. I present to you the lost footage of James Marshall as a kung fu skiing monk. Thank you, everyone. Thank you. Hello. How do you do? What's your name? Ni hao. W\u01d2 de m\u00edng s\u00e8 James.
