I've taken all the feedback from the first round of guys that came through this course, as well as testing this out live, constantly through my live workshops, and I've now come up with the tweaked, improved version. So, what is Martial Meditation Method all about? This is a five-week live course, so it's not just a dump of material to stick on your hard drive. It's guided. It has accountability through a daily Facebook group, through live webinars, and through the drip feeding of instructional videos on how to stack your meditation practice day by day. So, starting out with very, very simple aspects and gradually encompassing more complex aspects of meditation. Now, why would we even bother with meditation when you came here to learn about picking up chicks? Right now, if you've followed me for any length of time, you know that this is something that's very important to me in terms of what I personally do and in terms of how I teach people. The foundational principle of my seduction system is awareness. It's not just, you know, the basic awareness of like, okay, I'm kind of, you know, feel the breeze on my skin. That's one element of it, but it goes much, much deeper. The reason why I accelerated so fast with seduction when I first started and the reason why I'm able to help guys who have social anxiety, who are more introverted, guys who often have trouble expressing themselves or being able to, you know, run up to a stranger and let them know that they have desire for them. The reason this is so powerful for them is it allows them to analyze, diagnose, and start to adjust themselves internally. If you see a pretty girl and you want to go and talk to her, but you have a whole bunch of activation in your body, you guys know what that feels like, tightness in your throat, trembling in your fingers, jiggling things that don't need to be jiggled, butterflies in your stomach, mind going blank, right? All of these things that we would often perceive to be approach anxiety, really what this is, it's a series of activations, right? Usually you're in a homeostatic space, you're like, okay, I'm normal, my heart rate's normal, my temperature's normal, and then we have certain things that throw us out of kilter. Now, when it's a gorgeous woman that you're invested in trying to start something with, then often that throws us way more out of balance than it really should. The men who are able to not control this with will, you know, trying to block things out or tough it out, because I don't think that really works in the long term. Men who are able to allow these feelings to move through them and to not get caught up in them, to be more objective, to be someone who can allow things to move, these are the people that become more successful. Because seduction is not an exact science, you can't predict what's going to happen, women are not robots, it's always going to be chaotic, and so you need to be able to be comfortable in the chaos. And that's hard when you're trying to hold on to a system and trying to know step-by-step what I'm going to say and do next. I never promise that that's what I teach, I teach principles, broader frameworks, which then allow you to express yourself in your own unique way. Meditation is the tool that helped me become myself. Now in a way, we're always ourself, but we're ourself with layers, with masks, with fears, with our conditioning, with our beliefs, all of this stuff layered on top of it, which often gets in the way of our instinct. When you're out trying to approach a woman and make a connection, the things you say matter so much less than the intensity and the quality of your eye contact, the way you touch, the way you move, your voice cadence, all of this stuff I've gradually adjusted over time through awareness meditation, from the inside out. Because when I feel more relaxed, when I am present and in the moment, then my mind is clearer, then it's natural for me to reach out and touch, natural for me to make clear eye contact and project sexual intent, because I'm just unblocking and allowing attraction to flow. A lot of people think you have to create attraction, as if it doesn't exist between men and women, you have to do all this fancy stuff, and then some of it appears, and then if you do something wrong it disappears into the sand again, it's not like that. Men and women are attracted to each other in general, and it's about allowing the damn walls to break and this attraction to mix. Often the damn wall is created by you, you are the one creating all sorts of barriers. Of course she has her own shit and we need to be able to navigate through her barriers, but often it's men using shame against themselves, fear against themselves, locking themselves down, repressing themselves, and obviously that didn't come from you originally, it's not your fault, it may have come from your family, your religion, your conditioning, the media or whatever, but in a way we self-police. The martial meditation method was designed for guys who can't come to my courses because they're too expensive or they live on the other side of the world, and also to sift through all the spiritual mumbo-jumbo that's online. There are so many traditions, so many techniques out there, a lot of them promise a lot but can't really deliver, a lot of them are based on very specific spiritual traditions, so you have to become a Buddhist or wear these beads or chant the name of some dead dude. Most guys I work with don't want that, and I don't want that, I want a practical man's guide to meditation, I want a tool that works, and this is the tools that I've taken. I've studied all around the world, China, India, Southeast Asia, Europe, seeking out different masters and teachers of embodiment, of martial arts, meditation, spirituality, and over time I've pulled out the pieces that I've found to be most effective, most practical, the pieces that actually changed my life, and I found things like chanting someone's name didn't, whereas I found learning to, on a very precise level, observe sensations, observe the interrelation between mind, body, emotions, understanding how my reactive patterns work, how my frustration or my anger or my depression, those things that used to be really powerful in my life and have control over me at different points, I now have control over them because I understand them on a deeper level. Meditation is easy to learn, like to learn the technique, it's not hard, but it requires dedication, and it requires usually a sounding board, and so I've created this course as a brotherhood, as a community, so that we have interface with each other all the time, we can talk about it, because meditation is very challenging once you start digging below the surface, your shit comes out, things that you've been hiding and repressing, aspects of yourself that have been latent or you've been avoiding, suddenly when you sit with no phone, no distractions, no way to escape from yourself, and you're there, even if it's just for some minutes, the real aspects of you start coming out, the good, the bad, the ugly, and you have to become really honest with yourself and accept yourself as you are currently, and then with good, precise awareness, embodiment, qigong, breath control methods, then you're able to shift and change, essentially to rebuild and remorph yourself in the way that you want to. So martial meditation method, it's live right now, if you want to join you just need to click the button up here if you're on a phone, button down there if you're on a laptop. The course, as I said, it runs over five weeks, every week you're exposed to a brand new set of meditation tools which stack from the week before, this includes seated, standing, lots of moving meditation, originally I found it really difficult to sit still, most people do, and I found by learning things like qigong, tai chi, so this is where we are mixing movement, awareness, and breath, and we're aligning these, these can be a really powerful way for people to have an immersive experience of awareness and of meditation, so I have a lot of exercises along those lines. There's also a huge package of bonuses for this launch, there's a whole bunch of interviews with my favourite sex gurus, spiritual teachers, there's also an entire bonus section on how to translate your meditation practice into the bedroom, it's no secret that most men don't last as long as they want, and unfortunately the complaints come from women that many men are not particularly sensitive or good at communicating in the bedroom. Effective meditation, especially when you're learning to do abdominal breathing and to control your diaphragm, your abdominal muscles, this is the technique that will allow you to have stamina essentially for as long as you want, so to be able to last as long as you want in the bedroom you need to be able to adjust your arousal state, most men lose control very, very quickly, when you are able to use your breathing and your awareness to slow everything down you can be a boss in the bedroom. Also, what makes a man excellent in bed is not so much about his techniques, okay, no one at this does this, or a bit of this, or some special move, it's more about his ability to be sensitive, to be able to communicate both verbally and non-verbally, to be able to adjust and shift to the needs of the moment, because you don't plan great sex, it's something that happens when two people are in sync with each other. Being meditative allows you to get out of your head, stop worrying about whether you're doing it right or trying to distract yourself so you don't come, and to bring yourself back into the present whilst utilizing these techniques, which I'll show you, in order to ride the cusp and allow yourself to last as long as you need to. Whole bunch of other amazing bonuses with all sorts of different qigong exercises, stretching, self-massage, and as I said, interviews with all of my favorite gurus. So, if you'd like to join me for the martial meditation method and get the full bonus package you have from today, the 16th, through to the 23rd of September, click the links to find out full information, and I'll see you on the first day of the course. www.mooji.org"}
