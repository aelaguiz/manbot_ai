I had to be at the point where I was like, I'm okay with myself. If she doesn't like me, I actually don't mind. Women are not expecting you to be perfect. So welcome to the New York Presidential, how's everyone going? Any other words aside from a timid, good, excited, scared, he went straight to fear. Not even just a bit nervous. All right, well, we're here, we're real and we're really doing this. So welcome gentlemen. Better with women. How do you know you're better with women? Does that mean that you talk to the lady at the bus stop once a week or does it mean you're going on dates and getting laid? Does it mean you're setting up a lifestyle? Does it mean that you are moving strategically out of scarcity into an abundance and so on? That you're improving XYZ skills, mindsets, confidence metrics or whatever it is to get to the point where you're getting the results that you want. That's what we're here to do this week is to create results in the real time and to mean that over the next six months, 12 months that your dating life will vastly accelerate. In seven days, you will not be a 100% change man that all done. Anyone who thought that? I hope we didn't promise that. You will have the skills to do that. You will have way more experiences than you possibly ever had in this area. Like when was the last time you approached 70 to 100 very beautiful women and had a conversation with them? That's going to happen. You're going to meet 10-ish girls a day, give or take and properly. You're going to go in there and try and have a conversation and often you will. You're going to have a very dense amount of experiences of all types. It's important that you have some kind of acceptance of that, some grace about that. Like I'm going in here to learn and I will experience what I experience. It won't all be fun and games, but it will all be good. Yes, it is actually becomes a really big relief once you start approaching girls and getting rejected to know that you did your job, to know that you're not going to walk away from that wondering what if, because you know what if, she said no, and you know that you as a man did your job to follow your desire to a point where it couldn't go anymore. It's very liberating. The unfortunate reality is that so many men today leave their dating and romantic lives up to chance, expecting that a digital app or their social circle or fate is going to deliver them the girl of their dreams into their laps, which very rarely happens. The primary purpose that we have at The Natural Lifestyles is taking guys through a journey of self-discovery and development of autonomy in this area. Being able to actually go out, choose somebody that they're really interested in to develop the confidence, the self-esteem, and of course the social skills to make sure that that's actually going to be effective. So I've never really cold approached a girl without having the interest or the signals of really, really strong signals that I could think, okay, that's going to be an easy thing. Whilst trying to cold approach, it was always so many things happened to my body that it really never went there. In this split second where I saw the girl, it was like my feet would walk away in the other direction. So I actually really never cold approached a girl, yes. It makes me really, really excited. It makes, of course, just the thought about it, makes my heart pump and my body react to it, of course. But really having someone besides me or training me in what will happen or what could happen or just really having someone who knows what's going to happen and makes me feel very safe about what's going to happen. So I really give myself away in other hands, in professionals that know what they're doing. When a really hot girl goes around the corner and you say, ah, I missed that, I don't want to miss that anymore. It happened so often to me in life, and now I want to take action and really go after that second where my brain says or my feet say, go walk away. I want to go into this fear. I cannot imagine now on my level I am now, I cannot imagine what's going to happen in a week or two. Is there anything you're worried about? No, hopefully you'll never see us again. We're like sleazy Mary Poppins. The other thing Marco is admitting to himself is, yes, every time I see a beautiful woman, every time I see an attractive girl, I get all sorts of feelings in my body, in my mind. I go through different thought patterns and I'm almost paralyzed. And let's be honest, guys, like we all have those feelings when we go out on the street and beautiful, attractive women cross our ways. What's different about Marco, though, is he admitted that to himself and not only to himself, to the whole world now by being filmed on this workshop. And that's really amazing. That takes a lot of courage and bravery and is really the first step to then take action. He takes action by coming on the workshop and letting us, social coaches, so to say, guide him into this new place and new earth. So that's really fucking awesome. My name is Alonso. I'm from Mexico, grew up over there and then moved to the States to do my bachelor's and master's degree. And now I'm working as an engineer. I was trying to figure out seduction on my own, try different products, but it didn't work. So I found one video from James online where he talked about seduction faces and that opened the door to TNL, learn more about it, like it the way they do it, the products they have, the style they teach, which is very immersive. So they take you seven days and they make sure that you learn. That's the main reason that I'm here. I live in an environment where I will have eyes looking at me and tell me what I'm doing right, what I'm doing wrong, but also make it happen. So no, just keep waiting because we always fall on the trap. Like I would do it later tomorrow, next month, next year, and it never comes. So I think the moment is now and the opportunity was here and I just make the effort to make it. Most of the people believe the same old excuse that the right girl will show up. And as James says before, a girl will show up, but usually it's not someone that is very compatible with you. I think your partner, your life partner is a big, big piece in your fulfillment or your happiness in your life. And if you don't make the effort to attract it and become the man that will attract that girl, it's just not going to happen. So you ended up in a relationship that is, you are together, but you really hate each other. Or you have so many different values that you're pulling yourself apart and it's not making you grow. Okay, the idea of approaching girls, yeah, it scared me. I don't know why, because it's so simple. For me, the idea of approaching someone, if I have an excuse, that won't make that fearful. Like I need to ask for a direction or I need to get around the city and ask something quick. That's easy. But at least in my case, when I consciously said, okay, I like that girl. I want to see if something can happen. I just froze. I cannot break through. When I try to make things happen, my lower self show up. The girls which I have something happening, most of the times, I mean, I'm not proud of this, but they did the work. So I just have to say yes. Deep down, I mean, I like them, but I didn't feel that connection. I don't want to wait like 10 years to master these skills. The quality of your life, bottom line is the quality of your life is the quality of your relationships. So I want to have a high quality life. I need to have high quality relationships, skills or mindsets. This workshop offered that. So it's not appropriate to be fear mongering and be suggesting that you're going to die alone or be alone forever. The reality is that there's so many people on the planet and everyone wants to get laid and get together with someone that most likely you're going to get together with somebody at some point. Most of the guys that have worked with us have had girlfriends, some kind of relationships in the past. The problem being is that as Alonzo is talking about here, they didn't necessarily choose the girl, right? Because they didn't have much choice. They didn't have the ability to go out there and just walk up to a stranger and make something happen. They had to wait. And so that means that, yeah, OK, sometimes a girl is going to make the move or she's going to make it easy on you or by proximity or being drunk at a party or all the kind of, let's say, less brave ways that people hook up. Yeah, sure. This is going to happen. But much worse than being alone, I think, is being with the wrong person, and especially when you accumulate years into the relationship. OK, sometimes you start dating someone and it fizzles early on. You figure out you're not compatible. But if you're staying in a relationship out of scarcity and you invest years into that, you can't get those years back. And I often think about this, that like your life is like a series of brackets of times where you spent it with somebody or with people. Like your friends, your family, your lovers. And that time when you were 22 to 27 and you stayed with that one girl that was like, yeah, it was kind of all right, but like, you know, I never really felt it. And that's what he's mentioning here. He might have liked a girl, but he didn't feel the spark. And, you know, this is vitally important that if you have a long term partner, you choose a relationship that you are desperately into that person, that you have a lot of passion and that you guys, you know, have smoldering sexual chemistry, that you want to grow and learn and change together. And without that, then it can just become a stale treading water kind of relationship until one of you gets sick of it and you break up and then you come back out into scarcity again. And then you're obviously then at danger of the next time the not quite right combination comes up. You'll just take it out of fear. Important factor in what we're really doing is helping guys shift at a much deeper level than just the mind as well, because it's easy to think of these things. I mean, right now, you know, you watch a video and you get the idea, but to really step into the experience of that, to become somebody that's actually commanding reality with choice by taking actual action, by being somebody who's facing your thoughts, facing your feelings, stepping into the unknown, seeing what happens that creates like a deep shift in identity inside of a person. And particularly for the guys that go through this process, it creates this sense of like confidence and self-worth that starts to grow inside them. And if they consistently keep that up and nourish that, then it will give them a state of being that will free them from a lot of the things we just talked about, getting stuck in bad relationships, settling for mediocrity, letting opportunities pass you by, allowing yourself to live with regret. So really, it's incredibly important to be somebody that steps into reality, making choice and being capable of going for it. Anything you're concerned about, worried about? No, maybe I hope to be pushed to the level, but also not that much to make it so painful that I end up trying later. I mean, I want to experience fears that I may not down for face it, but I don't want to make it so painful that I end up... We're not here to make it painful. It's not the point of it is, we're not here as drill sergeants sadistically ordering you around to do horrible things. We could, we've experimented with that, doesn't usually work that well, right? So we will be harsh if we need to be, we will tell, we'll call people out on their excuses and we'll bust your balls if we need to, but for the most part, we're there to encourage you, right? So yes, we will certainly push you to go past your comfort zones and if we feel and if we see that it's taking you too far, then we'll just pull you out and go and have a cup of tea. So a key to really having effective transformation in this kind of process is to make sure that you don't overdo it too soon, because if you go outside your comfort zone too far, then it tends to just create overwhelm and the brain's like, and denies access to actually learning. So it's really important to create small little doable chunks and develop in a way that's like consistent. And then of course the nervous system acclimatizes quite quickly and we see that a lot. Like the intensity of transformation that happens in these kinds of workshops is very, very dramatic actually. So it's very normal that guys can have like overwhelm. So we're very aware of like, how can we set guys up to make sure that they're getting just enough to push them beyond their comfort zone in a way that's helping the nervous system grow and helping their subconscious really learn what they need to learn so that they can get what they really desire, as opposed to just like saying, go and approach that girl and do that thing, which is, you know, I think that's what happens to a lot of people out there when it comes to this kind of work. Sometimes guys get even kind of addicted just to the social freedom aspects, like throwing themselves out into the most extreme situations, approaching five girls with their boyfriends and their fathers, you know, to really kind of push that kind of adrenaline spike. It's not necessary to be doing that. And I think in the early stages, like sometimes it's fun and cool to like throw yourself way out into the deep end of something you have no idea what to do and then flounder around. But yeah, if you are constantly putting yourself into that panic of failure, of incompetence, of not knowing, of being totally unfamiliar with the environment, then for the most part that's going to cripple people. And if this process doesn't eventually become fun, I mean, it's not always fun, but if it doesn't become something that is enjoyable overall, then you won't really do it long term. All of us continue doing this stuff, not because we're like, I have to do this. You know, this is the only way I'm going to have a good life. It's like. Okay, I understand the alternative sucks, but this actually becomes a joy over time. If I'm constantly looking for, where is that edge? And your comfort zone is, it's not like you just have one and then you eventually make it a bit bigger, a bit bigger. It's like, it's in flux and change all the time, depending on your mood and the people you're hanging out with and you know, your diet and all sorts of other stuff. So that you are going to be needing to watch that thing because it will retract again. You can kind of go back into complacency and fear. And you want to be looking at, okay, where are my edges all the time? Where are places where I've created unnecessary prisons for myself, where I'm now running in a little rat maze and not going that way because I have fear over there, when that way would be the best way to go. So yeah, this is a tricky thing. It's why like being a good seduction dating social coach is not a simple thing. It's not like just go talk girl and you know, what did you say? You should have said that better. There's so much nuance and so much subtlety to it that we have to be monitoring the guys and then transferring those skills so that they can become self-monitoring and then they can make us obsolete. I'm from Austria, so maybe I can relate a lot with you guys. I grew up in Austria, technical high school and basically in my teens, while I should have been learning about girls and how to connect and how to get laid or get drunk in a bar, I was learning about, I don't know, physics and how transistors work. During like a residential in a different country for a year, I stepped over my fears a little bit more and I learned, holy shit, this is amazing. This is way more fun than just like being closed and the world is really up for play. And this is also when I joined JNL behind the camera and this kept with me and now more and more, I just practice day gaming became really fun for me. Like from this background of overthinking everything, analyzing every step, which I still do a lot. Like I'm still in the core, I'm still that analytical guy, but I learned how to have fun out there, how to make it a routine, not to overanalyze it, have fun with it and really enjoy the game. And that's what I'm doing now every day, basically. You have us for seven days. We will force you to approach, no doubt about that. You will approach girls tomorrow. But when you come back to your home cities, it's super important to keep doing it and you're only gonna keep doing it when it is fun, when it is enjoyable. Like if it's a torture every time you talk to a girl, you have to push yourself, you will stop pretty quickly. So that's what I wanna give you guys, that enjoyment of it, that not everything is super analytical because I really understand the thinking behind it. Hey guys, I'm John Keegan. Really, I look at everything in three ways for you guys. This whole course, our whole journey as men is about connection. And the first thing we wanna do is connect to ourselves. Then we become very present and be connected to our environment. Be super, become super aware, great observers. And that's the path out of your head and into the now. And then of course, we wanna take this connection to others, to each other and to the women that we're gonna be meeting. And I'm here along the way to help you do that on the streets, in cafes, in bookstores, in supermarkets, in subways, wherever we find ourselves so that there's no reason ever again to not approach a woman. There's no way out. And there's always 99 reasons why not to do it. And I'm gonna share with you the one reason to always do with it. Do do it, you know? And that's really what we wanna be looking for. Welcome everybody. It's good to be here. Where are you going? What are you doing? What is the larger context of your existential orientation? Does it matter? Maybe it doesn't matter to you. That's fine as well. So there's various levels of drop in points and different things that I can talk about and would be happy to open as conversations because part of what I enjoy in this context is that we get to have a mastermind together for a week and you will be broken down and rebuilt many times. Probably the first time will be the worst and then you're gonna feel better and better about it until you actually love the process. So hopefully by the end of the week you will have a very different context of self. So part of that context of self in my opinion is liberation. To liberate yourself. There's a range of steps that you need to understand. There's a structure. There's mindsets, there's skills, there's strategies. So we need to work on all that and that's what we're here to do. And I look forward to what you bring to this training as well because this is just as much about what you guys are here to really get and what your curiosity and engagement brings out of us as coaches as well. Because we could probably do these things in our sleep but what makes it much more fun for us as well as effective for you guys is when you guys are really switched on and present with us as well. So, you'll be getting to know these dudes a lot more over the next week and unless you have any questions for them now, they may leave. Nice to meet you. Hope to see you soon. Bye. You just confused her into giving you her number. Really?"}
