How are you going? I've just flown in from New York City into Belgrade, Serbia, one of my favorite places in all the world, where I'm working on the finishing touches for the Marshall Meditation Method, which is my six-week online course on practical meditation for the modern man, how to dissolve your anxieties, get out of your head, get into flow and be a chilled-out, cool, smooth motherfucker. And this course is coming out this Friday, in only three days' time, on the 2nd of December. Marshall Meditation Method is going live, so stay tuned for that. Today, what I thought I'd do is talk to you in some detail about my own personal history, my own story in relationship to meditation. Now, I've lived a whole bunch of different stories in my life. I've done a lot of really weird, crazy stuff, from being a traveling funk musician, to a porn star, to eastern massage therapist, all sorts of stuff, which I will continue to add to as the years go by. But the foundation for all of my success, all of my happiness and all of my personal growth, has always been spirituality and meditation. From way back when I was a teenager, I got into this stuff quite heavily, and then it became the foundation and the direction, like the compass, for all of the directions that I took in my life. The product which I'm releasing this Friday is the culmination of literally 15 years of my own personal study and research into various schools and systems of spirituality and meditation, applying them in my own personal life, and then for the last nearly 10 years, helping students around the world to integrate them into busy modern lives. Most people do not have time or the wish to do what I did, which is go to mountains in China and ashrams in India, and spend 10 or 30 days just working on meditation every year. Most guys want something that's going to be applicable to them, that they can spend 20 minutes here and there and get tangible results. And that was my challenge, bringing this in as a teacher into the lives of my students, and also being able to integrate it not just into terms of learning how to relax and chill out or decompress in isolated meditation sessions, say in the morning or in the evening, but to be able to utilize it throughout the day. And that's something that I'll talk to you guys a little bit more about later. So let's go way back to the 90s, to the time of Pearl Jam, undercuts and baggy, stussy pants. As a teenager, I was an outcast. I was skinny, big-nosed, dorky and nerdy, into odd interests. I never really fit into the macho, sport-orientated culture of Australia. I was never a really good Australian. I'm still a bad Australian. I don't drink beer. I don't drive a ute. I don't beat up pofters. I don't have blonde hair and a little nose. I've never surfed in my life. I'm a shitty Australian. And that's alright now that I'm an internationalist, but way back when I was growing up, it was not okay. I got beaten up because I played the flute, I did theatre and I thought about weird stuff. And as I got into my teenage years, I really started to develop philosophies around life that were geared around nihilism. So I was an atheist. I didn't believe there was any higher power or any particular destiny or reason for us to be here. I thought we were just basically products of evolution. And life was essentially meaningless. There was no specific meaning for us to be here, aside from to reproduce. And I got into some complicated, dark forms of philosophy. Read a lot of the Dawes and Selene and Sartre and existentialists and nihilists, Camus and so on. And smoked a lot of weed and had a few friends who were also into these dark forms of philosophy. And so I essentially isolated myself from my community because I didn't feel like I belonged and developed a certain pride around my angst. So as a teenager, lots of teenagers are angsty, but I was invested in my angst. And because I didn't fit in, I had to rationalize this. So I had to create an identity, which is how we protect ourselves. When we don't necessarily fit into the status quo or the standard society, we create some story about why we are different and why we are essentially superior. And so I had it in my mind through my late teenage years that everyone else was superficial, didn't get it, didn't see the bigger picture, was conformist, was purely conditioned by their society to believe all this nonsense, particularly positive stuff, particularly stuff about your fate and your destiny and faith. These kinds of things were just juvenile thought forms to me. And the result of this kind of thinking, and I see this with students and guys on the internet who comment, the result of this thinking is very ineffective in real day-to-day life. These days, and it's a result of many, many years of meditation, I've come to the conclusion that your beliefs, your thought forms are not you. They're not solid, they're not real. They're things that you have been conditioned to believe, or you've conditioned yourself, as I was doing back in those days. And they help you to navigate the world, but what they do is they set a pathway for you, which is narrow and blocks out all other information. And that's how we essentially navigate through life. We've been taught that certain things are true, we hold beliefs strongly, and then we move through the world based around those beliefs. Now that can be really effective if you have really effective, positive beliefs. And you can have very positive but ineffective beliefs as well. Just being positive is not necessarily effective. Or you can have very negative beliefs and actually have effect in the world. Or you can have negative beliefs that are ineffective. And that's what I had, negative and ineffective. The two things that you don't want in a belief. These days, the way that I perceive beliefs, because I've meditated a lot and seen that I am not my thoughts, that I am not my beliefs, that they are not solid, is that I perceive beliefs now to be tools. They're useful if they have an effect in the world. So I will take on beliefs such as, it's cool to go and talk to chicks on the street because they'll like it. Or it's better to position yourself as an internationalist who's able to take advantage of currency fluctuations, and supply and demand, and the fact that there's hotter girls over here, and better food over here, and better weather over here, than it is to be a nationalist who's committed to your country. These are beliefs that I will try on and use because they are effective for me. They make my life better. But way back in those days, when I had ineffective and negative beliefs, the result was that even though I had a sense of significance, and I had lots of interesting, dark things to think about, I was miserable. And I was self-destructive. And I recognized around 18, as I was finishing high school, that I actually hated myself, I hated the world, I hated people, because I had invested so much time into these dark thought forms. And so I started to look at different other philosophies. And I became attracted to Eastern philosophies. I'm not exactly sure why. I think it was originally because of ninjas. Back when I was a kid, I was really into ninjas, as every kid is, because ninjas are fucking rad. And so I read some books on ninjutsu, and then that talked about their meditation techniques, and general, like the way of the samurai kind of stuff. I read Hagakure early on, and started getting invested and interested in concepts that came from Eastern philosophy. Because I was not at all interested in any form of philosophy that required you to have blind faith. And certainly not one that suggested that you should believe in a monotheistic god form that is directing shit from up in the sky and telling you not to masturbate. I was not down for that. But spiritual forms, which talked about nothing to do with faith, nothing to do with a god, but that offered you a way to change and grow and actually enjoy life, which is what I was getting the hint that these things provided, okay, that was of interest to me. So when I finished high school, I started reading a bunch of books about Buddhism, and me and my best friend went, instead of going to university, we went out to the deserts of New South Wales and Australia, and we worked on orange farms, picking oranges for 12 hours a day, which is really fucking boring and difficult work, and the trees are covered in spiders and spikes, little known that orange trees are covered in spikes, so I would stab myself in the finger multiple times per day. And I had a few books that I'd taken out there with me on spirituality and meditation. I read these, and then during the day, while I was fruit picking, started to try to apply some early forms of meditation through basic breath awareness and mantra work. And I found that this started to calm the surface level of my mind. As I initially started experimenting with meditation. Because what I noticed was, because I'd spent so much time invested in these dark thoughts, that I was trapped in these loops of thought. And this is common to most human beings, I think. It's like, we think a certain set of things, and then we run that shit round and round and round and round in our heads with micro variations, until they drive us literally fucking mad. And especially when these thoughts are about negativity and nihilism, and how nothing means anything, and how you're essentially meaningless, and life is shit. Running those thoughts over and over and over again in your head is going to lead you to being really fucking depressed. I wanted, more than anything, to be able to switch off my mind. To be able to just actually have some silence, and to have some peace. And that was my initial motivation for becoming a meditator. So in those early days out in the orange fields, I got a little taste of that. Not that I had any quiet, but that the clamour in my mind started to be less. That I had moments of peace. I remember standing up on my ladder, on the top of an orange tree at sunset, picking and just seeing the sunset over the desert. And you're like, why is there an orange field in the desert? Yeah, good question. Because they irrigated it against all the laws of nature and God, and grew an orange field in the desert. So it was like sunsets, and I had these moments of stillness or calm. So when I finished working there, my best friend and I went travelling around South East Asia. We started off in Bali in Indonesia. And one night, he and I went down to the beach, met some street kids, and they offered to sell us some magic mushrooms. And we said yes, of course, because we were 19. And so we bought these magic mushies and munched them. But we said to the guys, because we heard that we were pretty savvy travellers, we thought we didn't want to get ripped off. We thought maybe they were just selling us shiitakes. And we said, look, we're not going to pay you until they kick in. So we ate the mushrooms, and we sat with these kids chatting by the beach for like an hour, and nothing was happening. Hour and a half, nothing's happening. And the guys are starting to get a little bit aggro. And they're like, come on, where's the money? And I said, look, you know, they're not working, so we're not giving you any money. Eventually, they said, all right, we'll give you another dose. So they gave us a second dose of magic mushrooms, which we munched down. And immediately after we'd swallowed them, the first dose kicked in. And I remember I was sort of arguing with this street kid, and then his face just went all wonky and started melting, and his nose melted down his face. So I'm going, oh, blah, blah, blah. And then I went, right. Okay, take out the paper. He wants the paper. Give him the paper. Wave at him. Smile at him. Turn around and take your friend by the hand, and you walk. So suddenly we're like walking on the moon, and the palm trees are going. As we like clamber our way back to our hotel room, managed to get in there. We were closing the door, and then the door just went off into space. This was really a really, really heavy overdose of very psychoactive mushrooms. So for the next like 24 hours, we were locked in this hotel room going insane. I have like vague flashes of what happened that night, and it was weird, weird shit. But in amongst all that madness and me like howling at the moon and thinking I was some kind of devil or whatever, I had these transcendent moments. So I started going through this process where my ego was dissolving, my identity was dissolving, my sense of James Marshall-ness was disappearing into the ether. And I started to feel like I was all sorts of different people, and I was like going through history being like a soldier in the Roman army and then being like the victim of a rape of an El Salvadorian soldier and like being man, woman, king, pauper, like experiencing all of these lives and having these like cosmic breakthroughs where I suddenly saw the truth and like let go of all these fears and worries and all this nonsense that I've been holding on to and this sense of myself and just having these ecstatic amazing awakenings. And this went on for hour after hour or appeared to be hours and hours, may have been a minute. Anyway, like at the end of it, I remember we wake up the next morning just like in the hotel room was trashed and like fear and loathing style. And I came to and my first thought was I saw the truth and now I've lost it. It's because immediately I was back to just me and I was like I'm back in this small mind and small beliefs and I'm hungry and I'm annoyed and I'm a bit irritated at my friend for some silly reason and all of this stuff and I was like I'm back in this small mind of mine. And right then and there I thought all right, there's got to be a way to experience something like that without drugs. I need to be able to live in that. Consciousness more closely if my mind can take me there if I can be in a space where I don't I don't feel the compression of my small mind and my attitudes and my beliefs if I can live in a more like in this Moment by moment way, then that would that's the only thing that matters. That's that should be my pursuit for life all right, so then and there I Decided okay. I'm gonna go and find teachers I'm gonna go and find somewhere to meditate and to Figure this shit out and explore this and so I said to my friend look man. I need to go off by myself I got to be alone And so we separated and I went off wandering around Bali for a while Thinking about this trying to do a bit of meditation from stuff that I'd learned in books and not not getting very far We met back up again, and then we flew to India So what I did is I started we were traveling around the north of India And I started asking people because there was monks of various types there was Hindu monks and there was Buddhists and various people there's all sorts of spiritual people or pseudo-spiritual or Psychospiritual people in India and there's also huge industries based around ripping off White men who are going there to find themselves so I had funny experiences where you know, I'd meet some yogi and You know, he'd take me off into the forest and show me a few stretches and then try and charge me 500 bucks for it Well, yeah trialing out of various hocus-pocus methods of meditation and not really getting getting anywhere Until I came to Dharamsala Which is a town up into the in the hills of India where the Dalai Lama is has his government in exile And there's lots of Tibetans and lots of spiritual things going on And I heard from somebody that a good thing to try would be vipassana meditation So I found this this center where they offered 10-day retreats and I went and I signed up as a 19 year old for 10 days of 10 hours per day meditating and Check myself in For anyone who wants to get deeply into meditation this system of Meditation is something I definitely recommend this school if you want to look up s dot n dot go anchor Go e n k a Look that up online their websites Dharma org. I think they have centers all around the world It's a donation based only so that you pay what you want to pay and it's a 10-day course and they're the same all over The world so it is something that I definitely do recommend to people if they've got a stable enough mind Don't do it if you're on meds It's really good stuff. However, very very fucking difficult and so what I did is I checked in and I started learning this technique and I came across the Same issues that everyone who tries to meditate seriously comes across and I've talked to lots of people about meditation and try to teach them And and often people say I I tried meditation. I'm not good at it. My mind's too busy. I Think too much like I try to sit down and it's just like I'm not good at it Right. Nobody's good at meditating. Don't get that out of your head. Nobody's born good at it. It's not a skill that some people have Meditation is fucking hard because your entire life your mind is like this untrained animal. That's just Got gotten to roam around doing exactly what it wants all the time and When you meditate what you're saying is alright mind instead of all of these interesting things where you get to go around and fantasize and think And imagine I want you to focus on one really boring repetitive thing for a long time That's what you're telling your mind to do with your meditation and your mind goes. No. Thanks. That sounds shit So I'm gonna throw up all sorts of distractions and doubts and worries and pains and all sorts of things to try and get you to stop this because it's boring as fuck and I want to go back To thinking about fucking Swedish twins and and imagining myself as being Iron Man And So it was day by day I started to learn to sit and to sit with my mind from a new perspective All throughout my life I'd perceived that my thoughts and my feelings were me that was essentially me meditation when practice correctly starts to give you a new objective perspective, right so instead of Following your thoughts in this linear process and associating yourself with them perceiving them to be you I started to learn to step back and observe thoughts simply as Manifestations that were coming through me Alright same with my body sensations things such as pain or itching or irritation things that I that I'd throughout my life had an emotional attachment to had Reactions to I started to learn how to sit and observe from a position of objectivity And this was definitely not easy It never never is in meditation But what I started to see was that I had all these reactive behaviors mental behaviors and emotional behaviors which I'd built over my life and Big thing that came up for me in that first sit that first 10-day meditation retreat was anger Right was something that I remember like day four five running out into the forest out of the retreat center just running out of the Dharma Hall and Screaming with rage and crying and like having all this fucking angst and anger just come out out of me and That's one thing that happens with with good meditation is that you will go through periods of catharsis, right because What we do is we as we practice our own particular way of living Inevitably, we repress all sorts of things. We should we push down we shove our frustrations our anger Disappointments all of the things that didn't go right for us in in life things that we don't have control over and we repress them and then we cover them up with blanket definitions or thoughts or Beliefs that somehow give us some perspective and we can explain away things as like, okay life is mostly misery that was my kind of operating procedure or this shit always happens to me or that's the way it is or fuck the world or You know different ways that we rationalize our position in life But when I started meditating those things started coming off, right? I started to allow myself to not be attached to my beliefs my thought forms and and to see what is the objective truth, not the subjective truth that I decided and Inevitably when that happens stuff comes out stuff that you've held down and repressed for a long long time The process of becoming a great seducer a great ladies man Must be a process of self-discovery right for it to be something that is sustainable and something that's healthy Yeah there is the other way where you actually layer more masks and more bullshit on top where you Pretend more and lie more to yourself and other people and if you do a very convincing performance, maybe you'll Hustle some chicks into bed through pure bullshit That's not my way and I don't think that's sustainable long term because that eventually you have a crisis of identity The way that I have always espoused the way that I've always practiced Has been to use Use seduction as a as an external world reflection of my internal change All right, so that later as I got into seduction many many years later I didn't learn to meditate to become good with girls, but I eventually integrated these two art forms What I discovered was that by Constantly bringing myself up against my perceived limitations and then using meditation to step back and observe my reactions I was able to have breakthrough after breakthrough both in my personal sitting time and Often much faster when I was out in the field So I came out of this first 10-day retreat feeling Ecstatic I'd never felt happier in my life I've been through some of the most hard the most difficult Moments of my life during that retreat and I think that's any real meditation system is not about bliss It's not about sitting there and feeling super Zen and just like everything's perfect with with no thoughts in your mind Sometimes you may have those experiences during meditation, but that's not why we're doing it You're not chasing a blissful state some meditation systems are just about they're trying to arouse bliss and sit in there But what I learned over the years from the different systems that I've studied is that it's the pain It's the frustration it's the anger. Those are the things that actually teach you the most right not by getting involved in them not by encouraging them but by Stepping back allowing things to be as they are and when those things arise and you your frustration your anger your depression all those things To shine the light of balanced awareness on them and to allow them to start to dissolve and change some of the most Beautiful times I've ever had meditating is when I've been sitting in screaming searing pain right in my knees or my lower back I've been sitting for 45 minutes trying to just keep solid posture and the pain is just like someone's driving a needle into my knee joint and then I use my Awareness to go deep inside my knee and then see the way my mind keeps wanting to place meaning on it to go I hate this. This is pain. I don't like this this meditation is bad for me. I'm a loser. I can't do this I'm never going to get enlightened all those thoughts that start buzzing reacting to the knee joint knee joint pain and then catching it and stepping back and letting the thoughts just move through and then seeing The pain for what it truly is, which is just sensation neutral sensation intense sensation Yes, but it is not that which is the pain. It is our label on it It's our decisions about what it means that makes it really painful All right, it's the anticipation of pain that hurts more than pain right the idea of the pain So, you know, I've had these moments where I've actually I'm still feeling the same sensations, but it's not pain anymore It's like I'm detached from it. I'm just feeling like a conglomeration of buzzing and pulsing and vibrating Which is technically pain, but I no longer perceive it in any negative way I just observe it and allow it to be and then it's you're free from it Right, and this is something that I've used over and over again throughout my life in in the many times when I've had situations Which I don't like or I'm feeling uncomfortable in noticing the way that my mind wants to jump in there place judgments place meaning Make it worse anticipate the pain Think about it make it into something that's complicated And this is highly applicable in seduction because every single time you roll up to talk to a girl Not every time but most times you're gonna have those thoughts you're gonna have those feelings. Ah, there's my approach anxiety I've got that disease again. There's that there's that manifestation of my looseness There's my worries my fears Embarrassment all of that stuff and that's why I say that when done. Well seduction can be an amazing tool for spiritual transformation Because you you don't protect your ego and your identity most people stay Navigate through life in a way that means they don't have to have their ego tested or very rarely It's comfort zones zones where you feel like you can maintain This facade this mask, you know this this belief structure I can hold it together as long as I only navigate through this small maze If I step outside of it Then I have to confront the fact that I don't know everything I have to confront the fact that I'm not at ease and cool In every situation and that's where I feel discomfort That's where my ego is threatened and therefore I don't want to go there Most people don't want to do it or if they do they try to do it with a bullheaded stubborn kind of bulldoze away Which is like, all right, I'm gonna smash through this Which you know can can yield some results But what I've discovered is by stepping out of my comfort zone daily or multiple times per day particularly in the early stages when I was learning seduction was that I got to see so much of my bullshit so much of my Ego coming up over and over again because I go and get embarrassed I'd go and get rejected I'd go and fall flat on my face and then notice the way my mind wants to rationalize that and go Oh, that's because she's an idiot. That's because she's a bitch. That's because Or that's because I'm no good or I'm a loser I'm never gonna get this or this shit doesn't work all those things which are again self-defense mechanisms to try to rationalize why I can't do this and More often than not I would catch myself and go. All right. There's that thought thought form that's reacting to the situation Reacting to the physical sensations reacting to the emotional outburst. I'm going to sit with it using my meditation techniques of Pointed awareness of abdominal breathing of The various different types of technologies which I learned over the years and have now distilled into the six-week program Martial meditation method to save you the years of trial and error of needing to go off into ashrams and travel around India so Since that very first retreat Meditation became an integral part of my life and it's something that I have become Very obsessed with at times at other times I've been a lazy motherfucker and let it drop but it's always been there in some form or another whether that was just little micro Meditations which and what I mean by that is taking one breath in one breath out it's Observing feeling the cold on my face right now looking over at this model Who's doing a photo shoot and thinking do I really want to do this video or do I want to go and talk to her? It's the observation of the moment and now my cameraman's looking over there. I'm like you pay attention. Do you pay attention over here? You guys want to combine this photo shoot here. I reckon we could reckon we could do something cool here All right, you just let me know when you need me. I'm very reasonable rates So, yeah the observation of the moment by moment through these micro meditations has been something that has totally shifted and changed my life Absolutely for the better When I got back to Australia after my travels through India I Became an extremist, right? So I quit drugs and alcohol. I became a vegetarian I started meditating at least one two hours per day doing this Vipassana technique I became obsessed with spiritual pursuits because now I'd found something that had given me a taste of peace had given me a taste of Having some control in my life That was one of the big things I took out of that initial sit was that I now had responsibility For the way I felt but I could no longer blame the world the superficial society that I lived in Vapid girls my childhood conditioning. I couldn't blame any of that anymore For the way that I was because I realized that I now had tools to change Right. That's one of the problems I think with Western psychology is lying on a couch"}
