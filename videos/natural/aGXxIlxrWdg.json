I'm just on a very short break in between coaching sessions and here to deliver this very important announcement, which is that after over a year of being in the TNL vault, my most popular ever online course, The 5 Principles of Natural Seduction, is available, relaunched, ready for you to join right now. I first released The 5 Principles over a year ago to a select group of gentlemen from around the world and took these guys through the five weeks of the online course. The results were incredible with guys reporting amazing changes in their lifestyle, in their core beliefs and very importantly in terms of their results with women, with heaps of guys getting laid and getting girlfriends. So we finished the course, I said goodbye and moved on to all the other wacky wild projects that I've been doing since then. However, since then I've received countless requests from guys around the world asking can I buy the course, saying here's my credit card, I want to buy it. And until now I've said no, because this product isn't just something where you download a bunch of videos and stick them on your hard drive and they sit there and rot, because for me it was vitally important that if I was going to put out a coaching course online that it had to be something that was interactive, proactive and meant that guys actually went out there to apply this in real life. So this course, The Five Principles of Natural Seduction, is a mentored, supervised course that runs over a five week time period with weekly drills and a whole lot of ways for you to interface with me to make sure that you actually get results. Taking feedback from the original alumni group, I've made a bunch of tweaks and changes to the course to present this brand new version of The Five Principles of Natural Seduction, which is available right now. Week by week I will be there personally mentoring all the members of the course on the daily Facebook group as well as through live webinars where you get to interface with me, ask me any questions that you want. To find out full details about the course, all you need to do is click the link in the description where you'll be taken to a page where I explain in great detail how the course works, all the modules, as well as a huge range of amazing bonuses that I've put together for you. But in brief, what are The Five Principles? Well, this is the teaching methodology that I've used for over 10 years to coach men all around the world in the art of expressing themselves in an effortless and natural way so that they can connect with women without needing to use cheesy pickup lines or tricks or try and force themselves to be some kind of personality that doesn't work for them. The Five Principles, awareness, intent, pressure release, emotional impact, and decisiveness, these are the aspects that all men, all men who are good with women utilize. Now they utilize them in very different ways depending on their own filters, their own personality, their own style, but at the core of it, these are laws that you need to understand if you are ever going to be able to get this seduction thing and make it yours, to make it something that you are rather than something you're trying to practice or do to people. So if you'd like to join me on this incredible life-changing journey with an amazing group of dudes all around the world, then you just click the link below and I hope to see you on the first day of the course. James Marshall, signing out."}
