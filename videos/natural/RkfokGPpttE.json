So every time I say hi to her, just say hi. I've already won. Hello and welcome. Today I have the pleasure of a very special podcast guest. Thanks for having me. I did a little setup here in Barcelona in my apartment and I wanna welcome John Keegan. Thank you. Coach, a good friend by now. We know each other quite for a while now. Eight years or so. And yeah, for sure. And we've been teaching on many workshops together. That's right. And I also remember listening in on you coaching when I was still a cameraman. Yeah. And it was very funny. You have a very unique teaching style. And I guess, yeah, we wanna talk about mainly street approaching, but we wanna get a little bit further in this podcast. We don't just wanna talk about specific pickup stuff. We wanna see the bigger picture of this whole thing. I think that's a good topic for that interview. Yeah, I do too. No, I couldn't talk to any girl in the street. I couldn't talk to a girl in a bar or club unless I was wasted. And so I had to, and then by the time I got around to what's now called day game, I didn't call it that, it wasn't called that. How did you, did you make it up by yourself? Well, I mean. We all have our story of how we discovered it. Yeah. But maybe you didn't have to discover it. Well, yeah, I mean, there was, all right, well, I could tell you, all right. Well, there was obviously, every guy wants to meet women, right? So now it's become more of a, there's more systems and processes and it became even an industry, so to speak. But it wasn't then. But there was always some guy somewhere in the histories of time, and there were some naturals around, meeting girls at coffee shops. We just didn't know them. But one day, I was in an acting workshop and enrolled a guy that looked like Clint Eastwood in about his 50s, who came in from Beverly Hills. And he said, I'm gonna do real estate out there, but I'm gonna produce my first movie, and I want you to be in it. And I said, and I was like, all right, let's do it. He said, I'm driving down to Miami tomorrow. Can you go? And I said, yeah, because I quit my job. So let's go. And I'm on my own. It's all like Wolf of Wall Street. Yeah. So I jumped in his 1970 something Jaguar. That happened? Yeah, this happened. And we drove down to Miami. All right. So you were just infected by his charisma? Super charismatic. One of the most charismatic human beings. Probably a sociopath. No. No? His name was John Garrett, now since past. He wasn't a sociopath, but he was so charismatic he could get people to do anything, but he would hardly follow through at the end. That was his downfall. But nonetheless, what he was a genius at was meeting people anywhere and everywhere. And that's why we became friends. We'd walk down the street and he would play the fool and he would just start talking to girls. Now he was in his 50s, handsome, but he had all the confidence and charm to turn on any girl, 20 year old, this, that. Then we were, this is way, this is early 2000s, going into the Whole Foods and the aisle four. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. And I just noticed, he would do it, but he wouldn't show me how to do it. And he didn't know how to show me how to do it, but he just had fun having my energy there. Gave him the confidence to do it. Gave him, I was like his wingman or something. I didn't know it, but that's what was going on. So, but I was watching him and I just saw him doing this and I was like, wow. And then we would go into a coffee shop and he tells some hot young girl, I'm making this movie, we need someone to run, be my director of this or whatever. And then all of a sudden some girl would give up her whole life working on this movie for a month. So it was like this kind of crazy charisma. Mad man. Yeah, mad man. Nonetheless, he didn't, and we actually, because then being around him would give me some extra confidence. And we actually met, I started to learn a little bit. You know, time went by, that movie was never finished. I have, actually he died and someone in his family gave me all the tapes of the movie. I have it at home. Maybe one day I'll finish it. So I then spent some years by myself afterwards and just started. That was a shifting moment for you because you realized, oh my God, I don't have to drink and I don't have to be this famous actor to get girls. I can literally just talk to them at Whole Foods? Yeah, and I can just walk down the street. Yeah. It often, like it's kind of crazy thinking back for me. Obviously it was different because YouTube was around by then. I saw some infield videos, so that's what gave me the idea. But then trying out alone, even though I knew there's people somewhere doing it, I was still freezing up when I tried. And then only when I really met James, Tony back then, Liam in real life, hanging out next to them, walking down the street next to them, seeing them approach, then it was like, ah, then it clicked for me as well. So it really is crazy how you kind of need, even though the internet is around now and you can watch videos all day long and you see that you kind of need somebody next to you to really get that shift, right? Yeah. It's almost like standing next to someone who has a really good physique and you're like, I should go to the gym. It's kind of like. Yeah, and it's not just anybody, right? Yeah. I mean, those guys you just mentioned are really like, you know, pinnacle, the pinnacle. Yeah. So it's like, you know, there's a whole story we can talk about is that you found yourself next to those people in a very determined way. And in some way, I wanted to find myself next to someone like that my whole life and there it was seen to me. So being around, having someone, and I think that is a big part of the coaching. Like, a lot of times I noticed over the years when I was coaching, I would meet different people that never saw someone like I saw that guy. And then they'd see me be like that. And then they'd be like, oh, I didn't know you could do that. It was simply like that, I didn't know you could do that. Yeah, somebody just gives you permission to do it. Yeah, it's permission. And then you have to give yourself permission. Yes. Which a lot of guys don't. How can you give yourself permission? Well, I think you have to say, hey, I give myself permission to play the fool. To go outside of my comfort zone. To not be, like people say, oh, that's not me. To explore who I am beyond what I know. So when you, there is no there's not me. There's, you have a desire. I want to date this very attractive women. I want to date more women. I want certain kinds of women to see me as attractive. And you have to align with your desire. And one of the way, one of the most important things you can do in this life is break free from that egoic mind that's telling you you're not enough. That now's not the time. That she's not enough. Whatever it is that's keeping you defined in a box. To break free from that. You know, every time the wall comes up, to push through it. Yeah. That's one of the most important things a man can do in his entire life. And you and I were talking about this before. Yeah. Which is. Which, because as you said, the wall break through, right? As a man, we have walls in so many areas of life. Especially if you're a man who kind of comes from nothing. Humble family. I don't know how you grew up, right? Me, nice, Austria, no complaints, but humble, right? Yeah. No real mentors in that sense. In any like masculine area. I never had like, you know, the uncle who shows me how to be at social events, or how to light a cigar, how to dress, or how to play soccer. I never had that cousin who works out a lot and takes me to the jiu-jitsu class. Anything like that. I kind of had to figure it all out by myself. And as you say, breaking through, you have to break through showing up to the jiu-jitsu class. Pushing in the gym, you know, keep going at that thing. Or pushing through at your job. Staying up extra late to get that job done, and so on. So there's a lot of different areas where you have to push through. And as you said, we talked about this earlier, day game is kind of this, how we call it, approaching, seducing women, is kind of the ultimate breaking through. Because why are we doing all those other things anyway? Right, why do we want to build a physique? Sure, to feel good ourselves, but we want to impress someone. Why do we work extra hard in a job to eventually have a higher value woman liking us? So it's kind of like, it is a bit of a shortcut, isn't it? To just go to the girl directly without all this other stuff? Well, I think that's exactly what you're saying. Men have built empires, cities, or many men imagine that. When I become rich, when I have the perfect body, when I finish my first book, when I whatever. Get that role in that TV show. In the future, I will be me. It's a disease of the mind that many men have, that all men have. And some men have successfully succeeded in creating millions of dollars and this and that, and yet their social skills, and yet their interpersonal skills, and yet their dating life is in the toilet. It's completely disconnected. And yet, even as they were building all of that, all they wanted was that. And this, so the, so. And you would know because you were coaching those guys, because you were coaching in New York City, where on paper, one of the most successful people on the planet are living, right? Yeah, you get a lot of different walks of life in New York, and I've been what you call a high-end coach, so to speak, for most of my coaching career. And yeah, so I've gotten the great fortune to work with some of the smartest people in the world in all different fields, and it's super cool, so no complaints. But the point, I just wanted to make that final question. Yeah, so I would know, and plus we've worked with all kinds of guys all around the world. So, but the point is, is most guys are avoiding the very specific things. So you could even say, oh, John, you're an actor. Should I take an acting class to get good at this? Hey, taking an acting class because you want to be an actor is a great idea. Taking an acting, an improvisation class to have fun, experience the joy of what it feels like to be in an improvisation is an amazing idea. It won't make you good at meeting women anywhere and everywhere. However, being good at improv will make you better at improv-ing with women when you're meeting them, but in a way. Still gotta meet them. Yeah, I became a much better improvisational artist just by talking to women anywhere and everywhere all day long, you know? That's when I really got good at it, and I was already good at that. But I really tapped into something then. But the point is, is directly, it's not a shortcut, it's a direct cut to exactly what you want to be. You actually align with who you are. When I stand, and when you stand, and this is what I learned, and I learn anytime I meet someone new, is when I stand in front of someone else and I'm being authentic, I'm being real, I genuinely want to connect with you, there's a bit of vulnerability there. Kind of looking into the abyss, yeah, it's scary. Yeah, and when a beautiful woman that you desire, that you have that energy, you know, adrenaline, when looking back at you, that's when you see, she looked like a mirror right at you, and she's like a mirror, and usually what it sends back to you is exactly what you're insecure about. You didn't work out for two months. You aren't rich enough, you, whatever you're focused, obsessed about, why the bullshit story, why you're not enough, she sends it back right at you. Yes, great teachers. Great teachers, and she may not know that she's doing it, she may not even be doing it. You're doing it to yourself, and that's why it's not just, like, that's why I never particularly, I understand we have to say, call things something, day game, okay, there it is, done, right? But it always felt so trivial and small to me. It's a game. Yeah, you do it, it feels wrong saying it, yeah. It's basically like, the idea is we're meeting and connecting with people without penises. No, we're meeting and connecting with beautiful people, and all people, anywhere and everywhere at any time. It's this, like you're, what's saying is this, I'm present in my life, and I'm ready to, and I'm ready to meet and connect with people as I'm walking in the door and they're walking out. As someone's walking by me, or when I'm sitting down waiting for a train, and someone's sitting next to me, and while I'm in line at the Starbucks, it's saying I'm more alive than I used to be. I'm not like, we're all in this line, like, when I get there, then I'll do the thing. And instead, we're just in our head all the time. So it's basically saying, I'm gonna escape my mind, I'm gonna be present more and more in my life, and I'm gonna meet people along the way. So this process becomes very powerful in the sense that you become extremely present, developing presence, which, presence means people look at you when you walk in a room. This guy's only alive. People say that, like when we walked down the street, we had a group of guys that we met, they said, man, you guys are more, you could just tell when you're waiting. Yeah, when you walk in a room. Yeah, there's something more different about you. Because all our channels are on, man. We're like tuned on. We're ready. So that's what it does for you in that sense. So it doesn't just make you good at meeting women on a street corner. It doesn't just make you, it makes you good in your business if you're a doctor, you're better with your patients. If it makes you learn to love yourself and accept yourself on a deeper level through the process of simply sometimes just wanting to get laid. I just want to have a girlfriend to talk to. I just, yeah. I just want to have a romantic experience in a city and not just be a tourist. Yeah, just a million people walking by me. Just have a lovely text from a girl. Doesn't it feel amazing to get a lovely? It is, it is nice, and we've started a service guys, you can just, we'll send a text to you and you name it. Sign up. Text this number. 99 cents a text. It saves our businesses after the crypto crash. Some hotline. Yeah. I've taken a mental break from talking about crypto. Okay. That's good. But we are going to talk about it. Happy you're enjoying the video so far, I just want to let you know I am taking Twitter more seriously in the last couple of weeks, posting there almost daily my thoughts, behind the scenes stuff and new ideas for content. So if you like what you're seeing here, follow me on Twitter, the link is below. So well, that's beautiful. And it's so true. And I guess that is the reason why I, because I'm in it now for eight years, which sounds crazy. Yeah. You know, eight years ago, I met James. Eight years ago, I started doing approaches. Eight years ago, I offered my skills in order to get coaching in return. That is one of the more interesting stories. Like I said, I've met a lot of people, all kinds of people, but it's rare that you get to watch someone just start from just saying, hey, I want to like zero and I'm willing to, you know. Yeah. You were basically following the Gary V thing. You offer them something and then you get in the door, right? Yeah. He was an inspiration, Gary V was. Yeah. Yeah. I love seeing D-Rock on the street of New York last time I was there. I was like, D-Rock! And he was like giving me a kiss. It's kind of synchronistic when you really think about your beginning in there, because that really kind of probably was one of the teachers that got you to make that first, hey guys, I'll come and offer my services if I can, what, just be around or what? Sideline, I don't know if you guys know, D-Rock is, if you know Gary V, Gary Vaynerchuk, he's like this marketing guy, but he's all about content, putting out content. And then there was this guy, D-Rock, who was his camera guy. So not just as camera guy, he was his all time 24-7 following Gary V around camera guy, which was special at the time. That was like five, six years ago where vlogging, you know, Casey Neistat was vlogging, but like a CEO, having a guy constantly film himself, that was new. Yeah. I can be the D-Rock for James, because people want to know what James's day is like. And then last time when I was in New York, a guy crossed the street and I was like, why do I know this face? And I realized it's D-Rock. And then the next day I even texted you that. I was thinking about D-Rock and then literally one, I walked one block, I crossed the street, I looked to the left and he's sitting on a moped and I'm like, D-Rock, and he just does like this. And I was like, so weird. Like I manifested him onto that moped. And he had a girl with him. Yeah, he had a hot girl with him. So yeah, that's what kept me going because I've been now coaching for four years, which is by far not as long as you've been coaching. But that, just like that beauty of that whole thing and how incredible it is as a coach, in my opinion, to help people understand that and get results is what keeps me doing it. Because obviously, I'm a smart guy, I'm analytical, I like building things, I like building systems, I'm quite entrepreneurial. I could probably make more money with something else, right? I could build a trading system. I could hire four programmers who code algorithmic trading bots. I could go into logistics. I could go into dropshipping. Some of that's scams. But I would crush it. If I would do it, I would be good at it. But you keep doing this. But you can do that, though. Yeah, I don't want to. Why are you doing this racket? Because it feels beautiful to do it. It does. Yeah, it really does. What kept you going? How long have you been coaching for? I've been coaching literally for 15 years. I started in 2007. By 2009, I got in the New York Times. That's when I had that beautiful and that was, you know. I love those photos. Yeah, beautiful photos. That guy won a Pulitzer Prize. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I was in the New York Times. I won a Pulitzer Prize. Wow. Yeah. Not necessarily for those photos, but just for all the photos. So 2007, what got you into it? What made you realize, because there's a lot of dudes who are good with women, right? Like the guy you mentioned. It was as simple as this. I had found this social freedom. Yeah. And I was, you know, I became obsessed somewhere in there. Somewhere in there, I found my own thing. In fact, just to go back to Jon Garrett, at one point I met with Jon Garrett again. Over the years, we've kept in touch. I ended up with him again, and I started to show him all the things I learned, and I started telling him what I thought was wrong with his game. It was interesting, because I even said, he in some ways was like, to me, it's an art I would never want to show anybody. He wouldn't teach me anything. I just realized, though, from practicing on my own, what he was doing, he was making observations. He was a master of making observations. He was a master observer, as all artists are. That's what I became, a master observer. Master observer on aisle four, and then boom. He was also, and this is important, he was a great storyteller. For example, he really, when I look back and I just think back, I don't have recordings of him doing it. I just remember sitting, we're sitting on Rodeo Drive, you know what that is? Like a coffee shop. Yeah. It's like in Beverly Hills. Yeah. Beautiful woman sits down over here. We're just sitting. He's, I'm here. He's here. She's there. I don't know if it was a little love, but like a little fishing line off to the side. Next thing you know, he's hooking her in, but he always had a story about his interests and passions. Tennis, filmmaking, whatever it was, he had his identity out. He always shared about himself, and it wasn't just like a shtick. He just had a fluidity about, he knew who he was, and he really was, it wasn't bullshitting. He was great at tennis. Things he was really interested in, and he also was interested in politics, and he was able to share it in a non-toxic way. So he was an interesting guy. He was an interesting guy who lived an interesting life. Which is important, right? Yeah. Become an interesting guy. Yes. He became an interesting guy. However, he had been rich, but he had lost all his money, but he managed still to keep his confidence and still be able to talk and not be knocked down by it. So during this one time period, I got quite obsessed, and I think in order to become great at something, you have to become a fanatic. And for a little while, or for maybe a long while, I was a fanatic. I gave up all friends that were an interest, that were like, if anybody was saying, hey, come to our dinner party with my girlfriend, do this, anything, and it also became for me a solo mission. Anything else was in my way. So I was hellbent because I was getting high from it. I was hellbent on breaking through every social barrier. It started ever so small with me walking. One of my first approaches in the day, this is true, back to Law & Order, I had an audition for Law & Order. I had a paper script. I had some shitty sales job. I hated it. I was in a suit that was ill-fitting, and I was standing on it, and it was hot, and I was sweating. I was standing near this Law & Order studio, and I had this script, and I was looking at the lines, and some hot girl walked by, and I said, hey, like really, you know, completely uncalibrated. Hey, can you help me run these lines? And she literally giggled and said, nice line, and kept walking, and I was like, no, no, I'm serious. I have a thing, you know? And she just blew me. Why do you think that one didn't work? Because you were not authentic? I was authentic because I just didn't, I mean, she did stop and said, give me basically a She just thought I was trying to pick her up, and I didn't have any way to transition or any map to go and then get her phone number, or I didn't have any idea what to do next. I just threw that out there. Just try to hook her, all right. Yeah, but then that became an idea, so I tried that a few more times, and then it just became like, if anyone ever studied B.F. Skinner, it's one of the, I studied it in college, basically, B.F. Skinner is the guy who created behavior modification. You can change, you can modify your own behavior, right? So you can change people's behaviors, like quit smoking or get up and start doing push-ups or whatever it is. So I just took this approach of, I'm going to, and one of the techniques is called fading. I want to fade myself past my anxiety, which was great when I was approaching women. It was like a lot of resistance. So I would just start. Now it may seem boring, but no one told me how to do it. I was just like, how can I do this? So I was just like, just do small things. So it would be like, hey, I like your shoes, they're blue, or I'd probably be better at it than that, or well, the old dog thing, anything, your dog, whatever, or hey, can you tell me how to get to the Whole Foods, or even though I live a block away from it. Whatever it was, I would just do stuff like that and walk away. I wasn't even trying to get into a conversation. And then I would escalate the challenge, like, okay, now I have to figure out a way to transition, and then I have to talk about myself in the conversation. I have to ask about her. I have to give her a compliment. And that was all without YouTube content or posts written on it, right? No, this was just me figuring it out. And then I came up with the idea that, then there became this three-week period where I was like, I have to get rejected five times every day. This was all on my, because I just kept building it up. I just kept feeling the freedom. You coached yourself. Yeah, I coached myself. And I remember, I don't remember this one very specific, because I had a five-a-day rule, and I was a fanatic, and I was as disciplined as Alex would be. And it was like 11.59, and I was on a subway going back home to the Upper West Side, and there was a girl who wasn't that attractive. In fact, at this point, I was a health fanatic. I would only eat raw vegan. I was like perfect skin, shining bright. And there was this girl who looked like she just hung out, like a regular American-looking, she eats like shit, and sweating beer out of her pores, whatever it was. I just remember looking at her, but I had one more girl to ask out. So we were talking. I could tell she didn't like me. I didn't like her, but I said, hey, we should hang out, and she was like, yeah. But I got five in a day. I remember that. That was a rough one, too, because I really wanted to do it. But I was asking five out girls out a day to get past my ego. Literally, I identify I have an ego problem. I'm afraid of being rejected. It's bullshit. It's a lie. And I just kept pushing myself past it with this power of now stuff, Eckhart Tolle, burn up your ego in the face of rejection. Have you been into spirituality back then already? Yeah, I was already in. Okay. Was that helpful? That was everything. I'll tell you why. Because I had already read the book The Power of Now, no joke. Audio. I used to drive around in sales job listening hundreds of times. It changed my life. And in that audio, in the book, he would say, the more you do this, the more your circumstances will change. There is no problem in the now. I didn't particularly like the circumstance. It was okay. I was driving around in the sales job, driving around in traffic in the city, and thinking living paycheck to paycheck. And I used to think, well, I don't know how I'll get out of this, but I'm going to believe in what this guy is saying. And I kept doing it and doing it. And then I really got, became super present. And then I looked at approaching strangers as a way to be in the now. It's like, how do I practice being in the now? How can I bring the now by connecting with people? So what that did was give me a super objective. The objective is meet girl, get date, get laid, get girlfriend, right? The super objective was transcend your ego. So every time I say hi to her, just say hi, I've already won. I've transcended resistance. I've transcended that voice that tells me I'm not enough or whatever, tells me to be afraid. And when I transcended the feeling that's weighing on my chest and I push through it, I am now more John Keegan than I was before, just one moment before. And that's became my whole thing. And then I'm in the conversation and there's a little voice saying, she's being nice. That's enough. Get out of here. One more time, I push through. Do you think Eckhart Tolle would be good at picking up girls? I bet you, you know, he has founded a way to attract beautiful people in things of all ways, all walks of life. I'm sure he would. If you've ever seen him live, I don't think he'd be running down any streets or anything. His presence is extremely powerful. For example, one time I saw him live at the Beacon Theater in New York. That's a big theater, Rolling Stones play there. You know, it's a big place. And the theater was packed with people of all walks of life. It wasn't like some hippie conference or something.
