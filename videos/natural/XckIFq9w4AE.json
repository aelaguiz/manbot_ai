The ability to plink out some chords and sing along is something that someone could develop over a period of weeks or months depending on their natural abilities, but in order to be able to play some huge concerto, you have to spend 8 plus hours a day for many years in order to be able to do it. And you could say, well, I could live without being a master pianist. I could live without playing the piano at all. And you would be right, because you could find some other hobby that you were more interested in or that gave you more joy and your life, your quality of life would not necessarily be discernibly different from whether you play the piano or not. This is not the case with women dating, seduction and sex for most people. Most men and women can't live happy, fulfilling lives without the opposite sex in their life in some way, without having a good sex life."}
