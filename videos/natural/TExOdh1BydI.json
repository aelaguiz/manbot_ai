I've proven that over and over again to myself and to others. I land in a city, I can, you know, be on a date today or tomorrow, no problem. That's an extremely freeing knowledge. It means that I don't have to stay in a relationship that's shit. It means I don't have to experience long periods of loneliness and celibacy. It means that when I choose to interact with women, I get a choice about what type of woman that I have, which has extrapolations throughout your life. This skill set is not just about, like, racking up a bunch of lays in your 20s or something. That's often an aspect because dudes in their 20s are horny and don't want to get married yet. So they want to rack up a bunch of lays. They want to have a threesome. They want to have sex with a bunch of different types of girls. Natural, normal, fair enough. Don't judge it. Go for it. Get it out of your system or don't. It's not that I'm saying that's the way you should be forever. I'm an outlier. Most of my friends are outliers. If I was also a full-time engineer and an athlete, then yeah, I wouldn't have put as much time into this and I wouldn't have had as big numbers or as big, you know, results. But I still would have been able to choose my mates, choose my dates, choose my religion."}
