All right, so what I do is I make myself very available to people, accommodating to the point of sometimes of martyring myself or really like really to my own detriment, but it's like I'm very giving. A little on nice guy syndrome. The first thing I want you to do is to assume that you've got it. Assume that you got the nice guy clap, you got the disease. Most guys I work with are nice guys on some level or another. Sometimes I get a guy who's a bit of a dick, who's like really doesn't give a shit about people or is a bit autistic or something, and they swing more on the other side of like being too pushy or selfish, but most of my guys and all of the coaches originally are nice guys. I mean, most of you would know what I'm talking about here, but I'm not talking about being kind or generous or pleasant to people, or doing good things. I'm talking about the strategy to try and get what you want, which is the nice guy strategy, which is based around, and if you haven't read the book yet, must read, No More Mr. Nice Guy. It's a good overview of like the pathology. It's written for like kind of married men, so he doesn't know what he's talking about with seduction or with girls, but in terms of like the how does this mechanism work of being a nice guy, it's a good book. If we cut it all down, the most basic tenant of nice guy stuff is that to get what I want, I use a very ineffective giving strategy, right? So what I do is I make myself very available to people, accommodating to the point of sometimes of martyring myself or really like really to my own detriment, but it's like I'm very giving. I help all the time. I lend money. I drive people places. I listen to, you know, female friends, whinge about guys all the time. You know, if anyone, I stay off and it goes into your work. I stay off to work, you know, any person comes by and drops an extra thing and says, can you deal with that? I said, yes, yes, of course, right? So it's this accommodating people and people pleasing behaviors because you don't feel like you have enough self-worth to just present yourself. That's the core of the nice guy issue is that I feel like and maybe I'm not conscious of this, but I feel like me by myself is not enough for this person or these people or this thing, this scene and I need to compensate for my personal lack by doing all this extra stuff for the people, right? And then hopefully they will value me. They value me because of what I can do for them and as opposed to the person that I actually am. That tends to be like the underlying wound and that's something that may need to be looked at through therapy or, I mean, it has to be looked at by building your self-esteem, whether that's through therapy or through exposure to the larger world or by building your character or testing yourself or whatever. Okay, it has to be done. But this is extremely common for guys that come to me is that they do it in small and large ways. There's always a smile on their face. It's always the answer is always yes. And when they have an issue with something, they don't say it, right? Anyone seen Peep Show, Mark Corrigan is the ultimate nice guy because he's actually a horrible human being, right? He's not a nice person at all. And that's the comedy of it is that he's actually a twisted, ugly kind of human being, but he's always the nice guy. He's always doing everything for people. And then what happens? Eventually or every episode, he fucking snaps and screams and the truth comes out. No turkey. You fucking idiot, Jeremy. You total fucking idiot. That was your job, you fucking moron. You cretin. You're a fuckhead. That's what you are. A fucking shithead. It was a joke. Watch Peep Show for everything that you could possibly do wrong in life and with girls ever. That's why it's so brilliant because if they fuck it up every time so beautifully, it's just you like do the opposite of what they're doing and then you'll have a good life. So yeah, the nice guy tends to hold things in, not voice his concerns, be walked on. And then it comes out in weird ways, right? Then it comes out in a burst and outburst in anger, in passive aggressiveness, right, sarcastic comments. That's very common. And those are never received well, right? So let's just say you live with a housemate and every day you do the dishes and he makes a mess and then you do the dishes. Every day that happens, right? And you smile and you nod and whatever. And then one day he puts the dishes down and you say, oh, are you leaving a dish here today? Oh, that's new. And the guy's like, hmm, yeah, right? Because my passive aggressive sarcasm, which wasn't very good, it's like, oh, well, did you know that you do that every day and fucking you should, you know, and that's not received. The person just goes, okay, whatever, dude. I'm just gonna keep doing my thing, right? There's, we need to, in that situation, there needs to be a real confrontation. I'm gonna talk about confrontation the right way in another week, but this is something you must learn to do. For this week, what I want you to do is watch yourself from an objective perspective, looking for nice guy behaviors. Don't try and change them so much right now. Don't be frustrated at yourself. Just see where you have them. Where are you people-pleasing? Where are you using covert contracts, which is where you give apparently for no, for free, but you really want something in return, right? So it's like the, you know, that's the classic thing of the friend-zoned guy who's doing the stuff for the girl, driving her places and listening to her whinge about Chad and whatever, giving, giving, giving, but it's not free. It's not because he's a nice guy and he's a friend. It's because this is the only way he knows to get what he wants. He's hoping that he's accruing credits and at some point she's gonna go, oh, oh, I just realized you just clocked in 25 sex credits from being such a nice guy. Well, allow me to just go and douche my arsehole so you can read it. Well done. A little extra stamp on your card. We've all been guilty of that. I remember doing that back in the day, but have a look at that and write this down in your journal. What is my strategy for getting what I want? Write it down and start to answer that question to yourself. How do I get what I want? Cause you do. I mean, you get some of it, right? You get fed and you get a house and you get some, whatever it is that you managed to get out of the world and people, what strategies are you using to do that? And where are the nice guy ones where you're trying to coerce people into doing things or not ever coming out straight and saying, I need this, do this for me, don't do this. You know, setting boundaries or making requests and so on. So in that way, you can start to chart where are your nice guy behaviors. And we can start to, again, it's like, first we have to be aware of it. Then you're in unconscious incompetence. And then we can start to move into conscious competence. Another thing a nice guy does is he spends too much expensive currencies without getting much in return. Remember the godfather spends a lot of cheap currencies to give away for him, right? So for me, cheap currencies are smiles and waves, a bit of advice about pickup, cheap for me to give away, cooking for somebody like this, giving them an orgasm. Lots of things I can do easily and they're valuable to the other person. So if I will give away a bunch of stuff, the whole basis of the Tino business model is that, right? I give away 150 something videos a year of high quality information that's worth something and I throw it out onto the internet for free, right? I give stuff that's easy for me to give away. I can keep talking until I die, apparently. It's easy to give away. It's valuable to other people. And then if they then return by coming and buying my stuff, then it's a massive return on the input that I put out. Okay, the fact that nine out of 10 guys don't buy something, it's fine because I can fling those coins all day. It doesn't cost me anything. Nice guys have the habit of spending stuff that's expensive. Lots of their time, their money, their emotional energy, their location. You know, people stay in cities for years because their parents wanted them to or because, you know, totally compromising their life for their girlfriend's dreams or being at the beck and call of somebody whenever they need whatever, right? So nice guy spends a lot, spends a lot, doesn't get what he wants to return. It feels like he's getting ripped off a lot. Okay, so have a look at yourself from an objective position this week and you can put it up in the group. You're like, okay, identify these four nice guy things that I do. Cool, name them, put them out there. You can start to see how they're affecting your life and how you're not getting what you want out of life because of that or not getting enough. And then hopefully we can start making some changes. There is a philosophical shift too in the nice guy. It's a major one, right? Which is the difference between believing that it makes you a good person to actually understanding it's just a behavioral strategy. Because when you believe that this is me, I'm a nice, good person, it's really hard to change that behavior because you'll think that if I change the behavior, I'm no longer a good person. I'd say I'm a much better person than I was when I was a nice guy because I'm way more blunt, honest. Sometimes I'm a bit ruder. Sometimes people get a bit more shocked by what I say. Sometimes people are disappointed because they didn't get what they wanted out of me because I said, ah, no, I'm not doing that. Or yes, I want to fuck that other girl, whatever it is. Sure, I create a bit more friction, good. And then people leave my life that may have hung around if I was really pleasant. But the people that stay, the people that know me and respect me and love me and want to fuck not all at once necessarily. Good. Let's monitor each other for nice guy behaviors. Gentlemen, welcome back to 2022. This is James Marshall reporting from Australia, which is where I am right now. I came home finally after two years in exile to see my mum and enjoy the sunshine and the beaches. I will, however, be returning to the North, to Europe very soon and starting our season of amazing, incredible, epic workshops. Four, seven and 10 day workshops held in Budapest, Kiev, Barcelona and a bunch of other places in Europe. So if you'd like to join me this year to learn strategies to get what you want, which don't involve being such a nice cunt, as we'd say in Australia, or a nice guy, as they say elsewhere, then click the link below, get on a call with one of our team. I would love to welcome you into the Natural Life Styles fold and get you out in the streets getting results. So that's it. See you in the next video. Yeah, see you cunt."}
