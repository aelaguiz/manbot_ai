We said earlier women take around 20-40 minutes to even get ready for penetration and then another 12-15 minutes to reach orgasm or climax. So there's a huge gap in women's pleasure and men's pleasure. Okay, my name is Tuce, I'm a Turkish sexologist, I'm a certified sexologist, I'm currently doing my PhD in transpersonal psychology, which means holistic psychology, so working both with the mind and the body. And I'm also a Tantra practitioner, focusing specifically on a particular lineage of Tibetan Buddhism. The areas of coaching I do are kind of in four pillars, so we coach on meditation, on movement, on connection and on pleasure, and then we take it from there. We were talking earlier about how I use, and when I say the word Tantra, I've said this before, that it's not really Tantra in the sense that it doesn't belong to some ancient lineage that mostly makes you sit in a cave for 12 years before they even start talking about sex. But as a placeholder term, I teach informal Tantra, so I teach different types of breathing, eye-gazing, synchronizing both body and breath, and do it in a way that's easily translatable to new partners or people who are having, let's say, normal sex and then to blend it in fairly seamlessly into, rather than sitting down and doing a, you know, a full Tantric ritual and, and having to be both be practitioners for it to work. So in that, with that same idea in mind, cause you know, I've learned some about vaginal mapping, uh, and like real helping a partner to release. And so would you, maybe if you could give us like the informal version of how that might be applicable to guys, for example, right? So rather than using an egg, using their cock or using their fingers in ways that if a woman is really stiff in the hips or she can only, she only responds to really heavy friction, which can be a thing that you were saying, like women who are in their heads or not very embodied, often want to be fucked really fast and hard because that's the only way they can really feel something. And so, you know, I've had that with partners where I've had to down regulate them and help them to like, to actually feel the more subtleties as opposed to only, you know, heavy sensation. So yeah. Do you have any advice for the guys on how, like if they're with, cause I mean they are going to be with, or have been with partners who are, it's, I mean, most people are disembodied to some extent or another. Yeah. I mean many, I think the practices you teach are great in terms of creating connection. I think without any connection and safety, women won't like ever get to a place where they can start dearmoring, let's say. I think depending on the woman, some women don't even know that they have numbness. So for 99.9% of my clients, they actually have a lot of numbness, let's say in the entrance of the vagina, because if you penetrate a woman before the body's ready, and it takes around like 20 to 45 minutes for the body to fully get ready, and you'll know because the lips will swell and you have engorgement. So a lot of women are penetrated within like the first five minutes, right? So already there's a lot of, even just at the entrance, a lot of trauma. I think by even, so let's say you've done all the breathing, the connection, and they're there with you. I think if you're using your finger or your cock and you start to, instead of going hard, just hold certain places. This can be like a practice where you're like, just lie down, let me give you pleasure, and you can start mapping out together if that's something she's open to. If not, then I would just start to slow down and try to, I mean it will depend on the woman, but like try to, um, ask her, how's this feeling? Like how's this motion feeling for you? Are you feeling this? How's the pressure? And try to get to know her pussy because every woman's pussy will be different. And based on like the four nerves that innervate the vagina, it really is different for many women. Some women have more innervation in the clitoris. Some will have it more like in their asshole. Like it really does depend. Mark. You mean the nerve centers will like cluster in different ways? Yeah, exactly. So although, yes, we know like the clitoris is super sensitive or like the cervix is, you know, highly innervated, it really does depend on woman to woman and from vagina to vagina. So I would say, I think it's a practice you do together when you slow down and you can use your hand or your cock to really figure out like what's feeling good, where is their numbness, um, if there's numbness, if there's pain, why is there pain, stopping breathing together. It's like these types of exercises that might not sound so sexy, but they are very transformative because for many women, many partners haven't really even taken the time to get their body warmed up, let alone like explore the pussy and give it time and like reassurance that it's like, okay, you can take time. Let's like explore this together, if that makes sense. Yeah. I mean, I'd say it would be the number of people that have done anything like that would be minuscule. Yeah. Very, very, very minuscule. Yeah. Yeah. I was thinking when you said it's not necessarily the sexiest because it could be clinical, I think there'd be ways to make that quite sexy. Cause like even in terms of the way you use language, like if you said, I'm gonna use my cock to, if I said, you wouldn't say, if I said, uh, I'm going to use my cock to explore your pussy. And then when I touch spots say, and it's just, I'm just riffing, say yes, fuck yes, nothing pain. Like something like that where you gave her like a, a way to like give you feedback that was, you know, it could be cute and you could use different wording there so that if, if she was like, then you could notice, okay, there's another spot, so that's painful. This is, that feels good or this feels super good. Um, yeah, I think there's like, yeah, when I'm teaching guys about like say dirty talk or, or sex debriefs, it doesn't need to be clinical in a way, in any way it can be used with dirty language. I agree. And I think a lot of women need a lot of encouragement at the beginning cause they already carry a lot of genital shame and they just don't want to take up so much time. Right. They're just like, Oh, it's okay. You don't have to, we don't have to do this. Right. Um, I think the questions that you ask and also asking questions that are not just yes and no, but maybe questions that are a bit more open-ended so they can get, the guy can get feedback and adapt in real time and explore together. Like how is this feeling from a one to 10? Like is this, is this area numb? Can you show me what you exactly like? What type of motion? Is it circles? Is it rubbing? Is it tapping? There's so many ways to stimulate a certain spot, right? It's not just in and out, in and out. Um, that woman probably haven't even explored themselves. So having that experience together, I agree, could be like super erotic and very much like deepening of the sexual intimacy and connection that you have with your partner. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I've done things where like you just take a woman's hand and you say, touch, touch the way you touch. And then I placed my hand on top of her so then you can, and then vice versa. She can move, move you or vice versa so then you can actually viscerally feel what she wants. Okay. What do most women complain about that we as men could easily fix or take into account? And in reference to like sex? Yeah, definitely. Yeah. Um. Not in there. Yeah. Yes. I think from like, this is all research based, a lot of women feel like they are rushed. So even letting women know that like, take your time, um, telling them like, I enjoy your body. Even like the most confident body positive woman report having high insecurity when it comes to their body image. Um, I think a lot of like words of appreciation help women down regulate and relax and get out of their head. And also, um, slowing down. It's very big. A lot of women feel like if the man came, okay, like it's done, let's wrap it up. I think by slowing down together and just giving her time, a lot of women will feel like that's already like a lot, I think then. And what do you mean in terms of like, okay, so we're slowing down. What exactly? In terms of the first penetration or, yeah, like if we look at that in practical terms, because we will always keep in mind that we're men who will be like, it sounds cool, but practically what does that mean? Practically sex lasts around seven to 13 minutes from kissing to end of penetration and ejaculation. We said earlier, women take around 20 to 40 minutes to even get ready for penetration and then another 12 to 15 minutes to reach orgasm, um, or climax. So there's a huge gap in woman's pleasure and men, men's pleasure, if we say like ejaculation. So slowing down through foreplay, but even if you've had penetrative sex and you came, I think still giving attention to the woman so she can finish or at least give her pleasure. Doesn't always have to lead to an orgasm, um, and extending that time. So it doesn't feel like a quick fuck essentially, which is what most women experience all the time. Which is not bad. I mean, it's great some of the time. Of course, a quickie is great some of the time, but most of the time I think women are left very frustrated because they didn't even, they didn't even get to the arousal stage and the menace come and you're kind of like, Oh, what the fuck was that? You know? So yeah, that's what I mean. Um, when you're saying like, these are interesting numbers here cause, um, I mean, you know, I'm always talking about, especially like the first stroke of penetration should generally last, you know, at least a minute to, to, to penetrate. Um, but that number of like 40 to 60 minutes, I think you said in terms of like, what does that look like? Like your basic, that's based on like scientific like readings of the way the body's changing or preparing. Like, Like what does it mean to get ready for penetration? Yeah, I guess so. Yeah. Yeah. So, um, arousal works a little different for men and women, right? So men, you get the arousal and then the erection follows usually quite rapidly and the penis erects around 300% up to, um, the erectile tissue you have of your dick is similar to the erectile tissue. We actually have more erectile tissue, it's just more internal and the vulva and the vagina also erects up to 300%. So if you've ever seen, Engorging. Engorging. Exactly. So there's a lot of arousal there and then all the, um, lips and everything like swells. Um, it's just a slower process for many, many women. Um, they will know, like you, you will know that her body is ready for erection one from, uh, like looking. So whether there's lubrication, whether it just looks much more puffier, like a puff fish. Um, the lips, everything will just look redder, you will see it. Um, and you will also feel like they usually, when women are aroused and they're ready for penetration, they will start moving towards you, right? Like their body, their hips, like they will guide you in rather than you like pushing it in. Um, and in terms of the first stroke of penetration, uh, an interesting study, they found that the entrance, like the first inch of the vagina, which no one ever really pays attention to, I think, has a lot of, a lot of pleasure nerves that a lot of women like. So instead of just going right in, even if you take your dick and start like stroking motions, like painting, kind of like a paintbrush, or you kind of go in and out from the first inch, it will also create a lot of pleasure before you like fully penetrate into the vagina. Definitely. And that's something I do like all through, I mean, at various points throughout sex is like take your cock and paint with it. Like you can do cool things where you can spiral it out. Like where you like kind of stretching in a circular motion. Cause, cause as far as I understand, you know, you have these stretch receptors, stretch cells, right? But like respond to actual stretching and kind of regardless of your size, if you were like actually, you know, pushing around the edges of the vagina and then you can spiral it out and just do the head on the, as Tush was saying, you know, in that, you know, first inch or so and then spiral it in and out. And that's also a cool way to map as well because you can tell her to say yes or fuck yes. If there's certain points and then as you're spiraling through, you'll find all sorts of points and then you, you know, okay, there's that says that these are special points for her and you can navigate in and out towards it. I hope you enjoyed that clip with the wonderful Tush Balik where the big takeaway is slow the fuck down, take some time and remember just the tip. The tip is really powerful and important.
