And as you said, there is a veil in front between two strangers, and it's your job to see how you can remove that or break that down or make that thin. Maybe you can give a little intro on who you are and what you've been doing in this space for quite some time, because you've been in this industry nearly pretty much as long as I have, I think. And, yes. That's so weird, because you're successful and I'm still at ne'er-do-well. All right, well, yeah, fill us in. Who are you? What's going on? Yeah, so obviously some people know me and some people don't. My name's Gareth Jones. I used to live in Los Angeles. And when I moved to Los Angeles, I was a rock and roll singer, which I think is probably the reason why James and I actually met. Long hair, doing the whole Hollywood thing. And I was brought into a company called the ABCs of Attraction because I got so interested in this stuff. And I ended up working with them for about four years and went off on my own. And when I went off on my own, young James Marshall said, \"'Would you like to coach on the Eurotour?' And I said, yes, I would. And then I was scared shitless because when you come from Hollywood, hindsight's 20-20, right? When you do the whole Western style pickup thing, it's more about like, what can you wear? What can you say? What can you do that will make a woman like you? And then when I went on the Eurotour, I was like an expert. I was like, oh, you guys are like meditating and stuff. This is, what the fuck is this? So I had a lot to learn. And unfortunately, you get to the point where you realize that everything you know is wrong and why it's wrong, but why it works. And then you clear up your activities and you learn the true and honest and good way. And that's what we've been doing for ages. At ABCs of Attraction, I really got pretty deep into language and texting and online dating. And of course, then dating apps came out, which was like a perfect transition. So I do a lot of work with obviously students about texting and those types of things. But I always regard myself as an infield coach because when I was working at ABCs of Attraction, it was bootcamps every weekend, bootcamps every other weekend. And then I started flying and it was bootcamps, bootcamps, bootcamps, bootcamps. So when we do things like Eurotour or bootcamp tours or whatever, residentials and stuff, it's pretty much in my wheelhouse. But yeah, so that's kind of what I've been doing for the last, what are we at? 13, 14, 15, somewhere around there. And it's all still awesome. Yeah, you and I are part of the dying breed of OG dating coaches that really did a lot of infield. You know, I know when I first met you, you were grinding in your own personal life. And as you said, like that density of teaching experience of taking guys out night after night, week after week is something, I mean, it's funny because I don't think it really exists anymore. There's us and you and Keegan and I guess a few one-man operators around, but most of that like old school. Guys that started out as pickup nerds and then moved into coaching and business is over as opposed to guys who get on now kind of cynically or from a profiteering point of view, just to set up a channel and try and punch out some generic dating stuff. So yes, Gareth has been around. He's seen things, many things. We've been through the trenches many times together. It's awesome to have you here. Okay, so let's open it up, guys. So hit us with some questions. You know the deal, whatever you want to talk about. Gareth's specialties, definitely in terms of texting online game, but as he said, and as I can attest to, he's as experienced as anyone I know in terms of all aspects of seduction. Okay, so Varun says, what are the best techniques, I'll just say some techniques, to spark attraction in an approach? I find my opening skills to be good, but I often skip to comfort and my interaction lacks that buzz and attraction. I find cold reading to be good techniques for attraction, but what are others? So essentially talking about, okay, so you're okay at starting a conversation. When you say skip to comfort, I guess you mean you kind of just talking about personal, how she feels about things, kind of mid game topics? Yeah, comfort is like an old kind of ABCs or mystery method thing where it's now about like learning who you are. It's more like the, I want to know you. And so what happens is she's not stimulated and you're skipping straight into the nice guy territory. Yeah, for sure. So I would think that you have, you could clarify what he means by attraction because that is clearly a pressure and release question that you're certainly, it would be foolish for me to answer that in front of you. Well, the way that I see this, and you won't like this answer, is that I don't see it as there is no attraction and I need to build or spark attraction. And then if I stopped doing whatever that was, that attraction vanishes. And now I'm only dealing with comfort like it's a leaky boat, right? Where I need to keep plugging holes and then refill it with attraction. The way that I, let's say, look at this on a meta level is that there is always the potential for attraction between men and women. And in some ways, it's like there's just a damn wall, a fairly thin damn wall between the two possibilities of these people being attracted. Now, of course, not all women are attracted to have the potential to be attracted to all men or vice versa. But that's the attitude that I come at it from, which is that I want to release attraction between us. It's there. I'm gonna assume it's there. Because if it's absolutely not, then I can't really build it out of nothing, right? Like if a woman is repulsed by me or just sees me as like, absolutely not, is the me doing something attractive to get her interested? Is it possible? Yeah. I mean, the only thing that really would do that is other women being interested in me. That's the one that kind of trumps many other ones where it's like, she's mostly can't help but go, why is he, why does she like him? So it's important to clarify too, that this is, we're talking about real attraction, not superficial attraction. Like guys oftentimes try to like show off how much money they have or like brag about themselves to generate what they think is attraction. And that's not, it's not gonna make her like you more. Yeah, although I think Varun's kind of talking about what's the thing that I do that like makes a girl feel like, you know, I do this. And then she's like, oh, I'm attracted to this guy. It's understandable that guys divide seduction into these categories. Cause I've done it and it's been part of, you know, like calling it attraction or comfort and the seduction phases or however you divide it up. It's understandable. And it also gives you some way to go. But I don't look at it as a linear progression where I'm doing the opener, then I do the attraction, then I do the comfort, then I do the seduction. I look at it like, how can I sync up with this person quickly? Because so much of like what makes a girl attracted to you is, well, firstly, she needs to be relaxed and feel not uneasy around you, not awkward. She needs to feel like she understands your communication style, right? Because these are things that allows her to like go from the, oh, it's a stranger that I'm just kind of dealing with to, okay, I'm in this interaction with the person and I wanna be there. It boils down to our fundamentals, our internal awareness, allowing us to take control of our own state and our body language. And yeah, the delivery issues as opposed to exactly what it is that I'm saying. And then it's the projection of intention, which speaks volumes compared to like, yes, I say things like, I think you're hot or whatever, you look sexy today. You know, I use direct. Really nice hair, that kind of shit. I say those kinds of things and they have an effect or not, but it's the real power and punch behind it is that I'm eating you alive with my eyes. It's that I can feel myself as a man and my, let's say, positive predatory instinct and that I am in moments, not all the time, because then it gets creepy, but that I'm ravishing you with my eyes, that I'm extremely present in real time with the girl so that the opportunities to like flirt are not ones that I'm planning. They're ones where, you know, I'm there immersed with her and she says, oh, you know, sometimes it's really hard. And I say, how hard is it? And you make that face too, Varun. Take that one. I'm talking about the hardness of my penis in case you're unsure. Oh, penis in your vagina. Exactly. Are we clear what we're talking about now? Don't do any of this. No, don't do any of this. But it's like a cheeky comment or, you know, telling her something that, yeah, is flirtatious is good to do. And would that like increase the attraction? Could well. But the important aspects of it really are gonna come down to these, the engines of seduction, which is your personal awareness, your external awareness of being able to read and adjust to the needs of the situation and the person in front of you, the projection of desire. And then the like, the comfort stuff, eventually, whether it's now or a date or whatever, I need to know you and you need to know me. And this is something, you said this, Gareth, actually, we were doing the five-step intention one day in one of the workshops. And the way you described it really, I thought it was beautiful because in the intent drill, you get to know the girl and then you can move on to wanting her, like in the sequence of events. And so you made that point that you can't really want somebody, like really want somebody until you know them. Now, the degrees to which you know them, it could be just like, I can see your spark. I can see your individual feminine spark. Therefore, I know that about you now. I can feel it, whereas I didn't before I met you. And vice versa, that she has this sense of like we actually know each other and then desire can truly unfold. Because what you're talking about is the like, I say the cocky, funny line and the girl went, ooh, that guy. Or she's like- I will fuck him now. Yeah, or they're like, oh, why did he dismiss me and pay attention to another girl? And therefore I might feel like I need his attention. Those things are real. They exist. You can do them to greater or lesser effect, sure. But that's like little curiosity hooks, right? It's not really attraction in the sense that she wants you as a person, wants you as a man. It's like, it's a little trick to get her attention. Okay, sure. You may play with those things. We've done them. I probably do them accidentally or otherwise sometimes. We would do it purposely all the time. I love it. I know, you definitely do more of that, for sure. It's totally for my own enjoyment though. I don't even know if it's helpful. Anything you wanted to add to that in terms of like this concept or application of like generating or releasing attraction? I think an important thing that we have to understand is the difference between interest and desire. And there are a lot of what guys think is attraction. So I think about attraction in terms of magnets, right? Like magnets are attracted to each other. It's not that one magnet like puts on a nice jacket and this magnet. It's like that's always gonna be that way. It's whether or not you're putting anything in front. And as you said, there is a thin veil in front between two strangers. And sometimes it's made of brick because she doesn't like fucking white guys or whatever. And sometimes it's made of paper and it's your job to see how you can remove that or break that down or make that thin or even just put a small hole. So she goes, oh, I see. And that's, you know, attraction is a really weird word that gets thrown around. And I don't think any of us really have like a particular definition that is like universal that we use. But you're absolutely right when you say like it's kind of one of those things you start out with and you do these little things and you get a little interest and that's nice. Here's my little line. But the core of the interaction is about seeing that other person and allowing that person to see you and to stimulate them in ways that are, you know, in accordance with, as you said, these engines of seduction.
