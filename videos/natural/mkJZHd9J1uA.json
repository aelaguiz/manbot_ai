What would you love to get from this experience? I want to feel like an inner security that I'm able to do this. I do a cold approach sometimes, but I can't anymore. I only want to see really clear signals that someone is interested. Alright, well we're going to be forcing you to take that chance from tomorrow. Well, I want to congratulate you, man, because I can see that it's a very strong thing for you and it's a strong thing for everybody here, but I can tell that your heart's really invested in this process, which is powerful and important. And we all need to also recognise that we are somewhat of a product of our environment, in the way people treat us, they judge us, the way they tell us who we are, etc. And in our more vulnerable moments, we take that as truth. We start to believe that what people say is true, especially when it's a girlfriend or a family member or somebody that we project some authority onto and then they're saying or projecting some kind of, you know, either direct or indirect kind of projection. It can have a big effect. So, yeah, you're in the right place, man, 100%. We want to teach you guys that what other people have said about you and have judged you to be and have limited you and tried to keep you in place is not your responsibility to hold on to. It's not your job to maintain the self-image that other people are trying to put you in because they're afraid of what you might be if they didn't keep you small. It's going to be a fun week, man. You're going to have so much energy and different personality by the end of the week. I'm excited to see how you leave. It's beginning the next chapter of your life. Have you done a shop approach yet? No. Okay, good. So, you're going to do a shop approach. I thought that you looked like really bored. I think I wanted to come in and see what's going on. No, I'm not so interested in perfumes. I'm more interested in you. It was beautiful to feel those little interactions that you were going through. Like, how does it feel to be the man? It feels great. I can feel my heart pumping. Yeah, it's beautiful. Like, even just that one little thing that now you've shared with her, now you can take that energy, which makes you feel good, and then use that, put that into your system and think, wow, this is another reference experience. This is another example that I can, if I want to, walk into a shop and talk to a girl. Feel good? Momentum moving? Let's keep going. We'll do another one. We'll do another one."}
