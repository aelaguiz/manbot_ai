I remember clearly one of my very first approaches way back in the mid-naughties when I was living as a musician bum in Melbourne. I was on the 86 tram, shout out to Brunswick Street hipsters, and I was sitting there minding my own business and reading a book probably because there was no Kindles back then and then this gorgeous radiant girl sat down in front of me. Looking back now that I've met some really, really gorgeous radiant girls, she was just cute but I remember her as being absolutely an angel. She had this little fringe and these little rosy cheeks, kind of the English rose looking lass and wearing some hippie dress and she sat down in front of me and she pulled out a tube of Lucas Porpoisement and everyone's going, uh, what? What is that? Well, that's this, Lucas Porpoisement, who I am endorsing right now and I've got a brand deal. This is actually a, uh, what do you call a sponsored video? So, uh, and currently it's not. I don't know how you can buy this. You can only buy these in Australia as far as I know. Uh, and in, in Brunswick and Fitzroy, pretty much everyone has a tube of this shit because this is, this is amazing. You're like, what is this? Like, is this anal lube or what is it? No, it's, it's lip stuff you put on your lips and it's made out of all natural stuff and it's, it's very nice. So anyway, she pulls out a tube and she applies it a little bit and then I'm there and I'm, and I've just kind of gotten the concept that you can approach girls. I'd read the book, you know, the book and I'd gone to a couple of lair meetings of seduction dudes, which was really kind of nerdy, nerdy guys trying to just trying to meet a woman. And they were talking about different techniques and whatever, but I hadn't, I hadn't tried any of these techniques where you go, where you go up to a girl and you say some story or you, you know, you do some cold reading thing on her or whatever. Uh, I, I hadn't really done anything. I was just thinking about it and here I was this moment and I had this compelling feeling that I had to do something. This, this was the girl of my dreams at that time. Uh, and I felt like I had to move and there was this magic, magic, beautiful moment where I realized I've got a tube of Lucas porpoise in my pocket right now. This is destiny. And so she's sitting there and I'm sitting there and I, and I do this. I pull this out slowly. I hold it out so she can see it. And I look at her, I smile and she looks at me now. Check this move guys. All right. Take a little bit of this and I go, well, this is embarrassing actually. But yeah, this is what I did. She's looking at me and we're holding this, this tension. This is like crack cocaine for your lips, huh? And she goes, yes, totally. I know. It's amazing. I can't live without it. I know. It's just like, if I leave the house without it, I feel like I'm totally naked. And then I put it back in my pocket. Hey, what's your name? Liz. Nice to meet you. I reach across and I shake her hands. Um, how's my lips look by the way? Probably a bit too shiny. And I said, well, where are you going? What are you doing? Going to the city? And she's like, yeah, I'm just going to go buy some CDs. Back when you bought CDs, CDs. And I'm like, oh my God. Yes. She likes music. Okay, cool, cool, cool. Stay calm. Stay calm. I'm a musician, right? Remember, this was my only thing. I played in a band that wasn't famous. So I'm like, okay, stay calm. Oh, cool. So, um, what kind of music do you, are you into? She's like, oh, you know, alternative stuff and like a bit of jazz and, uh, you know, reggae. And I'm like, good enough. Good enough. I don't really play those styles, but I can pretend. I said, oh, oh, cool. Yeah. I actually, I actually play in a band. Um, no, it's nothing, nothing serious, but you know, play, I would play around and she's like, oh yeah. What, what kind of type of music do you play? I'm like, oh, funk, soul, reggae, Latin, reggae, just reggae. And she said, oh yeah, cool. Nice. Yeah, cool. This is Australian. Yeah. Oh, cool. Right. Yeah. Oh, yeah, mate. Yeah. No, no. This is Australian seductions happening. This is how Australians breathe. And then I'm like, oh, she's like, oh, I'm going to get off a bit early. Cause I'm just going to grab a coffee at the, at the blue bell cafe. So it was Australia. Oh my God. I've forgotten all about Australia. And I say, oh, well maybe I could get your email. I'll put you on the email list of my band. And then, you know, I'll send you an email when we've got a gig, you know, maybe check it out. She's like, yeah, sweet. Sounds good. So like I did have a pen cause I carried pens around. I think I had a little satchel. I pulled out a pen and she wrote down her email address, liz something at hotmail.com. And, uh, and then off she got, she got off the tram. The spoiler is that I never saw her again. All right. Just let's just, let's just be clear about that. And it's, it's funny because I've met thousands of women since that day and many, many who are far more beautiful and probably more charming and so on than her, but she's stuck in my memory forever. And always, I will carry Liz with me to my grave because she was one of the first. And, uh, because there was, there was a, there was a vibe there. You know, there was, I still feel it right now. I'm like, Liz, if you're out there, everything I've done all of these years has been just to send this message. Anyone out there who knows Liz, please come on, get her to contact me. It's funny. I still feel it right now. And, and I think deep down she does too. Right. Right. Right. Anyway, I sent, obviously I sent her an email pretty much straight away. You know, as soon as we had the shittiest, like, and I was like, guys, we've got to get a gig. Come on guys, like anything. And I think it was at some book fair or something. And I sent her, sent her an email just saying, Hey Liz, got, got a gig coming up soon. And yeah, it's like, you know, 2pm at this market. So yeah, hopefully see you there. She didn't come. And I sent her a few more and she never came. So it was, it was a few years later, once I'd gotten past this beginner's phase of just trying random stuff out. And as I started hanging out with guys that you would consider to be naturals and started to dissect what it was that they were doing, that I realized when I, when I thought back on that interaction, I realized what I'd done very, very well. And the reason that I'd fucked it up, it wasn't, it wasn't a mystery to me. Once I understood the principles, right? Because by luck or just by vibe, or just by the fact that we had a little bit of chemistry in those, in that, those early moments, I was utilizing some of the principles, the five principles of natural seduction intuitively. And because I operated from them, I was getting some positive results. It was, it was creating sexual tension. It was creating a emotional connection. It was leading somewhere. And also because I didn't understand the principles completely, and I was just stabbing in the dark and just free-forming, I lost it. Right? There is a, there is a timeline somewhere out there, uh, in the quantum fucking potential realities of the something some physicists can explain, uh, that, you know, there's multiple timelines. There was a timeline where Liz gave me her phone number and we went on a date. Date? Well, actually Australians don't go on dates. They just go and have a beer and then they go home and have sex. And then I wake up in a relationship. So there was a timeline where that could have happened easily, but it didn't because I didn't understand the principles. Now, the point of this video is an extension from part one, where firstly, I trashed some of my competitors, which I've been wanting to do for a long time. And right now, by now, I've got fuck you money and I've like, I've earned the right to do a bit of a trash. And, uh, and those guys don't, they don't, it's not going to bother them. They can feel free to have a trash back at me, RSD. Come on, let's have it. Let's do this. We've been, we've been dancing around this for years. Let's have a little play. Uh, but aside from the gossip and, and, uh, a little bit of drama, the point of the previous video was to outline the difference between technique-based learning, which is stacking, I do this and then I do this and I do that. So if we were to like break down that interaction from a technique-based situation, this would be the Lucas pawpaw ointment technique, right? Which you could actually do this in Australia. You could carry this around. And, uh, every time you saw a girl pull this tube out, which would be not that uncommon, you would see it, you'd be ready, right? And so you'd go, okay, the Lucas pawpaw technique is when the girl pulls out the tube, you go and sit next to her, you pull out your tube, hold it within eye range of the girl, unscrew lid, uh, anti-clockwise, take small amount of Lucas pawpaw ointment, apply to your lips, look at girl. If she doesn't give you, get attention, give her a little kick with your foot, then deliver the line, it's like, it's like crack cocaine for your lips, right? Girl will then laugh and agree, then replace cap, reach hand out and introduce yourself. End of routine number one. Guys, there's some guys out there who are writing this down. That would be breaking that down from a technique-based perspective. Now, I think most of you guys can see why that's not going to work very well. It's not alive, is it? It's very contrived, it's very calculated. It doesn't allow for spontaneity or flow. It's not very fun. It's, it's, it's an absurd way to think of things. The way that we really should look at this, uh, if we want to break down this interaction is from the understanding of principles. So let's look at what did I do well and what did I fuck up? At the time, I was very confused about what I'd done wrong. Had I sent the wrong email? Should I have said, instead of, hey, Liz, should I have said, what's up, Liz? Now that's a bit American. Should I have said, yo, yo? No. Should I have just said, Liz? Exclamation mark. Should I have done like some callback humor about the pork ointment, right? That was our thing. That was our thing, right? We had this little thing we had going on there. Maybe I should have said something like, oh, did you find any like cheap places to get pork ointment? If you do, get me a case. No, no, that's lame. And so I was trying to figure out what, what, what was the damage control that I could have done better? Uh, because I was sure it was something to do with the email, right? I mean, we had a great, we had a good talk. We seemed to like each other. I asked for an email. She said she wanted to come to my gig and then she didn't. So fuck, something wrong with the email. And so I tried to figure this out. And I think, I'm pretty sure that I sent her a couple of these invitations to gigs. And I'm pretty sure that I also eventually sent her some really cringy email, like something like, hey, Liz, you know, I guess, uh, you know, your inbox is full, but if you ever get this email, it'd be cool to like meet up and talk about music or something like that. Uh, I'm pretty sure I did. I've kind of blanked that out and I'll, it'll come out in therapy later, but I think I did something like that. So looking back once, once I, once I came to an understanding of the mechanics, the universal mechanics of seduction through principles, looking back at this interaction, it was very simple. Ah, I see exactly what I did wrong. I can do an autopsy on this in a minute and I can see, yep, this is, this was my fundamental mistake. If I'd done this or change this aspect, it quite likely would have led to that timeline where Liz and I are now, uh, married with children. Hmm. Maybe it's a good thing that I fucked it up. Yeah, it is. Life is very confusing. Anyway, the, the subsequent years, this, this was my early approaches. I went out and did this a lot. Approached a lot of women in a free form manner. I came in contact with the early mystery method staff and various other early seduction teachers. I didn't like it. I just couldn't bring myself to go up to a girl and neg her or say stories about myself that weren't true or to wear things that didn't fit my personality. I just couldn't bear to do it. And, and I thought maybe, maybe I should be, maybe other guys are going to get way better results because they're going to do it by the book. But for me, I just had to, had to let that stuff go. I, I just couldn't bring myself to do it. So I was going to just free form it. And I'm glad, very glad that that was my attitude because I saw a lot of other guys, as I talked about in the previous video, following these techniques that were based, that were designed for maybe college girls in, uh, in America, uh, and trying to apply them in Australia or Europe and, and falling flat on their faces and, uh, gradually reaching frustration points where they gave up the whole thing. And I saw many generations of men go through that, trying out all these techniques, which promised them, promised them unbreakable, unbeatable results, right? This technique works. This opener is a hundred percent strike rate. And so the guy goes and does it, doesn't work. So either decides that all seduction is lies, all of this stuff is bullshit, or he decides there's something wrong with him. Okay. It's just that, well, that guy on the video can do it, but I can't do it. So that means that I'm just essentially not attractive and therefore I need to give up. So both of those things are pretty tragic. And that's where a lot of men ended up. Luckily for me, I was aiming to be myself, right? That was my aim was to, to try to learn how to be more seductive, more compelling, more creative, more able to interact with women, more brave. That was the main one initially was like how to get over the fear and to just, as my initial business partner said, if I can take my balls in my hand and go over there and make it happen. Now, what did he say? He used to, he used to say, this shit is 90% balls, right? He was the original direct guy that I knew. This shit is 90% balls. And that stuck with me forever. And he was right. Yeah, he really was. The 10%, the extra 10%, that's, that's where it becomes high art. But so much of it is just fucking taking your nuts and walking over there, which is a strange image, isn't it? It's like, why would you be holding your balls when you walk over to a girl that don't do Yeah, it's a metaphor. So hold your balls in your mind, in your, just, no, just leave your balls in your pants and remember that 90% of your balls are, no, fuck, it's getting confusing. Anyway, you get the idea. So as I started hanging out with guys who were intuitively or naturally good with women, I started looking at what are the crossover points? What are the, where is the intersection in terms of their behavior, their mindsets, and their actions that seems to lead to results? Because the first crew of guys that I was rolling with in the streets of Melbourne were very different in temperament, in personality, in looks, and in the way that they behaved with women. One of them, the guy I mentioned before, was a very slick club guy who was all about pulling the trigger hard. He didn't really have conversations with women particularly. He didn't really remember their names or anything. He was pure sex on legs and he made it happen. And it was breathtaking to watch him just roll up to girls on dance floors, say something in their ears, which I would ask him later, what the fuck did you say? And he'd tell me and I'd be like, uh, that's the thing? It wasn't the thing. It was the way he did it. It was the implication. It was the tension. And it was the fact that he pulled the trigger hard. Another guy was almost depressingly slow. Like he was just a kind of a vortex. He was actually quite depressed. Not necessarily a very pleasant person, but a very charismatic person. He drew you in with his silence, with his pressure. There was a need to validate yourself in his eyes that even I felt, everyone felt, men and women. And then another guy who was super social, super chameleonic, really friendly, really gregarious, and really generous, would just give a lot of himself, of energy, of anything he had, he would just be handing it out to people. And it wasn't needy in any sense, but it had a very powerful effect. And then myself, who was developing my kind of more refined and elegant, conversational-based seduction, but starting to use elements that I'd seen in these other seducers and they were using elements of mine. The four of us combined our forces and really built this. And it was me who codified it and figured out how these principles work across the board for men of any type. So it was over those few years that I started to realize that there are universal laws at play here. It's not about that I said this or I wrote the right email or the wrong email. It's about understanding that there is an underlying machinery, there is an engine of seduction, and it's the same across cultures, across different personalities. Not in terms of the application, because the way that you do it, the things you say, the vibe you have, the personality you have, of course, that is your unique expression. You look at the difference between me and Liam and we're very different people and we interact with women in very different ways, but we both understand the five principles at a deep level. And I've been searching for quite some time to see, am I missing something? Is there a sixth or seventh or whatever principle? And I'm very willing to be proven that I was wrong, like any good scientist or social scientist. So if you think that you have the sixth principle, please feel free to put it in the comment section below and we'll run it through with laboratory tests and see if it holds up. But as far as I'm concerned, and from all my experimentation and learning and travel and teaching, there are only five. Now let's look at how they apply to Liz, because it's very important that we figure out what went wrong. Now, before I get into breaking down my lost love affair with Liz, I wanna talk to you briefly about the final legacy edition of the five principles of natural seduction online course. Now, I've been teaching the five principles through my live courses for the last 10 plus years. This has been the basis for all of the results that my students have got. Several years ago, I codified this into an online course, which was an incredible success commercially and in terms of the results that my students got. I then did a 2.0 version a couple of years ago. My timeline's all messed up. Couple of years ago, three years ago, I don't know. I bounced around the world all the time, but it was a while ago. And what I'm gonna be doing in the beginning, early stages of 2019, is releasing the final word. This is my legacy edition on the five principles. I've gone back over all of the original material and it holds up. A lot of that original material was recorded five, six years ago, but it is really like the Levi genes of seduction. And that's always been my intention with the natural lifestyles, to teach stuff that works and has always worked and will always work. Of course, there'll be new variations as technology changes or as the social scenarios change or as people become more global or whatever, there will be adjustments. But what I've found is that these principles are universal laws. They are what Casanova used. They are what Cleopatra used. They are what the great seducers and seductresses of all time used, whether they didn't talk about them in these nerdy terms, of course, but this is the true universal laws of seduction. So what I'm doing in the final 3.0, the legacy edition, is I am adding to this all of the mindsets, all of the mental aspects that correlate to the principles. Because in the original five principles, essentially this is dry science, right? I'm looking at this really from an objective position where I'm going, okay, this is how it works. These are the mechanics of it. This is how you apply it. Go out there and take it and make it yours. But there are all sorts of correlating aspects, which over the years, as I have improved my teaching methods, as I have tweaked things and taken feedback from students, I've seen that there is a lot more that needs to be understood in order to apply these laws. A lot of this relates to your mindsets, your belief structures, what you think about yourself, what you think about women, what you think about and feel about the interplay between the masculine and feminine. So my attempt here in this legacy edition is to give you everything that I have, everything that I've ever taught my students live because I am moving into retirement fairly soon and I want to leave behind something that I am proud of and that I know is going to continue to have great effects in the world. So if you want to be kept up to date with the final launch of the five principles, then click the link in the bio, smash that like button, buy my merch, you know the deal, click the link, put your email into the VIP list. You will immediately receive a 47 point, what is it Alex? 47.23 minute free video which is from the Masculine Mastermind Conference. This is an unreleased video where I demonstrate how to use the five principles in terms of conversation, especially those delicate first five minutes, right? The five minutes when you're there with Liz and this is your make or break. So I'm gonna show you how to use the five principles to make sure that that initial conversation works really well. So to receive that free video and also to be kept on the VIP list with all sorts of private updates in the lead up to the launch, click the link, put your email in and I'll be in touch with you very soon. Not me, an automated bot which will send you emails but you know what I mean. Right, let's get back to Liz. So how does the five principles apply to this interaction? The first principle is awareness and I divide this into internal and external awareness. Now that's so that you can wrap your mind around it but once you start to understand things at a deeper level as you start to meditate more, you realize that there is no difference between internal and external awareness. Take that as an idea and roll with it for as many years as you need to. But in the initial stages, it's good to look at it this way. Internal awareness is all about understanding how your body works, how your breath works. It's about being able to direct focus outside of this monkey mind that's always chattering and thinking things somewhere else redirecting focus into your body. The reason why often I come across as sexy and charismatic, I'm not saying you think I'm sexy but some girls do and some of you think I'm charismatic. So often people think that or feel that is because I'm at ease in my body. Right now, I'm physically relaxed. Yeah, I can feel that I'm not holding tension up in my shoulders, that I'm not like tensing my face, that I'm not fidgeting and scratching and feeling all this tension that needs to be exhibited. And if I was delivering the video in this way, right? You might not necessarily see that he's holding his shoulders in a certain way and he's licking his lips too much or anything like that. You might not notice those specifics but you would get a feeling that this guy is tense. You would get a feeling, I don't really buy this. This guy is the guy that's gonna teach me this stuff. You wouldn't really buy it, right? And that's how many people are all the time. And it's certainly something that I've been through, learning how to become a performer and a speaker and somebody who goes and interacts with lots of strangers because it's tense. It's tense to be under pressure, to be in the spotlight, to be put on the spot where your ego can be dented and damaged. And learning how to be at ease, even in situations which are completely chaotic, is one of the most vital skills you can learn. I learned that through martial arts, through meditation, through yoga, through Tai Chi, through methodologies that allow me to direct focus out of here and into my body. So I was doing a lot of meditation and martial arts at the time of Liz. And so I was pretty chilled, I was physically chilled. My internal awareness was working all right. I was sitting there, probably I was even sitting there meditating because back then the phones were boring. All I did was text and call. So there's no point looking at them. If you didn't have a text message, it was pointless to look at it. So you just kept it in your pocket. And I'd forgotten my book. Now, then we got into the external awareness. This is where Liz sits down in front of me and I notice her firstly. I'm like, whoa, I like her, she's a pretty girl. And I'm reading that something about her movements, something about the way she glanced at me, I had a feeling that I had a chance here. And you guys, if you're ever in a state of relaxation or not being totally up in your head, you've probably had experiences where you've had a feeling that there's a girl in the bar or a girl across at the coffee shop where you're like, maybe, is there something there? Or you're just kind of compelled like to look at her more. And that's because she's noticed you. That's because in those moments, she's thinking, that boy's cute. Yeah, or she's thinking, I'm horny and he'll do. Whatever, it doesn't really matter as long as she's giving you some kind of attention, some kind of vibe. And the truth is, most of the time when a man who's not trained in seduction goes and talks to a girl, let's say he's drunk in the bar and he gets up the courage to go and talk to a girl, it's not because he chose, he didn't look at her and go, okay, that's the girl I want. I'm gonna go over there and I'm gonna give it a shot. What's really happened is she's noticed him and gone, yeah, he's cute or he'll do. And she's given signals, right? She's giving a little look. She's adjusting her body language in certain ways. She's open, opening herself. She's, you know, instead of like blocking herself in with her girlfriend, she turns herself out a little bit. She lifts her chin. She looks at you once every five seconds. And so the guy perceives that girl's approachable. Like she looks pretty and that's why girls who are like technically not super beautiful, but are cute and have big eyes or make their eyes look big and like, you know, pout a little bit and push their cleavage up. Those girls get way more play than the ice queen catwalk models. You know, the staunch looking Eastern European model at the bar in the VIP section, most guys are gonna look at her and go, not a chance. I don't have a fucking chance in hell. I would rather not have my ego obliterated on the dance floor. So I'm just gonna pretend I didn't even see her. And we see that on workshops. It's funny. You know, one of those girls walks down the street and you see the students suddenly going, looking up at the architecture. You know, we've been looking for girls for five minutes. We haven't seen a cute girl. And then suddenly she walks by and the guy's like, oh, just looking at other stuff. And I'm like, did you not notice that girl walk by? And they're like, which girl? The 10? You mean, no, no, I don't mean the tree. I mean the exquisitely, you didn't notice? Oh, oh, oh yeah. Go and talk to her. She's not kind of my type. She's everyone's type. You're just terrified. Go on, it'll be good for you. That's my job to make him do that. But the truth is that in the normal world, it's the cute girls who present themselves as available.
