Yeah, like what is this place? It used to be very different Yeah, the last time I was in Hong Kong was when was it? 2007 or something Yes, yeah, I had a great time I was a studying going through So, yes, I was in China a lot too special people and The last time I went which was four years ago Very good. Yeah 1984 with AI it was terrifying. I mean for me it was fine, but I was like camera camera camera camera tracking everything But they didn't care that a lot way with it Cool all right. Well, here's my stop. That was my tree I mean, no, I'm a man of my word. So lovely to meet you Alright have an awesome time Okay, so That's an example of dealing with the common objection that people have to meeting strangers and especially Asian ladies who have just arrived in Barcelona meeting a dude dressed like this That's understand They felt nervous now I can read that very clearly and you would hear in the initial interaction where they're trying to like as quickly as possible go Politely get rid of me Now often I would just politely leave but I wanted to give them the gift of hanging out with me for a bit and Seeing that strangers aren't necessarily bad. Even if they dress like fucking psycho And are a bit of psycho in a good way So, how did I relax it by calling it out by just saying look I see what's going on here And I had no intention of trying to get their contacts because they're not exactly my type I was nicer than they were actually more lovely than Many men might give them credit for it. You say approach them when those girls were tight and not something No, they're just nervous and they knew to town and they met some weird dude. That's why I just made up the opener I'm not a promoter for a cool club Because maybe I look like do I Fuck you fine. I don't whatever I said, whatever whatever came to my mind by the end of it. We were chill We're having a discussion about the politics of Hong Kong And I told him this is where I'm gonna this is my stop and probably that we could have continued chatting and probably I could Have got an Instagram Instagram But I don't need to because I found now I'm warmed up and now they feel better and they're like What was that all about and life continues beautiful moments on beautiful moments?
