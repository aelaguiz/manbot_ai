Now we're talking about real in a game here, real change work. It's like adding new information, new perspectives, new shifts to how you're operating and you can do it that fast. You can do it very quickly, with the right kinds of questions and the right kinds of focus. I was looking over a lot of the Ask the Natural questions and a lot of repeating ideas and some common things and a lot of questions that aren't really useful questions basically. And what got me thinking was that rather than answering some questions that aren't really that useful, why not talk about asking good quality questions and learning how to manage yourself in a more effective way. So basically I want to give you guys a really cool formula today to get you moving from a place of really not thinking very clearly to a place where you're trusting yourself a lot more effectively. I know this is really useful because I use it myself and I work with this same kind of technology with my clients all the time and it has very very profound results. So the first thing I want you guys to recognize is that you are amazing at being able to understand and create your interpretation of reality. You're doing it all the time, you can't not do it. You are always taking in information, processing it, making stories out of it and then making up beliefs and ways in which you interact with the world. And as soon as you do that, you create that reality. It's like a powerful mechanism to be able to take this field of possibility that could mean many things, turn it into something and then make it exactly what it is. So what I wanted to talk to you about first of all is how to stop asking dumb questions and how to start asking good questions. Something that's really common that people do is they ask themselves questions like, how do I do that? I'm not sure if I can. I don't know how to do that or what do I need to really get the result? And it seems like fair questions, right? We're asking ourselves prompting questions which move us in a certain sort of direction. But the problem is when we ask those questions but we don't really look for answers and we don't trust our own answers. So there can be a tendency when we are looking for a solution to something to ask questions which then put us into a kind of a feedback loop or a spiral of not really finding useful information. For example, it's not really useful if you want to get better socially to set that goal and then start to think, well, I don't know how to do that so I'm not sure what I should do. Then you basically hang out in a sense of doubt and insecurity and what does that do? It starts to wire your brain up in such a way that it has doubt and insecurity as part of your programming, part of your expectation, part of your projection of reality. One thing I would encourage you to do is to ask questions but start to look for your own answers. Start to set up the possibility that you can just find an answer. So for example, I don't know how to do that. What if there was a part of you that did? What if you could create three possible reasons why it might work and then start to develop and work with that? Why do you do that? Because it starts to develop self-trust, it starts to develop intuition, it starts to develop a connection with what we could call the unconscious process and the unconscious is really what we want to get into harmony with. It's a part of us that is really working very hard to keep us alive and to keep us happy according to the best that it knows and if we don't work with it consciously, then it will just tend to push and pull us through life in a very kind of reactive way and most of the time when people say, you know, I'm feeling frustrated or I'm sabotaging myself or I can't get what I want or I don't know why I can't do this thing that I really want to do, it's because they're out of alignment with themselves, they're out of alignment with their unconscious mind. So one of the ways that you get alignment is you start to trust that it has information for you. You start to ask it questions and then listen for the feedback and be patient with it. So that's the first thing I want you guys to work with is when you ask questions, you notice yourself asking questions, start to create possible answers that might be useful and then play with those answers. Maybe they're useful, maybe they'll help you, maybe you'll get some results. Think about it. Most of the greatest innovations, breakthroughs, transformations, information, you know, most of the biggest things that have happened in terms of developments have come from people that have basically just made shit up. So I'm not just saying just pluck ideas from nowhere and don't qualify those ideas as being useful but I'm saying open your mind to the possibility that you already have answers within you, that you can trust that, that you can start to work with that. So that's the first thing is stop asking questions that are not so useful and start trusting that you can reframe yourself to be able to ask questions that are going to give you answers. How do I do that? Okay, how do you do that? Well, ask the deeper parts of you that know how to do that to give you some answers now and trust, start to work with that. And I know this is a little bit weird maybe if you're not used to doing this kind of thing because I'm asking you to work with yourself at a deeper kind of level. The next point is that you are creating your relationship with reality all the time with your focus. And when I say that I mean the habits of your focus create what you feel, how you think, who you think you are, how to interpret your world around you. And if you understand what I'm saying then you'll realize that it's the feelings, the thoughts, the internal dialogue, the ways in which we focus on the certain aspects of evidence, the certain things that are going on around us that create the sensations, the experiences, the opportunities that you have around you. Now, do me a favor. Think about something that is not useful for you at the moment. Think about a problem, something that makes you feel uncomfortable, something that makes you feel frustrated, something that makes you feel like you don't really want to feel like that. Just take a moment. Got it? Good. Now, I want to ask you a really cool question. How do you do that problem? What do you have to focus on to create that problem in such a way that you think it's a problem, that it feels like a problem? And you will find if you pay attention when you ask that question, what do you have to do? What do you have to consider to pay attention to, to focus on, to have that problem? And as you do that you'll notice that there's an actual code to it. There's a certain set of feelings, thoughts, internal dialogue, you know, information, focus on certain information, certain pieces of the environment around you that create that kind of experience. And when you do that, guess what it does? It tells the nervous system to fire up a reaction. And every time you fire up that reaction, it sends out neurochemistry. That neurochemistry influences how your physiology feels, what you respond to, what kinds of information you have access to, what kinds of states you go into. And what most people do is they focus on something they don't want, they feel bad about it, they don't like the feeling of feeling bad about it, so then they ask themselves bad questions about why they feel bad about it. And then they find more evidence and they fire it up again, and again, and again, and again. And they just keep re-firing the nervous system to have these kinds of reactions to the environment around them. And what does that do over time? It sets up pathways, strong neural pathways, habits. It sets up chemical tendencies and almost addictions inside of the brain. So what that does is that creates who you are over time, it creates your tendencies. The truth is that you are constantly changing. Every part of you is constantly changing, physically, mentally, emotionally, energetically, everything's changing. Some parts more slower than others, but ultimately everything's changing. There is literally nothing inside your body that will stay the same over an extended period of time. So the real miracle is how do you keep creating problems? You have to work hard to keep your problems there. So start to change your focus. First thing in changing your focus is realize that you're creating it in some ways, you're doing it, you're making it happen to a degree. And the next thing is start to realize, well, what can you do to shift that? Well, I'll ask you a more quality question. What were you not considering that is not the problem? It's got nothing to do with the problem. That is going on around you that is basically good, that is basically fine, that is basically useful, neutral, or changing in the way that you want. So what is it that you're not considering that is not the problem that is basically good, that is transforming, changing, and moving in a way that you would like to, or it's supporting you in some way? And guess what? The whole world is going on around you. It's not your problem. I mean, your body is taking care of you. There's people and places and situations and systems that you may not have been paying attention to that are all in place to help you to do what you need to do. Right now I'm sitting on a train. It's a miracle. I get to drive along in this amazing machine that takes me from one country to another, and it's taking care of me. It's getting me where I need to go. And I can focus on that. I can focus on this huge, expansive environment outside, this perfect biosphere of weather and light and, you know, there's people around me. There's everything I basically need that's all here to basically support me. And I can trust in that. I can use that. I can start to feel how that makes me feel. Now when I think of a problem and I think of all that other stuff, all the other stuff is way, way, way, way, way bigger than any problem. So what does that do? It starts to make you realize that your problems are pretty insignificant and small in the face of all the cool stuff that's actually going on. Now the next question is, how does it make you feel to consider all the things that are not your problem that are changing in the ways that are useful or good or helping you in some way? And I'm going to take a guess that when you really consider those things, it's going to make you feel either neutral or really good. So you're going to start to feel quite stable and quite strong inside yourself. And I want you to spend some time really doing that. Notice the changes inside your nervous system because you asked a good quality question. What was I not considering that's not the problem that is changing the way that I want? So think about that. How does that feel? Feels good. Okay, good. Now you feel good. Take a look at the problem again except feel good when you look at it and notice what's different. Notice that you can't look at the same problem with a different state and not change it. So this is something very interesting as well. We can't have the same reactions to old problems if we have different states, different perspectives, different information. Now we're talking about real in a game here, real change work. It's like adding new information, new perspectives, new shifts to how you're operating and you can do it that fast. You can do it very quickly with the right kinds of questions and the right kinds of focus. For over 20 years, I had the great pleasure and honor of being close friends with and working with Mr. Shea Matthews. And after all this time, he always surprises me and blows my mind with the incredible wealth of knowledge and practical internal tools that he is so masterful at. A big part of our live workshops, as you know, is lots and lots of seduction related stuff infield technicalities of texting, of dating, of conversation, flirting, all of this kind of stuff. But all of this is underpinned with our internal change technologies because the reality is if you don't deal with your issues, going out and trying to connect with the opposite sex, you're always going to be kind of driving with a handbrake on, says the man who doesn't know how to drive. But I know handbrakes shouldn't be on when you're driving. Thank you very much. So at our seven day residential coming up in Budapest from the 9th of May, myself and Shea will be leading this workshop. He emphasizing all the internal change aspects and myself dealing with the out in the world meeting the chick stuff. And together, it's an extremely powerful combination. So if you'd like to work with myself, Shea and the rest of the Teen Out team coming up in May in Budapest, Hungary, click the link below, get on a call with one of our lads, have a chat and see if it's the right fit for you. All right. See you in the next video. Peace."}
