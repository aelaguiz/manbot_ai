Like, that's not enough time for a woman to even kind of wake up, right? For her body to go, oh, there's sexual things happening, and it's like, oh, you can go back to sleep because it's over now. This generation's doing much better. Twice as well, actually. The current stats are between five and seven minutes, so we're doubling it. And if we compound it every generation, in another couple of generations, it'll be good, but we don't want to wait around for that, because five to seven minutes, again, is pretty much nothing."}
