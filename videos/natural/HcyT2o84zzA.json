It is... In this video I'm going to depart from my usual topics and look a little bit at wealth creation, money mindsets, some of the things that I've learned about how to create wealth. Now, if you've ever thought about this and you've researched online, how do rich people get rich, or what are wealthy mindsets, the mindsets of the rich people out there, then you've probably come across things like this. I just did a quick search on what is a generic wealth mindset, here's a bunch of them. Rich people are committed to being rich. Poor people want to be rich. Rich people think big. Poor people think small. Rich people focus on opportunities. Poor people focus on obstacles. Rich people admire other rich and successful people. Poor people resent rich and successful people, and so on. Now, I don't necessarily think those are incorrect statements, and some of them we could dissect and play with, and I think the first thing is there are economic realities in the world, and so whenever anyone is talking about how to get wealthy, I don't think it's fair to be saying that poor people have terrible mindsets if they're living in situations where it is impossible to succeed. It doesn't really matter what your money mindsets are if you're in sub-Saharan Africa in a tiny village and you've got militias coming in and burning your villages. It doesn't matter how much you vision board and use the power of the secret, I don't think that's a fair thing, so I think there is a little bit of victim blaming when it comes to these kind of statements, because we do live in economic realities on a planet where there is inequality out there, and everyone's like, I knew it! James is a communist! No, I'm not a communist. So you've probably heard these kinds of things, and there definitely are mindsets that people who are more successful in life have or foster, and there are different ways of thinking that people who tend to move towards unsuccess or move towards not getting what they want as opposed to moving towards what they do want, and of course this relates to everything that we do with seduction and women, like if you have a core belief that you're unattractive or that women are something, bitches, hard to get, only want you for your money, or you have some inbuilt belief that is detrimental to actually meeting and dating women, then it's not going to assist you, of course. But there's a lot more to it than just these kind of empty platitudes. So what I want to do today is just have a chat about an area that I don't think these wealth creation experts talk a lot about, which is how to spend money, or the habits of spending that you have and how that affects you. When I was 18, myself and John Thompson, one of our coaches, we finished high school and instead of going to university like all our other buddies, we didn't know what we wanted to, well we did know what we wanted to do, we wanted to go to India and have rad adventures, that's what we wanted to do. So as young men with no qualifications, the only thing that we could trade on was our labour, and so what we did is we opened the yellow pages, yes this was pre-internet, and what we did was we went to the post office where they had the yellow pages for other towns and we'd heard that there was fruit picking opportunities way out west, there was orange gold out there. And so we found the yellow pages for a town called Griffith, and we looked up orange farms and we found a bunch of orange farms, which we heard was the thing to pick through our great networks at the time, called a bunch of people until someone said, yeah we've got some work, and we're like, how do you get paid, you get paid by the bin, and what's a bin, it's a half a tonne of oranges, so you've got 25 bucks, 25 Australian bucks per bin, and we're like, 25 bucks, woah, imagine if we could do that every hour. And so what we did is we packed up our lives into a shitty van that John had, and we drove ten hours, because in Australia you have to drive ten hours to get anywhere, and we drove ten hours through the desert, past the black stump, to this tiny town past Griffith called Hilston, and it was something like out of the wild west, it was like desert, and this fucked up old town of about a thousand people, and the only thing that was going on in the area was farming, and what they'd done was irrigate through the desert, they'd diverted a river and irrigated an area so they had these massive orange farms just rising up out of the desert, and the pickers, the fruit pickers, lived on site, and so we had this crappy caravan park, and we were given a shitty caravan, which we had to pay for, and then we went out there and we went to work, and what this involved was getting up every morning, basically at dawn, and when I think back I'm like, wow, I used to get up at dawn for four months in my life, and we go out to the orange field and the tractor would drop a big half ton crate, and then you would run up and down ladders picking fruit into a bag and dumping it in there and doing it as fast as you can to fill up the bins, and then you'd go throughout the day and do that, and we got pretty good at this, that's all we did for ten, literally ten hours a day and seven days a week, we were just picking fruit, we'd stop for half an hour for lunch and then we kept on going, because there was nothing else to do out there, and so we would end up, if on a good day, we'd pick each like four to five bins once we got our speed up, so we were making like 100 to 150 Aussie dollars a day, which was a huge amount of money for us, because it meant that we could make about $700,000 a week if we worked really, really hard, which we did. And as a result, after the four month period that we did this backbreaking labour, which I look back on as one of the better times of my life actually, it was really character building, it was really fun and it was really rough, but we had a good time out there. And after those four months, we'd saved up enough money to go back to Canberra where we were, pack all our stuff, book our tickets and fly to Asia. And then, at the age of 18, we travelled all around South East Asia, through Bali, through Thailand, through India, and had the wild adventures of spiritual exploration and going to crazy places that we'd wanted. Now, at the same time, if we rewind back to this fruit picking caravan park, there was two other groups in the park. There was a big group of Thai pickers, people from Thailand, they're just called the Thais, we're the Thais, they'd say. And they had about 10 men and one woman, and they'd built their own kind of mini little village there, like literally built it out from scratch. And what would happen is that when you went out to pick fruit in the morning, they'd already been out for two hours. Because what they would do is they'd get up at dark, and the Mama Thai, as we called her, she would have gotten up even an hour earlier, and she'd have breakfast ready for all the pickers. So they'd be eating in the dark, and they'd go out in the dark, and as the first hint of dawn came, they'd be up the ladders working. And those guys worked until dark. So they worked about 12 hours every single day. And they worked as like a kind of a cartel, it seemed, because every couple of weeks, a brand new car would turn up. So they would work as a group, and then they would buy a new car. And so they worked as this consortium that created quite a lot of wealth, and then different people from Thailand would come and go, and so they would go there, work their asses off for a certain amount of time, and then go back to Thailand, and I guess live it up, now that they're rich and leveraging the currency difference. So on the one side, we had the Thais, and then the rest of the caravan park was filled with Aussies. And they were all like old gentlemen, all drunks, and all running from something. Like this was the ends of the earth, when men ended up when they were running from the law or from their ex-wife or whatever fucked up thing they'd done in their life. And so they ended up there, and they stayed in that park for years, the people who'd been there for 10 years. Now the interesting thing was, all of those guys, what they did was they would work pretty hard, they didn't work as hard as the Thais or not as hard as us, but they would roll out there at 8, 9 in the morning, and they'd work their 8 plus hours a day, and make their 100 bucks-ish a day. And then every Sunday, they would be completely broke. Because what they would do is they'd work really hard through the week, and then on Friday, Saturday, they'd go into the pub, and they would gamble, and they would drink, and they would whore, well actually they couldn't whore, we didn't even have a whore in that town, that's how fucked up it was. So they would basically drink their wages away, and then by Sunday night, they would be literally penniless. And then they'd roll up Monday morning, hungover as fuck, and then they'd do it all again. And they did that for years, and I really wonder what ended up happening to those kinds of guys. So the interesting thing here is there is definitely a mindset difference, right, in these three groups. We went there highly motivated to do this for a short amount of time, to save up a certain amount of money so that we could get the fuck out of there and go on our adventures. The Thais had come there as their opportunity to leave Thailand and earn Western currency, and then go back to Thailand and become cool dudes. And the Aussie pickers, hey Aussies, for them it was just this endless grind of work, spend, back to zero. Now, it's an extreme case, but I think it exemplifies something that a lot of people with, let's say, poverty mindsets have, which is that they're okay going back to zero. They're used to, in some ways there tends to be a race to go back to broke, to zero, because they don't really know what to do with a surplus of money. So one thing that I learned really early on, I don't know how I learned, I was just kind of naturally frugal, but I had this idea that $1,000 was zero. So for me, in my early years after high school and in my early 20s, having $1,000 in my bank account, and it'll be different in different currencies and different locations, but having $1,000 was, I changed the idea in my mind that I had $1,000 to I have zero. So that little bit of buffer was not something that I was going to touch. And it's not that I never touched it, there will be certain circumstances where I would touch it if a really great opportunity came along, or I was moving towards a very specific goal. For example, when I wanted to go to China for the first time when I was 22, I think it was, that was the first time that I dipped into, that I went below that zero. I spent everything that I had because for me, going to Shaolin Temple in China and meeting with the masters that I'd always dreamed of and learning this ancient skill that was the thing that I cared about at that time was worth, was absolutely worth going back to zero. And it absolutely was because that changed the course of my life. That first trip when I went and spent one month with the monks in Shaolin Temple changed the trajectory of my life. It taught me a new type of discipline, a new type of passion. It allowed me to have spiritual breakthroughs with my meditation. And in terms of like the investment, it's paid off, I don't know, 100,000 fold. It's incalculable in terms of the benefit. But those were the only times, there was a handful of times in my life where it was deemed by me worthy to, okay, now's the time to burn this cash because this is where I'm going to get the payoff. But I think for most, well, a lot of like wage slaves or people who are, you know, working paycheck to paycheck, they, yeah, sure, they might not have great mindsets about investment or about wealth creation, but, and that's not what I'm really looking at today. I'm not looking at how to create wealth. I'm more looking about how do you spend it. I don't know if that's something that people really think about too much. I remember I had a bunch of friends back when we were in our 20s who became strippers, right? So we had a few hot friends that we knew and one of them became a stripper and she started making, back then stripping was like really lucrative because there was no internet, no cam girls or anything. So the only way a man could see hot young tits was to go to the strip club. And so these girls, there was about three or four of them that we knew became strippers at the local strip club and they would make $1,000 a night, a night, right? So they'd, you know, going and giving lap dances. And they did it for a number of years and the stripping lifestyle burns, burns people out for the most part because it is, it's hard work. You have to deal with a lot of bullshit and a lot of, you know, abusive drunk dudes. It's late nights, smoky venues, drinking and stuff. That's not something that most people can do for an extended period of time. And of course, you know, youth and beauty is the currency as well. Of those girls that did it, I saw them earn thousands of, tens of thousands over the year or year or two or three that they did it. And once they'd finally quit, they, not one of them had a single thing to show for it except for a whole bunch of nice handbags and fancy stripper shoes. They didn't have any money at the end of it because it was so easy, well easy, it was easy to create the wealth and so they were like, okay, well tomorrow we're just going to go shopping and blow it all and go to fancy dinners and take our boyfriends out or whatever they were doing. And then when they got back to zero, it was like, okay, cool, I'll hit, I'll go back to the club tonight. And they just repeated that. And I remember begging them, like begging them, please, please put 20% of it away. When you come home at night, just take 20% and put it in a lockbox. And they were like, yeah, I will. But like, I, what I want to do first is I want to buy this car and then, you know, I want to pay off my uni debts and I want to, you know, they had a whole bunch of stuff they wanted to do first, things that they'd never been able to do as girls who just were previously were working in cafes or like us, you know, working for 10 bucks an hour and in shitty jobs. And so they never were able to just like, it was, it was always there and then they lost it and they were back and then they just kept on spending it. It was tragic to see that like, okay, that one time when they could have, they could have put away, you know, a deposit for a house easily or, you know, really invested in themselves and they all came back to zero. So before you look at how do you 10X your income, uh, well firstly, I think the first step to that is learning how to actually 2X your income. And that's, that's a topic for another video, which I think I will record. Um, because there are so many wealth gurus out there who are promising, you know, to, to basically create 10 times what you're worth. What's the quickest way from zero to a hundred grand. I'd get this. Person who owns this business to pay me $25,000 this year and then I do it four times That'd be a hundred grand sadly the vast majority of that really is just marketing bullshit It's it's essentially the same kind of hopefulness that drives people to buy lottery tickets I live in this tiny little Outside of this tiny little village at the moment in Portugal and when I go into the supermarket once a week Which is quite an adventure actually you go into the supermarket you have a look and there's some people there And there's a little kiosk in the supermarket, and there's always like five or six Like let's say very working-class usually older dudes in there scratching the scratchies you know the the lottery tickets and whenever I see that it just gives me a little it makes me feel a little bit sad because I know that Nobody I know and nobody I know that's wealthy ever thinks to like buy lottery tickets It's it's I would I would never spend a dollar on a lottery ticket. It would be an absolute waste of money for me I would I would feel guilty about spending it and I understand what like why those things are really designed for the poor And just another way to like suck the last few bucks out of the poor Because that's that's the only way that anyone in that position thinks that they could ever get wealth right It's it's by by luck essentially or by winning winning the lottery is the is the way that the poor people think about getting rich But if to put that aside what I want to look at more now is how do you have your expenses? How do you how do you work to become more lean so that whatever it is that you're earning, right? so if you're the stripper earning a thousand bucks a night, or you're a guy working in a Cafe or a bar or a bookshop or you know laboring or doing your first kind of jobs out of university or your your low-income jobs How is it you can start to break out of the of the poverty traps or to break out of the the rat race? It's not going to be by winning the lottery and it's not going to be by buying some course which promises to 10x your income Overnight, it's it's just not There's no like the only people I know who 10x anything financially people who are deeply embedded in Exclusive wealth funds right where you can't you don't get you can't just like sign up for it online You have to be invited in and then there are certain investments which are only for really for the very wealthy and People with certain people are given opportunities to put in money at the right time and then they may see massive returns Okay so there are certain there are other like anomalies like the crypto boom or Certain other booms that have come along throughout history where early movers get in and do 10x I managed to actually 40x my investment in in Crypto, but that was just shit. Well, it wasn't luck. It was that I was in the right place the right time I listened to some people who had inside Knowledge early on back when Bitcoin was worth a grand and I went a fuck it All right I put five grand into it or I actually was five grand worth of coaching that someone paid me and Then I left it and now it's now it's worth 30 or 40. So, okay. Awesome I did 30x my my investment But that was I really perceive that as it was speculation that that luckily paid off because it wasn't because I was so smart on You the market particularly. So how is it that you can start to to minimize your expenses? Well, here's a few quick tips Firstly understand the different difference between an asset and a liability and This may sound simple, but it's it's basically this if you buy something or put money into something that costs you money More than once it's a liability All right If you put money into something that over time it it increases even by let's say 5% because inflation is whatever 2 to 4 I think You know if it gradually over time increases, okay, it's a it's an asset You know the thing that fucks most young men financially for years It is cars. Has it got to craftsmanship with a flair my dear lady It is craftsmanship with a flair. Well, it's a deal buying an automobile Yeah now I know I've talked about this before I've never owned a car I still don't know how to drive and and I'm not proud of that. All right, like this year I'm really attempting to learn to drive. I have to do it in Portuguese I'm gonna have to learn Portuguese as well, but it finally has become an issue for me But so definitely get a driver's license. I would advise you to get a driver's license. I wish I'd done that when I was younger But I just failed the learner's test a few times and got frustrated and then started traveling and never stopped and I just didn't get It so I don't know how to drive. I know But anyway by the time I learn to drive everything will be self-driving anyway So fine get a driver's license because you can hire a car if you need to get somewhere or you can borrow a car like It's a good thing to be able to move with a machine for sure But actually owning a vehicle you've got to understand that whether you bought it brand new or you bought it secondhand It is immediately worth less than you bought it the day you buy it and it's gonna cost you a fuckton all The time and I remember that in my in my teens and 20s the guys that would like straightaway They got their license at 16 17 and then they went out and got a car loan Which was which were obscenely high interest rates or they maybe they luckily their parents got them one or something and they all got cars and They they spent the first Number of years of their working life essentially paying for that vehicle because in terms of petrol costs Inevitably, they smashed it up because they were young and dumb and full of fucking aggression You know fines Maintenance all the rest of it. It meant that that thing was constantly burning their extra income. So Now I understand there are certain places in the on the planet where is kind of more or less Impossible to operate without a car and like in many cities in North America. They're designed They're not designed with public transport in mind. There's no real infrastructure for that And so, you know if you live in the suburbs to get to work, okay, you do need a car, I guess But there's there there are many places in the world where it is unnecessary to and I would say in terms of like if I was to choose between a nice car and My accommodation right in terms of like what's going to give me more benefits It's way better to have a shitty studio or be part of a like a crappy group house in a dodgy old Apartment or house closer to the city center where the action is way better and then ditch the car and pay more rent Than it is to live in the suburbs in a nice place and have a nice car The reason there's multiple reasons one is financial because overall you will you will be able to become much leaner and to be able to Move up and down where with regards to how your income fluctuates When you don't have this this fixed constant cost if rent is the base level thing that you have to pay And you know, okay, you've got to make rent every month and you got to feed yourself and you got to pay the bills And okay, then you can survive Having having that that fixed drain that keeps on taking sapping money away from you The car is not beneficial and also living in the city center or in a social center Let's say right. So some cities have multiple social centers Depending on their size, but you don't like there's no advantage to living in a fancy place in the suburbs from a single man's perspective Okay maybe when you get married and have kids and you want the American or Australian dream of the quarter acre block and the and the the brick Three three bedroom house with a picket fence and so on Okay, then that is typically why people move out into the suburbs so they can have that but I'm not talking to that audience I'm talking to the young the single the guys that are the single the guys that want a kind of different life than the one that is prescribed by their parents usually and so In terms of lifestyle returns. I know when I moved to Melbourne when I was 2021 I moved there to become a musician. I had not two cents to rub together I was living on social security and if bits and pieces of work So I was I was as broke as you could be in Australia So I wasn't I mean I wasn't starving, but I didn't have any anything really But what I did was I moved into a really shit house It was really shit with two other guys who were equally broke But we did it as right in the the hipster kind of area of Melbourne and as a result that meant we could walk down To the many bars and clubs and cafes and we weren't Definitely. I wasn't cold approaching in the classic sense at that time I didn't know you could go and talk to a girl in the middle of the day but I did know that you could go to bars and and buy one drink because that's all I could afford and And then kind of hang around and then talk to girls in some way random way Whatever it was or you know, go to or go to house parties so I was able to then meet a girl Mac Connor and whatever bad game way I had back and Then say hey, do you want to like go back to my place and like have a cup of tea? it's let's it's just down the road and then we'd walk back or ride back on our bicycles and Then I'd give her a cup of tea or or I'd crack open that one bottle of wine that we had in the house that you're only allowed to use if you brought a girl home and give her like half a glass of Because I didn't want to because there's no point pouring a whole glass of wine When two people come to home to fuck because they never finish it They just take a couple of sips and then go and then fuck each other and the wine was just an excuse So I'm like, well, I'm not gonna waste that wine on her Just like give it that much so she's got her token sip of wine and then maybe later on pour it back in the bottle I didn't do that. I didn't I promise but more or less so the the lifestyle return on on the location was far greater than Trying to like keep up with the Joneses and have a have a cool place or a fancy place in the in which would have had To be in the suburbs at that time another Simple piece of advice I can give you to become wealthy is to learn how to cook Does that make sense? I ate out a lot now, right? So I travel a lot and when I'm in big cities, I eat out probably twice a day and that's because now I am wealthy but before Throughout throughout my early years Going out to eat food was and it was a really expensive activity and it meant Like if I went out and I spent 20 bucks to have a meal that was two hours of my labor for what I was worth at the time and That's that's one thing that I don't think I don't think people who are lower-income value their time enough and one of the ways that I broke out of the poverty trap was by really Conceptualizing every time I hand over ten dollars That's one hour of my labor and I probably wasn't doing something. I really loved right I wasn't like living my passion at the time. I was working crappy jobs and cafes and bars to try and get by and so I Had that thought in my head. Is that worth an hour of my time now? I don't think that's a great I don't have that same mentality right now Right, because if you if you do that forever, then you don't you're never gonna break out of the the $10 an hour thing Right, it's it is it is really based around a low-income type of thinking but it's but it's there's effective ways to start Crawling out of poverty when you want when you are earning base or minimum wage and there are ways that will just inevitably keep you always running back to zero and So I had that thing of like is that worth is that worth an hour of my time that beer or that kebab? And then uh, and then I would just bounce it out and go nah I'd rather I'd rather cook at home and then go out like so I'd rather cook at home and then go to the go out to the jazz bar or the funk bar Whatever I used to go to and then pay the admission fee the three bucks or the five bucks to get in and maybe buy one Drink so just so that I had something to do while I was there back when I thought you had to drink to meet girls so one of the best things that I ever learned very early on because I left home at 16 was how to cook and how to cook cheaply and I think so many men have no fucking idea how to do this at all and it doesn't it's not difficult It doesn't require you to go and do cooking courses or to you know, study deeply It requires you to have a basic understanding of nutrition And to understand how to to get produce that's that's cheap and then to be able to do it and it takes about as much time as Ordering stuff in really feels like the amount of time it takes to get on your app and wait for the uber eats dude to Come you can cook stuff in 20-30 minutes. That is awesome and You know nutritious and very very cheap tonight Adam cooked us a chicken curry. What do you what do you think that cost? What would we say that cost in total? Like probably probably less than less than 10 bucks 10 euros for the two of us and we have some left over it's like Which would be but more or less the same as us going to the Thai restaurant and there is nothing around here We have no choice, right? So we have to cook here because there is there is no options so it's one of the one of those life skills that Many men just never learn and and it's one of those skills that it has so many benefits Another one of them being is it means that you won't be Have a woman wrap you around her finger based on her ability to feed you Like I've I had friends who you know they lived at home their mom cooked for them and they moved out of home and then they just suddenly they were just eating cereal and fucking Hot dogs Because they just were useless and then they got a girlfriend that was annoying and chubby and whatever But she could cook and he moved in with her and then she's and he's just like yeah but she just like cooks for me and say, you know, it's like it's easier to stay than to go and I had friends who ended up just like Spending years and years with girls probably not only because they could feed them.
