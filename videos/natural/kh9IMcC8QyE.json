So we got a question here from Kevin. He says I Never really know how to approach a girl if she is with just one friend a pair of girls where I find one of them Attractive it feels really awkward if I would just approach one of them and leave the other one out. Do you have any tips on that? Good question how to approach two or more women Lots of guys are very intimidated by this when they're walking around looking to approach that They only approach single females and the moment that there's a couple of them They're like I can't do that and they never do which is a pity because beautiful women are fairly rarely Allowed out alone. They're really out alone Often they are in pairs or in groups and the girl of your dreams walks by and she's with a friend and you don't know What to do. Well, that's not something that's gonna assist you in life So let's talk about what are the best ways to approach two girls firstly, this may seem counterintuitive But it can often be easier to approach Three girls than it is to approach to the reason being that if I go and approach three women and I focus most of my attention on the girl that I like Fairly likely if the girls are not going to be bitchy about it and drag her away that they will then turn and have their Conversation and kind of micro isolate us. So in the case of where it's three four five or whatever. There's a group of girls I don't necessarily need to go over and say hey everybody here Let's say if they're sitting on it on the grass or on a beach or something that I might just go over and say hey There's a girl that I like and then as I notice other people notice me then I will also acknowledge them Hey, how are you? What's up today? Because the thing you absolutely don't want to do is focus a hundred percent of your attention on the girl and weirdly ignore Everyone else there that is not going to work for you because the moment you walk away the girls are gonna go That's a weird guy and it's rude and it makes the girl feel uncomfortable. It shows you're not socially calibrated So we do need to engage with some of the group or all of the group if needed But the way I would do that in a bigger group is I walk over and say hey, how are you? I'll do my open or whatever it is. What's contextually relevant and then if a friend turns I say, ah, I didn't meet you What's your name? And then I introduced myself to that friend and if the other two were talking to each other over there Then I probably don't bother until such a time as that becomes relevant. I don't need to entertain the group I just need to acknowledge them. So having said that how do we deal with just the two ladies? So this can be a bit more challenging in terms of the actual logistics of it Although the larger group may seem to be more intimidating But if you're dealing with two girls, then we must deal with them both if you ignore the friend for the entire interaction She's not going to be on side the other friend that you're talking to is going to feel him Awkward and embarrassed for her friend, which means she's not going to be in the moment and present. It's going to be a disaster So when I'm approaching two girls, I open them both excuse me ladies, or I saw you both sitting Here in the park Relaxing you've got the right idea. I'm gonna join you both. All right, so it's like, okay I make note that I'm approaching both of them But then yes, I do need to differentiate and show that I'm interested in one because if I'd say hey you guys look cool Can I sit down with you? And then I just give 50-50 Attention without making it clear who I'm interested in then Yes That might be weird at the end when I asked one of them for the number So in general, I will say, you know, excuse me ladies, or you both look lovely today And then I'll address the girl that I like I have in the past said, you know, you both look amazing But and you are so my type so it's like I'm complimenting both But then I'm saying well, you're my type and the other one's not gonna get offended because people have types I don't always do this But it's something that I have done before or I just say hey girls you looking whatever, you know Do my opener and then lock in with the the girl that I'm talking to and just give her a compliment Well, you look gorgeous today, or I love this this outfit for you. It's really working and then I give 70-30 split of attention and I give a hundred percent zero percent intent Okay So what that looks like is I'm I can be talking to the main girl having my my interaction whilst giving her clear sexual intent Maybe I'm maybe I'm doing the odd touch. Maybe I'm being flirty and cheeky with her. So I'm Seducing all right with the other girl. I'm being very friendly. So what that might mean I'm chatting to this girl for a bit She's talking about her summer plans and then I say oh, so you guys gonna go and cause trouble together So I check in with the friend and give her an opportunity to contribute to the conversation She says I yes and this this and that or so How did you two actually meet because you're very similar or you're actually seem to have very different characters Which must be good because then you don't fight over boys or something, right? so I'm making a comment about those two as friends things that they're doing together how they met each other what kind of Like dining dynamic duo they are or whatever it is So I keep that in generally in mind 70% attention here 30% attention here a hundred percent intent here I'm and zero sex intent, but nice friendly straightforward guy that the friend might like intent over there So you do that kind of thing? You've got the best likelihood that at the end of the interaction her friends gonna go Well, that guy was cool or you should go out with him as opposed to delete that guy's number immediately You guys seem kind of different like not exactly the same personalities. Did you meet on some random night out? Okay, very commonly when you're talking to two girls, especially if they're moving right so you've approached them on the street They're going somewhere. They're off shopping. They're on their way to have coffee or whatever These interactions usually won't and shouldn't last very long because especially if you need to read the situation I go and open and the two girls are friendly and open it and they chat to me and they're interested and I say hey guys, you want to sit down for a second? They both sit down with me then sure I can have a longer interaction Which is still with this general 70 30 100% 0% framework and then ask for the number of 10 minutes later But that will be less common than the situation especially if you're doing street day game where you approach the two girls They're on their way somewhere the friend might tolerate it and put up with it and be polite But she really wants to go and she wants her friend to go with her so I can't really Monopolize or get her time and her attention and get too deep in with her because she's also focused on her friend So in those scenarios, I would do my open my charming Charm both of them have a general chat Find out a couple of cool things about it and then be the one to wrap it up and end it So that might look like well, listen, I know you guys are on your way to have coffee So I don't want to take too much of your time But I really like your vibe and I'd love to spend time with you when you're when you're not so busy So can I get get your number and let's hang out tomorrow, right? I'm doing it obviously in front of the friend because that's another thing that guys worry about Well, I approach the two girls and then how do I ask for the number without the other one knowing you don't you do it? In front of the friend like blatantly With impunity, you're not trying to say it softly or trying to go Oh, so maybe we should you just say it directly so the friend can hear it because that's ballsy indirect You'll get props for that Likely anyway from the friend because she's thinking wow that guy's brave and both of them think you're brave for doing it and it saves Whatever the alternative is, but all right get out of here. You're in a rush, right? What is the alternative I don't know trying to get someone's email to pretend that you know that you want to do some friend thing We'll get both their numbers and then text one but not the other all that kind of stuff I've done that in the past and it usually ends up in a confusing mess because I wasn't clear about what I was there for And the girls don't really know either so make sure that you Go for the clothes make it obvious and then be the big generally It's better idea for you to be the one to go. All right, awesome Well, you guys go and enjoy you, you know ladies brunch and I'll talk to you soon as opposed to I'm trying to hold the Attention of two girls and one of them or both of them want to leave and I'm thinking well I better get rapport So I need to do a 10-minute interaction to make sure I've made this solid when she's not invested in and she doesn't want to Be there or it's starting to feel awkward because the friend goes then I'm I'm losing traction It's actually working against me rather than for me. So it's better to have a short cheerful fun Punchy set where you go ladies. You look fucking beautiful today and you are so my type and what's the plan? What are you doing both today? Cool. And how did you meet? Oh nice. So yeah, tell me I know you've got a you're going shopping soon, but tell me one thing I wouldn't guess about you or you know, whatever some qualifying question She gives me an answer and I give him my response to it and I say, all right Well, listen, I like your vibe I think you and I are gonna get on but I know you have to go and do shopping now So give me a number and let's hang out tomorrow, right? That's that's direct. That's punchy. I'm I'm maintaining A control over the environment and over the dynamic in such a way that I understand how to deal with this and I'm not creating Undue negative pressure of the girl wanting to leave as opposed to you know Wrapping up making it punchy and letting her go as I said The difference would be two girls on the beach or in a park or something where they're chilling or you know on a park bench Or something and I go over I say hi I sit down with them and they're both chilling and just happy to engage with me and then Ideally the other friend, you know starts looking at her phone or puts her headphones in and you can have sure you can have a much Longer interaction there as you would if the girl was alone So there's some details for you that will help you in this apparently intimidating But once you start to do it, you realize it's not not that hard It's it's no it's actually no more hard than approaching one girl And the reality is hot girls are often chaperoned or in pairs So you better learn how to do it. Otherwise, you're gonna miss out on many opportunities Hope that helps quick little us the natural from James Marshall here If you'd like to ask me a question that I may answer eventually Put it in the comments And if you'd like to join me in real life To get this thing sorted once and for all to get over all the approach anxiety learn how to do natural style adaptive approaches to make your Conversations scintillating and sexy to be able to close to have good structures for texting to know what to do on dates and all that fun Stuff and you should consider joining us For our last European workshop of the year, which is in my favorite city to teach and hustle in Barcelona From the 28th of August to the 4th of September myself and the TNL team will be there Will you be to click the link below get on a call with Alex and maybe you will otherwise see you in the next video.
