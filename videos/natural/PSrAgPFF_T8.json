In my opinion, it's skills to be a lover. There's few and far between things in life that are gonna keep giving you rewards. And I'm here today with the lovely Jess Daly, and we're gonna be talking about what it is to be a sensual man and how important it can be in terms of your interactions with women. So, thanks for being here. My pleasure. As always. So, Jess, I'll open it by asking, what's it like when you come into contact with a sensual man, as opposed to a guy that's not so sensually skilled? I think for a woman, for a guy that's very sensual, a guy that's very confident with his touch and very in tune with his sensuality and sexuality, it creates a lot of, I wanna say, relaxation and connection between the two of you. In my own experience, having been with men who are, I guess, quite inexperienced or uncomfortable with their sensuality compared to ones that are, when I'm with a guy who has confidence in that area, it's almost like it fast-tracks the whole process of connecting the two of you. So it's sort of like, from the very first moment of meeting someone, if you're on a date, and even just the way a guy will touch me, even if it's before we've even kissed, and just the way he might touch my arm or guide me through a room and put his hand on my back and say, oh, those are lovely earrings, the way he caresses my face, straight away, I can tell that he's very confident with touch and how sexy and sensual that is. And it's almost like it creates, it's a very relaxing feeling, but it also creates a lot more connection between us quicker. Yeah, definitely, definitely. So, and obviously, it's intimidating for some guys to cross that bridge of how do I become sensual? How do I get good at that? And there's a lot of pathways that people can use to get more sensual. Definitely. Like, in your opinion, what are some common ways that you've experienced that guys are becoming more sensual? I would say, like, dance is one thing. You know, a lot of my clients and also friends, lovers, who've gone to dance classes, anything with partner dancing is great, like salsa or any kind of Latin dance is fantastic because a lot of that has its basis in creating a connection physically between the two of you. The man is leading the dance, and so it's about the two of you connecting and actually feeding off each other's movements. And it's very, there's a lot of subcommunication there, physically as well. That's a really great area to expand. I would say, and of course, massage. I've, you know, I've had boyfriends who are incredible at massage. I've strangely dated two massage therapists. Wow. Really strange. Must be drawn to them. And from, you know, like, from the guys that you've dated, do those guys have a fond memory in your mind in that particular area? Yeah, absolutely. I think there's something very trance-like with massage as well, is probably the best way for me to describe it. Like, if I think back to one boyfriend who, yeah, he was actually a massage therapist, and used to give me these insane massages. It was crazy. And massage in itself, however simple, can be beautiful and lovely and sensual, but men that really know what they're doing, it creates this, like, incredible, almost bond between the two of you. And I just think of, like, I have so many memories of receiving amazing massages and him, like, teaching me how to do it for him as well. And it was like, you know, there's a lot of trust in it. There's a lot of, it's incredibly sexual as well. And it's a very loving thing to do as well. But I think it's amazing because it's actually something, it's a really deep connection to have with someone, to be that vulnerable, to be lying there, to allow someone to touch you so intimately, and just to let go. To be able to do that with someone you're already in a relationship with, kind of makes sense. And I think massage is so amazing because you can actually do that with someone straight away. You could have just met someone, gone on a date with them, and you're back at their house, and you're like, hey, do you wanna have a massage? And I think that, again, can fast track so much connection between the two of you. Like, it's amazing. Definitely. Yeah, so in my experience of dating and working with massage, it's one of the most powerful ways, I think, to create a journey together. And it can be something that's quite sensual and loving. It can be something that has quite seductive overtones to it as well. Definitely. And it's a great thing because guys can really take women on a journey of leading them through an experience. Absolutely. Even if it's as simple as, I'm just gonna give you a massage on the bed with some nice music, all the way up to having a sensual journey that you're brought into over an evening with massage included into the whole spectrum. Definitely. And I think that you brought up something good there about setting up a space. For a guy to be sensual, it doesn't mean that they need to be a massage therapist. I think from my own personal experience, dating men who I've gone back to their house and their room looks lovely and they've got soft lighting and they put on nice music and they've created an atmosphere and the way that they touch me is gentle or sensual or in the moment or he's reading my responses. So it's very communicative. That in itself is incredibly beautiful. As a woman, that's the kind of experiences we wanna have because we've experienced as a woman and I know endless women have, we've also experienced the opposite which is to hang out with a guy who's awkward and strange and weird and doesn't wanna touch us and is like this and puts on 7-Eleven lights and there's no music and you're like, oh God, I feel uncomfortable. So I think there's something very sexy about a man who is able to lead. I think you mentioned the word leader. There's a lot of leadership in a guy being very sensual and being very in touch with his sensuality and as a woman, it really triggers those hyper-feminine feelings and it makes us feel very feminine and sexy and I guess to be led can be so attractive and me myself, I'm a very independent, assertive, kind of loud person and I'm a teacher and I'm a coach so I'm constantly in a role of authority. So for me, to be around a man that can lead me is even more incredible because it means for once, I get to go, oh, I get to sit back and have someone lead me, that can be fantastic. Absolutely and I think just to reiterate that point, it's such a thing these days with women are in positions of authority and they're busy taking on a lot of masculine roles in a sense to have an opportunity to really relax into that feminine space with a guy that can lead is really a gift and one of the biggest things, it's the kind of thing that I think women really tend to remember and it's a big tick that box, yeah, that was definitely a high-value experience, even if it's a short-term thing or it ends up being a long-term thing. And I think in terms of guys getting started on that path, even though it can feel a little bit intimidating, it's really important to just start where you're at and then start to build skills from that place. Absolutely. And I think it can happen quite quickly once you get some ideas and principles and then you start applying them and even if it's a little bit of fake it till you make it, it's definitely a good start because the feedback loops I think will start to happen, you'll be a little bit more sensual, women will be more receptive and open and it sets up a positive dynamic and then obviously it gives a guy more confidence and then it becomes more natural for him to have that as part of his behavior. Agreed. And as you say, starting one step at a time can be something as simple as learning and appreciating what it is to touch a woman when you're with her, even something as simple as running your hands down her leg, down her body, down her arms while you're making out, while you're lying in bed and I think a lot of men put a lot of pressure on themselves and I know this from interviewing a lot of my clients, a lot of men have so much pressure when they're with a woman, they think, oh God, I've got to have sex with her right now, we've got to be together straight away and having sex and I think a lot of, and I would think with porn would have a lot to answer for, is a lot of people in their sex life, especially with casual lovers or one night stands, people are missing out on a lot of the really beautiful elements of sensuality which is just to touch each other and how crazy that can be and how intimate so quickly that can be. So I think guys needn't freak out and think, oh, I have to become super talented as a massage therapist straight away. No, it's not about that. It's something as simple as you get into bed with a girl or you're lying on the couch or you're sitting there making out and it could be something as simple as just running your hands on her body really softly and that slowly can build tension and can be very erotic. Definitely, definitely. And just on that note, just as a little practical thing, because I think the tendency can be for some guys anyway to be quite disembodied in a way, like very much in their heads, especially guys that work a lot in their heads and think a lot and our culture tends to encourage guys to be much more mental. So getting into your body, getting relaxed is a really important thing and a very simple tool which I think is good is this idea of the lover's touch. So for example, a guy, like you said, can look at a woman almost like an object or an obstacle to getting to the sexual part of the experience. So it's kind of like, okay, I've got this thing that I need to kind of negotiate so then I can get to the reward of having this experience that I wanna have. But obviously that creates all kinds of weirdness and it's not a sensual experience at all. So, but the flip side of that is starting to get this attitude of, as Jess was referring to, like being more sensual and have this idea of a lover's touch. So even if you take your hand, for example, and you look at it like a mechanical object, it's very easy, like you can look at it like, you know, it's a thing. And men tend to look at the world in terms of things, in terms of function, in terms of practicality, which is a good skill. But in terms of sensuality, you wanna change it in terms of when you look at your hand, imagine that it's a sensual object now and explore what kinds of sensations that you can experience by feeling into that and then transfer that kind of mentality into when you're interacting with women. So it really is such a great pleasure to share, you know, sensual touch and the experience of what kinds of experiences you can create together. It's very magical. Agreed. So that's what we wanted to talk about today was really just introducing the idea of sensual touch as a very important thing.
