Hi there. Now in today's video what we're going to do is dive deep into the intricacies of an underrated sexual position, the old missionary position. Now this one can be considered kind of boring and it can be, and awkward and clunky and it can be, but it can also be super spicy and sexy. So let's show you how to make it so. First, let's look at a few of the don't dos and mistakes that happen in this position. One common problem is for women that are inexperienced or maybe a little bit inflexible or tense is that they might lock their ankles over your ankles, right? So what this does is it means that I can't really get in and penetrate properly because she's put me in some kind of MMA lock, unless that's what she meant to do. What I want to do is get her to lift her knee. So I'll say that, lift your knee, right? So you can see, I just run my hand in underneath and scoop her leg up, combining what I'm doing with the vocal commands, because if I just try and do it like without letting her know and I'm just pulling at her leg, then she's not sure what's happening and it doesn't feel good. So I just run my hand down, lift your knee and open up like so, and then on the other side, lift your knee. So this is the ideal position that we want to be in with her hips open so that I've got deep penetration so that we can rub both of our pubic bones on each other so I can rub her clitoris as well. So this is going to be much better than anything where she's down, locked in, or even just with her legs there, right? Because then I have to use all my force to get in past the barrier of her inner thighs as opposed to open your legs out or lift your knees up. From here, I can reach in underneath, grip in to the butt as well, so I can spread the pussy open and this gives me good purchase here, being able to hold on to the butt like this. Another big issue comes in terms of bodyweight distribution. Now kind of regardless of what size dude you are, if I lay my complete bodyweight on the woman... Ah! Comfortable? Not at all. Not comfortable. Right, so I'm in the throes of passion and I'm putting my entire bodyweight and rubbing my chin on her face. She's just going to feel uncomfortably squashed, so I need to be aware of how I'm supporting my own bodyweight. So in a position like this, what I'll be doing is using my elbows to hold at least half my bodyweight and the rest is held by my knees and then I can lower weight into my pelvis, so as I'm penetrating her here, there's going to be some degree of bodyweight like this, but same thing, if I drop my entire weight onto her stomach, that's going to feel uncomfortable. So I'm aware of what parts of my body are in contact with her and how much pressure, especially irregular pressure. Because I can do a thing where I can press her, where I can lie down and get this kind of squash, but I'm holding some of my bodyweight. How's that feel? This feel better? Yeah. Yeah. Cozy and intimate? Yeah, intimate. All right. So, yes, I can do that, but if I lean on one side or, you know, worse, let's say her hair's out like this and I put my forearm or elbow into that and I'm tugging on her hair, regardless of what other amazing things I'm doing, she's going to be distracted by the pain in her head. All right, so I need to be aware that as I come down to lay on top of her, let's say she was like this, open out her legs, and watch as I walk in, bodyweight on the hands, bodyweight on the knees, slide down. Okay, so maybe I'm coming down in here to penetrate or I've lifted her leg up so she's more open. Okay, so penetrate it. And then as I come down, her hair's in the way, so I might move it out of the way so I don't end up squashing it. Coming in, settling into a place where we're both comfortable. And this goes in alignment with the other important thing when it comes to any position really, is that the first strokes generally shouldn't be harsh and fast, right? So this allows me to settle into her space, to breathe together perhaps, be making out whatever we're doing, and then to start getting some rhythm from here. Also, if I shift my bodyweight over to one side, now I'm aware now that most of my weight's on this elbow, it's not in my hip, because if I lean my hip bone, I've got bony hips and I stab them into her inner thigh, that's going to hurt. So I'm taking most of the weight on knee and opposite elbow, and then this frees up this hand here so I can be touching, touching the clitoris, touching the rest of the body and so on. All right, so in that way I can shift bodyweight from center to side in a way that's seamless, that has lots of nice sensual touch happening instead of, you know, the alternative of yanking on the hair, not comfortable. Now it's not just the angles of approach that matter, it's the quality of the stroke. So another big no-no in problem that most men are guilty of almost all the time is the way that they fuck, which is essentially like this. So they're kind of basically doing push-ups or some kind of calisthenic exercise, where what I'm doing in this situation is as I retract, I have to use my legs, my butt and my back to get one stroke in, and you'll see parodies of this in movies where the dude's like this and the girl's staring into space, waiting for it to over and the guy's counting his reps of his push-ups. All right, so this is all completely unnecessary use of energy and mostly that kind of stroke is not the best stroke. Yes, there is, you know, there are times where I'm in and I'm doing, let's say hard fucking where I'm mostly going in and out, but really the artistry and the really amazing sex comes in large part from being able to isolate your hips. So the types of strokes, instead of this full body action here, is to isolate my pelvis here and to be able to tilt and roll forward, right? So because from there, now on the interior, my cock is doing this, if I'm rolling this way, or I can do all sorts of movements where I can be doing basically Latin dance rotations, rolling in on the stroke and then rolling back on the exit stroke or opposite, right? So I could be rolling the opposite way and then rolling it back as I retract. So there's different options that I have, which are going to create vastly different sensations internally. All right, so that's mistake number three, just pumping, exhausting yourself as opposed to getting these undulations of the hips going on. Another thing that's going to make any sex awkward, but particularly trying to get her into the missionary position, is how do I get her there in the first place, right? Because, okay, we've come into the room, we've been making out, now what? So I might think, well, if I take her by the hand and then kind of like lead her like this and then lie her down, now she doesn't know which way to lie down, so I'm just going to hope she turns on her back, turns on her back, right? So already this is all very awkward, no one knows what they're doing or why we're just going to cuddle and sleep, no. And now I try and like, you know, monkey branch, climb my way in. By now she already knows that I don't know what I'm doing, right? This is not a hot start to having sex. So if we're not doing it like that, what are we doing? There's a couple of ways. One is that I just take the lead and tell her to come and lie next to me, right? So if I lie down and say, lie down on your back, she knows now that this is where I want her to go, right? Because from here, okay, we might be having all of our foreplay, you know, open her legs out, might finger her for some time. And then when I decide to, so I've got her legs open, now she's in the position. So then when I then change positions, slow my arm out, come around, and then we have this seamless start like this. Or a sexier, more powerful moment is, let's assume that we've already undressed her and you should always undress a woman standing because lying down is awkward. So we've gotten all the clothes have come off, is to throw her or place her down on the bed. Now there's the soft version and then there's the sudden and abrupt version. So the soft one is I walk her to the edge of the bed, I make sure she's right on the edge of the bed, and then I just place my hands on. So the center of my palm goes onto her hip bone here, I hold her fairly firmly around the pelvis, and then I'm going to push 45 degrees down, right? So I'm really just placing her down, right? So you just get this action. I don't want to have a big flick at the end because it'll create an unpleasant shock. And then once again, from here, I can do it with a bit more speed, get down, right? So that's step one, obviously good position for a blowjob or for kissing her or choking from that position. And then to put her all the way down, I just place my hand at the top of her chest. And again, I'm not shoving, I'm just guiding, lie down, right? So I'm guiding and she's the one who's doing the movement. Otherwise you can have this, you know, shove in the chest, which isn't pleasant, right? So if we show that all in one go, sit down. Now from here, what I'll do, often her legs end up like this with the knees up, is then I just place a hand on the inside of one leg, open, open, right? And there we have her legs open. Now sometimes a woman can be tense and so she might resist. It's not a like not a resistance in the sense that she doesn't want you to do it. She's just feeling tense in her body. So resist, so resist, right? So I feel if there's any resistance there, then I'll just take a leg and say, relax, open your knees. All right, so this combination of coordinating your physical movements and your vocal commands will solve most problems, especially with a woman who doesn't really know what she's doing. You have to know what you're doing and then she'll generally follow. All right, so if we see all this again in sequence, I take her to the edge of the bed. And so again, as I'm coming down, I'm aware of my body weight distribution, one hand, one hand, hand, hand, knee, knee, and now I can get down on top of it. Now we find ourselves in a slight problem here that I'm too close to the edge of the bed, right? And this will happen in various positions where the head's right up against the wall or butt's too far down. And so it's not comfortable because eventually I'm going to slip off and I don't have as much purchase here. So I wanted to move up. How can I do that? Well, the awkward way to do that would be trying to grab some piece of her and then like, can you just a bit more, please? Oh, thanks. Once again, these, these types of fumbling movements just put a woman into a state of like he doesn't know what to do with my body, right? So let's reverse that. How do we do it? So what I'll do is I do place my hand right underneath her hips and I'll say to her, lift your butt. Move. All right. So it's her lifting the weight and then me carrying the momentum back. All right. Now, if it was the opposite situation, let's say her head was too close to the wall and she was banging her head on the wall, for example, and I want to move her this way. Then what I'll do is I'll hook my hands around the top of her thigh and then I'll say, come here. Right? She's not really doing much. Maybe she'll push with her hands, but from there I can scoop and lift. All right. So once again, I want her to go up that way, lift your ass there, or I want her to come back. Come here. Okay. So we'll see all that together in one sequence. Lift your ass. The other option is to throw her more vigorously, let's say on the bed. And to do that, I'm going to be placing my hands on her shoulders instead of her hips. And so I'm going to be pushing at an angle that's pointing towards the pillow basically. Because if I push too far down, then I'm going to end up banging her head. So she needs to get enough flight that she can head towards the pillow. So again, I've got her in close and I walk her until she's right on the edge of the bed. Right? Make sure she's definitely there that when you've got enough room to throw her. And then I place my hand here and I'll rock her once or twice. The reason for this is that I want her to relax into me. Right? Because if she's stiff and rigid, then she might fight it and then it's not going to work. Right? So I need her to trust me to let go. And I might even say, relax, let go. Right? So you see that launch heading towards the pillow. And then this is, you know, a better position now because she's gotten further along the bed. Same thing. Open the legs. And now we are in a good position where I don't need to move her up or down the bed. We're ready to go. So let's show that again. Now we've got her on the bed and we've worked out how to get her into a basic correct position. Let's look at all the variations that are possible. Right? So if we landed down here in this kind of standard missionary position like this, because my body weight's, you know, fully over, there's not so much that I can do with my hands. So yes, I can lean over onto one side and adjust things here. As I showed before, I can tilt the pelvis up in whatever angle it is that works best. Right? But most of the variation is going to happen when I'm getting up onto my haunches. Right? So from here, obviously now I have my hands free and there's a lot more we can do. So again, we want to be aware of, has she let her body go to me? Right? So every time you start to manoeuvre the body. Generally, add a voice command at the same time, makes it easy for her to understand what to do. And note when there's resistance, right? So again, if there was resistance here, then I would say, relax your leg, right? And often it's just that. She just needs to be told to relax and shown what that means, and then she'll open her legs. Okay. So variations that we can do from here. Well, so we've got the different holds that work in different positions. So where do I grip onto to create the resistance points? So holding the inside of the thigh like this, right? So this grip works nicely, placing a hand around the throat. It can be as a hold, which is just holding into the neck muscles, or it can be a choke if that's what she's into. That's a whole other technique, which I won't show you right now. But this is a good grip position, obviously holding on the breasts, holding her down by her wrists for these dominance holds. Or if you want to have it kind of cuter and more intimate, holding hands. Now I need to be aware, like I'm still putting quite a lot of body weight into her hands. That'll be fine for some time, but these are stress points that if you held this for five minutes, eventually you're going to start cutting off blood flow to the wrist, right? So I'm aware that this would be for some time, for some hot moment, right? Or variation here where I'm gripping around the wrist, but I'm aware that my pressure is not going so hard through the palm into the ground. The pressure is actually being held on the backs of the fingers, so that I'm carrying most of the body weight as opposed to leaning my weight right into her bones. Okay, so from here we can put the knees together. A cool one is to place her feet onto your chest or stomach, depending on her flexibility, and then putting my hands over her knees, right? Because this one means that I've got this resistance here, like a handle, where I can go like this, or up onto the chest, or something like this. From here, moving into an extended leg. Now generally, we don't want to have a fully straight leg, because most people are not flexible enough where they can fold directly in half, which puts the hamstring under too much stretch. So we bend the knees instead, so that releases the stretch from the lower part of the leg. So if we've gone from a position like this, then crossing the ankles, and then same thing I can pack her in by holding at the top of the knees here, partially supporting my body weight on my left hand in this case, still stabilized well by this tripod of my ankles and knees. This is a super stable position, with my body weight here, it's not tiring, it's extremely deep, so as we lift the knees up, we get much deeper penetration. From here, opening one leg out is awesome. So I've got one leg, you can do it either side, hooked over my shoulder, with the knee bent again, so I'm not putting her in this full tension, so the knee is bent, and then I've got open like this. Now she's very flexible, so her knees go flat to the floor, some women might have flexibility which doesn't allow them to go much further than that, sometimes if that's the case I might put my thigh underneath there to support her leg a little bit, because if she's held in stretch and she's not very flexible, again that'll be fatiguing, but a lot of women will be quite open in their hips, so we can get this full opening here. What's great about this, is that the angle of approach here is going directly up and targeting the front wall of the vagina, the top of the G-spot, so I can get, especially for these long and slow strokes, and rotational strokes, I can get a lot of stimulation of the G-spot. You'll notice, again, compared to the average man fucking technique of this, where I've got butt, legs, back all activated, instead I just get this tilt rotation, sometimes circular rotations, but mostly it's going to be tilting up like this, so I'm lifting a little bit with the legs and pushing a little bit with the butt, but there's very minimal muscular engagement here, and once I get a momentum, once I get bouncing, then the bounce creates a lot of the momentum as well. Other variation we can do is where we can put the inside of our bicep on the inside of her knees, so very easy for her to stay in this position, because if we want her to stay with her legs up like this for a long period of time, this can get fatiguing, so instead we can allow support, which also locks her in place, and you can also add a wrist grab here, right, so this is, she's completely bound really, she can't escape, so that's good for hot dominance moments. Another thing we can do is take her hands and put them around the front, right, then I can hold onto her wrist for this hot dominance here, or she can just be holding them, right, so that makes it easier for her to hold her legs up, look sexy, and then you can do the same variation here with the knees, or like this if we really want to pack her in. Okay, so you can see that from this up on haunches starting position, right, so if we started like here, we've got open leg, one leg open, press down, we've got both legs open and we can hold by the ankle, now this is going to put her into a stretch, and for someone who's flexible like her, this will be okay for some time, she can even hold onto her ankles as well, right, but that requires her to be super flexible, then we've got knees together, and you see, any time I maneuver any one of her limbs, here's how I wouldn't be doing it, right, so just yanking at things like they're levers, so we're looking at this kind of sensual touch that goes into placing her in positions, right, so I've got these presses, slides, scooping her up, placing her in position gently, running the hands down, so all of these transitional movements between the holds, this is the stuff that creates sensual flow in what we're doing, otherwise we're just jerking around moving bits and pieces of her body, right, as opposed to this sensual flow that happens, right, so if I'm repositioning things, placing here, same thing, running the hands up, crossing the ankles, right, you see all this extra sensual touch that makes the transition smooth, right, because you can technically get all the like, okay, that bit goes there, that goes there, here, but it's going to come across as clunky and un, you know, uncalibrated and not smooth, as opposed to we've got going from our grasp that we might have been in for a particular position, right, so we've got these grasp holds, and then see all this guiding movement, pressing in here, coming up, moving into our holds, into resistance points, over both the shoulders, see settling down, and I can make that an awesome moment where, let's say I'm in 50% penetration right now, then as I come down and smoothly come lower, then she gets the second 50% penetration, so it drags out the period of her being, you know, having the cock going in, which makes it feel longer and takes, builds more anticipation, gets a juicier sensation. And then, from our missionary, if we wanted to start switching her into other positions, we won't go into a lot of those in detail today, but just rolling her over onto her side, right, puts her in this half missionary, half doggy action like this, right, and then from there it's easy for us to, for example, transition into spooning, moving into doggy position or any other position we want to. One final thing that can really assist in the angling and positioning of the hips is to use a pillow. So what I'm going to be doing is putting it underneath her. Now, the way that I don't do it is like this, just lift up a bit, okay, not sexy. So instead we get her to lift, lift your ass down, okay, so in the time that she's lifted, I slotted in under. Now let's say the end of the pillow goes to about her belt line, right, because you want her to be in a situation now where because of this bolster, what this has done is tilted her hips more this way, which then gives us more direct access to the pussy, right, so it means that as I come down here and I penetrate, I'm directly deep in, right, I don't even need to, I mean, from here doing any tilting of the hips is going to be awesome because it's already towards the top wall of the vagina, and then I'm going to be pressing on the top of the G-spot area by doing my insulations like this. From there, there are other strokes that I can do where I can squeeze my knees together and drop, right, so this is where I, this is like a heavy drop into her, and because of the angle of her pussy, your cock's dropping directly in, right, so I go like this, squeezing my knees and dropping, got my rotations, under here I can also hold underneath the leg or reaching under the butt to get, to spread open the pussy, you get deeper penetration or more traction like that as well, right, so then, same thing when I want to remove it, lift your ass, and it's gone, seamless. There you have it, some quick and spicy upgrades to your missionary game so that you never have boring old married couple sex that hurts you back ever again. Now this video is just scratching the surface of what is possible and what is necessary to understand when it comes to different types of positions, angles, stroke control, and so on, the general flow that makes the difference between awkward and clunky sex and hot porn star, you know, erotic movie sex. Right now, I'm offering a free, detailed, and explicit video where I go into much more detail showing you how to transition between all of the primary positions that you're going to need and, of course, all the nuances and details that make them spectacular. So if you'd like to receive this video, all you need to do is click the link below, put your email in, and you'll receive it immediately. And stay tuned coming up at the end of November for the launch of the Master Lover Toolkit. Now at the beginning of this year, I launched a massive program called the Master Lover Method which was my most ambitious and most successful and popular online course that I've ever released. This was a full toolkit on how to become a masterful lover covering everything from the subtleties of Tantra through to the extremities of BDSM and every single thing in between. Since the launch, I've had a lot of requests from guys who wanted to join. Unfortunately, the course has been closed most of this year, so I'm reopening it for the guys that missed out the first time. And I've also had a lot of requests from guys who either have a smaller budget or who are more specifically interested in understanding just the good sex bit, right? How to be a normal lover that's maybe not doing crazy kink stuff and not being a tantric, you know, sex guru, but wants to understand how to fuck a woman well, how to get the most pleasure out of both of you and how to communicate, how to understand a woman's physiology, how to express your fantasies and your desires to her and so on. And so I've put together a more streamlined version of the course, which is the Master Lover Toolkit. Still extremely dense, covering in explicit, and I mean explicit video detail, all of the components that you need to go from the first kiss through to giving the woman screaming, squirting orgasms and everything in between. From foreplay, kissing, undressing, different positions, use of sex toys, fingering, communication strategies, fantasy role play, and so much more. This is an incredibly concise and powerful toolkit to take you from wherever it is you are now to being one of the top 1% of lovers on the planet. So stay tuned for the launch of that coming up in November. And remember you can get your free video by clicking the link below and otherwise we'll see you in the next video.
