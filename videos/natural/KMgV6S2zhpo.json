There is a degree to that where as you mature and age, and if you've been through a number of relationships, then the question arises, well, what do I do with that? All right, question. I'd love to fall in love. Been dating the past few years, quite a few women, really awesome, smart, funny, humble, caring, career-orientated and good-looking. And there were quite a few women I thought to myself, I kind of wish I fell in love with this girl, but have not been in love since teenage years really. Enjoyed connection fully and had fun adventures, but I wonder if I have the wrong perception of what love may be. Maybe since I got older and got more confident and have more integrity, love would not feel like this completely terrible feeling of uncertainty, madness, love, I know the one you mean. So maybe love feels different when you feel more grounded and confident. Well, I mean, good self-aware insights there, and I think it's good to look at this. I can't give any prescriptive answer because I don't want to tell you anything about what love is or what type of love you should feel, but I think there is, like from my experience, and I guess I've seen in my friends and people I've known for long periods as we've gone in and out of relationships and fallen in love at various points, me too even, that yes, there is a, I think there is something about the kind of crazy passion of youth and maybe a bit of the naivete, is that the way you say it, naivety, being naive, not having a huge amount of perspective, probably also just your hormones and your chemistry, that yeah, I've, I fell in love like hard several times in my life, and those happened in my teens and 20s. And the last time that I was in love, which was in my 30s, had a different quality. It was actually, I'd say, very deep love, but it was not the, like the woman that destroyed me and that I was head over heels, like fucking movie, romantic, no, not even romantic comedy, tragic love story, sick, couldn't think about anything else. That happened once in my life, and I'm glad, and I know it won't happen again, and I'm glad, because yeah, that was so much to do with our chemistry, my youth, my need, projections of romantic fantasies, like I projected all this stuff onto her, and she probably onto me, that made her not human, right, and made this experience together something that was just this desperate, and desperate in not like a necessarily needy way, but like, like nothing else matters, this is all that life is, I can't be without this person. So that extravagant kind of, yeah, really romantic love, for me, I think was a product of the man that I was at the time, and the combination with her. And now, like if I ever do fall in love again, which I won't, because my heart is a stone, no, but if I ever choose to allow that to happen, because I also know now that love is among, I mean, it has magic to it, and it has kind of an unexplained mystery to it to some degree, but it is also chemical, it's a biological process that everyone can experience it, it's not, so therefore it's not magic, it's part of our makeup, and it makes sense biologically, right, like if I have a lot of affection for somebody, and I really, really want to be around them, and look after them, and love them, then back in the caveman days, where who did I have to choose from, the other 10 women in my tribe, or the 40 women in my tribe, or whoever we managed to rape and pillage next door, that not all the time it would have happened, but because of proximity, because of staring into each other's eyes, because there's not many other options around, the capacity to fall in love from a chemical position happened, and that helped us bond, which meant that when I impregnated her, I'm more likely to stick around for the 18 months, two years, three years, that the child is most vulnerable for, and that's going to help me help the mother raise the child, so I would certainly say that there's, and that's a pretty cynical way to say it, maybe too reductive, but I think that's definitely an element of it, and you can kind of prove that in a way that probably when you fell in love as a teenager, it wasn't from going and grinding the streets, and doing a thousand approaches, and finding exactly the best possible mate for you, it was the girl in your class that you watched, and now I'm thinking back to all these like not very hot girls that I was in love, like I wrote poems about, and like fussed about, and stayed up late into the night fantasizing about, and it was just the chick three rows down on the left, that was the one that I like made all this stuff up about, and so I fell deeply in love with her, because that was what was available, and that was the person that I projected my desire, and allowed those emotion, those emotions or chemical emotions to happen, and fed them with my thoughts, and my feelings, and my actions, and then she didn't like me, because I was weirdly sending her poems, and then she broke my heart, and it was a great tragedy. So yeah, I think there is a degree to that, where as you mature and age, and if you've been through a number of relationships, bong, bang, at 6 30, why does it always go off at 6 30, what does that mean in Hungary, I should look it up, I don't want to know, shut up those bloody bells, I wish those bloody bells would stop, it's quite nice dear, it's Sunday, it's the church, what about us atheists, why should we have to listen to that sectarian turmoil, this will go on for about three minutes, and then the sirens as well, this is a really loud city, I'm gonna get back to the farm, all right so I'll try to talk over them, and that's two churches going off, bing dong, bing dong, there's one just there, all right project some porn onto that wall now Adam, we'll get revenge on them. So yeah, I think that your insight there is possibly true, then the question arises, well what what do I do with that, like okay, so I've been through my wild crazy love youth, and the pursuit of that, yeah I think can be kind of detrimental, and a lot of women fall into that, that like they will let good partners leave, or good relationships go, because they don't feel that crazy insane love, which was never really like throughout history, and I remember one Marxist telling me that love was an invention of the aristocracy, which at the time was like, what the fuck are you talking about, fucking commie, but I understand what's saying there, it's like okay, the romantic period of whatever that was, 18, early 19th century, bell epoch stuff, where aristocrats had the time and the resources to sit around pining over Madame La Blanche from the other estate, whereas the villagers were like, all right, well you all do, you got three of your teeth left, yeah well I love him, don't I, you know, you're gonna have to, right, yeah, oh she's died in childbirth, oh well, I guess I have to get, marry a sister then, I love her too, she's all right. Yeah, it is a bit of, I think, the modern preoccupation with, in relationships, that if we don't feel crazy amazing love for each other, that we're not good partners. I've certainly seen some partners where there's love between them, but it is that love that has been, that has been allowed to grow, because they fit well together, and they wish to make the relationship work, and so they become endeared to each other, and they allow love to grow. So I think that certainly is legitimate, I think, you know, if I was, if I had to choose, all right, you're going to be in this relationship for the next five years, I wouldn't choose it based on crazy amazing love, I would choose it more on, okay, I have deep affection for the person, and I really respect them, and they, they turn me on, I mean, that's really important, especially for me, like they really turn me on, because I mean, I'm turned on by a lot of women, and I know I'm not going to fall in love with them, or I'm, or I'm not, it's not going to continue, but that has to be a prerequisite for me, that I want her, like I really want her, and that I allow her charms, and I see into the person, and I see that there's more depth, and and that we can be compatible, and you know, if I had to do that, which I won't do, because I don't have to, and I don't want to, but you know, I think that helps a little bit.
