Literally one hour ago, I jumped off a plane all the way from Europe and arrived in Australia and I'm back in Melbourne at the TNL headquarters. This is the place where everything started many, many years ago. Now if you're watching this video, it means that I'm dead. And hang on, that's the wrong video. If you're watching this video, it means that the five principles of natural seduction is now live. That's right. My first ever comprehensive online course is now available for you to purchase. So you better do it quickly because it's only available for the next five days. That's right. Only from the 18th until the 22nd of December. So this is your only chance, unless you want to come over and work with me live in one of my exclusive and very expensive live workshops. This is your only chance to work with me in this kind of format. So what is the five principles of natural seduction course all about? Well, for the complete details, you just need to click the link here, which will explain to you everything in complete detail. But in brief, the five principles is a five week full immersion online learning experience where you will get exclusive lectures on the five principles as well as a whole bunch of drills and missions for you to go out and do during the week. And very importantly, there's a private Facebook group as well as live weekly webinars with myself where you get to come back and talk to me live about your experiences, about your challenges, and we can get into a lot more detail on any area that you want to discuss. I've also filmed in-depth interviews with some of my favorite seducers in all the world, Sasha Daygame, John Keegan, Liam McRae, Shea Matthews, and Travel Bum. And there's a whole bunch of other cool extras and bonuses for the guys that sign up in the next five days. This has been in the works for months. And in fact, I've been working on this material for the last 10 years through my own personal journey of self-discovery and seduction. And then through the coaching that I've done, literally with thousands of men all around the world from every walk of life, every demographic and every skill level. So it has been my obsession over the last eight to 10 years to refine down, to boil down what is the key differences that make the difference? What are the universal laws? And the five principles is my answer to that. It has been very important to me trying to teach natural game that I have something that is not a one-size-fits-all technique-based system, but is something that is universally applicable but incredibly adaptable. So the five principles, when integrated into your own personality, allow you to express yourself in an authentic, clear, honest, bold, and sexual way without needing to memorize any lines or tricks or techniques, without needing to put on any false masks or bravado or try to pretend that you're something that you're not. This is about raw, honest, clear actualization of who you are as a man and the message you want to present to the women in your life. So if you're interested in accelerating your change massively in the next five weeks, this is your chance. Don't waste another year. We're at the end of 2015. Smash this over the next five weeks and make 2016 a fucking amazing year full of awesome experiences and beautiful women. I can't wait to see you guys in the first week. That's all for me, James Marshall, checking out and going to bed. Bye. "}
