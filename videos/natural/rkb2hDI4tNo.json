It really is how you make her feel and whether she can actually respect you. Well, because we've been talking in this group on and off over the last year about the kind of life cycle of the seducer and going through different phases in your life, you know, being younger and older. And there's a lot of talk because, you know, for the first time ever, we've got groups of men who are questioning the status quo of should I get married straight or, you know, early and have kids and be monogamous and all of the things that people did. And obviously, I'm an advocate of basically a lifestyle of freedom so that you have choice. But then balancing that up against the realities of time and age and so on. What are your thoughts on being a seducer post 30, 40 and beyond in terms of like, is there a time you have to cash out? Is there something that men are really missing out on if they're not making a deep commitment to one person, for example? Or what are your attitudes on family and how that fits in with the seductive lifestyle? I kind of have this notion which is, I don't know if it's right or not. And Aristotle said the same thing. He said a man should never get married before the age of 35. Even the old Greeks, even the Greeks said that back when people didn't live longer than 35. Yeah, you should not get married before 35 because you're too impulsive and you're too horny and you too want to jump and hump everybody's leg, you know. There's a need for men to want to have fatherhood. And I get that. I understand that, right? You cash out. No, you never settle. My entire life is devoted to women and the concept of the energy of that, right? And I've done it my whole life. If I don't have women around, my energy drains. I can't sustain, you know. And I'm with my girl now almost nine years. It could be nine years coming up soon. And I adore my girl and my house is filled with women all the time. And I don't have an open relationship. It's not something that aligns with me. It's not my spirit. If I like this girl enough to be having my life, then I like her more than all the other girls, you know. So an open relationship for me, I really like my girl. But at the same time, I want to talk to every girl I see and I want to like interact with them. Say, hey, what's your name? Come here. Talk to me. Tell me a story. And with my buddy James, come talk to us. And how come I don't know you before? How come I've never seen you before? You know that feeling when your buddy comes to town and you got a wife, for instance, or a girlfriend. And your buddy comes down and says, hey, Zan, this is James. I'm in town for the night. You want to go shoot some pool or something? And the guy says, ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let me just check with my significant other. And she's like this. Well, what am I going to do tonight? In other words, you're her entertainment. What am I going to do? Okay, you're going to go with your buddy. What am I going to do? That feeling, I cannot abide. No. If I want to, I want to do what I want to do. If James comes to town, I'm going to say, my little sweetie, my dear, love of my life. I'm going to see James. You take care of yourself tonight. Sort yourself out because I'm not here. I'm going to go. Bye. See you. Done. And if I don't have that, then it's this nag, the feeling of that nagging quality that some women have, you know, which is like, well, and I can't handle it. I can't abide it. So I want to, if I said I'm going to go out with James, I'm going to go out in the old city of Bucharest or Budapest, for instance. I'm going to walk around. We can talk to girls. Sort yourself out, my dear. I'll be back in two hours, three hours, maybe four. Then that's what I want to do. So I will not sacrifice or compromise ever. Yeah, definitely. I mean, it's really vitally important. I think pretty much in any type of relationship, monogamous or not, and it's something that men make a lot of mistakes on in terms of their compromises. Let's say with your current relationship, which has been going for a long time, you know, it's all a length of time. How do you balance like the woman's desires if she's younger and she wants, I don't know, she wants family or how she deals with like quite a sophisticated and mature philosophy, right? Like in terms of you're committed and you're faithful, but you're also not in no way as a pushover or controllable. I guess that's the thing, right? And that's probably also a big part of her attraction to you is the fact that you are still free. You know, you're choosing to be with her and still choosing to be free. Do you have any thoughts on that, like in terms of managing your relationship? Expectations and stuff, right? Maybe. I know this now because I had a lot of relationships and stuff in the past where like I didn't, I was confused. I didn't know what to, and there was drama and there's no drama in my relationship. None, zero, none. And it's because of the way you set it up from the beginning, for sure. It doesn't mean like, and it's not like, okay, listen, here's my rules. I'm going to have this, I'm going to have this, and you're going to accept this in me. It isn't that. It's more like, this is what I've learned about women. Women are far, far, far more open and forgiving, I guess you could say, than we think they are with the right guy. With the right guy, she wants her man to be inspired and full of life and full of energy. Here's, you know, I'll tell you this, and this is a secret, nobody knows this, but it's true. If women feel like they are beloved, they are beloved. I don't mean loved, beloved. And she's the lily above all the lilies of the field. And you only have eyes for her. You can only see her in your mind's eye. If you're out somewhere, you're going on a business trip, you're thinking about your girl. And she knows it. And if she really believes that you adore her above anything else, women, this is why women, wives in history, have never really minded mistresses. As long as you don't embarrass me, don't embarrass me in front of my friends or, you know, my colleagues or something. Don't bring home diseases and be good to me and the children. Be good to the family, you know. And nobody knows this about women. In the right spirit of a man who's a kingly warrior, who's out there like battling battles, he doesn't mind if he bangs a girl now and then. That's the truth. And if you talk to women and say, no, not me, I would never do that. Yes, you would. I've talked to feminist groups. I've been invited to speak to just purely women, right? And I'll say something like this. And they go, no, I would never. My husband, blah, blah, blah, blah. And I went in, I would cut his balls off. No, you wouldn't. I'll tell you why. Do you want me to tell you why? Here's why. Because he adores you. He has devotion to you. He'll never hurt your heart. He'll never stargaze with another woman. You understand? You would give this man all kinds of liberties to be this warrior king that you know he is. You would do it. And they go, well, okay. I never thought of it like that before. I know you didn't, but now you do. Where do you find, where do you, like, I agree with you totally. But it can be a kind of a subtle line, which many, many men fall prey to becoming too needy or too accommodating. Or that sense of being beloved or being the great lover to her can be something where it consumes him and he doesn't have his own path anymore. Or where he's always trying to be a chivalrous knight. He's not the beloved then. He's just a needy, nice guy. That's it. He's just the guy who's attentive. Right. Yes. Which is definitely something that guys will put a huge amount of effort into this kind of relationship equity without understanding that it's not so much the things you do for her every day or how much you put yourself out. It really is how you make her feel and whether she can actually respect you. Yeah. So, I mean, you said it right. There's a fine line between being an attentive guy and being a guy who's too attentive, too needy, nice guy energy, you know. Think of it like this. If you were a king walking through your kingdom and you're moving through your kingdom and you see a pretty girl. She's 18. She's standing over there. And you say, stop everything. Who is this in my kingdom? Come talk to me. Come here. Approach me. Hello. Hello. I've never seen you before. And there's a one-way conversation there. It's not like, will you like me? There's no questioning of. He just speaks truth. So, when I meet a girl and I'm standing with you in a bar, for instance, James, and I see a girl, the only thing I say out of my mouth are statements of truth. I don't ask a question. All I say is, I don't know you. Statement. Period. Why do I not? Well, that's a question. It's true. Why do I not know you? Come talk to me, my friend. Come talk to me, my friend, James. Because I've never seen you before. That kind of energy, right? It's like statements that land. And you know what? In that kind of an energy, you can compliment a girl highly, which is taught. It's taught for like 20 years. Don't compliment. Don't do that. You have to act like you're a busy guy and you're aloof and you're not needy, right? So, don't compliment a beautiful girl because she's heard it all her life. But when this kind of man stands on the earth and says, hey, wait. I've never seen you before. Listen, I'm going to say this to you. You are a beauty to me. You're beautiful. You have beautiful eyes. I'm saying that. And when it comes from a man that says it has that integrity of what he's believing, right? He's speaking his truth. It's not this needy compliment of like, oh, you're so beautiful. Can I buy you a drink? And it comes with no reservations. Nothing in return is fine because I'm just going to speak my truth. And it lands. And I'll say this. I'll say, listen, you have beautiful eyes. I'm looking at you. You have beautiful eyes. And I know you've heard this your whole life. You've heard this from men your whole life, but you never heard it from me. That's the truth. Yeah, I think about that in terms of the king analogy as well, like riding through your temporal realms and flicking coins to the peasants. It's like, I'm rich. I can afford to give this away. It doesn't cost me anything. It doesn't shake my position. It doesn't make me weaker or poorer. It's like I can give with sincerity, and then you can take the gift or not. 100%. And I don't know. Maybe that comes with age. Does it come with age? It doesn't necessarily come with age. Like, I'd say, I mean, nothing comes with age just because you get older, except for, you know, weaker joints probably. But I think the opportunity to have more time to process. But it's like, do you take the lessons, right? Like, there's many men who, like, learn the wrong lessons early on, and then that builds in bitterness or neediness or codependence or whatever. And then they can just intensify that forever and then get stuck in their patterns. But, yeah, I mean, I think, like, I've no doubt you've had a number of grand affairs over your life, you know, like, loves and women that really touched you or, like, episodes with a lover which you really, maybe you fucked it up completely or maybe you made amazing breakthroughs. But, like, now I can look back over my kind of six great loves and see so obviously how immature and needy I was and also how sincere and, you know, like, romantic I was in an idealistic way. And then as those things start getting cracked and you come more into realities, then I think you can, over time, have a much more dispassionate view of the whole thing. You can step back and go, yeah, men and women are going to operate like this. It's not a big personal battle between you and each individual girl. It's like, OK, how do we actually harness the power of our masculinity to activate her femininity and filter through enough people that we can find ones that are really compatible? You know what? I've got a question for you. Something affected me when I was, like, 20, 21, maybe. I can't remember. And I never stopped thinking about, you know, this is what I devoted my life to this, because when I was 19, 20, 21, 22, maybe, going out to bars by myself, trying to be cool, trying to act like I'm aloof and cool, you know, pre-internet, pre-Tinder and stuff like that, right? And I'm trying to be, I stand and lean against the bar trying to be cool till the lights came on. I remember one time I was so lonely and alone, you know, but I remember one night I walked out of this bar and I'll never forget it. There was this girl sitting off to the side on a little bench or something, right? Beautiful girl. And I walked out and I looked at her and she looked at me and she said, hi, said it to me. Hi. Like, hi. She says, come talk to me for a second. I went and I sat down beside her and she said, you know, I like you. She said this. I like you. I can't remember the conversation. I remember she said, I like you and I want to say hi to you. And then her ride or whatever came and she was gone. So I spent maybe three minutes with this girl and I never forgot it to the point that I'm telling the story today, years later, right? I'm still telling this story. Never forgot it. And then and then you think, you know, everybody listening to this call can think of a moment in time when a girl like that just gave her spirit to you freely. Reached out, you know, even first and she gave you her spirit freely and made you feel that it's going to be okay and gave that to you as a gift that you never forget that girl. You never forget it. You never forget that moment in time. Right? So then my question after that is, has it ever been you for someone else? Have you ever been that angel in time for some girl that 30 years later, she's saying, you know, I met this guy one time. I'll never forget him. I only saw him for five minutes, but I keep thinking about it. Right? If not, then why not? Those are like, because I experienced it. You experienced it, right? The guys listening to this have experienced that moment in time where you feel like, wow, really touched by somebody's presence. You know, that's what I've been trying to write about and think about ever since. You know, that spirit, that kind, kind of spirit that is, it's not needy. It's not sucky. It's not like, can you get any of that stuff? You know? Yeah. The answer to that question, you know, if not, why not? As each individual man, if he can answer that question, then he has broken through. You know, it's like, it's like, yeah, just the question is strong enough. It's stronger than the answer. The question is stronger than the answer. And if a man asks that question and can ask himself sincerely, he already is more interesting in the eyes of women who he's approaching. Instead, he's walking up to the women and the women think there's something about him because he's got a mystical quality that he finally has broken through to, you know, as opposed to I want to get a Lamborghini and I want to get all these hot chicks and my, my boat and bikinis. Right. Nothing wrong with any of that, but I'm saying you have this mystical quality that men are lacking across the spectrum. Wise words from the one and only Zan Perrion.
