And today I have a very special guest with me, returning due to public demand and the fact that she's awesome, welcoming the one and only Miss Hayley Quinn. How are you doing, Hayley? Really good, thanks for having me, James. So we're here to talk about dating apocalypse and how we can possibly not let COVID-19 ruin our lives. Yes, exactly. So you and I spoke at length nearly a year ago, I think it was in April when the last time we had a big chat and it was the start of the pandemic and the adjustment to people's dating lives. And so now both of us have spent a year still working as dating professionals in this new and bizarre space and time to be alive. So I'm really curious to hear on your end, both anecdotally and maybe also from the statistical science levels, what it is that you think has changed or what has, and what has stayed the same? Because what I've seen, noticed online, especially with comments on our videos, when we put out, for example, some infill videos, people saying cold approach is dead. You know, online, online for men is like you're battling uphill against the algorithm. It's all over. You basically may as well hang up your hat and just give up and become a monk. So that's not, I don't, I disagree, but I'm curious to hear your, your viewpoints on yeah, what has changed? What's gotten worse? Maybe where there's some wriggle room for people who are taking advantage of this situation. So what is the dating space like in 2021? So I'm not going to lie that I think if you sat down probably at the start of 2020 and went, this is the year, you know, for me and my dating life, I think external circumstances probably threw a pretty large wrecking ball through that. I think COVID-19 thing has been a huge game changer, just like dating apps. I suppose when they came out, that really changed the dating space as well, but not even a pandemic can kill people's desire to meet one another. You know, sex, love and connection is not dead. I think that how we access it is going to be different in the meanwhile, but again, not all of those trends that we're seeing at the moment have to necessarily be incredibly negative. For instance, like yourself, I'm traditionally a much bigger fan of the world of in real life dating and long may that come back at some point, yeah, at some point this year. However, in the meanwhile, online dating, now there's a lot of bad you can say about online dating, but there are some positives in here that I'm going to pull out for you. Online dating is booming. I had some, I was doing some research with Match recently, which showed that January the 3rd, 2021 was the busiest day for signups on their site ever in history. There was 45% more people joining up. So whilst it's like, Oh God, it's online dating. On the other hand, because all of the women that would have traditionally just been able to walk into a bar or a friend's party, and they would never have had to do the online dating thing. Now that's because that's one of the only spaces that we can meet people. That means you're getting a lot of people on apps who traditionally were never on them. So there is a bit of a, and I think also with dating apps, there is a bit of a first mover advantage. So women as guys have probably experienced themselves in their life when they are using apps, they don't use it in quite the same way as men do. I think when women join the app, it might be like it's Sunday evening. She's just watched an episode of Bridgerton on Netflix. She's thinking maybe my Mr. Darcy is out there. She joins a dating app by like Thursday afternoon. She's bored. You know, she's had some bad messages. She's had some suboptimal experiences and she's just lost interest. So women tend to like go onto an app, use it really heavily and then they oftentimes they'll kind of drop out of using it. So if you have this momentum then of new women that are joining the platform and you can kind of get in there quick and be one of the first people to capture their interest and communicate with them and progress that onto video dates, that's not a bad, that's not a bad thing. Of course, it's not quite as exciting as maybe the days of like running up to someone, you know, on the street, but we've got to remember those days will eventually come back. Like my, the one thing I always reassure myself with about this, by the way, is there is a lot of greedy people in the world and there's no way those greedy people are going to let see our economy collapse to the state where we all live in a bubble inside our houses for the rest of our lives. And when that happens, I think it will be like a huge amount of unreleased and released energy. People are even dubbing this to come the summer of love, whether it's this year or next, when we're kind of free from our confines and for the guys out there particularly who are having a hard time thinking like, as you said, it's just time to go monk, I would just remind you that there's plenty of frustrated single women out there in the world as well. Of course, I work with men and women pretty equally and it's just, and I think this whole period in time has given a big reality check and wake up call to people about what's important to them. People have had a lot of time to reflect. So it's not just the men out there who are going to be chomping at the bit in a few months time to actually be able to go out there and meet people. Women are going to be seriously into that as an idea as well. Yeah, that's, that's really interesting that the, the ways that men and women have traditionally met people, let's say organically have, have been, have been shut off to some extent. I want to, I want to look a little bit more at the online stuff in a moment. Well, to be honest, I don't really want to because it's, I still, I still cringe it, but I understand that it is necessary. Just before we got on this call, I thought, I'm going to look up some statistics. And so, you know, from, from my hugely scientific research based on one Google search, basically in the nineties, which was when I first started dating, apparently people met 33% through friends, 20% at bar at restaurants, 20% at work, 20% at college, 15% ish through family and only 2% online. And now that's gone to roughly, apparently 40%, I don't know if you've heard those stats that couples are meeting, let's say, you know, almost half a meeting that way. And then the, the degrees to which those traditional through friends and restaurants and networking and so on, uh, have diminished a lot. Now, notably that, that, that chart doesn't mention at all, the pick yourself up and walk over to a stranger and boldly introduce yourself. It doesn't even factor in on the stats, uh, unless I guess you would include, you know, bar and restaurant, traditional stuff, but, um, and anecdotally, what in terms of like this coming summer of love, I actually noticed a mini summer of love last summer because when, you know, when the world was in the dating space was saying, okay, right now it's all locked down and nothing can be done. Uh, we, because we needed to put on some workshops, we were like, well, we decided we're just going to do it anyway. And we, and we threw a bunch of workshops in a small period where there was this little window where things opened in the summer period. And that was really interesting to go out in the field with guys, both myself, I was out approaching and filming and with students of various skill levels, uh, seeing what the responses were when we were in the middle of a pandemic and the men were still approaching. Okay. So they were doing it socially distanced. They were doing it with masks on. Uh, so, you know, there was, there was things they had to adapt to. But what I saw was, interestingly enough, the guys that were able to, you know, get their stuff together and go and, and approach girls, they were actually getting better results than the year before. Right. That was, that was what I noticed. And I think it ties into, if you're a social attractive female back in the pre-end times, then you were like your, your FaceTime or your, or your impression time with random men had all sorts of different locations and situations where that could happen, you know, whether that was flirting with the baristas, going to get the coffee or through work or through friends or through parties, festivals, going out, like there was a lot more times and places where a woman could bump into a guy who had, you know, whether he was an expert or not at approaching, there was just a lot more opportunities. And so we found that there was a lot of frustrated females on the streets in Budapest where we were, were operating and, uh, like humans are not exactly rational, logical. So it was, it was interesting to see that when the guy went and did approach, which was off or miscalibrated, the girl was all about the social distancing and all about the no handshakes and stuff. But when the guy went in and did something a little bit charming, she was like taking the mask off and there was handshakes and kisses on cheeks. So it was, it was interesting to note that yes, the, um, the, the desire to couple up was, was, is power, extremely powerful. It will even override health recommendations from time to time. And that although I think men are going to definitely need to have it in their arsenal to understand the online dating space and not to just throw it all out cause it's silly too. Um, having a, having a, a broad scope, let's say lead generation of, of meeting women can, can still exist in this, in this time and place. It just, it's going to have to be, um, you know, adaptive to the situations. Yeah. And you're funny enough. We found the same things in our training workshops in London. We just kind of like squeeze them in. Like it was like this scatter of weekends throughout the year and the COVID thing, admittedly we did it obviously when regulations allowed that to happen, but the COVID thing actually never came up once in any interactions. So that was rude. Cause we were, obviously we did the same as you guys, masks, social distancing, blah, blah, blah. But we fully intended that to be like the number one topic of conversation, major objection. And it was just like a tumbleweed in that area. And I think it's just so important to know it's not just the men that are frustrated out there. Like women are incredibly frustrated as well. Often I would say that women as well have, as you pointed out, first of all, not traditionally tons of social opportunities to meet people. They do not at the moment. Um, secondly, women also feel more time pressure around dating in my opinion. So they feel like they are on a runway towards getting somewhere and they're less kind of in the present moment, I think when it comes to dating stuff. So for women, the idea of a lost year is actually pretty painful, you know, because that's like, especially if she had an intention to meet someone. And I think because of that, as I said, I think it's going to reinvigorate people's attitude towards maybe how they were interactive with their dating life before. Maybe it's like they made rash decisions. Maybe they didn't make time for people. Maybe they didn't even prioritize the whole dating thing. I've got another stat actually, which shows that, um, I think over half of people surveyed are more interested in forming a relationship as a result of COVID because I think for a lot of single people out there, they'll have been sat there, you know, in their living room wearing the same set of pajamas for three days in a row, thinking this might've actually been a little bit better had I had someone to ride this out with. So I think we can expect more renewed motivation. And so for the guys out there, particularly who I know you're speaking to, I think there's just important stuff that you can be doing right now. Like it isn't touch wood, the apocalypse, you know, meeting people will come back again. That opportunity will arise. What skills can you develop in the meantime to help you to accomplish those things? Is there any work that you can do on yourself? How can you become a more attractive person during this time? And also, even if you don't really like online dating and don't see yourself meeting someone through online dating, online dating is still a pretty good, like if you want an area with lots of potential leads where you can hone your messaging, hone video calls, you know, loads of those communication skills, which I know tons of guys can struggle with from time to time and they can feel like they lose the energy of an interaction. You might as well just do a whole bunch of research and development right now on how to get it right and use this time to kind of keep training yourself. Yeah, cause this is definitely a time when a lot of people are practicing becoming undateable. It's like in terms of like using this time, uh, definitely in the opposite way that you could be, which is, you know, letting yourself go or becoming more insulated and isolated, uh, and yeah, more switched off so that, okay, for, for many people, the reality is if you, the alternative to monk life now is to, to work on the online space. So my question for you is for, like I know for myself and for a lot of the guys that I work with, they tend to be often the 30 to 40 plus range guys that weren't necessarily brought up with, uh, smartphones in their pockets. I certainly wasn't. Um, and I get some guys who are real purists about it who are just like, I don't want to be online at all, or why would I have an Instagram? I'm a 40 year old, uh, you know, investment banker, isn't that just for the kids? And so on. Um, so what would you say in terms of, cause what, what I see is there's, there's absolutely problems with the online dating for men particularly, I'm sure. And I'm sure women have their own types of problems with it, maybe in terms of men being flaky and getting, getting actually, uh, you know, actually being able to pin a, pin a guy down perhaps. But for the guys, it's no secret that a lot of the algorithms that these, um, apps and sites work on work as a popularity contest of some sort where they shuffle people into dateable and undateable ranges. Um, which can I just add is a very good reason when you first join an app as a man, do not swipe yes to anyone and do not install an app, which then they start swiping yes to everybody that it sees, you know, auto swiping things, they exist. All that's going to do is ding the guys in the algorithm. So if anything, for a man, if you are starting on a dating app and you're playing a bit of that game, be even more selective. Okay. Cause I wasn't sure if that was a myth or not. So if you just brute force swipe, the thing picks you up and goes, you're, you're, you don't care about each individual. And it's like, what am I supposed to do? I'm a man. I'm just trying to work the numbers. All right. Exactly. And also, if you think about what the app seeing, it's saying that you like everyone and how many proportion of those people like you in return. And that's kind of helps to set your relative hotness if this is the algorithms hot or not test. So because of that, you want to be very, very cautious with over swiping, particularly when you first join a platform. Oh, that sucks. So now you actually have to think about each one instead of going, I'm never going to meet any of them anyway. So I just got to swipe them all. Okay. So you can't, can't just brought brute force auto swipe. All right. So for, for guys that want to, let's say dabble in the online space in order to hedge their bets or in order to just deal with the fact that this is what is the reality that we have to deal with at the moment, but they don't want to, they don't want some of the detrimental effects, which is a, you know, sitting there demoralized for four hours a day, swiping and, and feeling like nobody likes them, um, be getting lots of spending a lot of time in flaky interactions, which is I think something that both men and women probably complain about is that, and I found that before too, where I've, it's like cute girl match. Oh, I'm excited. I chat and then I'm just like, it's a photo. It's, it's really hard to kind of maintain your like interest in this, in this potential human, which doesn't really seem, feel, feel real yet. Um, so what, what would you say some of the tips in terms of, yeah, being effective with this, not letting it ruin your life, but also not throwing it out completely and just ignoring it when the fact is that, okay, 40% of people are meeting that way and it's going to probably continue to increase over time. So I think there's three things to touch on, which is like how to make things more effective for you. And I do a lot of work going through people's online dating profiles and there's always something you can do to optimize that and make that better. And I'm definitely of the mindset that you should just have as much lead generation as many areas as possible. So why not have like a really kick-ass online dating profile as well as of course going out when we're allowed to meet people in real life. Secondly, there's the flaky interactions thing. Um, and there's, there's definitely stuff that I want to give advice on that. And thirdly, there's just morale, which is how to get through this time when it can be really difficult. So I'll start with morale. And first thing to point out is that women's morale suffers in the world of online dating as well. So I know it can really feel like she's having a field day of potential matches and you're just like number 163 in her inbox, which is promptly being ignored. Reality isn't quite like that. Um, for instance, a lot of women that I speak to, they'll have the experience of they're going on apps and again, they just don't have meaningful interactions. Guys will like their pictures, but they won't actually message them. If they do message, it's just, Hey, how are you? And they've even had lots of feedback actually that right now during this second kind of major lockdown, it's like men aren't trying to progress the interaction for because they don't, aren't showing any intent or pursuit probably because it is really hard to get excited about someone's picture on the screen. But that means that for her, it's, she doesn't actually feel like she's in this, um, abundance of potential suitors instead, especially for a woman, even if she has 50,000 followers on Instagram, those 50,000 followers on Instagram and those, all those guys, which match with her online until you have a meaningful interaction with her, like the bare minimum, I'd say from that is like a video date until you get to that level. You're not, it's just like noise. You're not even on her radar properly. She doesn't consider those people as options. So even though as a man looking in, it can feel like there is like, there's a very long queue outside this person's door. Her reality might feel very different from that. She could actually be like, there's no good man. I'm not connecting with anyone. These intro and she'll say the same things. These interactions are flaky. They're boring. They're not going anywhere. I want to feel desired. I want to feel pursued. I'm not getting that experience from dating apps. So she's been the same. Motivation point number two is to remember that yeah, online dating can be very tricky. Lots of dating apps have a bit, much bigger proportion of men on them than women. And so even the real stud muffins of the dating world, there was a stat, this was a few years old, so this may have shifted by now, but from a major online dating site said even like their top performing guys only got a 40% response rate on their messages. So the 1% of the online dating world get a 40% return rate on their messages. So lots of messages unanswered is not uncommon. Don't always chalk this up to you just not being good enough. In fact, it could just be that her profile isn't inactive and it's been very hard for her to remove that profile on the app. You know, that she's deleted the app off her phone, but her profile is still there floating around on the app. It could be that she's just got bored. She's not responding to her messages. Like God knows, but like, don't put it all down to yourself. With the online dating theme, motivation point number three, keep it compartmentalized. Don't just sit there like scrolling when you're trying to do something else. Even if it's watching Netflix or doing your work, carve out a time in the day where you do the online dating thing, where you say yes to some people and you write some high quality messages. You know, if you get a bite back on one of those messages that looks really good, then that's the time I would say to invest maybe 30 minutes in having a conversation that ends up in swapping contact details. Otherwise, just keep it segmented in your day so it doesn't just feel like it's just another pile of admin or another thing that's giving you alerts going on in your phone. When it comes to flaky women, important thing for everyone, men and women to remember in the world of online dating, is there's going to be some people on there who are like really ready and willing to connect as much as they can do, whether that's meeting up or having a video date, depending on where you live and lockdown and all that kind of stuff. There's also going to be a lot of people there who are just bored. And there's going to be some people there who are like, I really want to find a boyfriend, but then actually don't follow that up with taking any actions that are congruent with that in their lives. So rather than trying to convert people that are like disengaged, probably with dating and the app generally, focus on hot leads instead. So if someone was just responding to you with like emojis or one word answers, or takes like three weeks to get back to you, or says, I'm sorry, it's been mad busy. But anyway, how are you? I would just like, not I would just be like, on those leads. And I know that might feel difficult, especially if you're really attracted to her. But it can just be such a time suck and such a drain of your energy levels. So instead, try to create a process where you are filtering women with the assumption that a lot of the people that you're matching with actually aren't serious. They're not on the dating app is kind of like serious buyers. So you want to kind of have a way to get to that. Part of that is also when you do have that really warm response, and you have a bit of chat back and forth with a woman, really capitalizing on that and going for the phone number getting her off that platform. While she's in the right frame of mind that that's something that she's open to, that can be something that's really important as well to get that momentum because momentum can be lost extremely easily. But if you can get the phone number and get her onto a video call, the chances of that interaction continuing is so much better. Um, when it comes, you want to say something? I could pile on with more online dating facts. No, no, please do. But, um, yeah, that's certainly something I've noticed in my dabblings in online over the years is that women tend to be excited and attracted in a guy, even if it's virtually for a short period of time. It's not like you've got that in the, in the bank that if a girl was curious one night that we can leave that three weeks later, because the dude's like, well, she's still hot. So I'd still hang out. I'd still bang her. So like, why wouldn't she? No, it doesn't work like that. Um, yeah, I think that's really important. What you've talked about, how you're working essentially with a broad, broad spread to, to get as many leads in as you can. And how not romantic is this? What we're talking about? Like, it's like, right, so we need a broad spread of leads. We need to filter them down into like optimizing like, oh wow, romance really is dead. All right. Well, anyway, this is the realities we're dealing with. Um, and to be able to see, to, to be able to be like, not like, it's like going to a casino and putting bad money after good. It's like, if you've got a, just because you've got this shiny thing and the girl wrote to you once and you're like, wow, that's, that's the girl of my dreams. And then she's being flaky and giving you the mad busies or the occasional emojis. Yeah. Having, having like discipline in your mind to look at the, at this, like, okay, to a certain degree, this is a, this is a numbers game where working, you know, literally working with an algorithm. Uh, so we can opt, there are certain elements you can optimize in terms of your photos and your bios and your messaging strategies. And there's lots that you can't really do anything about, which is the broad mass of data that's out there. And so to be able to go, all right, cool. We start with a broad funnel. The girls, girls that are coming that are giving us this kind of run around a general, like you'll see after some time, like, have you ever met one of those girls ever? And there's, you know, I've seen those things where I'm like, wow, that kind of girl who gives that level of, I don't know if it's kind, but like a girl who's giving that level of investment, you're almost never going to see her. Right? So then, then any time sink into that, except for just the occasional Hail Mary as a waste of your time. Uh, and that, yeah, like if a girl is interested, aroused, flirty, you know, you know, in a capricious mood and she's chatting to you, that's the time that you do then need to escalate that. And if we can't escalate that to meeting in person, you've, you've talked about, um, escalating digitally. Um, I'm curious to know your thoughts maybe on, tell me about this video dating. Like this is, this is a new thing, right? I read an article the other day when I was doing a bit of research for this, where there were people had all these different ideas for, you know, you can cook together and watch Netflix together. And like, okay, so it sounds kind of dystopian and lame a bit, but, um, but this is okay. So this is, you know, this is a thing now. So maybe talk us through what that would look like. Um, probably a lot of guys have never considered that as an idea. Um, it does make sense when, you know, when you bring it up. So I'm just curious what your thoughts are on that. So I've got another stat for you in the world of online dating and it's got, and it's got a dating trend name as well. It's called Zoomancing. Like Zoom. Yeah. I don't know. It's just what you always thought Zoom would be used for. So, uh, yeah. I mean, my stat is that 18% of people say that even post pandemic, they're going to keep up the video dates as a filtering system. I guessing these women are, these people are women. So I think it's, I think the thing is, it's like for the time conscious online dating user, who's thinking, I bet for instance, let me put a backtrack on that. I bet a lot of guys out there will have had the experience online of a woman agreeing to go on a date with them and then kind of flaking out. And then he's trying to chase her around for a couple of weeks after that. And it eventually dies. Um, so I think that's because she's at that point of just not really being fully certain about whether she wants to meet and obviously doesn't want to disappoint someone. So it kind of mulls it around and it eventually doesn't happen. What the video date now becomes is it's like extra qualification step. Like I've been able to visually see you, you are who you say you are. Do we have a connection as we're speaking towards one another? Was that fun? So it becomes like another gateway to go through. And I know this sounds like I'm like the bear of bad news here before you meet her on a date in real life. So why I'm bringing this up is twofold. I think because of this reason, because I think it's, this is going to become part of our dating culture post COVID if we ever get out of COVID. And secondly, because I think with the video date, um, in and of itself, that is in many places around the world right now, that is like the best level of investment you can get from her in this moment in time where meeting in person is just like not happening. So because of that, I think it's important to get good at going for video dates. And I think having that interpersonal connection, even though it's not as great as meeting in real life, it does mean that you're in a, in her mind, you will be in a slightly different category to random guy that she's messaging on the app. You've actually become a person. That's a very good thing. So just like you said, momentum is extremely important. If she, the woman's very chatty, capitalize on that. Um, you know, you could just say something like, you know, um, I think this level of chat warrants a video call or once warrants a call, uh, let's catch up this weekend. So just be relatively casual about casual and direct about it. Get her phone number. As for the video date, I think the first time you speak on the phone, I would just keep it really short, especially if you find phone calls a bit stressful because we're just not really fully used to doing them in the modern age. It was more like a 1980s thing. Uh, then I would suggest, you know, going out, you know, do it. I still, I can remember stressfully calling people up on the telephone. Yeah. Yeah. So I would say, you know, do it while you're doing something else like cooking your supper or like going for a walk down the road or whatever you can do. Cause I think having something going on in the background will make it easier for you. And it gives you an out if things aren't connecting, if they are connecting well, I would still leave it on a high. So this goes back to kind of what we're talking about with guys being prepared to walk away. I think this is such, if we're talking about maintaining your motivation as a man in the dating space, this is crucial. So if she's not investing in those messages online, it is actually okay just to leave it because you're maintaining your motivation. Your purpose is actually more important than just like, I guess, taking it to the absolute, this is completely, you know, the point where you're absolutely convinced it's done with every single woman, you know, do broad strokes a little bit more. Um, and the same thing goes with like the world of online dating. If you're on a video date with her, it can feel tempting to just like chat, chat, chat, chat, chat. And then like, you're like, wow, two hours has gone by, but then guess what? It's actually really hard to sustain conversations with people that you can't meet in real life over an extended period of time, who you've never even met in person. So because of this, be okay to walk away first and end on a high. If the interaction is going well, then just be like, you know what, I've got to hop onto a call with a friend. I've got a meeting coming up or I've got to start, um, I've got to do my workout, but it's been good chatting to you. Let's catch up next week. So actually it's a very powerful move to end an interaction first. And I remember once back in the good old days when we were sat in, um, Budapest, you were telling me like after two and a half hours on a date, the date should end and it either ends or you're taking her home. That's it. There is no super long mega date that involves, that evolves out of that. And I think the same is true for the video date. Take a home or send a home. And if we can't do that in the digital space, then, uh, wrap it up. I think it's also totally fine to bring that up, um, overtly like to, to, cause that can take, that can take the pressure off things for both parties to say, um, yeah, how about we, we jump on the phone for like 10 minutes and let's even set a timer if we, if we're, if we're, and then feel free for any of us to leave earlier. It's like, it's a, yeah, we're not, we don't have to sit down and commit ourselves to two hours of conversation. Um, and I've said that kind of thing before. So I, you know, I usually don't like, like being on the phone much, but let's just have a quick call and, you know, and get to know each other. And then I'll go off to my very important thing I have to do, uh, changing my tracksuit pants for the first time this week. I've got to get to my meeting. Do you think, um, actually this, this, this brought up a, brought a little idea in my head. I think, so you guys will have seen that Hayley and I did a bad date compilation recently, which we filmed, that was a while ago. That was a well over a year ago back when you could, could go on coffee dates. Um, maybe we should do a follow-up where we do bad zoom dates sometime. That would be epic. I would count me in. I would love that. Oh, there's so much bad stuff we could do with very inappropriate backgrounds and, um, bad fashion. And yeah, that would be great. Um, should people be getting ring lighting? You know, should we be like, I've actually got a ring light right here, so I'm going to be really, this is my bit of authenticity. I'm broadcasting live from my parents' living"}
