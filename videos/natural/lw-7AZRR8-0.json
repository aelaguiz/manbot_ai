So it's like a lot of people feel kind of either uncomfortable or they suddenly feel rich if they got 500 bucks in their pocket and they just got to blow it. Hey, James and John, my dad passed away a month ago today. So firstly, deep condolences to him. I feel a lot of sympathy and that must be really fucking rough. You're a young dude, 20 years old to lose your father at that age. So my heart goes out to you, bro. So you've said, it's obviously been really tough, but one of the things I've been worrying about recently in light of my situation, I'm almost 20 and I'm fresh out of school, is that in a world that is more expensive than any other country in the world, is that in a world that is more expensive than ever, I have to be really smart with my money going forward. I can't rely on my parents anymore. What money tips do you guys have for young man who doesn't want to be broke? People keep telling me that money will come in time, but I don't want to be complacent. Okay, so neither John or I are financial planners. We're not like the most frugal people and we don't count every single penny. So you would get different types of advice from someone who's like a money person, but here's some perspectives that I can give you because I grew up very poor. Through most of my 20s, I had very little money. It was really only when I hit my 30s and the business started taking off that I suddenly started to come into money and then my wealth was created over the last 10 years, basically. So prior to that, I lived a very, I mean, I wasn't starving and I came from a country where there was a social safety net, which certainly I took advantage of. So there's lots of different places in the world where the situations are different and harder and easier situations. I'm not sure where you're from. I don't know if you're talking about America or what country you're coming from. And that will make a difference because the realities are that some places are more expensive, some places you get more support from the government if you need it. Some places wages are higher and lower. So all of those things factor in as well. And the last thing there, it says that people tell you that money will come in time. I would call absolute bullshit on that because that's not true. Money doesn't just come to everyone in time for no reason. It's not, it doesn't work like that. There is, there's economies, there's people who have huge wealth, there's people who don't. Sometimes those things are related to just being born in the right place with the right backing. Luck comes into play. I know that I'm, I've worked hard and I'm skilled, but I'm also very fucking lucky. You know, like I think both John and I, like if we had to try and start our businesses today, it would be a very challenging situation compared to we were early movers. We got into this industry early. We had various legs up, bumped into various clients that ended up being big fish that kind of helped us through hard times and so on. So I'm not, I would never suggest that it's all because I'm so awesome and smart. It's there is, there's lots of factors at play that we don't necessarily have control over. What I would say on this is that it, you can, I would put aside the idea that like money will just come, although there are mindsets that will assist you, but mindsets alone don't do anything actually. I mean, they might make you feel better and they might, they can set you in correct directions and having incorrect mindsets, particularly around money can really, really hamstring you. You do want to look at like, what are your thoughts around money? And I would say, again, I don't want to say this with any kind of blame or condescension when I say poverty mindsets, because if you're born in fucking North Korea, you can't mindset your way out of that. There's lots of situations where being in certain circumstances make it very, very challenging. So being born in a free country with a good passport, with a social safety net, even though my family was poor, gave me legs up. But with people who never really get a handle on money, there tends to be a sense that you work for your wage, whatever it is, you pay, you pay your living expenses. And then anything that's a windfall or that appears out of nowhere, or you have a little bit of extra, there tends to be a race to zero, right? So it's like a lot of people feel kind of either uncomfortable or they suddenly feel rich if they got 500 bucks in their pocket and they just got to blow it. And I've seen friends over the years who have actually earned good money throughout their life in various points, but have always managed to rush back to zeros because they're okay with being at zero. They don't feel like it's normal for them and they don't really know what to do with a bit of excess wealth. Because if it's like, I've got an extra thousand, well, okay, I can't invest that and make a million. So I may as well buy a PlayStation and make myself feel better this week. So one thing that I did early on was, I decided that $1,000, Australian dollars at the time, was zero dollars, right? So it meant that when I had a thousand bucks in my bank account, I had zero. That was non-negotiable, I couldn't touch that. I didn't have a thousand bucks to spend. And I had some kind of basic buffer. And later on, when I made more money, I changed that number to 10,000, right? So that early on in the business, when I suddenly was like, well, I've got 10 grand, holy fuck, I've never had 10 grand. And I certainly had impulses like, what could I buy? Where could I go? And I was like, no, no, that is zero now. And that's the foundation of my wealth. I don't know what to do with it right now. I don't have any idea how to invest it. I'm not gonna suddenly run into some get rich quick thing because none of those things work. Nobody gets rich quick unless they're right in the inside of the way an economy works, of some kind of insider trading, whether it's crypto or stocks or whatever else. You don't get rich overnight by listening to someone on the internet, especially who's like, buy these alt coins now, as both John and I have experienced when we dabbled in that. For a whole year, 2017. Yeah, for a whole year. Yeah, 2017, we got tangled up in that. Yeah, those things, of course, they're designed to make people who are desperate or poor feel like suddenly they can get out. Like that kind of charlatanism or con man stuff has existed for all time, from back from the idea of turning lead into gold. So I would never take advice from someone on the internet who says you can 10X your money overnight by buying whatever it is. It's bullshit. What it really means is they're gonna 10X because 10 people are gonna give you their stuff and then they're gonna take the money. So there's no like overnight thing for wealth creation in my experience. And unless you, you know, occasionally it's some really lucky thing. Sure, if you'd bought Bitcoin at $1 because you knew about it then and you held it for 10 years, awesome for you. But those things very, very rarely come along in human history. So there's that basic thing. And it comes down to like also looking at like really basic stuff, income versus expenses. Now, I also understand that there are lots of places in the world where a basic wage is almost untenable, right? Like you're on minimum wage in America, like how can you afford an apartment if every apartment costs two grand minimum a month? It's a really difficult situation. And this is something that maybe, okay, you're 20 years old, you have your whole life ahead of you. I don't know which country you're coming from or what the circumstance is, but there are places that are better and worse for wealth creation. Even if you look at a map of America, for example, that it's been well documented that like if you live in one state as opposed to another state, your chances of wealth creation are far, far higher because there's these realities of like there can be systemic limitations to your location. If I hadn't have moved my business to Europe 10 years ago, I doubt it would still exist because the market was too small. The interest was not there. The wealth was not necessarily there in the country and also the Australian attitude was a bit like, ah, I don't know about this guy. Whereas the Europeans were much more open and there's a lot more wealth in the continent, right? So with your whole life ahead of you, you may want to start thinking over the next, I mean, it doesn't have to happen overnight. It could be a multi-year plan that is the place that you live in the best place to try and become financially stable. It may be or it may not. Like early on when you're a young man, you don't have much to trade on, right? You're not a specialist. You can't charge huge consulting rates for your skillset. What have you got to trade on? Well, often it's just your labor. Like I did that as a 17, 18 year old is in my summers, I did this for a few summers, is I went and did hard fucking labor of picking fruit, right? So like that, and it was a thing where I could go and work for three months and get paid 150 bucks a day or something, which to me at the time meant, you know, I could make a thousand bucks a week, which was unheard of. I worked extraordinarily hard for that, of course, but I had limited expenses. I was just living on a farm. I just had to pay for my food, lived in a caravan and worked really hard and saved up several thousand more over a couple of months period, which then meant I could add to that a thousand as a zero. And then I had extra money, which I decided to invest in travel, right? And so by the time I was 18, I was traveling the world coming from a poor family because I'd taken those small blocks of time to trade. The only thing I had to trade at the time, which was young, strong man can lift things and can pick things. And that was gonna make me much more money. And I had friends who did this in the mines or went on working in fishing boats and, you know, things where male labor is of value and it's often tough work and you need to go somewhere that's usually kind of a place or, you know, there's not girls around necessarily. But that year I was wealthy for a young broke dude and I had choices about what I wanted to do, which for me was travel to China and learn Kung Fu, right? So these are some of the basics that you need to sort of get a handle around. And do understand that there are some places in the world that are so expensive to live in that trying to grind like, okay, I mean, John did this and I did this too, like rocking up an expensive city and okay, made it happen. But, you know, maybe it's better to start things in a cool city, one that has something lively going on but is cheaper to live in. Maybe that means going from UK, means going over to Spain and working summers there or some other Eastern European country where if you can figure out a way to earn, like not a local wage, right? So if you go and move to the Czech Republic and try and work in a cafe, it's not gonna be great because the wages are low. But what could you do? Could you teach English there? Yeah, possibly. So what do you need to do that? Go online, do a TESOL course. Costs whatever, a thousand bucks, takes a couple of months, get qualified as an English teacher. Okay, maybe you can go to a country where that thing is tradable on a much higher level. The thing that for me and for many guys that I know who went from being just working class guys with no money behind them to eventually, finding some kind of financial freedom, we all learnt a skill which meant that we could double, triple or quadruple the base minimum wage of the country, right? So, and there are lots of these kinds of skills that could be learnt within six months. So for me, it was massage, right? I went and I actually did a two year course cause I wanted to get deep into it, but I could have done it shorter. And so I was going from a guy that was worth 10 bucks an hour working as a whatever, cleaner, fucking chopping wood or whatever I could do, to being able to earn 60 bucks an hour, right? So suddenly, like I only needs to work 10 hours a week and I was making 600 plus bucks a week. So that, and I was free to work on music and the other things I wanted to do. And with that skill, like I know both John and I have been fortunate and skilled enough to end up having jobs where our jobs are our passions, right? We love the thing we do and we get to get paid for it. That is amazing, but not all, there's not all jobs on the planet can be like that. So what I would be looking at is if you have a driving passion about something you wanna work on to get to, especially if it's something artistic music or something where it's like acting or something where it's like a very small percentage of people are really gonna make it regardless of your talent. Or you have like some very specific pie in the sky dream. Cool, go for that. Yes, absolutely. But also have a side hustle, have something that a skillset you can develop over a year or two years or less, which is tradable for multiples of what basic income is. Because that means suddenly you can free up time, right? And that means you can put more time into your passion project or you can start to accrue basic levels of wealth so that you can get that one grand, that five grand, that 10 grand that are your base like securities, which is also the beginnings of fuck you money, right? It's the like, most people are trapped in whatever job they have, whether they hate it or not, because they can't afford to, you know, if they quit tomorrow, how are they gonna feed themselves? When you got 10 grand in your pocket, well, I could feed myself for some months or a year if I was being frugal. So I've got a year's worth of fuck you money. Maybe if I, you know, if I went off to India and lived for a year on the beach and go, I could live on 10K easy and bang hippie chicks and eat poppadum chips and have a great time. And so I've got a year's worth of freedom in my pocket. And that's, for me, like was always the motivation to get rich, right? Like, as you can see, the only thing I wear on my wrist is some Ayahuasca bands. I don't, you know, it wasn't to get bling or to get cars or to impress people. It was that I wanted more and more layers, levels of freedom so that, you know, now I know that it's like I had, the rest of my life is free, right? I can earn more money and I will, but there's no, no one gets to tell me what to do ever again. Yeah, those are some basics to look at. Just really understanding ins and outs, really understanding the taxation system in your country and saying, okay, how many months do you need to work for the government? And is there ways like over time where, especially if you start a business, sure, you spend your first couple of years at home setting up your business, but can I move it offshore or move it internationally to not have to pay the huge corporate tax that might exist in one country versus a lower one in another country? And I mean, some people have ethical concerns with that, but my opinion is it's like, I'm in the countries that I live in. I pay tax by bringing heaps of clients there, by spending money there all the time, by giving to beggars. You know, I pay my taxes in other ways and then I do what I can legally do to not, you know, not pay 50% corporate tax that if I was set up in Austria or whatever. Yeah, those are some things to start thinking about. It will be a longer term projects if you don't come from huge wealth. Don't be looking for get rich quick stuff. Look for, how do I start squirreling away decent amounts? How do I start clawing back my time? How do I start to develop a skillset, one or two or more skillsets, which mean that I get paid 20 or 30 or 40 or 50, 60 bucks an hour instead of 10, whatever the ratios are in your country, because that's the stuff that will actually eventually lead you to wealth. And then along the way, when you have a decent amount of money to actually invest in, don't invest in something because it sounded good, like because someone on the internet. The only time I've invested money, whether it was gold, crypto, real estate, was when I knew somebody who had proven track records, because I can see that he's doing it. I can see his bank account. He understands how to do it. And he's a friend of yours. That's when you should invest, right? Because there are so many scams and it is tragic to see people work, you know, hard to save up heaps money and then lose it on some dumb scam, right? So yes, that's my advice. And then I could add to that. Number one is there is something is like, there's some things James and I don't have, which is a wife and kids. And we didn't knock those girls up early and get saddled down. So maybe some of you are in that situation, but I'm obviously gonna make it harder to save money or, and also to follow your own personal dreams. So you're 20 years old and my dad just died six months ago and he didn't leave me anything, went to my stepmom. So that was, that was a blow to me. So it's like, and he didn't give me much money in my life, you know, especially not in a long time. So the thing about this is, is like I grew up, middle class. And there's something about the middle class that makes you lazy because you have things, you don't have everything, you aspire to more, but you have the health care, you have that. And there's something about being a first-generation immigrant, for example, that makes you work like hell. And there's something about losing your dad at 20 that and not having much money that gives you the opportunity to work like hell. So on one hand, you don't get to be the rich kid with the $600 sneakers and the $10 lattes all day, but you get to be someone who's laser focuses on his life. So I would use that as a motivation. And then I guess for me, ever since I got to that point that James talked about, there was a point and it went on for a long time. Remember, I was trying to be an artist and I had a delusional dream that I got on a TV show. I thought, that's it, I'm rich. And then I realized I've made more money bussing tables here. So the point is, I always thought there was some big payday for me in the future. But the actual reality is that one, you want to be able to follow your dreams. I want you to follow your dreams, whatever they are. You're young enough that you should be, but at the same time, live below your means. So when you get to that point where you have 5,000 in the bank or 1,000, that's 1,000 you're never allowed to touch no matter what. You're saving that. And then it gets to 5,000 and then 10,000. I know when I had $10,000 saved in cash and I was looking at it, I just felt rich. I was living below my means and I felt rich. And that's not rich by most people's standards. But over time I became, by most standards, wealthy. And always for me, I live below my means. I get what I want. I have my things that I enjoy. Like James said, I'm not wearing my pretty bracelet right now, but I always have a lot of sneakers and I have cool clothes and I eat healthy, expensive food. I go where I want. I do what I want. I want to take a date out to a nice place. I do it. So I don't feel restricted in any way. But for example, New York's a very expensive place. I could pay, I could get an apartment for four times as much, but I like my little apartment. It's cozy. It's in the ideal spot and it's working for me. And I save a lot of money every month on that. And that's money that just goes into investing. And if I want to, I can totally get another apartment. I just change because I'm in that situation now. So what I'm saying is don't live above your means, obviously, right? But at this time, I think as a young guy, you should be following your dreams and just listen to what James said because he really broke it down. Good day, gentlemen. I'm just here chilling on the farm in Portugal before I hit the road and start the touring teaching season. And I hope you enjoyed this tiny little clip from the Lifestyle Design Academy.
