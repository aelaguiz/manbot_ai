It's James Marshall here in Prague, just arrived back from Africa, now I'm hitting the summer season. I haven't seen a woman in weeks and I'm having a hard time focusing on you because of all what's going on around, but I'm going to do my best. Ask the Naturals episode something. Question here says, in your speech multiple relations, you say that after having sex, you're having a talk with the girls about the relationship. Doing that, he's saying that if he did that, he would feel awkward and bad as I need to be more honest from the start and I feel like I'd be manipulating her. Do you have experience in telling the lady about the whole intent from the start, he means before having sex? I bet the chances of having sex are quite low. All right. So this guy's talking about my multiple relations speech, which I gave at the 21 convention a few years ago. And in this, as part of my process for explaining how to set up a unfenced or an open or more casual type of relationship, I advocate that after you slept with a girl once, twice, that you're going to need to sit down or stand up, put your clothes on and have a discussion about what's going on. Because often guys and girls don't do this. They start sleeping together, they go on a date or two, they have sex and then they keep kind of seeing each other and no one has specified, and this might go on for weeks and maybe months, and still no one has specified what is the parameters of this relationship, what is the objective, what are the agendas and the needs of both parties. And this can lead to a very messy situation where for example, let's say you have a guy who doesn't want to be in a committed monogamous relationship and he's having sex with a girl and she does want to be in a committed monogamous relationship or at least she's open to that possibility and she's maybe screening a guy to see if he'd be willing to do that. And he doesn't tell her that he wants to be able to see other girls and she assumes after some time that they're kind of exclusive because, well, they're seeing each other twice a week and he's holding her hands in public and he's whispering sweet nothings in her ear and he's introduced her to his friends and he's doing actions that suggest that he wants to be a boyfriend. And then maybe a month or two down the track, she finally says, hey, so what's going on with us? Like, you know, I guess we're together or something. And then the guy says, oh yeah, I don't know, I'm just like still kind of busy with work and I'm trying to get over, you know, I had that thing with my ex-girlfriend and I'm just not sure if I'm ready yet. And he starts this waffling bullshit kind of excuses about why he's not willing to commit. And then quite understandably, the girl in the situation might be really upset or angry because she's wasting her time. The guy's not being clear with her and that's when you can have a messy little breakup or the girl is really upset or disappointed. And of course, this can work both ways. It's not just the girl always wants a boyfriend and the boy is always trying to run away from being a boyfriend. This absolutely can happen both ways. So what I'm talking about here is I would advocate for both genders regardless of who wants to be open and who wants to be closed. But going back to the question of the guy that asked me, he's saying like, because I said in that speech, I don't mean that you go on a coffee date with a girl, right? So you've met her in the street, you've gone up to her and you said, well, you are the woman that I'm going to talk to. And we're having a chat and yes, you. And then I get a phone number and I say, let's go on a date. And then we sit down for coffee and I say, so Sarah, it's a nice dress you're wearing. And just before we get started, before we get started, I just want to be really, really clear here. If we have sex tonight or tomorrow or some other time, I want you to be really clear and understand that I'm not looking for a committed monogamous relationship. I'm not willing to commit 2, 3, 4, 5 years of my life to you. I think it's really important that I'm really honest about this right now just to kill any romance, just to be brutally, stupidly honest here. I'm going to put this all out on the table before we've ordered the coffee, right? I don't think that's a good idea. I don't think it's necessary. And what the mindset that's going on here and the reason that I think this guy needs to look at his mindset a bit is he's assuming that every time a girl goes on a date or every time a girl has sex with a guy, that she wants him to be a committed monogamous partner for a long period of time. And that's a gross misunderstanding of the needs of modern women or the desires of the types of relationships. The reality is that most women, unless they are very super religious or they come from some very kind of repressive background, so let's say that they are free enough to make decisions and free enough to do what they want to do, they will through the course of their sexual life, their dating life, do all sorts of things. They will have one night stands. They will have a casual lover that they see once a week. They'll have an affair with their boss at work. They will sleep with a married man. They will sleep with their gay friends sometimes if the gay friend's feeling like is on MDMA. They will date a guy fairly regularly but not have a completely exclusive thing. They'll get back together with their ex-boyfriend and have sex with him sometimes. And of course, they will have situations where they go, alright, we're together. We've decided that we're going to have exclusive rights to each other's genitals for some period of time and we're going to do the monogamous thing. And there's a gross misunderstanding that there are certain girls who only trade sex for relationships and then there are those naughty, dirty, slutty girls who give it away cheaply. Having that idea in your head is the kind of deepest level misunderstanding about women that means that a guy who holds that is going to have heavy judgment about women and he's not going to allow women to express their sexuality in a free way which means he'll miss out on all the fun stuff. That's an unfortunate side effect of if you have judgment about women as being good girls or sluts, they can't be slutty around you because then they'll be judged by you. Whereas when girls meet us, we encourage the sluttiness. We encourage them to express their sexuality fast on impulse, on desire without necessarily needing to put some strict relationship parameter around this. So having said all that, what that means is if I tell a girl like, I meet a girl at a bar and we're having a drink and she's flirting with me and I'm touching her thigh and then I say, hey, do you want to get out of here? But before we go, just so you know, when we go home and have this one night stand where we don't even know each other's names, it's not going to be blah, blah, blah. This is absurd because it's assuming she wants that and it kills the sexual tension of the adventure of her being able to meet a guy day or night and have something happen fast, have an sexual adventure where she doesn't need to sit down and think, all right, is this guy boyfriend material? Do I want to introduce him to my parents? Do we follow the same political party? Are we compatible as life partners? That's not what people want to think about when they're starting to get involved, erotically involved with someone. That is the way that people think if they are trying to screen for a particular relationship type. And if I meet a girl who is very clearly like holding back from sex, let's say one, for me, if a girl doesn't sleep with me after the second date, I'm not going to continue. And that's not a rigid rule for everyone. It's just that time efficiency for me, I know that most girls will sleep with me on the first or second date. Anyone who's holding out because they're trying to manipulate the situation or just because, I mean, if they just feel uncomfortable, that's fine as well. But I'm looking for a girl who's, if she's attracted to me, wants to start something physical soon. Because in relation to this question, I can't give an honest appraisal to a girl. I can't tell her, listen, here's what our relationship is going to be before I've slept with her at least once, if not several times. Because sometimes you meet a girl and you think intellectually or emotionally that this person is really awesome and on paper they seem like they would be a great partner and then you sleep together and you just don't click. You just don't have the same kind of whatever sexual makeup and you find that it fizzles up, the eroticism fizzles. Then if I had said to her before, okay, you look like a girlfriend material and then I find out it's not going to work, then that's going to be much more disappointing than trying to figure it out by the process of sleeping together. On the other hand, I've had situations where I've met a girl and it's been cool and we've hung out and then we have sex and it's explosive and we have this fucking electric connection and then I'm like, cool, I definitely want to see this girl multiple times, whether or not I want her to be my girlfriend or just be a lover is another question. But until you started a physical relationship, how do you know what kind of relationship you're going to have? So for the guy who's asking this question, it's not unethical to start something and see where it goes. Girls are not so precious that they think that every time they sleep with a guy that he's definitely going to be their boyfriend and if they don't, that their hearts are shattered. Don't be so arrogant as to presume that just because a girl had sex with you that you're going to shatter her heart. Women have sex for all sorts of reasons. Sometimes they have sex for deep emotional reasons, sometimes they do it because they're bored, sometimes they do it because they're just horny, because they haven't been laid in a while, because they need distraction from their schoolwork, because they're trying to make a guy jealous, because they're rebelling against their parents, all sorts of reasons. And if you assume that women only have sex in order to exchange sex for relationships, then you are severely misguided. You don't understand women almost at all. You need to let that go. So don't hold judgment over women because of their choices in having sex with you and don't assume that because they have sex with you that they want to see you ever again. I had one one-night stand I remember many years ago where I met the girl in a bar, we went home, we had sex, and afterwards I sent her a message saying, thanks for the fun night. James Marshall available for late-night liaisons and erotic adventures Monday through Thursday, hope to see you soon. And she just wrote back saying, hey, sorry I didn't realize what your name was, but just to be honest I was after the one-off Easy Lay. And then I was just like, oh, she used me for sex. And that was in my early days of seduction and I kind of assumed that every woman that slept with me wanted to see me again and I was fitting her into my schedule. She didn't give a shit about me, she was like, cool, I'm going to fuck that dude today and I'm never going to see him again. Girls will do that and not just bad girls. In most girls' lives, they will have that experience some number of times and as I said, there are all sorts of levels of types of relationships. So you definitely have an amnesty. You can see a girl a couple of times and then, yes, then definitely sit down and go, all right, we'll look cool, we've seen each other a couple of times, I want to talk to you about what's going on for me and what I'm interested in because I don't want to mess you around and I don't want to assume what it is that you want. So I'm not sure where you're at with your dating goals right now, but just to be honest, here's where I'm at. And then that's where I would explain, cool. I do this often now because I have a girlfriend and we have an open deal and if I see another girl outside of that, I tell the other girl very quickly that I have a girlfriend and that I'm not in the market to finding a new girlfriend and that if she wants to hang out with me, it's going to be on a lover basis and if she wants to join me and my girlfriend, then that's also cool. But I'm very honest and clear about that and it saves a whole lot of mess and drama. I'm definitely advocating speaking the truth and saying what your situation is, but don't assume that you need to do that on the first date. The only time when I see this being a real issue is if during the dating process you've given the girl completely the wrong idea. So if you've gone on multiple attractive dates, particularly kind of formal dates, dinner dates, movie dates, where you are not being flirtatious, where you're talking a lot about your achievements and interests and future plans with the girl, if you are giving her the impression that you're looking for a girlfriend, that you are considering dating her in the long term, making promises or insinuations about what's going to happen long term, if you're not making physical moves on her, so you go on 2, 3, 4 dates and you barely kissed her or haven't really made any physical movements, or on the flip side, if you have tried to do that and she is putting up massive resistance or she's got very clear boundaries because she's culturally conservative or religious or she's decided, which sometimes girls do decide, that the next guy I date has got to be serious, it's got to be a serious thing, so I'm not going to get physical with him. Although, an interesting caveat on that is that sometimes when girls do that, when they decide, the next guy I go on some serious dates with, I need to get a boyfriend so I'm going to stop putting out, I'm not going to have sex with guys, I'm not going to do any of this fun stuff, I'm just going to focus on him and then she meets a guy like me or Liam or Travelbum or something who is clearly not that guy and is clearly not going to be put in that box and yet she's attracted to him and she's having fun, she may still fuck him or me or Liam, a guy like that and then not count it because she's like, well he doesn't count because he's just like one of those fuckboys that I can have sex with and then, so the interesting thing is that girls will sometimes be having crazy, wild, kinky sex with one guy and then the other guy, they won't even kiss him or they'll be putting on the high school barriers of no second base because they don't want to give that guy the wrong idea, they want to screen this guy into investing more and more so that when she does have sex with him, then she has him hooked. This is not a strategy that all women use all the time but it is certainly a thing that you can come across. So if you're in a situation where you're going on multiple dates with a girl and she's really making you work for it, paying money, spending lots of time chasing her, she's testing you constantly and testing to see how much you'll invest, I would be wary of that. There are ways to work against that and there's strategies to shut down a girl who is trying to test you way too hard, who is trying to make things protracted but in general if you're not very experienced with this, it's better if you want more casual sex or you want to get to sex fast and have a fun, sexual... life, then if girls are in that situation, that's the scenario when I wouldn't be trying to pursue that. If you have abundance in the sense that you can reach out and say hi to somebody, which is abundance, you can go and make something happen with strangers, then you don't need to deal with girls where it's going to be a whole lot of trouble. And that's something that I've done over the years. Initially, when I got into seduction, every lead I followed to the end. Every girl that came my way, I would keep going on dates no matter what, I would just hang here for a sec while the children all walk past. I used to do this when I was first starting out, when I started approaching girls, every girl I met, I'd be like, whoa, I've got this number, I'm going to follow this to the very bitter end. And I did end up getting in situations with girls where, because I was working pretty hard and I had some skills by this time, girls that were highly inappropriate for me to be with, I would gradually get into something. And then I did have some messy situations where it took three, four, five dates to get the girl into bed, and then I tried to explain what I did and didn't want, and then it got messy. So I found over time that I just started to, when I noticed that, okay, this girl is like, I tried to kiss her on the first date, she's like, no, like, okay, maybe I'll see her again because she just, maybe she wasn't comfortable, see her again. And then as I'm getting physical or flirting, I see that there's just a physical block there, and then I would just politely say, all right, listen, you know, to be honest, I need to, if I'm going to get to know someone, a big part of that is physical, a very sexual person, it seems like you're not quite ready for that with me, which I respect, and that's your personal decision, but I'm not going to, you know, I'm probably not going to hang out with you again unless that's something that you want to change. And then sometimes girls would just call me up on a Friday night or text me, and then they would have sex with me. So having those boundaries of being willing to walk away is really important at any time with a man. Like if you don't have any choice, if you're so invested in the one lead that you've got, then you're in a very powerless situation. Even if you're dating a girl that you really like, and you're thinking that it might move into something monogamous, I would suggest still seeing some girls at the same time until such a time as you both make a decision, right? That's another common thing that guys will often do is they start dating a girl, they see a future there, and so they shut down all of their options, and then they invest way too much in that girl. And very commonly, the girl is not doing that. Even if she is considering moving into a monogamous thing with you in the future, one of the harsh realities is that that is the time when girls are most likely to quickly fuck a bunch of guys or their ex-boyfriend or that alpha jock guy or the guy that is into kinky sex or that daddy dude. They're likely to do that more just before they get into a relationship because it's like the bachelorette party for the relationship. So be aware of that. It's better to, I would say, to keep dating some people even if you're leading into a relationship so that when you do decide to make a commitment, if that's what you want to do, that it's coming from a place of choice as opposed to a place of overinvestment and scarcity. So I'll wrap it up there. In conclusion, just going over the main points briefly once more. It is not necessary to bluntly put all your cards on the table before you've had sex with the girl. Primarily because you don't know what all your cards are yet. You just do not know what this relationship might turn into. It's presumptuous to try to tell the girl that early on. Also, it takes all the sexual tension and the fun out of it. Like if we're just like, okay, here's a, this is like a business deal. I'm like, here's exactly what I'm willing to do and exactly what I want you to do before we get into the trading of fucking bodily fluids. Yeah, it's not very fun. It's not very sexy. It's pretty much too formal. And thirdly, you're misunderstanding women's sexual agendas. Yes, sometimes girls are really screening for a boyfriend. Often they're just single and they're seeing what happens. If they meet a fun guy and they want to, and he asked them out on a date, they might go on a date and then one thing leads to another and they sleep with him. Okay. If that happens once or twice or three times, then she might go, okay, well I like this guy. Uh, he's good in bed. We had some fun. So what, what is this? And that's where I mean, okay, now it's important within, you know, the first week or so of this little, uh, pre-relationship for you to have the talk. And I've talked about the talk many times before, how to, how to explain this to a girl or put for you a position. I won't go into that now, but it is important then to communicate so that then everyone does understand. Okay. She's like, and she, maybe she's like, ah, okay, that's a pity. I was hoping to, I could see something with this guy. Oh well. Will I still see him? Yes or no? Yeah. She might have a minor level of like disappointment or what, what's kind of more likely to happen is if I've been clear and honest is that she might go, wow, that's awesome. Yeah. I could do a, I could do it like a casual thing. I'm so busy with study and work. I didn't necessarily want to have to deal with all of being a girlfriend stuff, but I like this guy. We have fun. We have good sex. I can see him once a week, once or twice a week. Cool. That seems like a good deal. If you're open to women being open to that, then that will be open to you. Does that make sense? If you're open to women being open to a situation like this, then they will open that situation to you. Right? It's when I only present, I'm either a boyfriend or I'm some like sleazy fuck boy, then she's going to go, I don't want necessarily either of those or I only want that one. But if you're like, well, I'm a pan-relationist, I'm a person who's into all sorts of types of relationships depending on who comes along and what time of my life and how things work out, then you can have all these different types of lovers in your life. It's not just boyfriend, serious boyfriend and sleazy one night stands. There's heaps of different other ways that you can have relationships. And once you open yourself to those mentally and start talking to girls about what they might possibly be into, then you will have far more choice, far more abundance and way more hot sex. This is James Marshall reporting from Prague, summer 2017. Now I'm going to go off and start some relationships."}
