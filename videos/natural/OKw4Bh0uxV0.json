It's me, Sasha, and my friend over here. That's me. I'm the friend. It's James, my friend. Hi. And we're usually not in the same city. We're bouncing around all over the world. We're usually on opposite sides of the planet. Finally, we're in the same city. And I said, let's get a cup of tea and do a little ramp. So the thing I wanted to rant about was, me and James, we've been friends for a really long time. And ever since the beginning, we recognized that we're cool dudes and we had skills. Well, cool dudes. Well, we were not as cool back then. We've gotten cooler over the years. And so what happened was, throughout our relationship, we always were kind of helping each other out in whatever way we could. It started off with James just crashing on my couch when we had a conference. He was staying far out of town. I had an apartment in town. And then James bought me breakfast. And that was the beginning of it. And then I was giving James business advice. And then I had an issue with a girl. And he gave me a girl. And then he had an issue with some other thing. And we've always just been there. Lending each other money. Lending each other girls. Helping each other out on workshops. Yeah. Helping each other on workshops. Like, pretty much all the way through. Pretty much, you know, just helping each other out. But the pattern that we keep seeing, and this is what our inside joke is about, is that we, even though we would never like go and like F anyone over, like screw somebody over, we would keep having people come into our lives who we would be like, oh, this guy's interesting. Okay, let's work with this guy. These kind of hustler types that are like, you know, charismatic, but a little bit dodgy, but they're pretty good at what they do. Charming, good looking. Yeah, yeah. So we're like, okay. You know the type, ladies. You know what we're talking about. And so it kept happening to us that even though we've been friends for many, many years and have complete trust pretty much, these guys come into our lives and we treat them with respect and give them a shot. And they'd end up fucking us over. And it's always fucking us over for like a few thousand bucks or like a camera or just a laptop, like something really stupid. A seven. Hey, don't put numbers on girls. But guys would, and it's so stupid in short term. It's like, so you get a little money, but then you don't get to have us in your life anymore. You don't get to be part of what we're building. And it's such a stupid, stupid, stupid thing to do, to get like a couple thousand bucks, but then never talk to me again or never talk to James again. It's fucking retarded. And then us like bitch about you to everyone we know, obviously. Yeah. And then everyone knows you're a fucking douchebag. That guy, he's an asshole. Yeah. It's terrible. Really charming. Don't give him any money. So, so I wanted to, I guess I wanted to rant for a couple of reasons about this topic. So the two, I think there's two or three main points here. The first point is don't underestimate the value and the power of having a bro who you can trust in the world. You know, it's so, it's such an amazing thing. Like I know no matter what happens, if I have some kind of fucking medical emergency and I'm in the hospital, I don't have my wallet. I can be like, call James. James can put up the 50K for my operation. Like whatever it is, he'll be annoyed. But like, like, like no matter what, people, people in life are worried about like, oh no, what like a lot of people won't go and they won't go start businesses. They won't go take chances. Cause they're like, oh, what if it doesn't work out? What if I end up, bro, whatever. People that are going out there, Germans are getting like 13 types of different life insurance. My insurance says all my friends love me and trust me. And most of them are rich because I help them get rich. That's my insurance. So if I go broke, I'm calling James. I'm calling John Keegan. I got another five, six guys who are loaded because I was like, buy Bitcoin now. You should probably buy that. Don't do that. That's what I said. He didn't. Well, you're still doing all right though. You're doing all right. Yeah. Yeah. But I have other people who really, who really did. There is a Chinese man with a huge trolley walking at us with a purpose like he's not going to stop. No, he's not going to stop. We can, we can stand over here. So, so, so, so, so the, so the one, so the one point of this, there's a, there's a real power to, to, to, to having really long-term relationship built on trust and mutual benefit. That's obvious. Can I talk about that? Yeah. You talk about that too. I'm ranting. Yeah. You just went on a speed rant. I like ranting. What's in that tea? It's tea. I think one of the, one of the archetypes you guys are exposed to is the idea of the kind of four hour work week, digital nomad guy who's out in the, he's living in Thailand, he's working from a laptop, he's making 3k a week, just doing a bit of this, you know, he's there, he's optimizing his nutrients, he's working out in just the right way and so on and so on, right? And it's this hyper individualist success story. And I, to be, to be honest, I don't know many guys who've really done it that way. Like we are individualists and we're success stories. But I didn't do it alone. Definitely not. I leapfrogged over and, and then like catapulted up with me and bootstrapped along with me and hustled alongside many different guys mostly and some girls along the way. And that vastly accelerated my pace and their pace, right? So one of the things I've learned, even if you want to be the most kind of Machiavellian self-interested person, the slash and burn, you know, I take what I can and then I leave or I'm just going to do it all myself is not the most effective way. The most effective way to get what you want is to make sure everyone around you is getting what they want, which means you need to build long-term bonds of trust and reciprocal trade. And in that way, you build a crew where every advancement from every, from any one of the members advances all of the members, right? So that's something that we're doing all the time. One of us makes a network somewhere. Who knows what it is? It's a spiritual one. It's a business one. It's an investment opportunity and then brings it back to all the other people that you trust, your tribal unit, which is for us, I think it's really like six to 10 guys that are in different pods around the world and then there's some kind of attach on guys that pop in and out and or there's another group that we might go in as a guest into more like a, you know, just to fact find or to make a network or so on. But we have this inner circle of people that we trust because we've proven over and over again that we can trust each other and we like each other as well. And as a result, every time anyone benefits, everyone else does as well. It's a multiplier. It seems really, really obvious. You know what I mean? Because when you're one of the guys who's just like, you know, you take advantage of someone here and you F them over here. You don't, you don't, you don't build power over time, right? You might, you know, you get a little bit something happening here and there, but like it doesn't work. Like it's, it's, it doesn't build on itself. It's like, it's like the difference between you'll read about this in, you know, spiritual textbooks and whatever. But the concept is like, if you're focused on love, love and other people who are also on the path of love and cooperation, it grows, right? And so when people are cooperating, they're able to create bigger and better, better, better things. But when you're coming from a place of fear, if you're totally in a state of fear, you don't, yeah, and selfishness, you don't trust anyone else. So it doesn't really, you're totally off and cut off on your own. So, so, you know, they can't trust you. Well, of course you can't trust anyone. You can't, no one can trust you. You can't trust anyone. So, so it doesn't really make sense in the longterm as well. So it's really, really obvious, but just, you know, worth, worth saying. But I think one thing that we can give you guys here that'll save you some heartache and time is, firstly, I would say cultivate the, the idea of being, you know, upfront, straightforward, honest and not fucking people over for short-term benefit. That's, that's a given. But don't operate from the position thinking that everyone else thinks like that. And that's, I think we're- I fucked that up many times. Yes, that's true. Because I'm a great person. Everyone's a great person. Well, it's, it's not even about being a great person. It's like that we operate in a certain way and, and it makes sense. And so, you know, when, when we've had guys, we brought them into our inner circle as coaches usually, or, you know, someone who's working the back end and they get access to bank accounts or to clients or whatever over time because they need to, to be trusted to do the work. And from my position, I'm like, I would never fuck someone over stupidly for like a few thousand dollars when that person is a close friend and I can see that our collaboration over the next five years is going to make me a million, right? Like, even if I'm just evil, I would be like, well, that would be a dumb move. So then I, I think, well, everyone else obviously realizes that. And therefore, they wouldn't fuck me over for a stupid thing in the short term, but people do because they're dumb or because they're, they're selfish or fearful or short-sighted or whatever. And so you need to be aware. I see. Milliock City, what the fuck? That people will act within their own self-interest in their own particular way. And so one thing I've now learned to do is when I bring someone into my organization or my friendship group, I watch them carefully for a year. And yeah, people are like, oh shit, really? I'm like, yeah, I do. I watch your behavior. I watch, I look how you treat people who are not in the organization, how you treat women, how you treat your money. Are you reckless with it? Do you ever brag or talk about times when you fuck someone over? And it wasn't you guys. I would never do that to you. But that guy, you know, and then I scribed him out of a couple of bucks. That wasn't a Jewish racist. It wasn't. That was just me being a guy who likes money, money. Not, that's just any guy, any guy at all. Anyway, the point being is I watch the way they interact with all levels. And then I give them, give them just a little opportunities to fuck me over in small ways and see how they do. That's right. Simple shit. Very, very, I hate to call it, but a little bit, a little bit Machiavellian. But good, giving someone a little rope just to see if they hang themselves. That's very sneaky. Well, it's like, you know, did you give me the change from that thing? I gave you the 50 bucks. I was going to give you that $2 later. I know, and you didn't. And now I'm starting to think, Sasha, it's starting to move. It's a similar concept to, it's a similar concept to, you know, if you're going on a date with somebody, right? And certainly if a girl is going on a date with you, she's going to be watching and you should be watching her. How do you treat the waiter? How do you treat everybody? You know, how do you treat the guy you're getting a bottle of water from? You know, if you treat him like he's nobody, then you're kind of a dick. And she knows you're just pretending to be nice. So very, very interesting. So this is the really big thing. When people come into your life, it's to really, really take your time. And like one, take your time and watch their behavior. But also, and I'm going to stop with this. This is really profound. This is something that I realized that really changed my life. Like a lot of people were able to get to me and I trusted them. And the reason I gave them a shot was good because they were appealing to my ego. They were like, Sasha, you're so great. We love you so much. Really want to work with you. And I was like, whoa, this guy, this guy thinks I'm awesome. So therefore he's trustworthy because he gets me, which is retarded. They were just getting to me through my ego. So you really got to look at it. If somebody really coming from a place if they really want to build something with you and they really appreciate you genuinely and they're coming from the heart's place, like they really, you know what I'm saying? Or are they coming from a more of like, oh, like if I do this and I can do that. So how are they actually getting into your circle or coming into your life? And so now I'm very conscious because again, I've gone through a lot of development myself. Have some tea. What place are they coming from? And what's their level of consciousness? So I really want to see where someone is at. And if someone's coming from high level, they really want to create good in the world. They're really coming from a higher level. Then I'm interested in dealing with them. But if someone's really coming from a lower place and all they're really interested in is a benefit for themselves, or they only want money or the only one, then I'm just not interested because it's just not going to work. That's not the place I'm in. So you really got to see where is somebody coming from before you decide to have a relationship. And at this point, if someone isn't coming from a higher level, I'm not interested in doing business with them. I'm not interested in dating them. None of these things. I'd rather have fewer people in my life, but really quality people who are doing amazing stuff. And lots of people where I'm kind of like looking at my bag. I'm not sure about this guy. And so I'm very, very picky who I have in my life now, more so than ever before. Yeah. True. Yeah, me too, actually. I've become much more ruthless. But I think the other thing that I've learned is there is a certain peace in knowing that some people are a bit of a dick in some way. And it means that you can actually love them and bring them into your life in certain ways. So whereas in the past, I would have a guy who was like a great, he was a great seducer, he was a cool friend, he would get a lot of potential. And I wanted to, you know, help him out and get him blah, blah, blah. And the guy just didn't turn up to work or was, or fuck students around or was loose with money or whatever. And so I'd get, I'd get burnt and then get hurt and, you know, disappointed. Now, it's like, I see that. Okay, cool. Judging from the way this person operates, I can see that they're charming, fun, but I shouldn't lend them any money or I shouldn't employ them or I shouldn't leave them alone with my girl. And so I just don't do those things. And then I keep those people cool. That's a guy that's really fun to hang out with or he's really interesting. And, you know, he's great to go, or fucking, I don't know, we're on some mission together, but don't get involved in the business world. And in that way, then you don't get super disappointed. It means you can be, you can interact with people who have, like different sets of morals to yours. I don't think it's a good idea to be hanging around people who are, you know. That's a funny way to put it. You can hang with people who are morally challenged once in a while, just to, but what James is trying to say, and this simple expression for this, which I've heard before is, know your drinking buddies from your actual buddies. You know, people you go drinking with, have a little party, you can't trust those guys. You wouldn't call those guys if you were in an emergency situation or if you really needed somebody to, whatever. They might be at your wake. Yeah, yeah, maybe you're awake because there's free food. Yeah, but that's what it is really. And so know who is who, but at this point for me personally, I was like that for a long time, but now I'm just like past it. I'm like, no, no, if I don't really, really, because I just don't have the time. If you're really not someone I really trust and really want to spend serious time with, I'm not really that interested, but that's just me. Maybe another thing that's useful for the guys out there, because there's probably a lot of young guys who want to get involved in like a cool social circle or a bunch of entrepreneurs or, you know, seducer dudes or people who are go-getters. And you can do it, I think, in two ways. The way that we did it was we built it from scratch, right? I mean, we started out old school. Let's go through this prison yard. Anyway, so yeah, go and build your own social circle. And that starts with one other person. It started for us with our first wingman. And then, you know, you try different people out and you start navigating in different directions. Maybe you'd collaborate on some project. Don't sign on the dotted line into a partnership with a friend when you have no idea about business. Don't do that. If you're going to do business shit, start it alone. You can do collaborations. We did a lot of collaborations. We didn't like go into business together. That would have killed us. So there's that way. But then the other way is what a lot of the guys who came in under us did is to social climb on somebody else's matrix. And that's where we have guys like, you know, Liam or Alex or, you know, some of your younger guys who came in as maybe interns or students or something. And then eventually became trusted members of the crew and got all the benefits of the grandfathers. He'd gone out and done all the hard work. Back in my day, we're like 80 years old, Keegan's only 25. So that is a smart way to do it, to jump in on somebody else's thing. However, my piece of advice here is to understand that if you want to approach mentors or people who are higher up a social hierarchy than you, they have, you know, guys who are super connected in the social scene, they don't just want more dudes hanging around, just a random other dick getting in their way, or, you know, people want to come and join our cruise, I'm bragging about our cruise, it's so cool, people want to be part of them, and the only way you get in is by being a weirdo who's interesting, and by offering something. So, you know, a guy like Alex, who's now a coach, for me, came in originally as an unpaid intern, offered heaps of value, was, you know, humble and fun and offered a lot personally and helped and made my life easier, so of course, I want him to hang around more, he becomes a buddy over time, and then, before you know it, he's living the life that took me 10 years to build. Alright, so, know that if you approach mentors, don't, we get these emails all the time, we're due to just like, there's this chick, and how do I get it, or, I want to work with you guys, so when do I start, this kind of thing, and, are you joking? So if you approach any group like that, you're just going to get shot down, don't have the entitlement that is unearned, you can have audacity, go and, you know, go and be cheeky and say, hey, look, I'm here, can I jump the queue if I buy your beer, because they'll be like, yeah, fuck it, I'll have a beer. People are easy to win over, you just flatter them, get them coffee and drugs and girls and, you know, a bit of whatever it is that they want, and they'll love you, cheese, cheese for him. Cheese works too. A nice piece of cheese. A nice piece of cheese. If a guy came up to you right now with a nice camembert and was like, dude, do you want the cheese, and you're like, yeah, I'd sit down and talk to him. Some nice Dutch cheese, yeah. I'd be friends with you. Anyway, that's a little rant on how to approach mentors, so what do you want to know? Oh, so you put a bonus in, we were talking about loyalty and friends, but you put in a little bonus, which is nice, I take a bonus. But really, that's it, I just wanted to rant about having good male friends, and how to look out for the right people, and how to have the right people in your life, and don't let people appeal to your ego, and don't make friends with people for the wrong reasons. It should be for the right reasons, and to be honest, if you can have two or three real, long-term, really good friends that you can really trust in life, I think you're doing better than most. I think if you have one, you might be doing better than most. They're very valuable. Very valuable. One other thing is, though, I think there is a phase, like, when we're looking at the beginning phases and all that, I think everyone almost inevitably had to do a devil's bargain. You think about early stages of business, and there's some dodgy dude that you meet at a lair meeting, and he wants, you did that, I remember you doing deals with some dodgy dudes that we'd meet at lair meetings. There's always been a couple dodgy dudes, yeah. And, you know, back in the day, the only guy I knew who made websites was also schizophrenic, so I kind of had, alright, he was cheap, and he was, and it did end up bad, he did end up cooking meth in my kitchen. But those were the sort of things when I looked, like, even thinking about Grant, like the guy I started the business with, if we hadn't have done that together, none of this would have happened. None of this would have happened, yeah. It's part of the adventure. Right. But you can cut out a lot of the bad stuff by just being really careful who you're dealing with. But I mean, not paranoid, and also, like, I think sometimes you have to take, especially when you're young, you take those risks, you get fucked a bit, you know, you learn something from it, maybe you made some money or contacts. That's another great point. If you do have an experience that's, like, bad and you get effed over or whatever, learn the lessons, it's okay, it's part of your story arc, you know. It would be a really boring story if it was like, yes, I was just successful the whole time. Everything was perfect. No one has that story. I got kidnapped by jewel thieves in India. I lost everything. That's right. Great story. I've been laid so many times in that story. Great story. I always tell it, the girls love it. Anyway. I've been a millionaire twice and lost it. It's great. And the next time the cryptominer goes up and down, it'll be three times. It'll be awesome. Oh my God. So it's fine. So you don't get paranoid and all, like, you know. That's right. Yeah, and all that shit. Yeah, don't be paranoid. Don't be paranoid. But just be conscious in who you want to attract and who you want to keep around in your life. And I know it's cliche and everyone always says it, but really, the quality of your life. Be yourself. No, the quality of your life really is summed up by the people who are around you. That's 100% true. So be careful and make smart choices. And I think that's it. 20 minutes. That's a long rant, James. That's a big rant. We should have charged for that. So I love you guys. I'll put in lots of links below this video for anything that we're doing that's exciting. I love you all and see you later. Coming to you in a minute. Woo! Well, that seems like a lifetime ago. Back when you could just wander around the streets of New York with your buddy and your arms slung around each other, coughing on people, saying hi to girls. Those were the days. And also back in the day when I didn't like cats. I know someone's like, you're a hypocrite, James. You did a video where you hated cats. I know, but I was lonely and this one turned up and it's pretty nice. It just follows me around. So the point of this video was looking at loyalty between men, basically. It's a funny thing that I've noticed that women can be good friends with another woman that they don't trust at all. They just know she's a snaky bitch and that she would fuck their boyfriend if she had half a chance, but they'll still hang out with her. Men tend to not be like that so much. We have to trust our brothers and our core tribal unit. We have to be able to trust them with women, with money, with our confidences, with our secrets, whatever it is that we need secured. And if you dick someone over in that scenario, you try and take their money or take their girl or talk about them behind their back, then they won't be friends with you anymore. Lifestyle design is not just about networking. It's not just about doing deals with people or hiring outsourced personal assistants so that you can just do this all from your own bubble. It's about people. It's about tribes. And that's what I'm developing in the Lifestyle Design Academy, which is live right now. You can enroll for it immediately now and only for a few more days because once the launch finishes, I'll be shutting the doors permanently and I'll be moving on to teaching the guys in the course. This is a live course. Every single week, I get on a live lecture series with the guys in the group. We work through one of the modules of Lifestyle Design. We chat about it. I set missions. You can ask questions, get feedback, get encouragement. And so week by week, what I'm aiming to do is to help you develop first to do a stock take and to do an autopsy essentially on your life to see where you're at right now. This enforced mini retirement that we all have because of Corona gives you an opportunity to actually to do an analysis and go, okay, this is what I got. This is right now. You're getting the retirement fund based on the life that you led in the previous years, financially, socially, and so on. And that's what you have now is all you've got. Now, I'm not here to blame anybody or to say, oh, well, you should have done something before. It's just like, okay, let's look at the cold hard reality of where you currently stand. Is it good enough? Probably not. So, if you want to improve it, that's exactly what I'm going to help you do on the Lifestyle Design Academy. Week by week, missions, accountability groups, encouragement, feedback, no bullshit coaching. I'm not there to just make you feel good. I'm going to challenge you if you don't have a clear idea on a type of life that you'd like to lead that's not the one you're leading now, don't sign up. I don't want anyone to sign up who's like, hey, I'm just like, can you just make my life better? No, you need to have some vision, some plan. Even if it's a bit vague and if it's just like chicks and like skateboarding and Guatemala, if that's your kind of idea and that's as much as you've got, I can work with that. We can work with that. I can't work with apathy. I can't work with mediocre thinking. I want out of the box thinkers. I want people who want to live the most exceptional version of their life that is possible because I know it's possible. I've done it myself. I've helped my crew do it and I've helped thousands of men around the world do it. So, if you're interested, click the link below, all the details on the LDA which is open for enrollments right now. So, join me. Thank you."}
