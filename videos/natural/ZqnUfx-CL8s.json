Building your own online business from scratch, just you, alone, because that's the only way you're going to get the lifestyle, I think is a bit of a myth. When I was first traveling, I had no sense of, I wasn't interested in trying to start a business or particularly network, I was trying to explore my spirituality and see beautiful places and go to places that most people didn't go. But since Tim Ferriss' book came out, I would say, there is this archetype that exists now of the traveler who leverages currencies, who works remotely, who earns, hopefully, Western money and then is able to get a better lifestyle in a place which is cheaper and so on, which is a cool archetype and it has inspired a whole generation. But the thing that I noticed when reading that and from then being one of those people and hanging out with a lot of those people is the thing that's missing there is the people skills. The 4-Hour Workweek gives you the idea that you do all of that yourself, like everything is done, it's all completely individualist, you're not collaborating, you're just like, okay, I'm going to set up my business where I just go do that for 10 minutes a day and then it makes money and then I'm going to go and get a tango lesson. So it is hyper-individualist, but you didn't do it that way and neither did I, really. Why did you bother reaching out and trying to get involved in a team as opposed to trying to do it all yourself? I just knew that I couldn't even figure it out myself, like no chance. Especially in terms of seduction and skills with women and becoming a better communicator in that regard, I wouldn't have even have known where to start. I did my little attempts talking to girls on the street in Vienna and it was rough and kind of depressing. So I knew instantly, okay, am I going to desperately try myself for 10 years or am I going to contact somebody who did it for the last 20 years and teaches it to other people and is obviously one of the top people in the world at it. Yeah, it is often extremely difficult to do it all yourself and as you said, I mean, why bother trying to do it all yourself when you can leapfrog on top of or collaborate with people who have either taken some of the journey for you or who have specific skills that you don't have. And the fact that you offered something that was valuable to me at that time is the reason, right? It's the reason that I welcomed you on board because I, and I'm not trying to say that I'm the most important person, but it's like, okay, there's a lot of people interested in working with me or hanging out with me because of my skills and because of my hair, sponsored by Notteby, that I have to say no or ignore most requests because I can't deal with everybody and the people that are going to get through with me, and this means with anyone, it's like people that are going to get through to have a chance to join a high-value social circle or some kind of dynamic workplace, the people that offer solutions to a problem that the boss has, for example. It is a massive accelerator to work in a company or to work with other people first and to get input that way in certain areas versus trying to do it all yourself. If I would have to learn about seduction and online marketing and how sales funnels work and how sales calls work, right, and how female psychology works and so on, if I had to learn it all by myself, it would have been firstly not as fun and I would have to be insanely motivated and disciplined to get that level of knowledge by myself and yeah, just like way slower. So, there is definitely a big, because there's this notion of work yourself and your own company and all from your laptop, but it's actually not that efficient. Like, sure, some people figure it out, you know, or they join some other support group online, but there is definitely a huge benefit of having people around you who can support you in that way. Yeah, because you don't need to be your own boss in order to live the nomad or this lifestyle. Like, the way you described it, like, what if you'd had to do X, Y and Z all yourself, in a way that's what I had to do, right? Like, the first five years of this company, which was also at the same time as me really consolidating my seduction skills and trying to figure out how to start a business, like, everything moved extremely slowly for the first five plus years as I was very, you know, I wasn't a businessman, I was an artist who, like, picked out women and then learned how to coach that and then learned how, very slowly, how to build a business and how to market and, you know, made lots of mistakes and lost lots of money and it took a long time to ramp up and then it started reaching certain tipping points where my knowledge increased, but more importantly, I think, was that, you know, that I started bringing in different specialists, whether it was in marketing or... Actually, meeting Sasha was the first big jump in my business because he was just ahead in YouTube, he understood more about YouTube and he knew about simple things like having a mailing, an automated mailing list, which I was like, oh, you don't need to write an email to everybody. So, it was like, you know, his business was ahead of mine at the time and then through those other social slash collaborative networks as I started reaching out and meeting different guys in the scene and then seeing what their business was doing and then asking them personally for favours and then swapping favours, meant that suddenly things went from, like, very slow, difficult growth to more or less doubling every single year for the next five years after that. So, yeah, the whole idea of, like, building your own online business from scratch, just you alone, because that's the only way you're going to get the lifestyle, I think is a bit of a myth. What is your process for... Okay, you, like, I know recently you went to... I mean, you choose one of the locations that you've been to, but you very specifically looked for opportunities to socialise, you've thrown parties or you've brought value to parties, like, you know, you've done a lot of stuff which is actually... It wasn't just happening randomly, right? It wasn't just because you're a guy who likes to go out and party, like, you were quite strategic about that. Maybe talk a bit about that, about how setting up very rapidly, building really awesome social worlds in a new space. What do you do to do that? Yeah, absolutely. I think a big factor is to not start out alone, right? Because, yes, I do travel a lot and I do build new things all the time and I create new bases, but I'm never totally alone, right? There's always one guy or two guys coming with me, you know, either it's Liam and then if I compare coming totally by myself to Bali versus with two buddies already who have the same mindset and then we could literally on the third day, you know, already create a house party because on the second day we would have gone out and each guy talks to five people and, you know, then we have a little group thing and then within a week or two you could have... You create a party where 25 people show up, you know, because it just snowballs. Versus if you're totally alone, it takes, you know, much, much longer. So, obviously having a circle of people who are like-minded and who are also ready to take certain risks, you know, who say yes to things like, hey, let's spend the winter in Bali, right? And who have their life set up in a way that allows to them, you know, because not everybody can just fuck off for two months, right? People have offices and they have bosses and they need to plan in their holidays six months in advance and whatever. So, you know, obviously it's amazing to build a circle like that. Who has that? But yeah, that makes it much, much, much easier. So, yeah."}
