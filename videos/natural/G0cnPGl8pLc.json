So that as the tide of our experience and skills rises, so does everyone within the group. Up until now I've been talking about gatekeepers in terms of, there's an established social circle and you're trying to insert yourself into it in some way. Now this is a skill that is useful and necessary for some guys and for many guys at some point in their life. But when I look at it, most of my main social crews were not entered by me, they were built by me. And of course other people entered them, so that's a thing as well. But if you want to have the most control, especially longer term, if you want to be able to kind of steer the direction of what you want a social group to do, in terms of lifestyle design, it's usually better to be part of the building of it from the early stages. Whether or not you're the founder or you're the first partner or you're one of the early guys that comes into an unfolding social scene, of course this means we have to build things from scratch and we have to put in a lot of effort, but this is the one that is probably going to yield more over the longer term. And if you've put together a good crew, then this is more likely to be your tribe that really has your back, that has multiple year legacy and loyalty. And when I look back over all of the kind of groups that I started, when I look back at house parties in high school, at playing in a band, at early forms of TNL and the POAs that I was hanging out with and those social crews that I was rolling with, we didn't all come fully formed as expert seducers, expert ladies and social men and seductive economics freaking madmen. No, we all were dorks or shy or a bit socially incompetent or totally broke or many other things that were not the best that we could be. And that's okay, because if the group is led overall by a desire for growth and change and you're able to work cohesively together to be encouraging and commiserating, to be able to tell the guy, you're so money and to be able to get him out of, out of, uh, funks. Right? Cause like I remember those days, early days of going out with my initial wingman was that it was really hit and miss in terms of our state and our mood. Like you'd go out and we'd be sort of talking each other up and then, and then I just knew that I wasn't going to be the one to do it. But today this guy's got the balls and he's like, fuck it. He's going over and talking to girls. And then I go in and I wing him and another, another night I'm like, okay, I'm in it. I'm doing this thing tonight. And I go and I become the spearhead and he becomes the shaft. And we lift each other's skill levels by encouraging each other and training each other, pushing each other, uh, backing each other up when we're feeling down and so on. So that as the tide of our, of our experience and skills rises, so does everyone within the group. So most of my, when I look back on all of my major groups, we have transformed a bunch of real like American movie nerds, like Goonies level nerds. Does it? And that's a really old movie. No one knows Goonies anymore. Right? Goonies. Come on. Everyone knows Goonies. I've given up. I've given up on, on the, on all generations after the nineties. I just have sex with them. I don't understand anything else about them. So yeah, this is, this is what you want to be building with your, with your lifestyle design crews versus the top down, uh, dominance hierarchy where the power player keeps everyone stunted because it, it's within their interest to keep you stunted because then they get the thing they want and they don't have to be challenged or have their boundaries pushed and everyone slots in below them. We talked about that before. So yeah, like understanding how to maneuver between gatekeepers is, is, is important. But what I do mostly these days is like I build, I built social, social worlds to the point where they have a reputation of themselves so that if I want to gatekeep into a new world now, I don't, I don't usually need to do the, find the first gatekeeper, find the three degrees of separation and work my way up stage by stage because I have some clout in my world. Uh, I can theoretically just go ahead and contact someone on the other side, right? So in anyone in my industry, I can contact, I can call up Tyler from RSD and he'll pick up the phone. And what we talk about, I don't know, but if I want to, we can, we can have that conversation or anyone else in my, in my industry, uh, anyone else that runs parties and travels with girls and that kind of thing, I can, I could step into that kind of zone. Anyone else that is a, uh, a known quantity is a spiritual movement, sexuality, whatever kind of teacher or, or seen leader I could, I could approach directly those people and probably get good results too. Right? So if, if we have clout and reputation of some sort, or we have other people being emissaries for us talking about us, which Liam is an excellent at that, he's often, whenever he meets a guy, a wealthy guy, he finds out about what their dating situation is. If he finds out that sexually they, they want to improve or they're trying to get better with, and they're interested in kink or something, then he immediately brings me up and creates this, uh, story about this mysterious guy who can teach you how to fuck for hours and also lives on a farm in Portugal and does all these other crazy things and sets the scene for why this person might be curious to meet me. So over the longer term, you want to be looking at that in terms of, yeah, just in trying to insert yourself into a very established crew. Okay. It can be done. Sometimes you can't be fixated on any given group. However, the, the way that is longer term, you'll be able to create more social retirement or, or seductive economic, economics currencies to trade on is by building your own or being part of the startup version of this and knowing that, okay, you're not fully formed and you guys still need to figure your shit out, but that's, that's part of the process and that's kind of fun when you look back on it, which means that eventually you can build a social circle, then offshoots of that social circle can start breeding in, in another place, right? Which means that, and, and ideally multiple other social scenes start kind of spawning out of your initial social scene, which means you then have basically rights to connect to all of those other social scenes as well, right? I know that if I wanted to write a track and get some music done, then I would contact Harry, who was part, who joined my scene in Budapest, who now I can see is built a cool scene of producers and musicians and so on. And I'd say, Hey dude, I need to, I need a producer to help put together this track called Back on the Boat. And I'd be able to get that moving, right? Or many, many other multiple degree of separations from me, social groups, which partially I started or hooked people up or encouraged at some point, and then they went off and built their own sub tribes or the tribes that evolved out of that. And then I still have contact with those and I can move in and out of their social scenes and they can move in and out of mine. Okay. So Malcolm's asking when you start a crew from scratch, I'll just paraphrase, usually it's happening in one city or location. How can I make sure that the scene or crew I build is international or more mobile than initially perceived? Well, you can't necessarily, unless that's been kind of built in from the beginning. The way I looked at it was, I don't think I planned it so meticulously, but I was building things with people who had certain lifestyle goals and possibilities, right? So if I'm trying to do it with a couple of guys who've got two small children and, you know, have to look after them every day, then maybe that's not realistic for them to be internationally traveling. It's more that I was just hooking up with different guys and girls who were adventurers to whom if one or other of us said, Hey, do you want to like fucking go on a mission to Southeast Asia and do X? That someone would be like, yes, I'd love to, whether or not I can right now with finances and so on. Maybe I can, maybe I can't, but those type of people want to go on ventures. It also relates back to your partner. So we talked about this last week that usually within any social core, there is a main duo and that was how I ran things a lot, where it was like me and my main duo, whether it was me and Sasha, me and Liam, me and Grant or whichever partner it was, we knew we were going to do the thing, right? So we committed to each other early on that we're going to, well, whatever the project was with me and Sasha, the commitment was let's travel together and run each other's workshops, make each other money and have cool adventures. Cool. All right, well, let's go here. Let's go here. Let's go here. Let's do that. For others, it was like we're committing to building a musical project together and we want to create a CD, a CD, back when that was a thing, and we want to travel. So we're going to tour. So you, me and this core bunch, we'll figure it out. And then if the bass players can't come, we'll replace the bass player or the horn players will get stand-ins if we need it. So yeah, it's definitely, if you can have a main collaborator to whom the mission is paramount, then other people can plug in and out of that as needed. So maybe you do have your core kind of crew back in your main city and if you want to branch out nationally, internationally, then you and your partner or you and whoever is willing to start doing this goes out or if needed, you go out and do it alone. I've done that multiple times. TNL existed in Australia for a number of years and the first year it went international was me just going by myself around Europe and going and doing a bunch of speeches for little lair groups and selling guys on like $500 weekends when I was there and meeting up with guys and hanging out with them and winging with them. And it was like, okay, cool. I was the spearhead that went out and did the pioneering work and made a few connections and tested the market a little bit in Europe and saw that that could work. And then I came back next year with a crew of people where I was like, all right, let's go and invade properly. Now I've done the scouting mission. So yeah, you don't want to be in a situation where you can only do it if you have your full crew moving with you. Sometimes you have to be the emissary or the spearhead or the pioneer going by yourself. And sometimes that means starting a new sub version of the group by yourself, which is what I did also in Europe. The first year, that was that same first year when I spent on, maybe it was the next one when I spent the summer in Budapest and I got, it was like, all right, I'm renting my own place. I found a girl and I had my first regular girl. I got a couple of clients in and then friends came and visited throughout the year. And then a few guys that eventually did move over from Australia came and saw what was going on. And then, okay, then we moved it up a level the following year. An alternative to trying to build your own social circle all from scratch is to just take advantage of mine. For the last 12 to 15 years, I've been traveling the world, making incredible networks with elite aid players in all areas of lifestyle design, including sexuality, spirituality, finances, fitness, you name it. We have specialists in this area helping out with the Lifestyle Design Academy, which is coming out very soon on the 9th of April. I'm relaunching this program. It's the most popular ever online program that I've ever taught with hundreds of guys all around the world who are super motivated to network, build tribes, and create epic lifestyles. So if you'd like a sneak peek inside the LDA, you can click the link in the description. Get a free video right now and stay tuned for the launch coming 9th of April. See you in the next video. "}
