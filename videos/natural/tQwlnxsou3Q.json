I imagine especially for a younger woman. So my question is what is the key to relaxing her fear? Well it's showing her that you understand the effect that you're having. So the reason why if someone comes up to you on the street and goes, hey man, how you going? Hi Joe. Where are you? What are you doing now? You feel a bit uncomfortable with that because you think that he doesn't know that this is a weird thing to do. A crazy person is dangerous because they don't know they're crazy. They're like, I'm just, this is how things are, right? This is like a smacky from Melbourne. This is, hey man, how you going? Got anything I've got, give me? Yeah that's scary. So if someone came up to you and said, well, I'm in a really crazy mood today, man, I'm just fucking feeling weird. So how are you feeling? You would be better. Not necessarily great, but better because that guy recognizes the effect he's having on you. So one like simple, very practical tool that we use is pre-framing or acknowledging the situation. And this requires us to watch the effect we're having. That's why Liam will talk about this in his speech. We tend to use split timing in approaching. We don't just go up and go, hey, blah, blah, blah, blah, and say all this stuff. I will tend to go up and say, excuse me, and then wait for a second and see what the response is. So then if she responds with fear or looking at me awkwardly or any of these expressions, I have to be self-aware enough to be able to be present to go, okay, yeah, I'm having an effect on her. And she's not going, hi, I'm ready to chat. If I just keep steamrolling past that, like ignoring, okay, she doesn't like it, but I'll just keep going and hope eventually she joins me on this, then probably it won't happen. But if I'd say something and she gives me this weird look and I said, does this not happen very often to you, or are you a little bit shy, or this is because I'm a hairy man from another country talking to you, right, okay, I'm acknowledging her fear. I'm just calling it out and showing, I get how you're feeling right now. And this is not just about the opening, right? I use that kind of strategy all throughout, actually all throughout my relationships with women, but particularly in the courtship phases. Okay, we're on the doorstep, I've got a good example actually. So I was on a date with a girl some years ago and it went pretty well and we got, and then she, I said, I'll walk you home and we got back to her doorstep. And I said, so do you want to invite me upstairs? And she said, I probably, probably shouldn't. She didn't say absolutely not. She said, I probably shouldn't. And in that moment, I felt like I could guess what was going on for her, okay, because the decision to take a man upstairs is dangerous always. And even if it's not about her physical danger, she may be thinking, well, I don't know, like maybe if we get in bed and we're making out and I decide I don't want to anymore, then what do I do? Or if we do have sex and it's bad, how do I get rid of him? And all of these other things. So I said simply this, well, I can come up for a cup of tea and you can kick me out whenever you want. And she went, oh, okay, cool, let's go, right? It was just me acknowledging, understanding that what was her issue there was like, I don't know how I can control this situation once he gets inside. But now because I've said, I get it, like, you know, being a stranger in your house, you may want to end that at some point. And then, of course, that relaxes her tension and then she doesn't want to kick me out. Okay, so there's all these ways that not just in the opening, but all these steps of points, particularly the point where a girl needs to make a decision of allowing this to escalate, right? Which is the reason why when you ask for a number, often that's the point where the girl's like, oh, okay, that was cool chatting, but now I'm going to give him my phone number and then he may not. Okay, so what have I done in that past in that situation? Say how I'll grab your number and she's like, oh, I don't know, no, I don't, I shouldn't. Or I don't give my number to strangers. And sometimes I've said things like, I can kind of understand that you've probably given your number to a guy before and he's texted you 30 times and you have to delete, you have to block his number, right? Or change your number. And then the girl goes, oh, yeah, because every girl's had that. She's had some guy who's just got a Facebook or something and then just hassled her 50 times. And because you're a complete stranger, she doesn't know anything about you aside from what you've shared. And she has no reference experiences of the people you know. That's why often another reason why girls date within their immediate or extended social circles is because they can do some research and go, okay, probably hasn't killed any women because no one told me, nobody has reported that. Okay, he's socially calibrated enough to have some friends that I know of and therefore he must be okay, right? So in this way where I call out, I get what your issue might be. However, I don't always do this. Don't think every time you're like, so I'll get your number and she's like, I know there was a guy who did this something. Sometimes just the girls has to think about it and or she just goes, yeah, cool. And she's open and she's ready to engage. But be aware of this. This is where your external awareness, which is an extension of your internal awareness, becomes such a powerful tool. This is what allows you to be turn this into an art form as opposed to a series of like structured lines that you say one after the other. That help? Cool."}
