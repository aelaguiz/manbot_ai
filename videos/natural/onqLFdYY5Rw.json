They did not teach you the two most important skills that you will ever learn in your life. What do they teach you in school? They taught you about mathematics and how to read and write and chemistry and how to write an essay and perhaps a little bit about history which you forgot immediately after you crammed for the exam because you don't think it's important. I think it's important because it's interesting to know where we came from and where we're going to. However, they did not teach you the two most important skills that you will ever learn in your life. The first one is to do with how to manage, understand, invest and play with money. I will talk about this in another video. What I want to talk about in this video is the primary skill which is socializing and seduction. The point I want to make here is that seduction is not an optional skill. This is not a hobby. This is not something that you might choose to get into because you want to learn how to bang some girls and then leave it later on. Seduction is a life skill. It's a survival skill. It is perhaps the most important thing in terms of what is going to give you happiness, joy, connection and fulfillment in your entire life. You should have a very clear understanding that seduction is not just about that first approach. It's not about the date. It's not even about just getting the girl into bed. That's really just where seduction starts. A true seducer is a man who is able to engage with the world, choose his partners and his friends and the people he socializes with in a proactive and calculated sense and then bring the right people and the right types of relationships into his life. When you learn to be a true seducer, this is about how to seduce your girlfriend every single day. It's about how to make deep connections with your friends. It's about how to have clear boundaries and have a will to go out in the world and get what it is you want because the ability to make your presence felt, to have charisma, to project intent, to be able to go for what you want are all tied in with what seduction truly is. So what I want you to understand is that here we are at the beginning of another wonderful year, 2015, and if you're a man who has been looking at seduction material or thinking about this for some time, dabbling in it, it's time to really commit because you need to approach this from a position of not just thinking this is something you're going to get into for a while but understanding that this is a life skill, a survival skill that you must master because the alternative to it is really awful. The alternative, which is what I see all the time as a man who teaches this full-time, looking at the life and the history of guys who've come to us, and plus just looking at my friends in the normal world who've, you know, bumbled along, had girlfriends here and there that they've sort of lucked upon and ended up in relationships. Now at the ripe old age of 35, I'm seeing the results of that in my peers because they've had girlfriends, got married, had kids, and a lot of them have gotten divorced and are having a pretty horrific time because they chose the wrong woman. In fact, they didn't choose the wrong woman. They didn't choose the woman at all. It's important to understand that most men will end up with a girlfriend. It's not likely that your genes will be deleted from the gene pool, considering how many people are out there. You will hook up with girls at some point. You will have a girlfriend. You probably will have children or have some kind of long-term relationship at some point. But the question is, will you have chosen that person? Will you have chosen the right person for you or the person you really wanted? Or will you just end up with somebody who was in proximity to you? That's what happens to most people. That's how most relationships happen. Anytime you approach a girl on the street and she says she has a boyfriend, just out of curiosity, ask her how she met her partner. I do this often. And nine times out of ten, she says she met the guy at university, in her workplace, or through friends. It's highly unlikely that the woman of your dreams, that the woman that you are truly compatible with, that the woman that is going to challenge you and bring out the best and the most masculine aspects of you, is the woman that is in the next cubicle at your workplace or the woman who is in your lecture theatre. Really, she's out there walking around the streets in totally different social scenes than you're in, and you're going to need to go out there proactively and find her. Because if you don't, someone will find you, or you'll find yourself in a situation. And then what you'll do is you will settle. You'll settle for mediocre, you'll settle for average, and often you'll just settle for awful, abusive, codependent relationships that not only don't feed your soul, but make you into less of a person. As your digital mentor for the moment, I want you, this year, 2015, to make a very clear, unwavering promise and commitment to yourself that you are going to figure this out this year. No more sitting on the sidelines, no more endlessly researching theories, and definitely no more living in doubt. Because we see the biggest reason why men don't get good at this, when they have access to material and information about it, is doubts and perceived limitations. They hold onto these ideas that I'm not tall enough, good looking enough, have enough muscles, the wrong race, the not enough money, the whatever it is that they think that women really want, and therefore I can't get good at this. And they have these conflicts in their head about, is this whole seduction thing a complete fraud, and maybe it's a lie, and these guys are all scammers, and all of that kind of stuff. Those thoughts do not assist you. There's no point in endlessly debating online or in your own mind about whether this is possible or not. Of course it's possible. Anything that anyone else has learned, you can learn too. Social skills are, of course, learned by human beings. Some guys learned it young, because they just happened to be cool, or they had an older brother, or they figured it out somewhere or another, and other guys didn't. And if you're watching this video, you're one of the guys who is not getting enough sex, not getting the right girlfriend, not having the right relationships, and therefore it's time for you to take responsibility for it, and make sure that this changes. Stop thinking of this as something you're interested in. Think of this as something that you are compelled to master, because you know that it is going to be the thing that makes you happy in life. So, you can either join me on one of the crazy workshops that I'm running this year, I am only teaching, personally, 55 men this year, because I'm only one man, and I need to have my own life as well. So, if you want to learn from me, personally, get on my website, thenaturallifestyles.com, check out the workshops that I'm running in Europe, USA, and in Australia. And if not, find another way. The simplest way, and the way that will definitely work, what I did, what anyone I know who is self-taught did, was go out every single day and talk to just one woman. The first pretty girl that you see. You don't go to the gym and lift one rep of a bicep curl, and then wonder why you're not getting biceps. This must be something that becomes a habit, that is simply the thing that you do as well as brushing your teeth every day, is that you talk to one girl every day. Make this the year, gentlemen, this is critical. www.atrural.com"}
