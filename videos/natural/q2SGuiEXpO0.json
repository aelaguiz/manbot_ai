She will shred him. That you come into this relationship out of choice. And Liam talked about this yesterday in terms of it's not a good idea as you're zeroing in on a monogamous or a committed relationship of some form to cut all your other options off. Assuming that she will. She will not. Very unlikely. She will probably be taking good dick to the line. Right to the line. Because if she's hot and sociable, she has options. She's dating guys. There's people in her life. She maybe has a long-term, like, casual lover. You know, I play that role in lots of women's lives. And at some point, they call me and they say, hey, I think something serious is starting with Dave. And that's really them saying, let's fuck one more time and then I'm going into a relationship next week. And I'm like, cool. Do what you got to do. Just buzz me when it's done. Yeah. This is a reality. And so women are, especially, and when we say women, like, it's a catch-all for all females on the planet. You guys here are interested in women that are in demand. That's it, right? You didn't come here to learn, like, what are the things that will get chicks that no one else really wants and we'll put up with and here's some ideas on how to do that. That's not what you want. You want, like, we're all in competition for a narrow bandwidth of ideal women. And those women know it, right? They know that they're in demand. They know their worth. They know their options. And they're looking for men that also have options, right? So in this experience, she got to see that and she gets to feel the fear, the fear of losing the guy, which increases the attraction to him, right? And so then she comes and dumps this big truckload of drama on me, thinking that she wants to capture me, right? That this is, she's going to put all her cards down, make a big fuss and I'm going to go, okay, cool, baby, like, you're the one for me. It is time for children and you win, right? But again, and I know this is like an extreme example, but it shows this in microcosm. If I do that, especially apologizing to a woman who is being irrational, this is, you are fucked. Seriously, you have put a nail in a coffin that for a long time you will pay for that. Because it means she knows you will apologize when she's wrong. Bad, bad sequence to get into. Gives her license to be moron. And when a woman doesn't respect a man in this sense, often she smells blood and she makes it harder on him. There is something I think within women that is very unforgiving of the man that can't handle her. She will shred him. Whereas the man that can handle her, she will defer to him, she will honor him, she will be faithful, she will look after him in all sorts of ways because he's earned it. I think that's what it comes down to. So she gets to experience this explosion of dramatic uncertainty like in any fucking soap opera or love story or whatever where there is this tension and dissonance. She gets to experience it. And then what she got to experience was the man putting her in her place correctly. Letting her know that this is not on. I want you because that's underneath. What's the fear? She's like, I think you want other girls. I'm like, I'm with you in this scenario, however that plays out. I'm with you. I want you. But I don't want all of this extra bullshit. So let's put that aside. And now I'm going to punish you. Not with anger, not aggressively. I'm putting in time out. And that is a very legitimate thing to do. Walk away when it's psycho time. I literally had, with my first girlfriend, she was so insane that there was, there's a scene that my neighbors have to relive over and over till they die, which is me at dawn running down the street with my bangin' hot redhead, totally naked girlfriend screaming, like running after us. And like at full speed, right? Because the, and the name, you know, this is suburban Canberra and like, you know, like watering their lawn. Don't know how to place that in my life story, actually. Because whatever was going on just before that, I did not know how to solve. My technique was to escape. But this is a totally legitimate thing to do. It's like, hey, listen, whatever's going on right now, I don't want to fight about this. Let's leave this till tomorrow. Or it's happening over text, right? Liam's big on this. Never have spats and fights over text. Because the meaning's lost. You're just reading cold, hard text. People are in their own space, getting reactive and then throwing it back at each other, right? And so it's like, we will discuss this after work. Yeah, I'm not having this, I'm not having this fight here. A very powerful, powerful technique. Because then often what happens is they come the next day and say, me sorry, yeah. So she got punished and then she got to go away and have time to actually process this and realize I was being a dick. And not that everyone does, you know. She could have just gone off and fucked somebody else to get revenge and that would have been another thing. And that is the reason why many men won't do that. Because they're afraid that if they don't do what she wants, she'll go off with somebody else. It happens, it can happen for sure. Let her go. Yeah, because if that's her response, that will be her response down the line when some other thing doesn't go her way. If the response is that like a reasonable human being who is prone to unreasonableness, which is all of us, to then come the next day and go, I'm sorry, she then gets to put into this like Freudian infantile situation where I get to be the authority daddy figure and let her be forgiven, right? She gets to have all the emotional turmoil. She gets to be a bitch. She gets to fucking cause a ruckus and then she gets punished for it. And then she gets forgiven. And then all of that entangled, embroiled emotion is now ready for awesome sex to happen. And then there's a resolution. And the final resolution is after all of this turmoil and drama and so on, now we are closer. Now we are more intimate. Now I have more faith in this man. Now I trust him to look after me and to handle me. That I can't run rings around him. That I can't control him. But he will make me feel safe, wanted. And that I have been affirmed in my choice that this was the right man. Interesting. Interesting."}
