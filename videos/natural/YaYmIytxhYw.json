Or are you just exploring? So I'm just walking along this street And trying to find these 2 places Or this one I think I just saw it The colourful one Oh, yeah What do you do in life? I'm a technology consultant So I work for like a sports agency FIFA You go to FIFA You tell them what technology you use So my company is a sports agency Are you the one who said They have to lose now the video When there's a goal? Actually, we did their broadcasting The broadcasting. Holy shit, that must be like... I know a little bit about technology, and I'm always wondering, for example, when I'm on Instagram, I'm sometimes thinking, holy shit, the servers, like how can, because they have like a billion monthly users, I'm just thinking, like, how can it work? Do you have an Instagram? Yeah. I'm like, how can it work that a billion people can use this and it doesn't fuck up? Okay, because I really gotta go, but... How long are you here for? Just two days, maybe a Tuesday. Today is what? Today is Sunday. Okay. Because that's two days off. We meet for a walk on the beach tomorrow? Sure. I booked the ticket for some meetings tomorrow morning, but then we can figure out in the afternoon. Okay, I sleep in the morning. Okay, good. Wow. And you tell me all about broadcasting. I'm very interested. I'm more digital side, but my team is on the broadcasting side. They're all in Russia now, so that's why I asked who they are. Well, you're cute. That's why I talked to you. Oh, thank you. If you're a smart lady that knows more than just shopping, that's awesome. Okay, go. Have a nice day. Have fun exploring. Bye-bye. We've been out for like 90 minutes now. It's my first infield video session where two guys are filming me. I was a little bit in my head and stressing about that. And this was the first set where I actually got a bit in the flow. It was a spontaneous approach and a little more playful. That's how I actually like doing it. I just like walking out having fun. Because if infield becomes this thing for you that you have to do to get to the sex, then you will never do it because it's just not fun. You have to make it a fun thing to turn it into a habit and to actually get success. Otherwise, you start doing it because you, I don't know, maybe read online. That's the thing you have to do to get to the sex, to get to intimacy. But then you will quit pretty soon because it is hard. It's no secret that it's a hard thing to do. To walk out of your comfort zone into the streets. Emotional music. And to meet strangers. What I'm saying is have fun and see what happens. When Alex arrived at TNL four years ago, he was certainly not operating at the levels that you've seen him in this infield video. How was it that he went from shy, awkward, Austrian web designer through to kick-ass ladies man? It was through internalizing and practicing the five principles of natural seduction, which I've been teaching around the world to countless men for over 10 years. And now I'm launching my final edition, the legacy edition of the five principles of natural seduction online course in March 2019. If you'd like to be kept up to date with the launch and to receive VIP updates, as well as a free 47-minute video where I describe and demonstrate how to use the five principles in those critical first five minutes of conversation, then click the link in the description, put your email in and I'll be in touch very soon."}
