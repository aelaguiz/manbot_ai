And they see me there doing this and doing my thing and going like this. Maybe they go, yeah, that guy's cool. Being cool is stressful, seriously. Cool people have to spend all day being cool. They can't be silly. They can't make mistakes. This is the perception that you are always at ease, always in control, always know what you're doing, always smooth, always know the right thing to say, the right thing to do. That's what being cool is. When actually real cool, real cool is Liam McRae. Was that guy Matthew Silver, the guy we'll see in Union Square later? People who are actually able to be them fucking selves, silliness and all, make mistakes, trip over their words, say the wrong thing, accidentally spill a drink on a girl and still be okay with themselves. In my opinion, that's what actual cool is. But the investment in like, okay, I'm an attractive guy who's situated, who knows what he's doing, who fits into the social scene, who's got things covered. That guy is not going to get nearly as good ever. He cannot get as good as the guy who goes, all right, basically I'm a dork. The world sees me as a weirdo, as a loser, as an outsider, as a strange man. All these things, people are going to judge me in all different ways. I'm going to accept that. Most of the planet doesn't want to fuck me on sight. Accept that. Most of the women on the planet don't look at you and go, yes, I want to fuck you. Sometimes they do. And there will be a dozen girls every day who look at you no matter what you look like because people have all sorts of tastes and go, yeah, I'd fuck him. But even that doesn't really matter. It doesn't help you unless you go over there and make a move."}
