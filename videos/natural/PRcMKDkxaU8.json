It's like, okay, cool, our values don't align here, then we should part. It sounds like you're good at setting boundaries or like being clear about where a woman can fit into your life and what that means in terms of your freedom and so on. How do you go about creating boundaries or stating what you will and won't do? Because it can be common that you'll need to do something or not do something that the girl wants or doesn't want, and she's gonna feel annoyed or angry or upset or whatever because you're not doing the thing she thinks she wants, but you're actually doing the thing that you know that you and her both need in order for the relationship to be strong, right? So whether that means telling her no or that you're gonna go and do this thing or she's being unreasonable or dealing with a tantrum or whatever else. What are some of the ways that you manage your woman in the global sense, maybe as well as specifically? Because boundaries is a big thing that men don't understand or they don't know how to approach. And they think it's controlling or dominance or getting angry. All the greats in history, all the great guys who had women that adored them, that had devotion to them to the day they died had strong boundaries. Thus far, shalt thou go no further. I can tell you a quick story of a guy I knew, a guy I still know. He was such a great guy and he had many women. He had many women in his life, love. And he had this girl that he really loved. He was dating her and he told me, Zan, I really love this girl and she was hot. And he was really connected to her and he brought her to Bucharest. He brought her here and later in the relationship, he told her she was doing cocaine. Somebody came to a party at his place. He had always had parties. Somebody brought cocaine and she did cocaine. And he said, why would you do that? Don't ever touch that again. If you ever touch it again, I'll break up with you. Right, he told her. Don't ever do it again in my presence or ever again. A year later or so, she did it again and he found out. And I talked to him later and said, so what's happening is I broke up with her. Okay, but man, you love this girl. You're gonna marry her. That was your heart's dream. It was your desire of your life. I know, but she broke her promise. And I said, well, okay. I'm thinking, okay, so you're gonna punish her for a while and then maybe bring her back. And he goes, no, I will never, never, never, never be with her again. She broke something that hurt my heart. I will not do it again. And he loved her. I thought about that and I thought, you know, that conviction, conviction is the word that men need to understand because we'll have conviction with girls who are not really attractive. Don't do it, I don't like it. But a girl that's quote unquote out of her league or we really want to try and land this super girl, we will compromise a little bit. Okay, well, and the greats in history never did. They said, no, don't do it. And how you do it is it's not stomping around, hey, my way or the highway. It's none of that. It's like, listen, my dear, I adore you. I love you with all my heart. You're my girl, you understand? But don't cross this line. Don't do it again. Don't ever do it again. It's what I demand. I want this. You say it like, you know, the way I wrote it in my book, it's like, it's a father figure energy that women, women will act out and make you jealous and do all kinds of stupid stuff that women do, right? Just to look and see what your reaction would be. Like the little girl looking at her father like this. And the father says, listen, sweetie, I love you. Don't do it again. And if you don't have that energy, that father figure energy to your woman in those times when it's called for, then you're just a nice, needy little boy guy to her. And she's like, she can do whatever she wants. It's not a stomping around, throwing things against the wall. Fuck you, bitch. That kind of stuff. It's not that energy. It's like, listen, do not cry at my baby. Give me a kiss here, here and here. Kiss me here and then kiss me here. And don't do it again. Do not ever do this again. And when they hear that energy, they're like, I'll better shut up because daddy told me not to do it. That's 100% the way it needs to be. Yeah. And of course I would say the first thing a man needs to think about is, are my boundaries reasonable? Like I do try and check in with that because I know that I'm not a reasonable human being because I'm a human being. And I know that there's certain things where I'm like, my need to control this person actually, or make them do or not do something is actually a bit based out of fear, right? Whereas, or as opposed to something that is like really deep and clear in my integrity. I can think of one example. When I was with my ex-wife 10 years ago or so now, and we'd been dating for a year, she moved to Australia and she met a bunch of my friends. And a bunch of my friends were strippers at the time. My ex-girlfriends and so on. And she told me one like, Jamie, I think it will be fun to be a stripper. And I said, listen, this is really important to me. I've, several of my previous girlfriends worked as strippers and I did not like it. I did not like having girls come home at five in the morning, smelling cigarettes, showing their bodies to other dudes. I'm a very open-minded person. I don't judge women for using their resources and so on. But with me, that is not gonna work. So, and I understand like, if that's something you want to pursue because it's like exciting and you want to explore something different or whatever, that's all good. But I will not be there with you if you do that. And she just like, and she's a very strong woman. And she just immediately said, okay, I won't do that. It was just like, she was like, this is something I might be curious to do. She said it was conviction. She said, as conviction as a man that's standing on the surface, don't do it. Women will respond to that energy. It's beautiful what you did. And men are afraid to do that because they're afraid to lose this hot girl. Right, because, or they won't and they'll walk and good. Then you know that, okay, good. This is an area where our values cannot align. Is it something that's worth compromising over? No. Is it something that really affects my self-worth and so on? Then you have to stick to it. Like that's one of the many, many advantages of being a man in abundance is that you don't have to put up with a shitty job, a shitty boss, a shitty girlfriend. It's like, okay, cool. Our values don't align here, then we should part. Or we can downgrade the relationship to something else where it's like, okay, cool. We have a casual thing where we literally have no controls over each other and that can be negotiated as well. Yeah, that's a good point because my friend is still good friends with that girl that he was in love with, but he's good friends with her. He helps make sure she's okay. And he's not a bad guy, you know, but he'll never be with her again in a relationship. Interesting, huh? Yeah. I would have let, I know I personally would have let the Coke slide if I loved her that much. You know, different values for different people. I'll tell you another quick story. There's something in me since I was a kid, maybe because I grew up poor with, I had five brothers and sisters. My mom was a single mom and we were judged because we were poor, right? People would look down on us like, pfft. And so the thing that bothers me the most in this world is to be judgmental. So here's a story. I was in Bucharest about, I don't know, eight years ago. I was with Deanna. I just started seeing her. And we had a bunch of people over at my house as we do. And we were sitting in the kitchen and I was sitting with, leaning back in the chair with Deanna and the week before we met this girl in a bar, we started talking to this girl and she's like this petite young girl, pretty girl. And she was a stripper. And we said, well, listen, you know, it's nice to meet you. We had a nice talk with her. So we always have people in our house come over, give her the address of it. She came that night and she didn't know anybody, right? Just young stripper comes over. I'm sitting with Deanna and somebody rings the bell and she comes in into where we're sitting on the couch and there's like eight, nine, 10 people around, right? And she comes in and she's sweet. She's kind to everybody. She's shaking hands and she's smiling. It's just like, she's nervous to be there, right? She comes, she's a good girl. She's sweet and sincere, okay? And she comes and she sits across from me and Deanna and we're happy. She said, hey, come sit. Her name is Andrea. Andrea, listen, this is so-and-so-and-so-and-so-and-so. And the girl she was sitting by was the girlfriend of the guy who's a good friend of mine. She was sitting over here on my left and she was sitting across from me and it was known or I don't know, somebody brought it on the conversation that this girl was a dancer, okay? And this girl sitting beside her straight across me, here's Andrea on my left, this girl's here and this girl's a hairdresser, my buddy's girlfriend. Andrea gets up to go to the bathroom. She goes, takes off, she's having to go to the bathroom and we're sitting here and I saw this girl sitting across from me, the hairdresser go roll her eyes like this. I was like, hey, hey, hey. I'm sitting with Deanna here like this, what's that? Well, that girl. What about that girl? Well, she's a stripper. I said, what did you just say? I don't like that girl, she's a stripper. I said, what the fuck you just say in my house, you crazy ass girl? Is her boyfriend sitting right there. The only thing gets me ever exercise is this, eh? And I said, listen, listen to me. I'm gonna tell you, I'm gonna tell you only once. This was kind of the conviction I'm talking about, right? Don't ever, ever, ever say that about that girl again in my presence, ever, ever. If you say it, if you're not nicer, when she's gonna come back here in two minutes, if you're not sweet to her, you'd be sweet. If she was sweet to you, because she was very sincerely sweet to you. She reached out to you and asked you about your job and she's kind to you. And if you're not sweet to her, I will kick you out of this house the moment I see it. And I'll kick him out too if he doesn't like it, your boyfriend here. And he's sitting there like, I'll kick you both out. But I'll kick you out for sure, you will not be in my house, don't do it. When she comes back, be sweet, okay? Promise, tell me. She's like, and she came back, the girl came back and the girl was sweet to her. That's how I want it to be. That's when I talk about conviction, I think of these things, I don't want judgmentalism. I don't want that, I don't want that feeling. I don't want you to feel like, and I'm not gonna control your emotions or say something. No, you just, in my presence, be this. Because that's what I want. If you don't want it, then go. It's really powerful. And in some ways, it's so much easier than every other option, right? It's like, I can't be fucked trying to diplomatically work. Or, you know, guys say, how do you handle a bit shield when you run into it, a bit shield? A girl's like, eh, we're talking here. Why would you want to go where your energy is blocked? It's like riding a bicycle with the brakes on. Why would I try and, guys say, well, use humor to break through the bit shield. She just disqualified herself from any kind of girl I would want to be like. My girlfriend, if you came out to her in a bar, said, come up, said, hey, she would be sweet. She'd be nice. And why would I want to be with a girl who's being bitchy to men for sport or just being artificially bitchy? I don't want the girl. See ya, done. Yes, yeah. And it's, and like, I sometimes understand it as like an arms race in some sense. It's like, you know, when, I mean, look, I haven't been in a club club for some years now. I've retired from that. But I would find that that, you know, when I did a lot of cold approaching in bars and I would get that, and I worked on all sorts of different ways to try and get around it. And the one that I just came up with in the end was when girls would do that, I said, listen, you don't have to do that with me. I get it. I get it. Good man. That's perfect. But I'm not here to do that. We can have like a real conversation or I can leave. See, that's conviction, man. That's fantastic. Really good. Cause it's not dismissive. It's not like, you know, it's not, and it's not needy. It's not sucky. It's like saying, listen, I speak truth. I see things in life. I've had experience in life. And I'm gonna say something to you. I'm gonna say something to you. Marco makes a cool comment and question. So he said, wow, these words give me so much relief in a way, and they do, they are relieving. It makes life simpler and you can actually just speak your truth. I feel like I need to connect to myself first before I get to reclaim my conviction. Is there a way how to do this? What are your thoughts on that? Cause my thoughts on that is that I don't think there's any first. I don't think there's like, you know, you do one thing first and like, cause the idea is there what I'm preparing myself and my armor and my, you know, my conviction or whatever it is. And then I can go out to battle with it. I found that I developed this stuff in the fray, you know, but whilst fucking it up, whilst finding myself in an argument with a girlfriend and realizing that I'd lost the power or, you know, watching my friends go through relationships and so on. Like, it's like throwing yourself into it. And it's the same with confidence or charisma or any of these kind of X factor things that make you, you know, stand out is like, those things are not developed in isolation. They're not developed in private. They're not developed in a lab. You know, they're developed whilst going out and doing this trial and error whilst also being able to step back objectively and go, okay, take the person, take the me out of it. What happened here? You know, why did those results not go well? Why does this woman clearly not respect me? Why did those people reject me? And so on. What are your thoughts on that in terms of connecting to yourself? Like your, let's say your own kind of internal autonomy and then being able to project that out into the world as well. I can answer that because you might think, well, I don't have a lot of confidence or I don't have a lot of experience. I get that. I understand. Or I'm nervous. That's okay too. But if you speak these things to women, you'd be shocked at your response. If you said, listen, if you said, listen, I was over there with my buddy James and I had to come talk to you and I'm very nervous. I don't know what to say next, but I'm here in front of you because there's something about you. So you don't have to have it figured out. You just have to have this conviction that you want to figure it out. That's the secret. I always tell guys, if women ask you, what do you do? Which is the common like evaluation question. You say, you know what? You know what I do? I'm a student of life. That's what I do. Trying to, which means you can forgive yourself everything. If you're a student of life and you go talk to girls and they reject you, quote unquote, and say, take off. I'm a student of life. I'm doing my bit. Are you sincere? Is your heart good? Did you really want to go and say nice things to those girls? Did you really want them to respond something nice to you? If that's true, if that's the truth, you can have conviction around that. I wanted this. She was being mean, whatever, right? But it doesn't affect the fact that you are a student of life. You're sincere in your efforts and you want to know. You want to learn. So you cannot fail. You can't be rejected. Nobody can say you're not a student of life, James. No, I don't believe you. Yes, I am. No one can reject it. No one can stop it and say, I'm trying this. And so you have this conviction you can have if you don't have a lot of experience or you're a virgin or any of this kind of stuff. You can still have conviction to know that I want to know. I have conviction around that. That gives you boundaries. That gives you talking points. It gives you everything. If you have that feeling that at least I want to know and at least I'm trying, at least I'm doing my damn just to figure it out, you know? So no one can take that away from you. Seduction is about much more than just the ability to approach girls, get their numbers, and get on dates. That's really where it just starts. After that, you have to learn how to manage your woman, how to negotiate boundaries, how to set up relationships that are healthy and respectful for both partners.
