So here is the question for today Liam is always talking about that men are suppressing their sexuality. And what about women aren't they also suppressing their sexuality? Because suppressing it sounds like a tongue twister now suppressing your sexuality Comes from Christianity what Liam also says makes me curious aren't women doing the same thing Because when you have fantasies you are saying I don't have that and I want to have that Isn't having a fantasy also an outlet of suppressing your sexuality. Doesn't this lead to addiction? I find this a very interesting question I too find these very interesting questions. Thanks for bringing them up There's a lot to delve into there. So you asked several things basically are women also suppressing their sexuality if we assume that men are Isn't fantasy some kind of expression of suppression and Can this not lead to some kind of addictions or? sexual compulsions Well, yeah, those are big questions in answer to the first one. The simplest answer is yes women are definitely affected by Suppression mechanisms in terms of their sexuality. And in fact, I would say the truth is that they are far more oppressed suppressed and Have more complicated structures to try and navigate through whilst trying to reconcile their sexuality So let's look into this a little bit more deeply Historically, let's say since the advent of Christianity in the Western world Women's sexuality has Integrally been tied to her role in society in the family in child rearing and as property Became a thing after the agricultural revolution when you could actually store wealth you could pass wealth on to generations It probably became more important to the overall cultural structures and family legacy structures that a woman's sexuality was very controlled and in the sense that she was essentially bought and sold by her parents to suitors that she was ideally a virgin and Then there was morality tied into that with Christian beliefs that sexuality and in and of itself has a moralistic charge That you can't just enjoy sex based on your desire to be with somebody There are all these other obligations Not just to the here and now in terms of your present family relations, for example but right through to the great time Almighty who gives such a shit about who you have sex with and Is more than happy to damn you to an eternity of hell if you fuck somebody and that's not your husband or your wife so Through countless generations and millennia. We have brought we've come to this position in the modern world Where there is a vast array of what is possible and what is acceptable in terms of human sexuality It's a lot freer than it once was There are still many places within the world where women's sexuality is a hundred percent controlled in very very strict Conservative religious cultures A woman's virtue a woman's value is tied to her virtue so that if she is not a virgin she is worthless You know if she was to sleep around or have an affair That's sometimes grounds for execution So in those kind of societies, yes, women's sexuality is 100% controlled it is completely controlled by the legal structures the religious structures and then Parents and then later her husband have complete control over her sexuality and that is part of greater control mechanisms Designed to keep women in their place and and use them for child rearing sexual gratification commodification of them as people So that sucks if you're a chick, and how do you express your sexuality in those situations? You don't it's not it's not safe to or you do it within the confines of your marriage Now in the modern Western world obviously women have a lot more sexual freedom than that okay So there are usually not any legal ramifications for having sex or or punitive ramifications But there are still moralistic ones there are still cultural norms and and ideas about What what is acceptable for a woman to use her sexuality for now there are still parts of culture within the Western world where it's still assumed that you will not have sex until you get married and That you must retain your virtue for your husband, but for the most part. That's not a modern Written realistic idea most women are not going to only have sex with one man in their life when they have the choice to date different guys or sleep around or have a Series of different relationships throughout their life of different types they will Because the reality being that female sexuality is not what the church or old Archaic societies would presume it to be which is something that is only based around child rearing and the love and devotion to one Male partner, but that female sexuality is wired biologically to be More scattered in its approach So men obviously Biologically we are attracted to a lot of women and given half a chance. We would totally bang them all pretty much right And that is the prerogative of the male and our curse and part of our path for a woman Of course on a deeper biological level She is a reproductive machine and You know if she's going to get pregnant Looking after a child takes a long time a lot of resources and you need Some kind of support structures around you to bring those up so that you are going to be more careful with your partners even though on a logical You know modern perspective we understand the male and the female understands We can use contraceptives and not get pregnant, but there are still very strong powerful biological drives that lead us Or you know try to influence us in our directions, and so that is then run through our filters of modern society of education of Understanding the truth of the human body and so that we can adjust Obviously our behavior so that we're not getting every girl pregnant we have sex with and she's not getting pregnant every time she has sex However, this will still affect her behavior Lay out on top of that so I mean in these situations is not the women are only attracted to one man Okay, she was she is a sexual being she will be attracted to multiple different men She may be more careful with her selection criteria about allowing man into a bed and sometimes she may not be Depending on what's going on for her in her life but lay out upon top of this biological basis are all the sociological or conditioned responses and the force of culture can totally override nature right we see that because Every time we roll a condom on we're using our intelligence our cultural and our scientific knowledge to override a natural urge There are all sorts of examples throughout history of tribes and cultures doing things that were not good for the benefit of the species But we're part of the culture and may have affected it to the point where the culture collapsed Now the overlay that women have to experience in their sexuality if they're not from a super conservative background is still these aspects of judgment around what it means for a woman to be sexual and the old Christian beliefs which is mirrored in most if not all other major religions is that Virtue and value are aligned is that a woman who fucks outside of her marriage is Sinful right and that she will be punished and that she will no longer be valuable, right? So if she has an affair or loses a virginity and no one else will see her as a valuable Commodity and therefore she will not she has the potential to lose all of her security of being a mother of having a place in society you know of being valued and so this fear of Being rejected from her society her tribe of being judged as dirty or unworthy or easy Right a slutty all of these words, which are weaponized or ideas that are weaponized against a woman's sexuality she internalizes and she's aware of and Usually women have some kind of experience where when they start becoming sexual in their teenage years Whatever 16 17 18 depending where she is and At that age often women are fairly experimental with their sexuality if they don't have strong cultural forces telling them what they should and shouldn't do and So they act upon their desires and upon their you know Young need to experiment and to explore and to feel validated and sexy and enjoy physical pleasure and often Those same girls get punished for this right because the cool guy that think of them at the party goes and brags about it Or word gets around, you know, there's a perception that she's an easy girl She's the kind of girl who fucks and therefore maybe she's not boyfriend I'm sorry girlfriend material and the other girls can be quite brutal to this girl for experimenting for expressing her sexuality for no reason other than that she wants to And even if she didn't have that experience she will have seen that experience of girls being slut-shamed by often other girls or guys To the point where their reputation is destroyed And So a woman when she's going through her sexual life She knows it's not realistic that she's only going to be with one man for the rest of her life She may have a series of boyfriends or lovers, but in general she will need to be very discreet About her sexual life She'll need to navigate this Minefield where she has her desire her animal desire She's a mammal a female mammal that wants to fuck and breathe that's you know has cycles the of Arousal that has attraction to a whole lot of different men under different circumstances that has all these Unconscious triggers that set her off under certain circumstances with certain men that make her want to have sex with them sometimes and often very quickly Without the need to go on five dates and plan a marriage So she needs to juggle that the fact that she is a horny mammal and And The fact that she has to navigate through a society that that makes judgments about it depending on what based on what she wears How she presents herself what kind of photos she puts online who she has sex with and how many people know about that? so The truth is that the suppression in women is far greater I think than men our suppression the suppression of our sexuality is different. There's a different quality to it for us it's around The the judgment of being the fear of the judgment of being an abuser All right of actually unleashing your animal in some kind of violent way right and so that the the thing that you may be judged for by society by women by other men is Not being able to control your sexuality or presenting it publicly right and that that this force this masculine force, which is A force of power and creativity and good and everything that was created On this planet on some level was driven by this sexual force And of course, there are the negative aspects of warfare and rape and all the other nasty stuff that definitely is involved in this masculine power but it's Essentially the fear that a lot of men have of being outed as a sexual male That is the thing they're terrified of and therefore their sexuality is suppressed for women. It has a different quality I Had to stop for a moment because as much as I love talking about the suppression of Female sexuality while there's two seven-year-old girls like walking backwards next to the camera guy bouncing their balls I just figured it was more appropriate to let the children walk by I think they've gone. That's the children's playground there That's we'll just keep moving. Shall we? All right. I'm on I'm on target so In terms of your original question do women experience sexual suppression? Absolutely, and of course this women will experience this at vastly different levels within the same city You will have girls whose parents are on their case about never Giving it up to a boy and then you'll have Girls who are living in some kind of hippie household where the parents like handing them condoms and smoking weed with them So there will be big differences in the way that women experience this oppression and so a woman who has had more freedom who's been brought up to ink and encouraged to Be sensual to express herself to date people if she wants to you know, hopefully safely she's likely to be more expressive with her sexuality and to have less sense that she's repressed and Less barriers to exploring her physicality with you, for example Whereas some other girl may have a whole lot of guilt issues and may feel a lot of fear around Sexual contact even though she may physically and emotionally desire it She may well have very clear mental blocks that say I can't do this under this circumstance And that's where you get you start to experience this as a male When you're approaching girls and you're starting to go out on dates and you're moving things more quickly than perhaps you had in the past That a girl who's clearly horny or wants to be with you on a first or second date back at your place suddenly puts the Brakes on and says I'm not that type of girl just so you know, you know, I don't do this kind of thing I'm not that easy. All right, so these kinds of expressions that come up from a girl I mean, of course if she doesn't want to get sexual with you, that's a different thing That's just no lack of desire or it's moving too fast or she wants more time or something like that That's different But if a girl has desire and her fear is blocking her then this is this is where the repression is coming into play So in simple terms the way that you need to understand this I mean, I think it's interesting to understand the female condition. I think it's a really important aspect of your Education in terms of understanding people and if you want to be a great seducer, it's not about Viewing the woman as an enemy or as another that you are trying to conquer If you understand her empathetically and you and you can get inside her world world a bit and see what would it be like to have to balance your sexuality with all this moralistic judgement. What would it be like to have to balance your sexual desire with the reality that men can be dangerous, right, and that they can cause physical violence or sexual trauma and a lot of women have experienced that and even if they haven't they're afraid of it. So stepping over to her side and trying to understand her position is going to make you much more effective, more seductive because you're not trying to break through barriers, you're trying to help her to dissolve them because she wants to. Let's assume she's attracted to you, she doesn't want to have to live with layers of sexual suppression, she wants to express herself, she wants to be free, she wants to be slutty in a good way in the sense that she wants to be able to let out the wilder aspects of her sexuality but many women don't get to and they desire to but because of these constraints that they actually self-police. That's the interesting thing about this kind of oppression is that now in the West we don't have people banging on your door and saying who you're fucking. We have systems in place that women will tend to self-police and so if you can demonstrate to her that the space you have created between you two and here it's like this shape that you live within, whatever space it is, is a safe space and truly safe in the sense that if you are a man who has less judgement internalised, if you allow for women to have sexual expression then they will have it around you. Women are very good at telling, being able to tell what is going on with this man. A female friend of mine a little while ago was talking about she flew to meet a very wealthy gentleman she met online who courted her, was very sexy and rich and flew her over to an exotic location and she was going over there thinking she was going to have sex with this guy. And this guy had an open kind of polyamorous situation he had a couple of other girlfriends that were in the space and he went out with these girls and then he was making comments about some other chick at another table saying how slutty she was, how her dress was really slutty. And so my friend she picked up on this and she decided then and there she wasn't going to sleep with this guy because even though he was judging someone else she could see that this man holds judgement over a female sexuality based on what she wears. So therefore how many steps is she away from being on the receiving end of that? Not much because all she needs to do is displease him in some way and then exhibit whatever he perceives to be slutty behaviour and then she's going to be badly judged. So she decided not to engage with that. Because women are filtering, they're looking at what are the man's behaviours, what are his belief structures, what are the topics he's talking about, is he talking about women in terms of a dichotomy, sluts and good girls, whores and girls you date, easy girls and girls that don't give it up. So if he's seeing women in these two dichotomies he doesn't understand that really they're the same thing. The truth is there's not two breeds of female, ones that are worthless slutty whores and ones that are virtuous lovely virgin mothers. It's that there are women who experience being sexual, being animals and also have to navigate through their cultural life. And so if you understand that and you hold space for that to happen then she can feel free with you. Even though she may not feel free overall that there is elements that she feels suppressed by in the space with you, you let her know through your behaviours, your actions, your encouragement of her sexuality, even if it's really weird to you, then she can start to express herself without fear. And that's when you really start to see who she is on a deep sexual level. It's a beautiful thing to see a woman not worried about what she looks like or what people think about her or whether this is a virtuous or moralistic thing to do but just to express based on pure desire and pure presence in the moment. It's a wonderful thing and if you get to experience that you're very lucky and should feel honoured. And you can create spaces where that will happen just as you can create spaces where a girl will feel like she can only show you a very small fraction of her sexuality. You may have had a girlfriend you've been with for years and she only showed you one sliver of what she really wants because she knew that you couldn't handle the fact that she wanted to be tied up and whipped or that she wanted to play with some kind of power dynamic or that she had dark desires for role plays that were culturally taboo. So if you want to be an amazing lover and you want to have the best sex, the best sexual life, then you're going to need to embody this. If you want to hold it, some women are sluts, some women are worth your time. All women will know that and so they will hide aspects of themselves. You'll never get to experience their pure femininity. The second and third questions you asked regarding fantasy, I find these quite interesting questions. So you're asking, isn't fantasy a reflection of the suppression of your sexuality and can this not lead to addictions and compulsions? So I would say that the answer is yes. That in some way fantasy is always a reflection of taboo or is a reflection of desire that has some kind of barriers in front of it. But that's why if you fantasize about a famous person, the thing that makes it intense or polarizing is the fact you can't have that person. They're a fantasy figure, they're not real, there's no clear pathway that you can go through to get that person and so you have a fantasy or create some kind of sexually tense narrative of wanting to be with this person. So when you look at female fantasies for example, then yes there is always layers of culture and taboo involved in these. And can this exhibit itself in really unhealthy ways? Then yes. So people can, men and women, can suppress their sexual urges and then they pop out in weird and wonderful ways or in destructive or illegal ways. But for the most part they don't really do that. Most people just hold their fantasies inside. Especially women because women's fantasies tend to be far more complex than ours. You ask the average male what is his fantasy, he'd be like, well, have sex with hot girls without too much trouble. Something like that. Whereas you ask a woman and if she'll tell you honestly what her sexual fantasies are, they may involve a convoluted kidnapping scenario with an Arab sheik that goes into some kind of semi-torture scene that then shifts as she's rescued by someone else and then plays out some kind of family taboo dynamic for the resolution of it. So there's so much more depth and complexity usually to female sexuality and their fantasies. Now this is where, okay, I've answered your question in the sense that yes I think that for example, if you have an authority figure in your childhood, you're a woman or girl and your male teacher or the priest or the best friend of your father or some kind of male authority figure triggers attraction switches in you somehow accidentally when you're a child and then you fetishize that man or this type of man representing something that you're erotically aroused by. Okay, and so then a woman may take that through her adult life and she'll be attracted to older men or more powerful men or she'll be attracted to dynamics where there is a power imbalance where for example, the man is her boss and there is a taboo, there is some barrier in the way of getting together. This is why Romeo and Juliet is such a sexy story aside from the fact they're children, is that they can't be together because their families hate each other. It's the tension of them not being allowed to consummate their love that makes it so tragic and intense. So women will internalize these things and then attach them to certain representations of their fantasy. Now this is interesting to know but it's really practically applicable when you start to play with this in your own relationships. If we can understand that, alright, a girl may have daddy issues or she may have authority issues or she may have desire to be dominated or to dominate or to express her wild side or to play some kind of innocent infantile character that is ravished because that takes the responsibility away from her for making the sexual decision. Alright, so I'm just throwing out some ideas and some examples of the way a female's sexuality might start exhibiting through fantasy. And you then as a male have the choice to ignore this, judge it in some way or to allow a space for her to play this out. And this is where ideally I think you want to exist. Most men ignore female fantasies. They just don't, they're not consciously doing it, they just don't know about it. They don't know how to talk to their partners about what she wants, what she wants to explore, any role play she wants to play with or whatever. And so they have whatever sex they end up having and that's their sexual life and maybe over time they learn more about her anatomy and how to get her off but they never really delve into the psychological or emotional spaces that she wants to explore. Or they judge it, even worse. And this is, I've heard many stories from female friends and lovers and guys who've come to their senses later where the girl has expressed something. She wants to be tied up, for example, or she wants to be fucked really hard or she wants to be called a nasty name in bed. And her partner doesn't understand this and cannot handle this. And so instead of talking to her about it and finding out what's behind that if he wants to be more educated, he places judgment. Isn't that weird or that's the kind of stuff you're into? Or make some assumption, okay, daddy, she's coming up and shames her in some way. Let's her know that her fantasy, which was created through a whole bunch of series of conditioned experiences. Okay, so what if she has daddy issues? So what if she has issues where she wants to resolve them through playing out some kind of archetype or role play? To judge her on that is to say that your sexuality is wrong, that I don't approve of it, that I have morally looked down upon you and therefore you should be punished in some way, right? So what does a girl do under that circumstance? She shuts down, she hides or she removes herself from the man. Now a third option and definitely the best one is to allow her and encourage her to have these fantasies and help her play them out, right? We got a couple of kids like waving in the background. It's like, yay, I'm in a vlog. Like little do you realize what kind of vlog you're in, kid. We've got to stop filming these videos in parks. It's just getting, we're going to get reported. Because the awesome thing about creating a space and leading a woman into her fantasies is that it's super sexy and super fun, right? I've kind of come to the point where I realize I don't really understand all of the processes going on inside a woman's sexuality, right? So I've been sexually open and experimental for a long time and I've tried a lot of different things with women based upon what they have expressed in terms of their desire and their fantasies and the hints that they've given me. And I've come to the point where I realize I don't understand this. I don't feel it. I don't want to be dominated, for example. I don't know what it's like to have the desire to be totally submissive to somebody else's power. Yet I've been around that enough with women that I accept that this is the way it is often in an intersexual context. And that's a beautiful thing. And when I play that role of being the dominant, of being the leader, of being the aggressor, of being the person that's taking her through her fantasy, then she gets to drop into and experience a different aspect of herself. It's her sexuality without judgment. It's wilder. Yes, it's related to different narratives and maybe different characters throughout her life. But in that moment as we're playing this out, it becomes a psychodrama, a healing space actually. Because if she wants to play out an aspect of her childhood that she wants to express through her sexuality, or her fear of men, or her desire for danger, or her curiosity about having control taken away from her, or her desire to take power and become like a sexual queen or a wild woman. These are all different things that I've seen. And when you allow that to happen and you play the complementary role of the dominant, of the leader, or sometimes of the sultan who's tied up and pleasured or whatever it is, then she gets to experience aspects of herself that she doesn't experience with other people. She needs you there, actually, to be the mirror image, to be the spark, to create the tension. She needs a man who is able to hold space for her, who is able to step into the role, play out the archetype so that she can go through this process, this psychodrama of experiencing the emotions. She might want to play through some kind of guilt cycle, for example. A girl who has guilt around her sexuality may want you to, in a fun way, punish her, and then chastise her, and then forgive her, and then make her a nice, pure girl again. There's all these different kind of narrative story arcs or character arcs that a girl will want to go through in a role-playing scenario, for example. I've been involved in doing a lot of BDSM sexuality for some years now, and I've recognized that it's not so much about the whips, and the chains, and the ropes, and the dungeons. All that stuff is just extra theatre. All that stuff is just adding props which can make things more fun or more amplified. But really, real BDSM is about this understanding of archetypal interplay, of the power dynamics between masculine and feminine, of the need for people to explore their psyche through their sexuality, to do therapy. It's like essentially to psychoanalyze themselves in real time, in a sexual space, in one which they feel physically safe, and that they feel like their character or their self-esteem is going to be safe. In BDSM scenes, sometimes you'll be playing out a scenario where the woman, for example, is being really..."}
