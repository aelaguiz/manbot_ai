It's a beautiful day in October in Budapest and today is a very special video I'm here with Nathan. Hey, hi guys. So yeah, we're halfway through today. We're gonna talk to some girls I'm gonna listen in I'm gonna give feedback. We have time to do all of that and Let's see which ladies are gonna cross our path. All right Excuse me I'm not trying to sell you anything. I just thought you have such a positive Vibe around here. I just want to say hi I'm Nathan Are you from here? The weather is nice today, huh? I mean like I have been here for like the past four days and like the weather's just been like sunny rainy sunny rainy Okay, so I'm from Vancouver Canada is also known as rain Vancouver during this time of the year just because it's I really close to the Pacific Ocean So we kind of get similar weather like this Then you see that's a stereotype so people usually when they think about Canada, they're like Oh polar bears freaking cold temperatures or What like we only wear t-shirts But Vancouver during the winter time inside zero to two Celsius, so it's pretty warm So, what do you do like are you a student are you let me guess something to do with arts No, I do love art but I'm a business student You're a business student so you're down to business, huh? Making cash money. No, not yet. No. Yes. Yeah, right Like usually people like I'm not making much money. They'll make a lot of money. What is it? Okay, and and why did you decide to study in business what's what's your motivation Okay Okay, and what do you do for fun besides business No, no, no, I mean like besides going to school and study bit like business do you have any hobbies or My friends Sports sports Running I'm a terror like I personally think running is such a weird sport. I Have my route I I have my read my reason behind it just because you know how we have fast and slow twitch muscles So slow twitch muscle is used when you are walking But fast twitch is used when you're sprinting right by running. It's like in between So like you're not really working on either the slow or the fast twitch Yeah, cuz I think it makes sense that you either just walk or sprint but not Yeah, I mean like Physiologically speaking that's how human body works I'm a drug dealer No, but but I I'm like artificial intelligence developer Yeah, so I'm a nerd I wear glasses But right now I'm wearing a contact lens No, like not right now I'm on vacation. Do you have school today? No, I don't have school today. That's why I'm here. That's why you're here Wait, so you just so when you're not doing anything, you just walk around Pictures and videos this is going to sound like a really weird question. So I'm not very photogenic How would you recommend to look nice for? The pictures like, you know, like sexy poses You should try that yourself Do you just I put your camera on a countdown timer and you kind of just hold on a second Let me try this pose and see if it's sexy No, but I thought like you asked like either your friends or you have a model that you can just test on Okay Do you have Instagram? Let's exchange I'm gonna be here for a while. So um, and you seem like a Interesting person I'm not fully come like convinced yet, but so No, no, this is why I need to get to know you a bit better right this is why like we exchange Okay My keyboard is a little bit fucked so it's a little bit different to lay out so Is that common Hungarian Not that common Okay, cool, I will text you later and give me a hug Okay, bye so He sent long conversation I thought at the beginning she was a little bit Hesitant because she didn't know what I was. Why did I approach her? So I I noticed that in her facial expressions I calibrate it a little bit as I I Tell her that I'm not trying to sell you anything. Excuse me I'm not trying to sell you anything because if we look at the environment, there's a ton of people trying to sell stuff Yeah, that was very good. Very calibrated. Yeah to realize this is one of the main street selling spots of Budapest and then using that Preframed good. Yeah, and then so slowly I started with just general questions low pressure Slowly went into more specific. Yeah, so I went from something like what is she doing? What's her name? This is a low entry into the conversation. And then afterwards I started to ask about what she's passionate about Or Polarity questions. Yeah to build up the tensions and stuff like that. I think this one was interesting because Maybe she was a bit confused, but she was charmed nonetheless and it's one of those, you know Obviously, I have a good eye for who is gonna be friendly and open, you know Like I walk through the streets and I see and it's one this is this and I see how her vibe was Friendly open relaxed and that's why I told you say exactly those words Because I like when the opener matches What she feels inside of her and what she thinks about herself Because then it shows her that you're very observant and that you're right. Yeah, she does see herself as relaxed and open that's why she Reacted really well to that. Also cool that you already Applied a feedback from previous sessions where we said get a little more specific in certain questions Don't jump around try to get personal. So I think you could go even deeper there. You did a good job Asking. Oh, why do you study business? But then you still stopped it too early and Didn't push hard enough I would say, you know with business Okay. Oh, why do you choose business? You wanna make money? No. No, I just chose it now and you're like, okay And why did you decide to study in business? What's what's your motivation? Okay, you let that kind of boring answer Be enough to just shut that topic And the same with sports you ask what types of sports? It's a great question, right? So you get specific but you're not getting personal and then what happens is okay Then you move on to the next topic and then you do that again and that topic and then you're like, okay, that's done Then you move on to the next topic and then you do that two or three times and then you come to a point You're like, hey, what's your Instagram? No, but I felt like you asked like either your friends or you have a model that you can just Test on Okay Do you have Instagram? Yeah, that was a few weird. So it was like I'm out of questions. Let's do the Instagram All right, that's how it felt Just like conversation over Exchange on really what we want to do is we still didn't find a thing that she really is passionate about And it seems like what it would have been maybe it wasn't the business thing She was like, I don't know like she was like, I'm doing that now, you know and maybe you can then not persist on the business thing, but more like oh, are you a type of person who Will live more in a moment and doesn't make long-term plans Right, so it's also important to be able to be flexible with your conversation topic Just because you open with what you study and you're studying business doesn't mean you need to then talk about Business and studying in particular. You can also talk about the fact that she's not planning Long into the future that she's kind of going with the flow Maybe or that she maybe was influenced by her father because he said you need to study business who knows, right? So you can they are but why are you doing that who got you into it what made you sign up what makes you keep going Mm-hmm. What's your plan B? Do you have a plan B and so on about the closing part? It was as I mentioned a very abrupt. Yeah, right. Yeah, you didn't really charm her What did you say that made her go? Oh, don't follow me. I'm not fully come like convinced yet, but Yeah, so I was trying to be a bit more challenge on that I'm not convinced that I want to hang out with you yet But I'm going to give you a chance. So let's exchange the Instagram and we can catch up later Yeah, so once I get to know you better then I can see oh if I like you, right? So you want to be a bit of the bad boy? Okay, which is good idea. Just the wrong time Right place wrong time you could have challenged her on all the things before Okay, the studying the photography all the things she actually is You know, she needs a way to be able to qualify herself. Hmm, but if you just say I don't know about you now Maybe if you send me a cool text then I'll think about it's like yeah, she's not a expertise texter, right? You can challenge her on what she's studying on what's her hobby is on why she's living in Budapest All the things you can actually give you things and then you can say I that makes sense I like that but on the closing she wants to feel good giving you her number and yet it leads me to the other thing Which is like tell her why you want to see her again. Don't just be like, hey, what's Instagram? It's a bit too rigid Excuse me. Excuse me Sorry, I just walked by saw you you look gorgeous Thank you. I just wanna say hi I'm Nathan It means You're like Are you a student are you working your students? It looks like you are in rush going to somewhere Okay, I was I was slow down it looks like you are going somewhere are you going to school? Oh, okay, I will just make it quick So I'm from Vancouver, Canada Yes, and This is like my fourth day in Budapest What are you doing in Zara like you purchasing a specific clothes or Yes It's Okay, take your time So it's like clothes that you're trying to purchase Okay Oh I'm not gonna so I know you are going inside. So I'm not gonna bother you any longer but Maybe we can meet up Okay No worries. Have a good day So she was Definitely charmed. Hmm. I think your compliment was very authentic. Sorry. I just walked by saw you Look gorgeous Thank you. I get in general. I get the feeling you come across as authentic which girls really like Yeah, you can say the same words to the same girl and she can perceive it very differently based on if she thinks You meant it or not. So your intention was good in the sense of intention as appreciation and You wanting to meet her? Yeah, then she got shy and you got shy and then it's just too shy people So eventually you got to take leadership, right? You as the man who approaches her needs to guide her to the thing which eventually is hopefully exchanging contact Hopefully going on a date, right if you just give up because she's shy That's a problem because Many girls are shy, they don't know what to do, they don't know how to have a conversation. She literally said, my English is not so good, but she was shy about that, which she did navigate well. Sorry, I don't speak English very well. Okay, I will slow down. But you have to be a little more persistent, because you were like, oh, I see you go to Zara, okay, bye. You know, she was a beautiful girl, you charmed her, she walked with you. She didn't say, no thanks, so I'm busy. She did say in the end, she has a boyfriend, right? But we didn't know that until the end. So we want to get more to a point where we engage her more and more and more. But you did try to close her in the end? Yeah, so. Yeah, I did. Yeah. Fair enough. But anyway, we want to find out more about her first and share more about ourselves, right? Sharing about yourself, you also didn't do in the last one, that didn't go well, is important before we get to the close. Because it should, again, make sense to her to give her our contact, like she won't give it to someone who she didn't really talk to, who didn't really share much, who didn't make her feel anything, then she might give you a contact to get rid of you, because she feels shy again, or, you know, to be polite, but it's not a strong close. So take more leadership in that sense. Tell her, hey, before you go in here, tell me about this, da da da, you know, get to know her. Excuse me? Sorry, I was just, you look beautiful, I just want to say hi. I'm Nathan. Are you from here? Yeah. Okay. So what does your bag say? Is there a character? Versace. Huh? Versace. Versace. Okay. I thought you were saying something Vancouver. No. I guess maybe because I'm from Vancouver. I'm from Canada, by the way. Really? Yeah. I know, like, people usually, they're like, ah, Asian looking guy, and it's like, how is it possible that he's a Canadian? So are you a student, or are you working? No, I'm working. You're working? Yeah. I guess you work for... No, I wish. You wish? Yeah. So what kind of work do you do? No, I'm actually working in a souvenir shop, and I'm doing sometimes modeling jobs, but not usually. Souvenir, great. So what would you recommend me to bring back to Canada as a souvenir from here? Paprika, maybe. Huh? Paprika, maybe. Paprika? Yeah. Is that like a Hungarian... Yeah, it's spice. Spice? Spice. Spicy? Put it in a lot of food. Okay. And like, what do you have it with? Do you have it with cheese or crackers? No, you just put it in. It's just really like a spice. You put it in soup. Oh, right, right, right. But like, what is your favorite ways to enjoy paprika? Maybe in goulash. Goulash? Yeah. What's a goulash? It's a traditional soup. And what's inside this? Like meat and a lot of vegetables. Meat and a lot of vegetables. So you're saying Hungarians are very hearty, like to eat a lot of proteins, carbs. Carbs. Carbs. But the thing is like, I would imagine when people eat a lot of carbs, they tend to be, you know, like big bellies. But you don't look like you have a big belly. I can be. Oh yeah? Is it because you do certain sports? Yeah, sometimes I go to the gym. That's... I don't know. I guess it's just genetic. Yeah, you need more. Sorry. I have to be honest with you. It's just because I have seen girls that go to the gym a lot. They actually got like huge... Yeah, I don't like it. No, no, no. It's okay. Do you think it's better... So guys, it's okay to have big muscles, right? I mean, it's not so important. So what's important for a guy? What do you look for? Are you doing like an interview or something? No, I'm not doing an interview. I'm just curious. I'm just curious to know you, right? I think you are a pretty, pretty girl. So I want to get to know you. I don't know, like be intelligent, nice, funny. Funny? Yeah. But then afterwards, they get drunk. And then everything else is out of the window. Oh! Yeah? That's true. Do you usually get drunk? So here is the funny story. I haven't drank in three years. Really? Yes. How old are you? How old do you think I am? I don't know. 24 maybe? 24. A little bit more. More. 26? More. 27? 27. You look very good. Thank you. It's my secret. Stop drinking. Do you drink a lot? Like, I go out a lot. You go out a lot. So you party. So tell me, what are you passionate about? Besides working at a souvenir shop. I don't like it. You don't like it? I like drawing. Drawing? Okay. Dancing. I danced a lot when I was younger. Now I stopped a little bit. I don't know. I don't really know what I'm doing. What do you draw? Everything. Everything? Just in my mind, kind of. I don't know. I need to go. Okay. I'm gonna be here for a while. In Budapest. Yeah? Let's exchange contacts. I give you my Instagram. Okay. I don't use it, but I give you. As long as I can text you, right? Here. Okay. Yup, I just followed you. Did you follow me? Soon. Soon? What? I don't even even? I don't even even. There you go. Okay. Bye bye. Alright, that's a good place to end it. Because we're out of time. But again, we see a beautiful young Hungarian girl on her way to somewhere. Very comfortable to be stopped. She even said, usually I don't give my Instagram, but you can have it. She was funnily challenging, which you can call out as well. You can say, I like that. You're challenging. You're cute, right? That kind of establishes also that you're still the guy who appreciates her for being challenging. Because she was like, is this an interview? So what's important for a guy? What do you look for? Are you doing like an interview or something? Yeah. It's funny. Still, I feel like you didn't share enough about yourself. Yeah, true. She doesn't know all the cool things you're doing. She doesn't know really why you're here. She doesn't know what's going on in your life. You know, how hard you work and what cool adventure you want. I want to hear more about that in the future. Yeah, I really have to work on that. Because, you know, she's going to receive a message from you. And she needs to remember who you are. And we want to hook her. We want that she remembers, oh yeah, that guy. Wow, I liked how he said that thing. Or what he told me about himself. Or how he complimented me. And again, the end was to be, what do you say? Left something to be desired. Which is like, hey, let's exchange. It was very weak. It wasn't like, you're really cool. I like that about you. Let's hang out more. It was just like, yeah, let's connect. You didn't take the risk. You need to take more risk in that. You take amazing risks now in the beginning. Hey, you look absolutely gorgeous. That's great. You're coming strong, authentic. I want that same energy in the end as well. Remind them, hey, wow, you and me, let's do this. Come on, let's go. I want that energy in there. Alright, cool, good job."}
