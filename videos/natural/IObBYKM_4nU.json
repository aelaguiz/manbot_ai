Number one is you are setting it up too formal. This could be you planning a date in the opera or in a nice restaurant or going to the cinema. Anything that takes longer than, you know, even an hour or two hours is not ideal. Because it's quite stressful for her to just have met a guy or maybe she met you on Tinder or quickly for five minutes on the street and then suddenly she needs to make this big jump in investment and sit with you there for two hours, three hours, four hours, you know, look in your face or have a five-course meal or choose the wine or something like this. It's very stressful for her. So, my tip is for the first date, keep it super casual, keep it short and make it possible for both of you to leave whenever you feel like leaving. So, examples for this could be just a simple walk in the park. Maybe you get a juice along the way or you sit down at some cafe or outdoor area having, you know, one glass of wine or some other like nice social area or you can have one drink and it's not a whole big event. Now, the next one is not moving enough. So, that means you should during a date, even if it's the first date, change location at least once. Ideally, even more than once. This is based on the principle of time distortion. If you move location one time, you're basically creating two dates in one and it gives her the feeling that she's getting to know you way more and that she already knows you and, you know, it's kind of like, oh, I was already with him there and I was comfortable there and now I'm here. So, it makes you connect with the girl way faster and gives you the opportunity to escalate physically on her more easy as well, which leads into mistake number three, which is not getting physical. Obviously, we want to be respectful. We want to check if she's consenting to our touch and our escalation, but usually the big problem is not touching too much, but touching way too little. Guys are too hesitant. They don't know how to escalate. They don't know what to do. And probably, if you're watching this video, you've had the experience as well that you're on a date and it's kind of like going well on a like talking level, but you don't know how to make the next step. So, the solution for this is basically starting with really small touches. So, you can, at the beginning, give her a hug already and maybe brush her arm next to her arm when you're walking. You can also sit closer to her, not like sitting in opposite side of each other, but sitting at a corner or even next to her in certain areas. So, this can help slowly, step-by-step, getting you and her comfortable about each other's touch. And then you don't end up, after two hours of talking, needing to make a big move or trying to kiss her out of nowhere, which can be really strange. Now, one of the biggest mistakes guys do in general, either on the approach, the first date, meeting people at events, just generally conversation, is not letting the other person talk. Now, this is a big issue. Obviously, you want to connect with a person and you want to get your point across and you want to show how cool you are and what you've got going on. But you trying to talk your way into getting approval is causing the opposite effect. It's annoying. She doesn't really care. And mainly, she doesn't get to share about herself. And you also not getting to know her. So, there's so many negative things that are happening when you're constantly talking, talking, talking, interrupting, not leaving pauses. And on top of all that, it becomes a very factual conversation, you know. You are conversationing about things and it leaves out the sexual tension. It loses all the sex in the interaction. You don't take time for like strong eye contact or making her feel aroused, but you're just staring at her for a little bit. Also, it doesn't enable her to just relax next to you for a while. So, it's a very common problem and one that really destroys the whole energy and atmosphere that a date could have. Two advanced tips that I want to give you with the end of this video is two things that girls will do and always do. And if you complain about it, will make you look really stupid and non-calibrated and aggressive. The first one is you complaining about her being late. Now, of course, your time is valuable and should be respected. And there's a limit, right? If a girl is like two hours late or you're meeting the same girl and she's always late or she makes up weird stories of why she was late and you know she's lying, obviously, you should draw your boundaries. But if you are, you know, perfectly on time and she's a couple minutes late, it's her feminine energy. She just needs more time to get ready. She's chaotic. She's not, you know, if she would be so smart with time management, she would probably not even meet you because she has some job somewhere. So get used to that. Girls will be late. They're always a little bit late. Hotter girls are usually even later because they get away with it and usually the world has taught them how to behave and they're behaving that way. So you as a single guy won't be able to change that. So bring a book, bring your phone, have some tasks, you know, bring a Kindle, listen to a podcast, use the time to meditate, use the time to approach another girl in front of the cafe. It's no big deal. It's only a big deal if you feel like you lost the time, but you didn't. You can just act or you can just plan ahead and use the time productively and then she shows up and you can be in a relaxed mood. One life hack is just always expect her to be late and then if she shows up on time, then it's a nice surprise. Another common complaint that guys have is when a girl is on her phone, right? Usually, if you meet only for a very short amount of time, that might be not an issue. But if the date goes on or you're in a restaurant or some event, you know, there might be times where she looks at the phone either for a longer time because she's catching up on stuff or something is happening or she's just in the habit of looking at her phone when there is something. Now, different people have different relationships to their phone and different standards and behaviors of how fast they respond or how long they go without the phone. But the main thing to understand is just like that's the world we live in now where a lot of people just react to the notifications and me personally think that's super annoying, but I just have to accept that, you know? Just because I have all my notifications off and I sometimes take hours and days to respond to people doesn't mean I can enforce that behavior on everyone who is around me all the time. So, if you become the guy who becomes like salty, who's like, oh, you're always on your phone or you're addicted to your phone or you're checking your Instagram likes, it will just show you're not calibrated, you don't really understand the world she lives in and it makes you look a bit like a loser. So, don't do that. Just accept it. Use the time when she's on the phone to check your messages, you know, maybe somebody texted you, maybe one of your co-workers or employees or partners need something from you or you just, you know, use the time to again meditate and calibrate and relax. Now, in a perfect world, of course, everybody's always present all the time and we leave our phones at home and, you know, we really get to know each other and connect on a deeper level. But that's just not the world we live in. Currently, phones are around all of us. It's almost like an extension of our body. So, you complaining about that will just annoy her. She won't like respect you more because you make a point or draw your boundary there and will make her think, oh, if he's already acting like this, how will he act, you know, at home or in a relationship on the second date and it's just like ruins the fun for her. So, let her do her thing. Also, probably if she's looking at her phone every minute or two minutes, probably you're just boring to her and you need to work on your seduction and communication skills. Now, again, that brings me back to the point of choosing different locations, making the date moving. If you sit in the same spot for three hours, of course, she's going to look at her phone eventually because probably she's going to get bored. So, move around, you know, make stuff up. Also, let her talk often. She's looking at her phone because she's like, oh my God, this guy won't shut up. You know, let's see what people actually care about have to say to me or maybe I can share something over text and people are actually going to respond to it. So, that can be reasons why she looks at her phone as well. Another one could be she's just anxious and, you know, she just doesn't know what to do and to say because she's shy. So, she's kind of like finding security in the chat messages with her friends or she's literally just texting her friend. Yeah, everything is okay, you know. Oh, yeah, he's fine, it's cool. But yeah, I'm safe. Or texting her mom, who knows? You don't know what's going on. So, don't make assumptions and stay relaxed. Thanks for watching.
