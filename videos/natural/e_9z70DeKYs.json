Yeah, I'm Erik, I'm from Norway, 22 years old, and I like traveling. How are you feeling emotionally today? Well, earlier it was great, now I'm tired. Back again, yeah. This is going to be the hardest part of this workshop. So I'm just gonna have to get my energy level up and then I'm ready to go. Excuse me, girls. What are you up to? Really? So you're going to Barcelona and have nothing like plans or anything? That's what I'm doing today. Really, so where are you guys from? Greece. Norway. By the way, what's your name? Patricia. I'm Erik. Patricia? Yeah. Nice to meet you. Okay, so I'm just walking with you about 200 meters, then I will stop there. What's on your mind? Well, I think that Patrice is the most beautiful girl I have ever seen. She is, definitely. Yeah. Well, she's beautiful too. Thanks. Yeah, you are. Thank you so much. Thank you. I want to ask, well, Patrice, what do you think about a coffee? A coffee? Yeah. Or maybe some drinks later? Maybe later, maybe later. Maybe later. Well, first off, we need to know each other a little bit better, maybe. No, can I come? Sure. Why not? I don't know what to say. It's just, yeah, we gotta go. Sorry. It's too hot. Sorry, sorry. 100 meters, then I'll leave you, guys. Okay, so... I'll tell you where we go. Just 100 meters. Yeah, I'm Erik. I'm from Norway, 22 years old, and I like traveling. I love Barcelona. And yeah, I'm going to study psychology in September. So what about you? What about me? Who are Patrice? I'm Patrice. Okay, so Patrice is Patrice with white and red. Yeah, I'm from Miami. She's my sister. Okay. You don't think we look alike? You guys sisters? Yeah. No, you're not. You really are? Yeah. Wait, take your sunglasses off. I wanna see your eyes. Wow. So, okay, Patrice, you were born in Miami. You moved to Greece with your parents because of Greece. What else? That's your sister. Yeah, I can see that you're in Barcelona. But I want to know the real Patrice. It was nice meeting you. Bye. Bye. Okay. I understand. But before you go. It's not personal. I know. Sorry. But before you go. Yeah. I just wanted to get her Facebook and Patrice. No, I'm sorry, I have a boyfriend. I can't. Really? Okay. Well, you guys have a wonderful day. Okay. Bye-bye. Why did they want to walk away? Because I haven't told a stranger. Yeah, so how do you change being a stranger? Well, we introduce each other and share something personal. Yeah. So... And you did that by? Selling. Telling just a list. Eric, I'm 22. I'm from Norway. Is that enough? Now we are friends? No, maybe more. I don't know. There's no emotional connection. Yeah. Right? Emotional connection is what makes people feel like a conversation is adding to their lives. Rather than taking away from their lives, right? Getting information is what you were doing from that woman in the shop. You're going to be working here for a long time? Or are you studying studies? What are you up to? Yeah, I'm working on this. Okay. So you don't want to study anything? Yeah, marketing. Marketing, right? Really? How long have you worked here? What do you go to school for? What kind of marketing? All of these things where now she's just... It's an interview, right? So for these girls, what you have this opportunity to do is to go into the circumstance and find out about the emotions and the connections that you can make with them, right? I mean, it was super interesting because those girls were like giving you a whole bunch of information about like what they were doing and like what you needed to be doing. When she goes, okay, what? Like, why are you here? What does that mean? That I didn't state my intentions. Yeah, that you didn't explain why you were there, right? That you weren't being honest with them, that you weren't... They didn't know how long you were going to be there. So you said to them, okay, well, let's... 200 meters, I'll walk up with you. Now, let me ask you the question between telling them how long you walk so they won't worry or asking them if it's okay that you walk with them, right? So a lot of what you were doing, especially when it was like 100 meters, 100 meters, only 100 meters, is that okay, right? Rather than saying, okay, well, you guys are in a rush. We're making moves. So I'm going to walk with you 200 meters up till there and then hopefully we'll know each other by then, right? Because then you're establishing what it is that you want. When they were like, oh, what the fuck? That's the point where you want to be like, oh, sorry, I know this is weird, right? Calling out the awkwardness. You can feel that, right? So you feel that. You feel that awkwardness. And then you go, sorry, I know this is weird. I just came over here because I thought you guys were beautiful. And then they giggle, oh, thanks very much. And then you say, all right, so what's your story? How do you guys know each other? All of these little tiny things that you can do to push the conversation forward because it actually represents what it is that you want, what it is that you're thinking, what it is that you're feeling. Then when you move forward, you'll discover what is it I really want. You don't know if you want to meet these girls again. You don't know if these girls are nice. All you know is that they're pretty, but that might not mean anything. So all you really know is you just want to make connection. You just want to meet them, right? Moving forward for these next interactions, I really, really want you to focus on what is it that you feel? What is it that you're thinking? What is it that you want to express? And being honest with those expressions. And then you find that those girls will respond to that, respond to you as a person, not your line or your facial expression or how smooth you are. You know what I mean? That make sense? And it'll be way more validating too. Because when you get rejected, when she says no thanks or whatever, you go, oh, well, she has something to do. You don't go, oh, I didn't use the right line. You know, or why didn't that line work? Or, oh, I said the wrong thing. You'll find like, hey, it's me. She's like, no, thanks. You're like, OK. Excuse me. Hi. Is this your mother? Yes. I wanted to tell you, your daughter, that she's beautiful. I'm Eric. Valentina. Eric. Are you guys on vacation? Yes. I'm Talia. You guys from Italia? Yes. What's your name? Cristina. I'm Eric. Nice to meet you guys. So what are you doing in Barcelona? What are you doing? Are you here for lunch? Four days. Nice. I'm actually leaving tomorrow. So I was thinking of having a bit of fun. But what to do? Do you guys have any suggestions? Do you speak English? Speak a little bit. A bit. A little. A little. OK. Well, I just wanted to say that your daughter is beautiful. And you guys have a nice day, OK? Bye bye. Enjoy. Just as a quick note for mother-daughter sets. If you see a mom out with her daughter, just be pleasant to the mom. Don't talk to the daughter through the mom. I wanted to tell your daughter she's very attractive. Well, you didn't. You told the mom that you wanted to tell her. Well, I just wanted to say that your daughter is beautiful. Instead, say, well, you're very, very attractive. And I'm glad I got the opportunity to talk to you. So don't let it intimidate you. Don't add any significance, any difficulty. I just want to try it. Yeah, no, it's great. That's what I'm saying. I'm saying you go and do it. Here's a little note for you to take with for you next time. Yeah. Just a little thing. So church bells. Telling directly to... But I still need to acknowledge that the mother is there. Yeah, but you did. You said hello. Yeah. What you did is you said to her, oh, hello. Hi, my name's Eric. Is this your mother? And she was like, yep. And you were like, oh, well, I wanted to tell your daughter she's very attractive. What you were doing there is you were, like, feeling the pressure of complimenting the daughter. So you released the pressure by, like, trying to do it through the mother. That's true. Gareth, he was giving me a hard time when I thought I didn't deserve it. But once he said it, I, wow, he's right. Gareth has an incredible sense of humor. I'm going to fall if I do that. He always likes to laugh. But he also has the ability to be serious. And talk really deep and question your thinking. And when you're being challenged by guys like Gareth, it's way more fun to have people like that. And Gareth is an amazing guy. Stating my intention was absolutely one of my main problems when I get to think about it. I think it was a combination of both being afraid of rejection and being afraid of judgments of the other guys around you. You don't want to be the guy who gets rejected. Nobody wants to be that guy. But you have to face it and own it to develop. When you are approaching a girl, you need to state your intention. Because she can't read your mind. If you state your intention either by your facial expression or your statement, then she gets why you're there. And you're not there to be her friend. So what I want to focus on with you is not being your nice guy. It's making sure you have a dynamic conversation, an emotional conversation. You can be stimulating her. You can enjoy it rather than just coming over and being nice and wandering off. Make sense? Yeah. Okay, let's do it. Hi. Hi. What's going on? You seem to be in a hurry, right? We are in a hurry. Yeah. Where are you going? Why do you want to know where we are going? I'm just spontaneous. Okay, bye. Bye. Bye-bye. Where are you going? No. No. That's also very, very, very common as well. The where are you going? They don't owe you anything. Strangers asking you where you go. Strangers. Now let's go find him. Actually, I'm going to tell him that. Hey, Stefan. Where are you going? No, no, no. I mean, you ask them where they're going. You'll always have a real hard time with the question, where are you going? Right? Because they don't owe you squat. So a stranger asking you where you're going. How about, what are you guys up to today? Stop those girls. Awesome. Hello. They were like, hello. Then you said, you look like you're in a rush. They didn't really look like they were in a rush. That's okay though. Good pre-frame, good practice pre-frame. It's good to get in the habit of pre-frame. But they didn't really look like they were in a rush. I think you'll notice that when you suggest something like that. Oh, you guys look like you need to leave. They'll be like, yep, here's my house. This is the way I can leave. Right? So you look like you're in a rush. She was like, yep, we're in a rush. And then you were, you were asking them, where are you going? And she, do you remember what she said? Why do you want to know? Why? Yeah. So the question is, why do you want to know? What you really want to know for is so that you can have a conversation with them. Oh, I just want to know, say hello and find out what's going on. Simple, yeah. When you, when you identify what they're doing. Oh, you guys look like you're relaxed today. She still kind of wants to know why you're there. Hey, I came over here to say, relax, you look fun. I'm walking around meeting people. You got to say hi and see what's up. Yeah. Say hi and see what's up. Then you can continue that conversation. Okay. Good. Yeah. Hey there. Hi. You look so chilled. Yeah, I'm chilled. I am chilled. I was just trying to draw. Oh, you're nice. Yeah. I'm here walking around and see what's going on. I hope you don't mind that I sit here and have a chat with you. That's all right. Cool. Switzerland. Oh, okay. Are you here for work or holiday? No, I'm traveling. For myself, to explore about people and culture, because I like to connect with new ideas. Okay, that's cool. But do you do that as a hobby or as a job? More as a passionate thing I like to do. Okay, that's cool. So you do research about people and culture? Not in that sense. I prefer to meet people and explore through them, because there are different ways of living. Are you into anthropology? Not really. Not really? No? What about you? I like anthropology. I actually want to study it. But it's more like culture as in like a big thing, like the whole society culture. Maybe you're more interested in like personal opinions about culture, right? Yeah. Well, for example, what I like about Japan is everyone is caring about each other. But what I don't like is they are too shy and reserved. Right. I heard a lot about countries like that. I actually visited Nepal once. And I actually, you know, kind of saw the same thing. They're really open, but when it comes to personal stuff, they don't really want to talk about it. Or they kind of just sweep something under the table, because it's too personal for them to talk about. How did you feel interacting with these people? Well, I was there with my family, so I didn't really connect with someone on a personal level. But I still saw it happen sometimes. So to me, it sounds like you like it to have it easy. I think that, you know, I'm only 19 years old and traveling to another country was already a big step for me. So I had to choose like a job. Yes, I chose for easy. Yeah. How do you feel about it? Well, I moved out as fast as I could. Let's just say that I was 18 and actually moved within a few months to Rotterdam. Because I thought it would be very creative to have these wonderful plates with the deliciously prepared food. Oh, shit. I have to go. A friend is calling me. Okay. Well, have a nice day. Yeah. How about we go on a date together? Okay. Naomi. What's your name? Stefan. Stefan. Well, nice to meet you. All right. Have a good day. Thank you. You too. Bye. So when you said to me that you didn't challenge very much, I totally disagree with that. I think you challenge so much more than normally. And you challenge in a lot of different ways. The difficulty that you were running into is that when you were allowing there to be quite a bit of space by putting pressure on her, she was just filling in the details. She was asking the next question. And what ended up happening was she ended up leading the conversation. Which is fine, but it stops you from choosing the subject. Right? It stops you from moving forward. But starting out with a great observation of her chilling because you saw how she felt and called it out. And she was like, yep, you're right. The issue of her leading the conversation was continuously coming up. Remember, too, that if she is going to give you a subject or start a subject that you don't want to talk about, another way to apply pressure to the relationship is to like not just answer questions just for the sake of answering questions. Think about the principles behind it. The principle behind it is that you have a direction that you want that conversation to go in. And her asking, maybe her asking that question or starting on that conversation topic won't be helpful. This is very useful for a lot of people. If somebody is complaining or somebody wants to talk about something boring. Or maybe you're at dinner and they want to talk about politics or things that you know are going to be tricky subjects. You change the subject and move or I don't want to say ignore, but kind of sidestep. You know, when you acknowledge that something happens and then move on. One of the biggest points that you were suffering from is you were getting a lot of information. You were having a conversation. She was giving you a ton and very, very, very rarely, if at all, did you encourage her or appreciate that she made that effort. Or tell her how awesome it was that she had all of these in-depth feelings. Now for you, because you've been battling this kind of transition between being a really nice and being a friendly guy. And being the challenging guy that puts pressure on the conversation. It is okay in this instance that you didn't encourage everything that she was saying. But a little bit goes a long way. Wow, you have great answers for all of these questions, right? Is all you need to say maybe once or wow, what an excellent answer. Or I really like the way you thought. How thoughtful of you. Yeah, very thoughtful, right? But I want to add things to make her feel good about making this investment. She spent a lot of effort and a lot of time talking with you. And she was really happy about it. If you call it out once. If you say, man, you know, I've been talking to strangers for weeks now. And people are boring and have short answers. You're really interesting. That's really cool. It can give her that little boost of good feeling and continue the investment, right? Just real quick because then we got to meet. But so before every question. Get rid of that. And then when she asks you a question, you were sort of humming to yourself before your answer. When you have to think of something, you have to think of the line. Take a deep breath. Sit in the stillness. Wiggle your toes if you have to. And then continue on. It was very weird. It's very surreal hearing you do that. But good challenges. Good answers. Good talking about yourself. That was a great example of something where you were like, hey, let's go on a date. How about we go on a date together? Which was a little too strong of a sexual thing. There's a context. The concept of going on a date with a girl is a little bit outdated and there's a lot of pressure. When you say, hey, let's go on a date. She thinks I've got to dress up. We're going to go this way. She's going to expect a kiss. But if you say, hey, let's hang out. Let's see what happens, you know. Hang out. Go for a drink. Go meet up or whatever. It ends up being the same thing as a date would be. Because all you're doing is going to talk and interact and that kind of thing. But it doesn't come with the associated pressure. Glad I still asked for a connection. Absolutely. And that is excellent. That's why I texted you about that too. Nice. That's a good job. Thank you. Great job. All right. Let's get out of the sun. Working with Gareth was very helpful. He was really on point. He gave me the right freedom of, OK, we are here for having a lovely day. Just go out and have fun. After interactions, he gave me also very good and clear feedback. And the way he also gave me the examples were very insightful. So I have the feeling he knows what he's doing. And he always gave me the right direction. I was totally in the nice guy area. I was too friendly. And I had trouble meeting women and sparking attraction. So I was basically not having many interactions in a romantic sense. My biggest changes at the end of the workshop are I instinctively approach women I feel attracted to. Like, oh, let's go. I turned that into a habit. Or like, OK, I had a lovely interaction. I go out of the interaction and feel like, oh, wait, I like that. Let's get the number. So I do it more smoothly and consistently. Also, I got a lot of tools that are helpful. Like meditation or having positive mindsets I can reaffirm. You"}
