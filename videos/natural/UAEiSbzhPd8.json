You know you saw that she touched you That was definitely like I got a boyfriend, but I think I want to fuck Excuse me I saw you from there, and I thought she looks absolutely amazing. I think You are you are married. Oh, it was the lucky guy. Yeah, you from Ukraine Anyway, have a good day Thank you When you because you were what I could see you doing is waiting for her to kind of be ready for your approach Right you were kind of waiting waiting, and then you got in front, and it was she didn't like she was very startled If that happens call it out All right, so guys surprised you yeah, excuse me, and she's like oh, I said I didn't mean to startle you I didn't mean to scare you or yeah, or I just surprised you okay? And I'll even like lean back a bit to create a bit more space and then I go in to do my thing Yep, that's and then the only other thing is when the girl says she's married. I has a boyfriend Don't ever say anything about the lucky guy. You are married. Oh, it was the lucky guy. Yeah Fuck that guy Because it's it's not it's a really beater move for you It's like it's saying please pass on message to the alpha that he's better than me or something like it Do you want the game of life? Yeah? You don't need to do that. It's just like she's married. Oh, okay. Well congratulations and have an awesome day That's it. Oh, yeah, that's all See I don't speak very Spanish, but Oh, yeah, okay. Oh, let's work. Let's work together then I said I really love your style. It's something Like I'm new to Barcelona so maybe something come on that you do it's like second-hand or anything I'm from Belgium actually You're from Russia, that's funny sometimes we remember like things where they come from So Okay, anyway, okay, I know I wait wait a minute, okay you and I know you're a bit in a hurry but Yeah, my name is zero zero Yeah, my name is zero zero thirty two Yeah What's your name? Maria It's like Yanis or something No, yeah cool every day Where are you running to? Okay, go go go go Ciao, what's that face explaining your face? I'm surprised. She gives me her love. She gave me enough. She didn't give me a number. She took mine so it's King it is what it is, but That's it, that's my my face is for that. Okay. Okay Well, we don't know what that meant. Like firstly, I never give my number to a girl because they never call Ever yeah, except one time in Norway once It happened because she was very polite well It's sometimes it's them getting rid of you. Sometimes they think they're gonna call you They yeah, and then later on she's like, hang on. I'm a woman. I don't call guys, right? So if she says that Which will happen occasionally. I'll give me your number then I'll say well only if you're gonna call me right now So I have your number and then and then she says oh no Well, like I'm I always called but I said look I don't think that's ever has to happen in the history of the world So either give me a number or let's just leave it And I'll walk away because I did it a bunch of times and no one's ever called It's a fucking waste of time and it's another one of those things. We like okay No, just like you're trying to get the contact details and like sometimes I've said Listen, I'm not the kind of guy that's gonna blow up. You're fine. I'll text you once or twice if you don't want to see me That's totally fine Now I don't do that. If the girl happily gives me a number I don't say just so you know, but if the girls bit hesitant or she doesn't she wants to take mine or whatever Then I'd say listen, I know like often guys get a number and they just text you a hundred times I'm much too proud for that. I'll text you once twice if you don't see me, that's fine. Usually that's enough. Okay now Imagine this you're walking down the street. You're a girl you're wearing an Okay outfit and then some guy runs down the street Jumps in front of you and says stop. I had to come all the way down here and tell you I like your style Right and she's like fuck off so I Don't I would say don't go and tell girls you like this style. I Do sometimes but I tell them I love what I like about the way they're dressed the way that it makes them Right, so But I don't want you to do it at all so tell her You're sexy. You're gorgeous. You look amazing today. Yeah, I love the way you walk. Yeah This outfit in the Sun you look Just like make it about the woman because otherwise it ends up being you run down the street. Oh, I like your shoes She's like no you don't Okay, so keep that in mind And then you got dug yourself deeper by saying oh, it's secondhand you do it's like secondhand or anything And she's like I'm Russian we don't do secondhand And then you insulted her and then it got worse Anyway, that's right Her name's Maria and you went Maria the most common name in the world Maria Everyone's fucking called Maria What's your name? Maria So it's just Maria, yeah She says the name. Oh cool. And same same with when the other girl whose name was some interesting name. I'm like, whatever Okay, I know I don't wanna So she said Maria and of course, I have a few ex whose name are Maria So I thought of that but I couldn't say that I so I should have reframed it in You know, I once knew a Maria or anything doesn't matter just like your name is Maria. Cool. Cool. Oh, yeah, just it's like And especially like when you meet a girl who's got an exotic name that doesn't that's interesting to us and you say wow That name is really interesting. It actually it's actually like weirdly insulting because you keep saying oh and your culture That's a name. Oh those those sounds sound weird. And that's a name. I guess I could like it Just like your name is but dinga bonga bonga. Cool. That's your name. How do I sit it right? Okay, nice Just a name What's in a name? And then at the end like you've got to read the room a little bit better like she's like and I'm really in a hurry Right and and you did handle. Well, he said I can't call a walk with you Then you stopped her said look, you know, I'll get your number and then you're like, oh, what are you doing right now? She's like, I mean I fuck Why are you running to Okay, go go go go and then you and then you got it you like go go go right but it's it's like She's really in a hurry cool, I'll get your number. All right, I'll talk to you soon. Bye All right, let her go because because it just shows a little slight level of miscalibration that she's told you She's in a rush a couple times and you're still going. Oh, so what are you doing? Why are you in a hurry right now? See how it's like. Yeah Yeah, and she's Russian and they're half and they nasty and hard so, you know, you've got that bit as well All right Okay, are you French Okay, because you have the same accent I have so I thought we have something in common what school are you going to? The Spanish English, yeah, because we don't we don't speak Spanish, okay I know you I know you I know you you might be you might be late, right, but it's okay Just tell me your name, my name is John That's a French name, that's why I don't know Differently Anyway though Have a good class So what happened there You make trying to make it too complicated Right, and you're not really registering the scenario like she was moving very fast as soon as you opened her She was not rude, but she was like I really am in a hurry. I would have just immediately said, okay, let's walk together Yeah, right, but then then you know later you stopped her and started like really slowly saying so she's like And he's like, I know you're a hurry. So yeah, so but is that a French name? I know you I know you I know you you might be you might be late, right, but it's okay Just tell me your name, my name is John That's a French name and it's like her name Just ask her where she's from stop fucking around with like, oh, it sounds French. It's not she's Polish or something Yeah, just ask her where she's from Don't try and make it clever Don't worry about creative worry about like actually reading the room right now in this moment We don't have time to be clever. Oh very weird handshake What did they do? Oh, yeah, she did a weird thing and you were up. It was up here like this Alright, so offer offer me a handshake Just let it sink sink And then let it go right so it's like again So injured, you know say it by the way, why didn't he my name is John nice to meet you Okay, I saw you from there and I like to come and talk to you because you look amazing absolutely No She part for say The question on Badman that we sell one to be sure que tu es d'origine italienne, je suis d'origine luxembourgeoise, ville j'ai le nom de Berlin. So, she's from Switzerland, she's only here today, she's leaving today actually. The rest of the conversation, I try to slow it down and at some point she took a cigarette and I think, okay, she's going to light it and go away. And that's the opposite. She's going to light it to have a conversation and I was impressed. With you? With myself. As far as topics go, that's about it, it wasn't that long. And then how did it end? What happened at the end? At the end, I said, okay, so I have a nice day because I mean before you said, what was the context for you asking for the contact? I said, yeah, I'd like to, so I said, I'm visiting for one week, she said, I'm visiting for one week alone, I said, me too, but I said, this is kind of strange, but that's why we do it. So I create kind of a bound and then said, well, I'd like to meet you before you go, before you leave, and she said, I'm leaving today. Because she's leaving today, we can't see each other today or whatever, so all right, well, in that case, I'll get your Instagram, let's stay in touch, who knows when we'll be in the same city together, or maybe I'll come visit you in Switzerland, right? Something like that. But overall, how do you feel? Do you think you're happy with everything that was in there? I felt good, yeah. It felt really good, yeah. Okay, good, good, good. All right. Fine one who speaks only English. You are very Spanish, though, I think. Where are you from? I'm from Belgium. Belgium? It's my first time here. No, wait, wait. Oh, you work with children? Yeah, well, today, yeah. You're a teacher. Can I work with you for a while? Just a bit? Yeah. Okay, my name is Jean, actually. Hi. What's yours? What's yours? What's yours? What's yours? What's yours? What's yours? What's yours? What's yours? What's yours? What's yours? Okay, yeah, definitely Spanish. What are you doing? I'm on holiday. You're on holiday? Sort of holiday, and then I follow a workshop, also. Find a monkey inside of me, you know, a bit. The wild side? The wild side. You know about the wild side? Eh? The wild side, you know a bit about that? Yeah. Yeah. I can tell from the look in your eyes. Why? Yeah, something. I can, it's a guess. What? To be honest, it's a guess. Okay. Maybe you try it. I was going to eat, actually, but if you're done with all your different works today, I'd like to take you for a drink. Oh, I know, but I have a boyfriend. You have a boyfriend? It's weird. Yeah. Do you think so? Yeah. Yeah. It could have been different, I think. Yeah. Yeah. I like that interaction. Meeting her was a pleasant moment, actually. She reacted positively, tried to look in your eyes. I thought that was experienced, definitely. So just being straightforward. And then I was kind of straightforward. Yeah, yeah, I mean you were flirting. Yeah. I don't know whether or not it was amazing flirting. It doesn't matter. It was flirting. So when you said the wild side, which I think was like a misunderstanding, but good. Like it's good to misunderstand in the right way. You know about the wild side? The wild side, you know a bit about that? Yeah. I can tell from the look in your eyes. She challenged you on it. Like, why do you think I'm wild or something? And then, so basically she matched you and then you buckled. Right? So, the simple one when a girl says, what do you mean by that? You say, we'll find out later. You know what I mean? I don't need to go, oh I think you like sex. Yeah. So it's like, if a girl throws it back, oh yeah really, why? Then good, she's playing. So you've got to then match it with her. But I can diffuse it with that like, we'll find out later. Or just a guess, but I think I'm right. Like hold it and then release it. Which you more or less did. I think you got a bit thrown because she was so, you know, she was like, okay, you want to play little boy? Yeah. Look, that one was the like, I can't. I've got a boyfriend. You know, you saw that, she touched you. That's saying, look, if you wanted to, you could have totally gone, alright listen, I'll just get your WhatsApp. I'll text you sometime, if you're free. If not, totally cool. Because she like, that was definitely like, I've got a boyfriend but I think I want to fuck you. Ah, okay. Because, well that's how I interpret it, maybe not. But it certainly wasn't like, I've got a boyfriend, bye. It was like, she touched you, I can't because I've got a boyfriend. We are trapped. So that's your opportunity to go, alright, well, I'll just get your number. I'm not going to blow up your phone. I should always try to close even when I think it's bad because obviously sometimes it's good and I think it's bad so I should try to do it. But you read all those things I just said, right? You were aware that she was not saying fuck off. She was like, I wish I could, right? No, no, I was interpreting in a different way. It's like, yeah, yeah, you're a boy, little boy, that's how I interpret it. No, I don't think so. Okay, you're the expert. I mean, I don't know, I'm not inside her brain but that's how I interpret it. You're more likely right. Alright. Just wanted to say you look amazing. Like the prom queen or something. Wait, wait, you are going somewhere? No, I'm with my friends. Ah, where are they? This direction? So you're like, trying to hang with them, see where they are? No, we're in a store because we needed to go to a restaurant. Okay. Yeah, emergency call. Yeah. You are from here? Mexico. Mexico, okay. Where are you from? I'm from Belgium. So we have like lots of cervezas. We drink like the... Yeah, but I like my women conscious so I like when they don't drink that much, you know, like just a sip or two. Okay, your friends are here? Yeah. We have a very short interaction. How can we potentially close? Okay, I'm really liking your vibe but I think we should... I know we just met. I know we don't know each other. Because that's the context. Wait, so this is where your friends are? Okay, stop for a second. I know we just met. You've got an awesome energy about you. Would you like to have a coffee sometime? Get to the point. She's about to leave and I get it. I know you gotta go, I know we just met. But how about we do this anyway? Yes, no, bye. Cool. Like, knowing that you only had a very short amount of time, you said you're from Belgium and all you talk about is Belgian beers. Or change. It's like, okay, you know, it's like me going, oh, I'm from Australia, you know we have kangaroos? Yeah. So, if it's gonna be about Belgium, it's like, hey, I'm from Belgium. It has to be about me more. Yeah, but personally I really much prefer the vibe here or something about Belgium, something about not being Belgian. Knowing that you've got a very short amount of time there, don't waste your shots on random clich\u00e9s. I know it's a lot to try and think of when she's not that open, but she wasn't closed either. She wasn't closed, yeah. I always try, how compliant is she? Like, that's why I start and then I walk. Yes, but I would have asked to walk with her. Instead of walking, starting walking. Well, because you were like, oh, you're this way and then you just did it. Wait, wait, you were going somewhere? No, I'm with my friends. Oh, where are they? This direction? And I do that when the girl's open straight away. So, if I go, hey, how are you doing? She's like, oh, hi. And then she's sort of walking and I just walk and we just kind of continue. Sure, right? But when she's not sure about it all, which was that one, then you say, oh, you're walking this way? Yeah, cool. Oh, well, I'll just walk with you for one minute. Cool? Alright, let's go. Just to give her that time constraint so she knows, okay, he's not following me. This is not going to get awkward. He's just asking for one minute of my time. That should be like yes, probably. Let's go. No, it's true. Thank you. Can I walk with you a bit? No, sorry, I'm in a rush. You're in a rush? Okay. Yeah, no worries. But thank you. Where are you going? Home. Home? Alright. I want to know where it is. Okay, have a good day. Thank you so much. Oh, thank you. You're about to say, I like your style. Don't say, I like your style. It's just wearing pants and a shirt. The girl said, can I walk with you? She says, no, leave immediately. Don't say, oh, where are you going right now? Because she's laughing, but she started feeling uncomfortable from that second onwards. Alright? So, do you mind if I walk with you? Oh, actually, no. Okay, cool. Have a good day. Bye. Because she's told you, that's enough. And women won't always be very, very clear, in their signals. You don't look like you're overwhelmed by the... You are, maybe, but you look... Yeah, we're trying to keep up. We're trying to be positive. Because... You have a big smile, your eyes look full of life. We've come through a lot of stuff, actually. Also, in Spain, we have some obstacles. But what do you like personally? Like, you're working for the cinema industry or something. What do you do? I'm in computer. Oh. Like, programming and... Something like that. So, you used to be surrounded by a lot of men. Very masculine environment. Not very subtle. Started from the university. Yeah, and then, you never see a girl anymore. It's like, only men. Yeah, actually, there was some girls. Actually, in my group, in my class... So, you bonded with girls, like, girl power together. There are actually a few of us. Everyone is nice. Do you live in here? No, I live in Brussels, Belgium. So, you just came here? Yeah, a bunch of different stuff. Yeah. I was going to eat now, but I'd like to take you on a drink tonight if you have the time. Maybe later this week? Yeah. It can be like a cool public place. A nice environment. Not too much alcohol. I don't drink usually, so no problem. I can compete with an Ukrainian, I think. It's been a while since I had heavy drinks. I like that. Healthy. I'm really out of shape. Yeah. So, you want to fight? I want to get back. Once upon a time, I drank 12 beers in a row. I don't drink beer, but... Vodka, I can go. It's more like wine whiskey. No, no, no. I'm not that young anymore, so... That's cool. Yeah, there was a time when I could drink almost everything. I don't know. It's uncomfortable. Yeah? If the wind would be less strong, less cold, maybe it would be nice. I guess it's never perfect. Or is it? A couple of days ago, it was actually nice. Don't despair. The weather is going to come back. Someday. When it snows, you won't be in any trouble. Okay, I'll give it to you. I'm making a shadow. Okay, I'll text you. For sure. Don't despair. I'm sure the weather is going to be great someday here. No problem. When we meet again, okay? Have a good day. Alright, so... I think you got a bit overexcited because she was so cute. The problem was, you cut her off so many times, and you finished her ideas for her multiple times. Did you notice this? Like, she says, Oh yeah, in Spain we had some difficulties. Oh yeah, I bet you something. You'd look so positive. Also, in Spain we had some obstacles. What do you like personally? We're trying to keep up. We're trying to be positive. You have a big smile. Your eyes look full of life. I have that tendency. Yeah. So, luckily, she was invested in the conversation, so she struggled to get her point across. But a number of times you made an assumption about what she was going to say, and it wasn't quite right. And it's pointless to jump in. Once upon a time, I drank twelve beers in a row. I don't drink beer. Vodka. Vodka can go with anything. It's more like wine or whiskey. Wine or whiskey. Okay. She doesn't speak... Her English is pretty good, actually, but she's taking her time to try and get her thoughts together. So just chill. She's happy to be there. Let her express the thing she was trying to say, and then further. Because you kept on jumping in, clipping, speeding it up, misunderstandings, which didn't need to happen. Yeah. So, ask the question or whatever, let her say the thing, and then stop for a second, and then allow an actual silence of a second or something before you move on. Yeah. Too excited, maybe. Yeah. And there's just a lot of assumptions, which, like, when she said she's in IT, you were like, oh, so there's no guys there. She's like, well, actually, there were some girls there. So, you know, I guess there's no line for the bathroom. She's like, well, not exactly. Like, I'm trying to tell you. Yeah. So it's just like, oh, what was that like being in a department where I guess there's mostly men? Over to you. Right now. I don't need to assume it. She can explain. Actually, there was quite a lot of girls in the... Oh, right. That's interesting. Must be different in Ukraine than where I'm from. That's mostly a male thing. All right. Fine. So, that was the main thing. At the end, I think you were... I mean, you were trying to sell the date, right? Because you said, oh, I'd like to take you for a drink sometime. She said, I can't tonight. And you're like, oh, it can be in a public place, a nice atmosphere. It can be like a cool public place, a nice environment, not too much alcohol. I don't drink usually, so no problem. She's like, what? And maybe you were trying to make her feel like safe or something. But, you know, you are safe. You've asked her respectfully for a drink. She said yes, so then we don't need to sell it. It's like, okay, awesome. What's better for you? What's that for? That's why I did it. She was giving no physical indications. She wasn't backing away. She was just standing there, talking to you. I wasn't paying attention. It's pretty obvious. When a girl's like that, as opposed to here I'm standing, staring you in the eyes, she feels fine. And in general, you never need to sell the date. We're just like, hey, I want to take you out sometime, tonight, whatever, so can I have your contacts? I'll figure it out. Where are we going is irrelevant. It's just a place we'll go to spend time together. I'm not asking you to come over to my apartment straight away, so it's like, yeah, we'll meet at the toughest place, which will be public. I mean, she knows that. But look, again, it worked. So I'm nitpicking, and I'm calling things out at the blind spots, but overall, you did the great opener, you had a nice vibe, you had a laugh with her, she liked it, that's just as likely to be a not flaky number as any other. It seems pretty solemn, maybe not, but she's just arrived, she doesn't go out and drink anymore, she's staying with her friends, so maybe this is the first guy she's met here. And she's like, well, I'm still a woman, so follow that up. Good, that's a lovely woman. Good, that's it. Thank you. Gentlemen, I hope you enjoyed that sneak peek behind the scenes of what goes on inside an infield session on our live seduction workshops.
