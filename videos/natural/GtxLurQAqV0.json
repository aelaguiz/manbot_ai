Yeah, just take you around the bedroom, and you guys have seen the bedroom before, but now I wanted to take you through the eyes of a lady, what it would be like to experience entering the pleasure parlor with me, welcome. My place is usually tidier than this, so you can imagine what it would be like if it was set up properly, I guess. So what I wanted to show you here is how my bedroom sometimes looks. Honestly, it looks something like this. But when there is a woman, and sometimes it looks like this after I've had an amazing night with a lady, and that's totally fine, okay? There's detritus from the previous night's date. That's fine after, but it's not okay before. So this is something that may seem kind of simple and rudimentary, but it is something that you need to be aware of, is that you are always preparing to get laid, right? So if you go out on a date, even if you're not sure whether or not she's going to come home with you, which often you're not, you should be preparing your space, whatever it is, whether it's the simplest studio apartment or share house or basement, or whether it's a cool baller house or apartment, regardless of that, you want to make your space work for you as best as it can. You want the woman to walk into a space and think these words, I could be fucked in here, right? As opposed to, uh, I was horny, but there's things in this environment that mean that I'm turned off and it's very difficult for me to get out of my head and thinking about stuff to actually get into the flow of enjoying being seduced by this man, when it's clear that he doesn't know how to seduce a woman because his environment speaks volumes. So this is perhaps a little exaggerated, but I want to give you a little tour of what's wrong with this bedroom set up at the moment. The first thing you'll notice is that I'm extremely well lit, right? Even when I'm standing, even though we have lights in the room for extra lighting, this is way too bright, right? We don't want to be coming into a seduction location with bright lights, bright overhead lights. Even if, you know, kind of you would think, well, wouldn't it be fun to fuck her under floodlights? Yeah. Okay. Maybe on the second time or another day in the daytime, but first seduction evening, we want it to have mood lighting. And right now the mood here is welcome to my clinic as opposed to welcome to my boudoir. Now over here, whoops, I've left some evidence from my previous nights or weeks activities, right? So probably you wouldn't be leaving a condom, a thing to put in someone's mouth, a silk tie and some ropes. Probably not. But this is a, this can be a common mistake for men that are fairly sexually active is that they don't clean up after themselves. So you always want to make sure after a sexual encounter, if you have multiple lovers, that there are no little bits of condom wrappers or condoms under the bed or anywhere that could be found inside the bed covers. And be aware of things like long blonde hairs, if you don't have long blonde hair and your next lover is a brunette, right? So you do want to be aware of that kind of thing. Now I'm not saying that you're necessarily hiding from, hiding the fact from a lover that you have other lovers. If you are in multiple relationships or you have multiple lovers, that's okay as long as it's ethically, I mean, it can be great as long as it's ethically discussed. But still, if you had a situation where you had a woman that you cared about and you liked and you were seeing her sometimes, you knew that she saw other dudes, but you went over to her place and then, uh, found underneath her pillow an XXXL condom, which is not your size or, you know, a pair of male underpants might, might throw your game off a little bit, right? So you think about things you shouldn't be thinking about. Tidy up after yourself. Don't be sloppy. Make sure that there's no evidence of any other girl having been here. So she gets to feel like the queen that she is for whatever time that she's your queen. Moving on. My bed is not only not made, but it's filthy. The sheets, trust me, are covered in a genetic material from another woman. Very important that you at least have two sets of sheets, right? That you're not finding yourself in a situation where, Oh no, I got to flip it over and now I got to turn it that way to try and hide the cum stains or the girl squirting stains or whatever it is on there. So make sure that you change the sheets every time you're going out on a date. This is good mental preparation as well. You should be going out on dates, going out for seductive situations with you within the end game confidence. Like, okay, we're not always going to bring a girl home. It's not always going to happen, but you should be prepared for it to happen so that when she comes into your environment, she thinks, Hmm, I could be fucked in here and you're not going, Oh shit, there's a condom, I should have, I really should have spent five minutes preparing this space. So messy bed, dirty bed that smells, uh, you know, I've, I've also got my eye, eye mask and earplugs, which makes me look like an old man. It's noisy outside, I swear. And then what do we got over here on my desk, right? Well, this is not the right kind of thing. So firstly we have a bottle of wine and two glasses. Now, if I had a bottle of wine in one glass, that would be slightly better, but it wouldn't be great because it makes it look like I sit and drink a bottle of wine by myself every night. So no matter how much you drink and who you drink it with, make sure all that's out of the way. Uh, other little bits of evidence, like for example, right here, I've got a trezor, uh, not an active one, but you know, a prop one. Uh, if I was to leave cash around or anything valuable with a stranger, look, I'm not saying that you're going to get, get robbed, but don't make it easy on somebody. So don't leave anything that's obviously valuable sitting around, uh, you know, evidence of my coffee and, and pastry breakfast and some, any kind of medication, right? Like you don't want a girl to be thinking about what are your, what are your physical ailments? And so don't leave any kind of pills or medication no matter what it is, uh, sitting around or obviously in the bin. Cause then she starts thinking, what's wrong with this man? So yeah. Uh, and then, you know, just generally the place is a mess. The lights are bright. Uh, it's in no way a conducive situation to seduce a woman. And this can be fixed extremely easily. Now, it doesn't matter again, whether you're in a cheap group house or studio apartment or whether you're in a mansion, uh, well, I mean it can have an effect certainly, but for most of my sexual life, I was poor, I was living in shitty kind of accommodation situations, but I still worked with what I had, right? So work on the mood, the lighting, the neatness, the creating a space where the, where the woman feels comfortable and sexy. That's what's important. So let's see if we can tidy this place up and fix it up. My apologies. Let's try that again. Welcome. Well, that's much better, isn't it? You can feel the mood. So if we just talk through what are the differences from the previous disgusting frat boy pad to this one, firstly and primarily is the lighting. Now, I've got lots of cute lights around my house and it was designed by me specifically to create nice moods, you know, for playing chess and reading Shakespeare, oh, and having raucous sex. Now, whether or not you have a fancy lighting system or not, doesn't really matter. What you need to be aware of is, okay, how do I create mood lighting at the basics? It's having a lamp with a low wattage, a warm bulb, you don't want to have like those clinical white ones that they have in a dentist because that's not unless you're doing a dental fantasy play, but you want the lighting to be warm and low, right? So having a couple of cheap Ikea lamps or ones that you bought at a secondhand shop or whatever, totally fine. And you can even get those USB ones online, which you plug in for like 20 bucks and they have different colors and different, uh, you know, warmth that you can have with the light. So it's regardless of your budget or how baller or not your apartment is, you can make the lighting look nice. You want it to be that it feels soft that you can see, right? You know, it's not generally a good idea to have sex in the dark. It's people fumbling around and it's, you can easily disassociate from each other. But having lighting where the woman feels comfortable, if it's too bright, then she's going to feel exposed and vulnerable and, and worried about what a body looks in this looks like in this lighting. Whereas in this soft, warm lighting, everyone looks sexy. All the pores disappear. All the curves have a little bit of shadow on them, which make, you know, makes your abs pop out and makes her butt look even nicer. So keep the lighting warm and diffuse. Okay, secondarily, bed is made and sheets are clean, simple, you know, should be easy to achieve before a date or when you start the day, uh, so that she walks in and goes, cool, that's a nice place to get fucked on as opposed to, uh, got to move these underwear underwear and I need to help him make the bed before we have sex. That's for little boys. A man knows how to make his own bed. Moving on near to the bed. Now, what you want to make sure is that within arm's reach of the bed, uh, all the toys and tools that you may need to have sex and very importantly, water. So right now here, okay, right next to the bed, I've got my drawers. Now what I wouldn't waste this real estate near to me to the bed by putting socks in it, would I? No. So if you, here is my general toy drawer and it means that I can easily access a condom, a silk tie, eight different types of vibrators, butt plugs, whatever it is that I need is within easy reach. You know, you're on the bed, we're doing this stuff and I go over here, huh? Prophylactic device. And then I move on to that without needing to go, Oh, my wallet's out there. I'm just, just stay horny for a moment. I'm just going to go out and get the condom. No, or the sex toy or the silk tie or whatever it is. Make sure that it is easy to access. Next I always have next to my bed when a woman's coming over water. Now I don't usually put two glasses cause it's maybe a bit presumptuous and we don't need to. By the time that we're drinking out of the same cup, we've already been exchanging fluids. So that's fine. But I make sure that there's, and I choose to put filtered water so it tastes nice and I have it there because if you are having long sex sessions, which is what you're aiming to do, I would say when either or both of yours mouth gets dry during sex, it means that we're dehydrated at that point. We've been sweating, we've been fucking, maybe we were drinking wine before and we're feeling dehydrated. And so this can absolutely affect the ability for the woman's vagina to lubricate and it doesn't feel nice to kiss each other when you've got dry saliva-less mouths. So I do this commonly during a long sex session. Say we've, we started, we've built up to like the first or second kind of in most intense moment, you know, with some hard fucking and then, you know, we're catching our breath. Then I'll just reach over and take the glass and drink some water and hand it to her and say drink. Right? Because sometimes a woman will politely decline because I don't know why, like she's thirsty, but she's like, Oh, I don't need some. So I usually say have some water or drink something, right? Because the moment that she has a few sips of water and you do too, both of your mouths are now lubricated again, you get back into the wet and sloppy kissing and her vagina is going to be easily lubricated and she's going to have fluid to squirt with if that's where we're heading. So I always make sure that water is an arm's length away from the action as well. And finally over here, any other areas of the room, desk, couch or whatever should be neat. I don't want to have like everything gone. It's fine. I've got my laptop here. I've got my lamp. I've got some coins or whatever. Those kinds of things are fine. Um, but I just don't want it to be messy and I don't want it to give away things about myself that I don't want her to know, right? My messiness, my medication, the porno that I was flicking through, whatever it is I wanted to go, okay, there's a gentleman with a laptop and a desk. Okay. What goes on here? Who knows? Over here, very important, have a box of tissues and or towels, right? I mean, I would say in general, what you want to have is a box of tissues nearby and towels available so that she can tidy up afterwards. If you came all over her tits, some girls love to just let it dry in or rub it in and they want to leave it there and soak in the masculine goodness. And other girls after the, after the erotic moment want to get cleaned up. So I always have that there by the bed. So she basically like, so she can make the decision, right? It's like often a girl will reach for the tissues or if she's sitting there afterwards and she's got that look of like, eh, what do I do now? Like I'm all sticky as opposed to, mm, that was sexy. Then I'll, I will get up, take the tissues, don't throw them at her, hand them to her. And then I will, I don't watch her doing that, right? Like it's fun to watch me putting it on, but it's less erotic. If she's there, you know, like taking it off her tits or whatever, just give us some like mental space, right? So I'll hand her the tissues and then I'll, whatever, I'll do something else, put my clothes on or take a glass of water or something else. So I'm just giving her that little bit of space, but she has the ability to clean up. I'll usually also have towels in the room that are clean, meaning that, okay, same kind of thing. Maybe we had messy anal sex and afterwards I wrap her in the towel and then I walk her to the bathroom and she can go and tidy herself up, right? So important stuff. And finally, music. Now I recommend getting one of these, a JBL Flip 5. They're about 80 euros and they have more, far more volume than you need. Uh, they're great for taking on picnics, taking to the beach and they're also excellent for quick. I mean, I carry this with me whenever I'm traveling, you know, I'm traveling all the time and this is part of my traveling seduces kit as well as a USB light, right? As I mentioned that before, in case I'm going to an Airbnb which doesn't have any lamps or has bad lighting, then I'll bring my own so you can have your like little travel seduces kit. So usually when I come into the room with the woman, so maybe we came in, we sat down on the coach and the couch and had a glass of wine, um, and at some point maybe she goes to the bathroom or even when we're just coming in and she's taking a coat off and getting herself settled, I'll come into the room, turn this on, connect it to my phone. I have a playlist as you should too. And if you don't just look up, uh, inoffensive, sexy music to have sex to, so you know, basically R&B, jazz, something that's funky and cool, EDM that's down, down tempo and kind of chilled stuff. Like you don't want to get too avant-garde with your music choices. You don't want to be specialized or niche. If you're super into metal, too bad, unless you're bringing home a metal chick and you guys want to fuck the metal, then you want to have stuff that's like generally acceptable. So having, you know, R&B of some sort, something that's sexy and doesn't take too much thinking is good to have. So I'll come in, put on my prepared playlist, which I've listened to so many times, very familiar with those songs, uh, and not have it so like, you don't want it loud, so loud that we have to raise our voice if we're talking to each other. It's supposed to be. background music. It's really just to make people feel comfortable, to kind of cover up some of the slapping, smelching noises that you might get, which may take someone out of the moment early on in the sex play. Like usually once people are immersed, they don't care what sounds are going on. But you know, people can feel initially trepidatious or a bit embarrassed. So having some cool music in the background that just adds to the ambience and the vibe is going to be good as well. And there you have it. Pretty simple. What do we need to think about? Lighting, cleanliness. Obviously it needs to smell nice. So be aware of if you've not opened the window to your room for a week and you've been eating bananas and jacking off, then it's going to smell like jizz and bananas. So, okay, make sure it's fumigated. Light some incense or light an oil burner if you need to. I mean, I often do that anyway. I won't do that straight. Like I'll do that like before I go on the date, right? So the place smells nice and then the smoke and the fumes have dissipated by the time we get home. What else? Water available. Tissues and towels available. Music playing. It's warm. You know, so basically we've affected all of her senses positively so that she's not getting in her head and going, eh, this is not quite right. This is not how I imagined this. As opposed to she comes into a little erotic fairyland, right? She walks in the door of your apartment or into your room, both, and it feels nice. You know, soft lighting. It's warm. It smells nice. Everything is neat. It doesn't, you know, regardless of how expensive or flashy anything is, it's like, cool, whatever, whatever, you know, economic level you're living under, it works and it looks nice. She, she walks in and goes, yeah, okay, I can, I can justify fucking this man in this space. I don't need to think about that. And then she can get into the immersive flow. I hope you enjoyed this little tutorial where I show you how to turn any old bedroom into a boudoir where a lady would like to get fucked.
