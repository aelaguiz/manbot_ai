Is that right? Cool. Nice. Can someone give me a hi there, James? I can hear you and see you, so I know that I'm not in a simulation talking to myself in an insane asylum. You better let me know soon. Or maybe, maybe you guys can't have access until actually 4 p.m. so probably I am actually talking to myself. So James, I've been thinking, it's maybe it's time to settle down, get a real job. Oh hi, I was just talking to myself. Hey Justin, can you hear and see me? Looks like, is that a yes? Adam, are you there? Can you hear and see me? Someone put in the chat. Straightaway, how to deal with STD. All right, good, good, good. Well, it looks like we're in the right place then. All right, so firstly, good afternoon. James Marshall here, checking in from Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. Can I get some shoutouts? I'd like to hear where, what countries and cities are you guys checking in from? Espa\u00f1a, from London. Gris, Sopris, Salt Lake City, Utah. Americans always say the city, then they say the state. That's what they do. Sri Lanka, Brazil. Sorry, hang on. Brazil, Brazil. That's where I am right now. So Germans, Russia. Okay, okay. How did you get? All right, we'll let that go. What else? Bangalore, India. Seattle, India. Poland, Z. Okay, in that case, dude, fuck off. Seriously, I'm seriously, get off the chat. Adam, can you take him off? He's putting a Z. I'm not willing to accept that. Seriously, dude, fuck off. Leipzig, Germany. Belarus, same goes for you, buddy. Japan. No, I reserve judgment. If you put that letter up, you're out. Cool. Hey, Sydney, mate. Fuck me, mate. More from India. Welcome. Okay, good. We've got a nice international crew. Very welcome. All right. From Czech Republic. Okay, I know who that is. Nice. All right, gentlemen. So today, the point of this here webinar is to firstly, as you well know, I've been promoting the launch of the Master Lover Method hard for a long time. That's why my YouTube channel has changed from dating advice and pick up to like, hey, is that how to do anal sex? You guys know, right? We've been obviously pushing the boundaries of what's allowed on YouTube and what we've discovered is if it's educational content and it doesn't show nipples or pussies, you can put it up. Cool. Awesome. So the point of today's chat is to answer any questions that anyone has about the course. So if anyone's like curious, but they're not, they've got something that they want to have queries about, then feel free to ask those questions. But primarily, I'm here to be at your disposal to answer any questions that you have. I mean, mainly sex related, but you know, if you've got dating questions or lifestyle design questions, I wouldn't ask you anything about crypto or investing or things I don't know about. But other than that, let's get into it. One guy says, I've downloaded the last 100 videos just in case. Wise move. Wise move. You never know. You never know. Okay, so basically hit me with questions and I will get into it. Now, why the time limit to buy the course? Because there is a live component to it. So basically, the course is pre-recorded primarily, but there is a very active live telegram group and there are also live webinars. So it's designed as a progressive five week course. And I'm there every day working with the guys to get into it. And that's what I'm really looking forward to. I mean, I already have been, but that's what I much prefer doing than marketing. Seriously. You know, I've had to do a lot of marketing for the course as you do when you run a business. But what I love doing is teaching. And so that's why I'll be focusing on the teaching from next week. How to get rid of fear of STDs. Okay. Well, this is this is definitely a legitimate question. What I've been looking at firstly is, okay, what is what is the likelihood of getting whatever type of STDs and what can we do in order to prevent them? Now, if you are wearing condoms with every partner, then you are protected to 99 point something percent of getting any kind of STD, except for one. So, you know, in terms of getting HIV, chlamydia, gonorrhea, what are the other classics? Syphilis, you know, all the nasty ones. Having a plastic barrier between you and your partner means you're safe. As safe as, you know, as safe as anything. Okay. Nothing is 100% safe. If you want that, then never leave your house. And, you know, nothing is 100% safe, but it's pretty damn safe. The one there is the one where you can't like condoms don't necessarily help is herpes, because usually when people get herpes, it's not necessarily on the penis or inside the vagina. It can be around. So, you know, having, let's say, groin to groin contact means that it can be transferred. And a large percentage of the world's population, I think it's 20 or 30 percent or something, have it. And often they have it and they don't even know, because if you have a strong immune system, you can have it and never show any symptoms. So, okay, that's one that maybe you can't particularly protect against. But, you know, at the end of the day, it's like, okay, sex is messy, life is dangerous. You wear a condom, 99.9% is pretty good. How do you get over the fear of it? Well, it's like, what do you prefer, freedom or fear? Like, we could say it with almost any, with any kind of topic. It's like fear is what holds people back. There is dangers in everything, to some degree or another. You have to decide what's more important to you, trying to live in absolute safety or having the freedom to enjoy life. Is the silk tie going to be available again? No, it's not. Like, the silk tie, it costs me money to produce. It's not like, if I was to sell it, you know, as a standalone product, it's absolutely in no way profitable and it takes a lot of my time because I have to get someone to sew it and then someone to mail it and dealing with, you know, customer problems and postal problems or whatever. I'm only doing it for the launch. I'm doing it as a, you know, as a favor to the guys that are signing up for the course. I've had 150 of them handmade, well, actually more now because we ran out of the 150, so I'm getting another hundred made, handmade and then mailed by my friends in Portugal and after that, that's it. As I've said many times before, if you want to make one, don't be fucking lazy. It's extremely easy to make it. Like, it's not my responsibility. Two meters long, extra 30 centimeter loop, buy some silk, draw it, take it to any tailor, say, make this for me and I'll make it in three days. If you can't figure that out, I can't help you. Or, buy the course and you'll get it for free. This one, do you have any experience with PrEP? Would you recommend it? No, I don't. So PrEP, I mean, I've researched it. PrEP is like some kind of drug which apparently if you take it and then you had sex with someone who had HIV, you wouldn't get HIV and apparently it's, I mean, I did research it, apparently it is reliable but I have no personal experience with it and I don't want to be, you know, endorsing something that is that important but apparently it works. Let me know. Okay, so this question is, how do you get over the you are not enough problem? Right, so just to paraphrase what this gentleman has said, you know, I've been teaching seduction and working with men for 15 years and without question I can easily tell you what is the primary problem and it's what this what this gent has alluded to which is that the biggest problem that men have is not conversational or sexual technique or lifestyle related, it's that they don't feel like they are worthy and worthy of what? Well, okay, in this context, worthy of attractive women and there's no one answer to this because you know I've been working on trying to solve this problem for many years and there's lots of different angles to work on it from. So I'll just give you a couple of random ideas to play with. The first one is to think about, well, the truth is you're not worthy for some people, right, like I mean every day, like today me and Keegan went to get a juice and we walked past a cute girl and I waved at her and she didn't say anything and then I ran back and I did a proper get in front stop and she looked at me like this, like she had headphones on and she walked around me and walked off, right. James Marshall got rejected? Yeah, of course, of course, I get rejected every second time or whatever, you know, like that happens to every single man for the rest of your fucking life no matter how good you are. That girl never got to find out how good I was because she took one look at me, went gringo and thought that or whatever she thought and then she fucked off. So the reality for, in her reality, I am not worthy of her and it's true for her, right, and there's nothing that there's nothing I can do to convince her otherwise and there's not no amount of in a game or meditating or ayahuasca or anything I can do to make me worthy of that girl because for whatever instant reason she decided that I'm not worthy. So that's one thing to initially accept is that you are absolutely not worthy for many, many women and you do the same thing. Every time you walk down the street you immediately decide that probably something like 90% of the women are not worthy of your sexual attention, right, and it's true because to you that's the truth. So that's, I don't know if that's a, I mean for me that makes me, I like that thought, like it makes me just go, oh yeah, I'm not for everybody, everyone's not for me, I'm not, you know, I'm not worthy of them, they're not worthy of me in some sense and that's just going to be part of the way it is, okay. So trying to, like trying to hold, trying to figure out a way that you will always be worthy and valuable and that more women are going to like you and that you feel that at a deep level and so on, it's not that important because it's not, it's not going to be a, it's not going to be a felt sense reality. So maybe that takes a little bit of the pressure off. Then what we need to look at is, okay, if we cut out all the other, all the women that just on-site don't like you for whatever reason and we look at the potential women who could be potentially interested in you, now you want to be looking at what is it, this is now, this is your internal stuff, what is it that you think makes a man worthy and then you need to go and find evidence that there are other things that make a man worthy because like the classic ones that most men perceive is their looks, their height and their wealth and let's say their status and their game in the sense of like how charismatic and able they are to, you know, to charm people. So if you, if you've decided, well, this is where I feel like a lot of the kind of red pill stuff goes awry because guys perceive that there is a very setting stone set of metrics that make you worthy or not. It's a specific height, it's a specific number in a bank account, right? It's a specific number of followers on Instagram or whatever and that's where it becomes, that's where it's actually inaccurate, right? So what you need to do, let's take it really practical, let's say you've decided you are going to approach women, you go to approach women and then you see a lady that you like the look of and then this self-talk comes up, I'm not worthy for XYZ reasons. The simplest way to figure out that, well, firstly you could tell yourself, I may or may not be worthy but some people are gonna like me. It's just, it's just gonna be part of the facts of life because men and women generally are attracted to each other in general and every woman wants to fuck, that's straight, needs to fuck somebody and it may as well be you. So then I would be thinking, okay, let's go and find out. Let's just go and find out and if the answer is to her, you're not worthy, okay, I found out. Let's move on to another one and let's go and find out again. Let's go and find out what women really actually want from a man because yeah, of course, like, you know, if given the choice between just a photo, she's gonna choose the chat or whatever her version of the hot guy is but that's not what really ignites a woman sexually, what really gets her into a guy. Most of the, all of the guys that I know that are exceptional with women, none of them are like tens, none of them are six foot four fucking jacked and perfect jawlines and all that. Like they're, some of them are better than average, some of them a bit less than average, some of them are chubby, some of them are short, you know, I'm tall but I'm very skinny, I have a fucking long nose, my eyes are sunken. I work with what I got, you know, I make my hair in such a way and I craft my jawline, you know, I work with what I have but I'm not a ten. I know I'm at best, no, I was at best an eight when I was about 35 and now I'm maybe a seven, right? But the women that like me, I'm a ten because I know how to ignite their sexuality. I'm fucking confident and I'm not, but I'm not arrogant. I know what, and I know how to make a woman feel fucking amazing sexually but not just that emotionally in many other ways and that's the thing that makes her addictive. That's probably, that's why I know I'm worthy to many, many women because I know I can make them feel amazing and even when I didn't know that I could make them feel amazing, I knew that I was attempting to and that was, that was something I wanted to do and as a result I was gradually over time making women feel amazing and building my worthiness over time. There's some random thoughts upon that and I, you know, I have to be, I have to be a bit careful because I know, you know me, once I start ranting on one topic I could do it for an hour but I want to try and make sure I get as many questions answered as possible. Okay. Steve-O says, how do you know if a girl likes you even though she has a boyfriend because her and I have been texting a lot. I'm really confused and I don't want to ask her if she likes me. Okay. Look, I don't know the situation, but well, here's, here's, here's the potential options that I see what's going on here. She has a boyfriend, but she's interested in you. Maybe. Option two, she has a boyfriend, but she enjoys chatting to you because you fulfill some kind of need that the boyfriend doesn't fulfill, which is maybe, and I don't want to, you know, I don't have a situation, but maybe it's just that you listen to her and she can, she can vent to you or chat to you about things she wants to, that her boyfriend doesn't want to talk about or doesn't care about. If that's the case, then you're just being, well, whether or not she's using you, it's just, that's, that's your function in her life. If you've never met her, uh, then this is a, I don't know, I don't know if you already know this girl, if you've met her or whatever, but no, of course you shouldn't say, do you like me? If you want to find out if she likes you, then say, let's, let's meet up and go for a, go for a coffee. And then if she says, oh, I couldn't because my boyfriend, you're being used. Um, if she says yes, and if, I mean, this is where the ethical line comes in. I personally don't want to go on a date with a girl who has a boyfriend cause I don't want that mess in my life, but okay, up to you. And if you do decide to do that, then you go on a coffee date with a hangout, a date, whatever, like you meet up with her, you hang out with her and then you try to kiss her. That's when you'll find out if she likes you. Don't ever talk, don't, you're not, you're not trying to, you don't never discuss with any woman, boyfriend or regardless, do you like me before you guys, before you ever, you just ask girls out on dates, you go on dates with them, you do a bit of escalation, you lean in, you try to kiss her, you'll get your answer. Then you'll get a kiss. You'll get a whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I wasn't, this is a friend thing. Or you'll get this one where she turns her head cutely. That doesn't mean I don't like you. That means not right now. Try again a bit later. So that would be my, my, my advice. Don't, if you're just going to keep texting her forever, this is a waste of your time, buddy. Oh, we got lots of questions. Okay. Someone said, what's wrong with the last video? The big blowjob one. I don't know. What do you, what do you mean? What's wrong with it? You tell me. Is there something wrong with it? Yes. Yes. Someone said the silk tie video is taken down. Yes, it was taken down by YouTube. I don't know why. It's amazing that that was the only one that was taken down. They didn't, they haven't, I mean, they haven't notified us about it yet, so I'll find out, I guess. Okay. I'm going out talking with girls, taking numbers. I'm texting and they never answer. Welcome to Flex City, buddy. Welcome to the initial stages of approaching girls. Look, getting flakes is extremely common. Okay. So as I said, even, you know, even for me, absolutely for me, if I go and do a couple hours a day game and I get 10 numbers, five of them will inevitably flake probably somewhere around that depends on how good the day I am, depends on the stats. So you just have to accept that a lot, especially when you're starting out, most numbers will flake. And as you get better, less will flake, but still quite a lot will flake. So how do we work around that? Well, first of all, we just have to accept that that's going to be part of the game. And at the beginning, it's going to be more part of the game, but there are what, there are things we can do. First thing you can do to work around that is forget about getting numbers for the next week and try to do instant dates every time or whenever that's logistically possible. So approach, conversation, say, Hey, do you want to go, go and grab a coffee right now? Or if you're not busy right now, let's go and take a walk along the river or whatever the situation is so that you've got more so that you're stepping from the approach number close to, okay, now we're actually on a little mini date where I have more time to create rapport and reference memories for her about me. That's, that's an awesome thing to do. And it's an awesome thing to do anyway, right? Like for any guy that's never done that, it's a really awesome thing to know that you can just walk up to someone, start a vibe, and then actually segue into the date immediately. It works particularly well in kind of holiday locations, you know, beach approaches you know, bar streets in a park, places where people are chilling anyway, right? She's not on her way rushing to work. She's, she's out in a public space, enjoying the public space. And if she meets a charming stranger, then why wouldn't, it's quite likely she'd be happy for him to join her and for them to go on an immediate adventure. So that's one thing you can do to kind of get around the flaking. Second thing is to be clear when you close, like when you're asking for the contact details at the end of the interaction, to actually propose a clear date, right? So rather than saying, Hey, let's, I'll get your number. Let's hang out sometime, right? Uh, say, well, listen, you know, I've got to go now. You've got to go now. You're really cool. Enjoy chatting with you. Uh, let me grab your number and let's meet tonight for a drink. And that's what, that's a policy that I mostly do anyway. If I'm closing a girl, I try to meet her tonight or late or tomorrow at the latest, uh, because after two, three days, people forget each other. Like when you spend five minutes talking to a stranger, she's going to forget you or other things happen, you know, other guys get in the way. So I'm always trying to get the first date that night either immediately tonight or tomorrow. Uh, so in the interaction, you propose that let's do this tonight. Then if she says, Oh no, I absolutely, no, I can't because of whatever's happening tonight. Then I'll, I'll, I'll propose twice, not marriage a day. I'll propose twice. The second one was, Oh cool. Well, I've got, I've got time tomorrow before whatever, 3pm let's, let's grab a coffee around lunchtime. Sound good. Then if she says, Oh, I'm not sure really something. Then if I say the third one, now I'm getting, now it's getting creepy, right? She's like, ah, tomorrow I'm like, okay. In that case, the next day, no. How about the next day? No. Uh, then if she says after two, she, she gives me whatever excuse. I mean, people are busy. Okay. It's quite likely she does have something she has to do. Then I said, okay, in that case, I'll grab your number and I'll text you in a day and we'll figure something out. Okay. Now, now it's just a normal number clause. So, so when, whenever possible, try to get a verbal agreement that we're going to meet within the next 24 hours, that will definitely lower your front flake rates. Right. There we go. Do I think bars are good for meeting women? They're better than clubs for sure. Um, yeah, it depends on the type of bar and the ratio in the bar. Like the problem with a lot of bars is that they're sausage fests, right? Like they're just way too many men cause they're easy to get into. And so there's too many men in them and not enough girls. Uh, that tends to be the problem with bars and depends on, you know, whether they're violent or like very late, if it's all about drinking and I mean what it kind of is, right? Like the, in terms of bars, the ones I found to be the best are like quiet, cozy, little cocktaily lounges or like little hipster bars, um, or outside ones. Like right now I'm in Rio and there's fucking, the bar scene here is really good because they're, they're like open air half and then out on the street with people at little tables and standing around. And so I go into those and it's quite sociable. So, you know, those kinds of bars can be, can be good for sure. Um, and certainly if a woman's going out to get laid or going out with her girlfriends to get laid and she's, and she knows what that means, she knows how to do that. She won't go to a club. Usually she'll go to a bar, right? Cause clubs are about status and about dancing and about fucking sharp, bright lights. And, and very few people, male or female, get laid at clubs. They're, they're kind of the worst places to pick up. So yeah, I'd say it's fine. You know, bars are fine. And especially if you're a young guy who's a guy who likes going out anyway, like I, I never ever have a thing where I'm like, Hey man, let's go to the bar. Like there's no, I have no, no friends who like, that's what we do for fun. We don't go to bars. I did it in my twenties when I was a musician and I was, you know, hornier and had way more energy and was happy to stay out till four in the morning and liked getting drunk and that kind of stuff. Yeah, sure. Okay. So that's part of like a phase in your life. Um, but if you're not in that phase or that's not something you ever want to do, then you don't have to force yourself. Like day game is, is in my opinion, the best and most consistent way to make girls and good quality girls as well. Did I make Tom Terrero? No, I didn't. Rest in peace. Okay. There's a lot of cool questions, dudes. I'm just trying to choose one that I think everyone's going to find useful. Okay. So this gent says, what would a gradually socializing first cold approach ever plan look like? So I will interpret that sentence to mean what would a specific game plan preparing to do your first ever approach look like? And there's a big problem with this question. Does anyone want to answer why this, why this, and no offense, man, you know, I'm, I have to give you a little tough love here. Uh, why is this a problem? Anyone want to answer this one for me? It's too low. No need to plan. Okay. The problem is we don't need a complicated game plan to prepare, to go and do the first approach of your life. You need to go out immediately after this fucking webinar, walk up, walk past somebody and just say, hi, just fucking say hi. And if you won't do that, then give it up. Seriously. Just, just forget this. Just forget it. Just live your life. And sooner or later, somehow you'll bump into someone and you'll have a date some other way, right? Because if you can't go and say hi to someone without a 15 point plan, it's never going to happen, right? You just need to go and say hi. And then that was a bit of an approach. And next, and then the next one say, hi, how, how are you? And the next one say, you look great today. And then the next one say, you look great today. My name is right. Like, okay, you can stack the like bits of the sentence. You don't, we don't have to worry about committing to like doing a super ballsy direct approach and going from A to Z or whatever. The guys that get good at this are the guys that go and say hi. And then they, at the end say, can I have your number? There's your game plan. Like all the rest in the middle and becoming most artistic, amazing verbalist and cool ass seducer and projecting intent and all that is amazing stuff. But unless you can go and say hi and at the end, ask for a number, you're fucked. And there's no point. I'm so serious. I've been doing this for so long. And I've heard this question so many times. It frustrates me because the answer is so quick. All right. You got it. Again, this is coming from a place of love. I want you to get what you want. But don't keep going around asking dating coaches for a 15 point plan on how to say hi. Just say hi. I should, I should create some like techno song about that. Just say hi. But what about the midget? Shut up. Just say hi. Oh, that was good. You got me worked up. Okay. How can you avoid being too direct and cheesy? I find that to be my problem. Can you give me an example of a too direct and too cheesy? Um, well, let's, let's talk about directness a little, right? So back in the day, back in the early pickup days, it used to be the big debates was direct versus indirect. And the indirect guy was the guy who went over and over his shoulder went, oh, hey, uh, where's the nearest Starbucks around here? And she's like, over there. Oh, yeah, actually. And then, and then transition to the next mystery method thing. Uh, and then the direct guy was the guy, guy who ran over and went, you're so fucking sexy. You and I must, must connect. And that was the debates about which one of those was correct. Now, uh, I would, I would define directness as something else, right? Because there's, there is verbal direct, right? Which is where I go over and I verbally state that I find you attractive in some way or another, right? Whether I go and say, oh, stop, you're so fucking hot. I can't, it's doing my head in. Or whether I say, excuse me, lady, you look extremely elegant today. Okay. There's, there's all, you know, and then, and many, many other variations on ways that we might say that we find her attractive now is that direct could be, but it's, it's more to do with the alignment of our States.

No, not like not in the way that I would describe it, even though I'm saying the direct words."}
