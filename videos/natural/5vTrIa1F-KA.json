You just have to develop one, otherwise you feel purposeless. How to figure out your life's purpose. What is that? What's the assumption there? I don't know what my life's purpose is. Like, at the end of it, I think it's, I don't know, but I think it's like, there is no inherent purpose. The universe does not care about you. In fact, almost no one really cares about you, except your mom and a few other people. They don't really care, like, I think it's one of those weird things, because it's an effective delusion, but it can also be one that traps people into a lifetime of thinking that there's this thing that they need to figure out in order to have a purpose and that there's some magical storyline that they haven't quite found yet. On the other hand, you can make magical storylines, right? Like, so the hero's journey is so compelling to humans because it strikes that chord of the need or want to have a purpose. Because feeling purposeless sucks, right? It leads to nihilism. You can have simple, I mean, there's simple purposes that many people ascribe to, which is they are a part of a community and they have a family and they look after their children and they aim to keep them alive and doing better than they were and hopefully die in their sleep at 89. That's a very common life's purpose. And what's wrong with that? Nothing. It's probably the, it is the most common because it is achievable for most people. It makes sense with our genetic prerogative, right? Because, like, what is our purpose is to replicate and keep the children alive long enough that they can survive by themselves without you. The end, right? That's our genetic purpose. Fail. Everyone in TNL fail. And what's the purpose of that? There is none. Like, genes replicate themselves because they replicate themselves. What's the purpose of the coronavirus? Just to fucking divide. It doesn't have any other purpose. It just divides and does its program. So that, like, on a genetic level, I would say that's it. Is there a spiritual level to that? Is there an inherent soul and purpose? Do we get reincarnated? Do we die and then spend all of eternity standing on a cloud, sitting on a chair in heaven, not feeling horny, right? Like, or what? What is it? You just get to fuck all the time or you don't want to fuck anymore. Everyone's there, but are they the same age as when they died or they're all at the, like, coolest age that they ever were, which is weird because then your grandma's 21 and she's probably pretty hot and you're hanging out with your grandma and you just want to fuck her, but you shouldn't do that in heaven. Or you don't want to fuck her, you just want to hang out with your grandma. Why would you want to do that all day? Or what do you do? You just play kind of video games. That gets boring too. Well, then you want to, what's fun? Fucking what's fun is fighting and killing and raping and making rockets explode and then you want to blow shit up and you can't do that in heaven. So what's the fucking point? I don't think people have thought it. They didn't really think it through when they sell it to you. Like, hell is so vivid. It's so clear. Every day they know what's happening. You know, Mondays is pitchforks up the arsehole. Tuesdays being raped by gorillas. You know, Wednesday is having your skin flayed off you. Whereas heaven, it's like boring. Sorry, everyone. And I mean that for all heavens, not just the Christian one. So, you know, the life purpose that was sold to the masses throughout time was, look, your life's going to be pretty shit. You're going to be a peasant in the mud. We're going to take your firstborn children and send them to war. But if you endure all of that, then you get the good shit later. Like, I don't think there's like, I don't think there isn't any inherent life purpose. You just have to develop one. Otherwise, you feel purposeless. And just as I was saying before with Edo's stuff, the tool becomes redundant. And everyone wants to, that's why everyone like picks up the next self-help book, which is like, this is the one, this has got the answers. Fuck yeah. Or the like, The Power of Now or the Tibetan Book of Living and Dying or any of these like texts where you're like, okay, this. And it gives you a hit of like, oh yeah, I get it. Okay, that makes sense. Yeah, that's a good way to live. That's a purpose. And then life changes, right? So I think really life is a series of you setting purposes or not. And then you'll just get thrown around, buffeted around by circumstance or by your boss or by your family or by whoever else will take you and go, well, I'll use you for my purpose. And that's not bad necessarily either. Because often it's like in your early days, maybe you need to be just like taken on someone else's purpose because you'll learn a lot by looking at theirs. That's why we apprentice ourselves, right? I don't go to an Edo workshop to go, oh, I'm going to like, you know, I want to be Edo and like my purpose is now to do his thing way, way worse, right? And try and convince people I'm a movement master. It's like he has a clear purpose, which is, I mean, it's kind of not though, is it? His purpose is keep on changing, keep on using this technology of movement to keep testing his limits, keep testing his ego, keep testing the boundaries of what a human is possible, what he's capable of and keep itemizing that and breaking that down and giving it to students and then taking it off them and breaking it and throwing it away and giving another one. So, yeah, I've had many, many purposes in life and I've had many periods of purposelessness where I just float for a while and I feel fucking like, and I'm in one now, to be honest, I'm in a purposeless point. Now, I have things to do. This is, I have a purpose here, right? I'm here to teach you guys whatever I can. You know, I have lots of things to do, lots of things to achieve, lots of obligations to fulfill, but right now I'm in a floating like, I don't really know what my purpose is now and there's, and it's not going to just get gifted to me. I'm not going to just go universe, just what is my purpose? I'm going to have to go, all right, well, I better go and try some new purposes because I've done a long time of a certain type and now I'm going to have to either wallow in this funk for some time, in which I may, but then I'm going to have to go, all right, well, I better choose a new proto purpose because I won't, because it's, you usually do not get a fully formed, complete purpose out of the box and go, cool, all right, there it is. Here's the kit. Just take the first step and now I'm off on my track. You're like, ah, like so many, like that's been the whole conundrum of the LDA. I gave you guys a whole bunch of tools which work to create lifestyles and, but initially you're not exactly even sure what a lifestyle is and you have, maybe you have vague ideas. Some people had really clear ideas, not that many, but some had like, I really want to do X, Y, Z and I want to have these people in my life and I want to, and I'm going to execute on it and that's fucking awesome. Cool. But for many of you, probably the majority of you and understandably, you don't know what the purpose is out of the box. So you test, you fail, you go through the beginner's hell. You feel that extremely clearly that this purpose is right and then you start down the track and you go, oh, maybe it wasn't. Or you go down one that's a bit vague because you're like, fuck, well, I may as well do something. Okay, I'll take a tango class. And suddenly that lights you up and you, and tango is your thing, but it is not the thing forever, right? It'll be a tool. It'll be a gateway into a community. It'll be a way to test your abilities, to build your confidence, to increase your ability to connect with women, to lead, all this awesome stuff. And it'll reach a point where, okay, the tool is redundant. I may still do tango. I still may still dance tango for the rest of my life, but it may not be my purpose. It may have been a way for me to get out of a funk and it may have been a short-term purpose or it may be a really pivotal one, right? So, and it's the paradox of like coming to teachers for answers, right? Because we don't, I've never met a teacher who has the answers, never. And I'm not, and I don't have them either. Even when I've gone to Shaolin temple and I've gone, these are fucking enlightened monks. I don't think they were enlightened. I didn't get this. I didn't get the, oh, wow. They are, I got the like, fuck, they are powerful. They are, and various teachers. They have a skill, a high-level skill, but they're arrogant or they're prideful or they're prone to addictions or there's holes in their stories, right? And I can see, I can see that with every teacher and certainly with myself, the closer, there's some saying the closer you get to your teacher, the more disappointed you get because you get there and you're like guru, guru, guru, oh dear, it's a human with all their shit who may, who may be a complete fraud in which case, okay, wasted time or not a fraud at all, knows their shit, excellent at their thing, but doesn't have the answer."}
