Like, what are some of the deal breakers that when a girl looks at a profile, she just goes, nah. I have to name, name and kind of slightly shame, some killer mistakes that I'm seeing guys make online when they're writing their profiles. Gentlemen, and that one lady. It's James Marshall returning with my long distance podcast series. And today I have an extra special, special extra guest, the one and only Hayley Quinn. Hi Hayley. Oh, hey, thanks for having me on the show. You're very welcome. I mean, you know, the schedule was totally packed, but we managed to squeeze you in, in between David Letterman and other celebrities. So how are you doing? You're currently in France, right? Yeah, I've got the same idea as you guys over there. I bailed out to a remote country abode where I'm gonna be hanging out, pretending this whole thing isn't existing by living on a farm. Excellent. So there's a, there's definitely a, what do we call that? There's a theme. There's a theme and a pattern. For those of us who have been in the dating game long enough, we knew that at some point we would need a country retreat to escape to. Okay, cool. Well, what I wanted to talk to you about today, because you're better at this than I am, is online game. So my general opinion on online pickup, meeting people, dating, et cetera, has pretty much been since the beginning. I checked it out and went, uh, that's way too much work for what I got out of it. It's not that it doesn't work, because I did meet people offline. Actually, I met my ex-wife on Myspace, believe it or not. Oh, I didn't even know you had an ex-wife, James. So that's a revelation. That's my revelation of the day. Right, ex-wife and met on Myspace in 2006 or something. So yes, definitely, you know, people meet online and that's the reality of today. And now it's extra the reality, now that we literally can't go and talk to people. Because my advice has always been, don't bother with online game, go and meet girls in real life. Now, my advice is totally redundant, so it's over to you. So what are some of the, I don't know, foundations and principles that you would, you know, suggest to guys in terms of meeting and dating online? Well, first of all, you're preaching to the converted, because I love teaching people, men and women, to meet one another in real life as well. And as you talk about a lot, the value of people's social circles and networks extremely important. However, I think we have to think about what possible dating activity we can do during this time, and not just use it as an epic excuse to just procrastinate and get fat and sit on your sofa and Netflix binge. And whilst online dating definitely has its frustrations, there are actually things that you can use with it as a guy, which even if you're like a diehard, I'm not into online dating person, think of it this way. Right now, online dating app usage is surging. People are spending on average seven hours a week on dating apps. It's probably gonna go up, because people are bored. Dating apps are seeing spikes in their traffic actually, which is a bit mad, as the news becomes worse. So it's like, as the likelihood of us staying inside becomes more real, that they're noticing more people are initiating messages online. I also think people are gonna be really wanting human contact. They're gonna be hungry for that, and so they're gonna use the only channel that's still open to them to access it. So right now, you have an abundance of opportunity. And even if you don't envisage yourself meeting someone online, if you have traditionally struggled with things like, how do I get from having a woman's number to asking her out? How do I successfully handle messages? How do I nail that playful, flirty tone? Now is a brilliant opportunity to get a ton of practice on that front and actually to set yourself up. So we can talk about some principles as well for just building out a generally decent profile, some obvious dos and don'ts. And then I think we can also look at a bit of strategy. So how you can probably approach online dating with the least, I guess, stress and aggravation and try and make it work for you as much as possible. And then we can also look at some good tips around messaging, so that you can really distinguish yourself as a guy and basically stand out from all the other noise of all the other people that are cramming onto that platform. Because you're right that yes, right now the population of the world, unless they happen to have landed with their ideal partner in a lockdown situation, is lonely, bored, horny. To what greater or lesser degrees of those three metrics. And there's definitely, like I've noticed, I'm sure you've noticed that like all of our, all the people in our industry and are quickly pivoting and going, okay, online game is where it's at, which is fair enough. But I think it's important to note that just because everyone is locked at home, just because girls are more open to meeting a guy online or girl online than maybe they were when they could go to parties and go to events and they had lots of other options going on, right? So the women that usually had a lot more options have a lot less options in terms of who they can meet right now. But that doesn't mean that it's like a free for all. It's like, cool, I just get on there with my photo of me like this or patting a sedated tiger or me and my three buddies. Yeah, that type of profile is not gonna work anymore. So obviously it's not just like, okay, cool. Well, I guess I'll get on Tinder and get laid because that's, you still have to be able to differentiate yourself. There's another reason why I told a lot of my clients not even to really bother, aside from having a good Instagram profile, which is something I wanna ask you about later. So, cause you can look at like, Instagram is a dating site in some way. It's a multi-purpose. When they do the dating site rankings in terms of which are most popular, Instagram is listed in there as a dating site. Right, cause millennials figured out how to turn it into a dating site. Rich men worked out how to turn it into a brothel. There's a lot of stuff going on under the surface aside from just sharing photos. But I guess my question is, okay, so, cause what I would say to guys is, unless you are a particularly well curated online fuck boy. So, you know, a guy who's 20 to 30 ish, has a particular aesthetic that the girls who are on there all the time, particularly Instagram girls are looking at and going, yeah, that's the guy I like with the tattoos or with the, whatever the aesthetic is that the girl is into. Unless you're going to be that guy and invest a lot of time in it, I would say often don't bother. But in this circumstances, I would be saying do bother. So what are some of the like practical specific things? Let's start with deal breakers. Like what are some of the deal breakers that when a girl looks at a profile, she just goes, nah. Cause I've done that before with female friends or with lovers. I've like said, show me your Tinder and show me how you would use it. And it's basically this, no, no, no, no. And I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa. That guy looked nice. Nah, I didn't like his shirt. No, no, no. So it's like, what are some of the deal breakers that definitely when women look at a profile pic or a description, they're just going, nah. Yeah, let's do the pics first. Cause we have to be real here that that's, you could send a great first message to a woman, but if she then clicks on your lead profile picture and that sucks, that isn't gonna go any further. So we need to up your online game and you're right as well to identify that in the Instagram age, our standards for what constitutes a good photo have just like radically escalated. So when we're looking at what's good and what's not good, obvious things that sometimes guys don't tend to think about. And I do think as well, it's a bit disadvantageous cause I think women tend to have an amazing back catalog of photos that their female friends have taken through them throughout the past couple of years. Whilst guys are sometimes like, oh, you know, photo of me, bit awkward, don't wanna do it. So first things to think about, make sure it's a new photo. Low resolution photos look bad. So if this photo, if you're maybe a more mature guy and you're thinking, oh, maybe I could use a picture from five years ago, that actually might be to a disadvantage. The reason for that is the picture is gonna look really pixelated. It's not gonna pop and be really nice high resolution. Most of us on our smartphones, I've got an iPhone, it has portrait mode. You're gonna get a really crisp, clear shot with that. So don't rely on old stock photos, use ones that are crisp and clear. Likewise, anything that stops your picture being clearly visible. So pictures taken at night, pictures in a big group of other guys, pictures with red eye, pictures where you're wearing sunglasses or a hat, all have been statistically proven to ding your profile. You also, as you said, wanna know what your market is. If you do happen to be that 20, 30 year old tattooed, hunky guy, brilliant, you go for it. However, if you do not identify as that person, you wanna think, what is the theme that I'm trying to put across here? What's my personal brand and how can I work with this? So I'll give you a couple of examples of how you could maybe go about and do that. So for instance, if you are, again, a more mature guy, but you know, a professional man, I would be thinking about taking photos of yourself or using photos where you think about the background. Like I don't have a particularly great background today, but I have seen guys who have had an ironing board or an unmade bed in their background. This just to a woman screams, I have not got my life together. You know, if you hang out with me, it's gonna be like a little frat party in here. It's not inviting. Think about the dates that you want her to look at that picture and think, oh yeah, I could see myself going on a date. Oh, he hangs out in that place. I like that, but you know, I recognize that place. Well, that's that cool city that I went to once. So really think about your aesthetic there. Also for your photos, natural light tends to work best. Direct sunlight is not flattering. It makes all look wrinkly and old. But if you use a nice clouded day, a tripod, a timer, an iPhone portrait mode will get you far. But be careful, don't use photos, more than one photo in the same outfit. Don't use the same photo from two different angles. Anything that makes it look that you might be scratching around trying to find the one good photo of you, because that's the only one that's in existence. Instead, we have- If it looks like you set up a tripod by yourself with your portrait mode and then took lots and lots of photos, that's bad. Although that's what you have to do in order to make it look like you didn't do that. Yeah, we want to do fake candid, the Instagram art form of fake candid. So that could be watching out for your body language, making it look nice and relaxed. Also, if you're obviously posing in the same outfit, again, dead giveaway. Or if all your photos are professional, dead giveaway that this isn't good. So you might want to mix up maybe a photo of you doing some kind of like sport or activity. They're pretty useful because you're going to be small in the picture. So they don't often have to be the super best ones with a nice headshot, where it may be probably taken from mid chest up, looking at the camera, but that's going to be your, or looking slightly off camera. That would be your lead profile picture. Then you want to have a couple of other pictures so that she roughly can understand, okay, this guy is relatively well-dressed. He looks like he has a decent quality of life and his photos are well-organized. Now, as I would say, sometimes you can even go really left field. So I had a really good male friend of mine. He would not identify as being like the hot guy, the traditional hot guy. He is very slim. He's of Pakistani origin. So he didn't fit that tattooed model. What he did was very clever though. He, on one of those swiping apps, what he did is he created a series of post-it notes, which had a very clever statement written on them, which tempted you to swipe to the next one. So he drew them in. And then the last picture of him was in a really cool suit, kind of lying languidly on the couch, holding his guitar. So he really built lifestyle in and was super creative. So you can also, if you feel like, you know what? I'm not the mature business guy who's got those lifestyle shots. I'm not the young tattooed hunky guy. I'm a bit quirky. You can play that quirk if you pull it off really well. Sure. And also you can niche yourself, right? So it's like generally, generally most men are thinking of a broad spread. They're like, okay, you know, hopefully I get some girls out of this. But you know, I have a friend who is a, for example, a BDSM teacher. His Instagram is only BDSM stuff, you know? And it's, and he doesn't get vanilla girls. He gets only BDSM girls, right? And then girls that are searching through Instagram, that are into BDSM, search for hashtag BDSM or various other things. His profile pops up. He appeals very specifically to the women because he's always, his posts are always talking about, you know, you deserve pleasure and dah, dah, dah. Like speaking directly to women, right? And so as a result, he, I mean, he pulls girls off Instagram within 10 minutes of chatting. He, you know, he's very specifically niched, but he, by his own admission, did you ever read Mad Magazine back in the day? No. I know, but I've never read it. Right, right. Well, he's, I look like Alfred E Newman, who was like the funny caricature character in it. You know, by his own admission, not the most handsome man on camera, but because he's niched himself so specifically, Instagram worked incredibly well for him. Yeah, and there's other themes you can do on Instagram as well. Like I would say the main thing with Instagram profile is make sure if you're gonna have one, and that's a choice, make sure it's well cultivated. You know, if you've got, if you're posting really irregularly, the photos don't fit together, it's like an awkward photo of your lunch one day, you're on a trip to Belfast the next day, like a bad joke. It's just, it's gonna look messy and it's gonna look like you're not putting effort into it. And it just basically projects the image of, I don't have my life together, whether that's fair or not. So I would say like either be a ghost on the internet, like do a bit, Google yourself. I would never do that to myself, but Google it, do a big detox of stuff, or put the effort into having a well cultivated profile. Other profiles that I've seen that can work really well, which are non-reliant on you being like the hot guy. I've seen photos which have a strong, Instagrams which have a strong theme, whether it's like architecture or black and white photography, or photos taken at funny angles. So as long as the theme is consistent, the photo quality is really super good and it looks interesting, then yeah, I think by niching yourself to photography or travel or architectural business, you can still have a good profile, even if you're not like the traditional Insta model good looking. Right. And on that, I would be wary with repetitious photos. And if you are like someone who's going for an aesthetic Instagram, which is mainly around, let's say, minimalist architecture, for example. If you don't have a photo of yourself every three or four photos, then this is only an Instagram for people. who are interested in the topic, which is fine. You know, if you want to build the biggest, you know, Scandinavian appreciation architecture, Instagram on the planet, cool, go for it. But in terms of for any man that's, you should really be looking at your, all of your social media as marketing, sexual marketing for you, right? Like unless, unless you're using it for business purposes or for some other specific, you know, we, we, I have four Instagrams. Some of them are for business, some of them from girls. That makes me curious what the other two are. You know, I have one, I have one set up as a BDSM guy because I am, and I learned from my friend. I'm like, okay, well, I niche myself as that. You know, I have my personal friends and family one, which is a bit more PC. I have my TNL one for TNL fans. And I probably have some other one, which I've, oh yeah. And I have one for Vince, my lizard, but that one's, I haven't updated that lately. But the thing is that, and people are like, well, I don't want to do that. No, you shouldn't have to do that. In terms of the way I view Instagram, I don't like being online very much. I do it as much as I have to for business pretty much. And for, you know, relationship stuff. And so what I do as opposed to Liam or Alex, who are very, very active on their Instagrams always, and they utilize that, their stories and, and they've created a whole network and culture on, on their platform. I do that a little bit, but more often it's just like, when I go to a place, you know, I used to travel a lot, you know, if I go to a place or I meet some good old friend or I, here I am at some interesting event, I will make, uh, make the effort. And all of us do this in our social circle. I'll hand my camera to my friend and say, take, take 10 photos, 10 photos, not one, 10. And that's a, I think that's, there's a mental barrier for men there because you know, having photos taken of them is not something most men are used to. I'm used to it because I was in a band for years. And so I got used to like going like this. Um, but most men feel uncomfortable when their cameras put, put at them. And so they do, they do things with tension. They'd like grimace or like do some weird pose or lift their shoulders in a tense way. Right. Or try to like act ironic, like, Oh, it's just a photo. Uh, anything like that. It just says you're on to the, to the viewer. It just says you're uncomfortable. So get used to go and stand in the mirror and just look at yourself and just do like a model face and then do one to the side and feel how silly that feels and too bad. And then get a friend and say, Hey man, take 10 photos of me. And if that friend then says, uh, is a dickhead about it, they're not your friend. That's my friend. Right. Exactly. Or get a female friend. That's another good use of having female friends. They'll be better at that stuff. And you're right. When you're doing any kind of posing, if you look relaxed in the pose, the, it will tend to come across. Well, if you've got tension, it's not going to work. So photos are super important. Profiles are, I would say a secondary consideration when it comes to dating apps, but they still have a function. And I've got, I have to name name and kind of slightly shame, some killer mistakes that I'm seeing guys making online when they're writing their profiles. And I, and I think it's kind of the, my thinking is it's a result of reading or trying to cultivate, say a good dating app profile, but maybe looking at advice that is either, uh, to, it's been too widely spread. Too many people have used it or it's out of date. And that can be a real problem when the woman is potentially seeing tons and tons of profiles. So a few tips, the guys out there, just questions to ask yourself when you're writing that festival is, could it be half as long, twice as strong? So there was a big TLDR too long, didn't read. So you want, you know, a couple of good lines is actually better than having this whole mishmash of stuff going down the page. Um, also be a very wary of any online dating cliches, like looking for a partner in crime or what's another one taller than you and your tallest heels. Like some of these were really like, they were kind of like playful and fun when they first came out. But now so many guys have used the same thing. It's going to make you look generic and it's also going to make you look like you don't basically have the guts to write your own profile and you're borrowing stuff around you. It's not presenting a really strong image around yourself. Also be, you know, another obvious one, be wary of being too generic. I'm saying stuff like I like all the usual things or my friends would say, I like staying out and I like staying in, you know, anything that makes you sound really bland. I'm kind of a good times, middle of the road kind of guy. I like generally what most people like, not too much, not so little. Yeah. Whatever you, whatever you're into, I'll find a way to be into that too. Yeah, exactly. Or having lots of, um, tons of emojis or the flags of the countries, you know, the, all your nationality, mixed nationalities. Again, all of this stuff is actually per se. Now we've missed the boat on that being a trend. So I think instead having a clean, short profile of one good line, or maybe even saying something like, um, something that I like to use as well is thinking about kind of fun starts to sentences. Like you would win me over if you should definitely swipe left now, if so saying something that creates controversy, that creates challenge, that suggests that you have standards that you're entering into the dating process. And also this is your profile is a good opportunity as well to niche yourself out a bit, because if you have a conversational tone, even one that's on the borderline of playful on the borderline of slightly rude, sometimes actually that does more to make you stand out than the guy who's put tons of emojis in there and it's got the custom paced profile he found on the internet. Right. A little bit cheeky, a little irreverent is good. Um, okay, so let's talk about, um, messaging, right? So, okay, let's assume people have got some matches or they've got some Instagram hotties that they've linked up with in some kind of way. So every, everyone's always looking for the opening line. Um, which, you know, my opinion has always been there isn't, there is no opening line. However, when, when we go online, we have to be very aware of using, uh, words that have no charge, right? Words that are very generic. So, uh, and phrases, how are you doing is, or how are you going? Or, uh, you know, what's up or any of those like people don't even read them because they just, they just so generic and bland. How was your day? What could, can be, can be changed completely by what kind of mischief did you get up to today? Right? So that's, you know, same question, but because we're using a slightly charged word mischief as opposed to how was your day that we give, we give the person, uh, you know, or if we know that she's at work, how's it, how's your day at work boring as opposed to, you know, uh, procrastinating or actually working, you know? So it's like a question like that is the same thing. But if we look at the way we can replace and change words to just, you know, just literally just to stand out from the very generic phrases that she just sees all the time, what do you think? Yeah. And you've hit on a good point there as well about kind of some problems that will come up a lot with online dating is that having some rough templates or ideas of messages you work to for the first message is actually smart just because you may find that you have to send 10 messages out to get a response. You will, you will have to, let's get those stats. Let's get those stats down for good gentlemen, because it's lucky if it's 10% return. Yeah. And I would say after, and I literally legit have worked behind the scenes at some big dating apps and platforms around the world and the true stat, the stallions, the top performing Insta model worthy, totally crushing it guys on online dating profile profiles, they still only get a max of 35 to 40% response rate. So that is like, you know, you are Brad Pitt, you're at 40% or whatever it is. So, and you may think that this is like terribly unfair, but I would think with the asymmetry of dating, I'm just gonna stand up for the women here. I work with women as well. And for women, imagine that what you get, you open your like, it's like another inbox and you've opened it and there's all these messages in there and they don't seem at all relevant to you that either, as you said, very low investment, like, Hey, how's your day going? Hey babe, what's up? Hey, that kind of thing. I stole my best line there. You know, or they seem to be like written and the women are there thinking these guys haven't read my profile. They're just spamming everybody. You know, this guy doesn't even look like, there was no way in my mind I could conceive us hanging out together. So when, the women, because of that, they really struggle to narrow that down and figure out who to invest their time and energy into and often get it wrong. They also, if they happen to be looking for relationships, which certainly not all women are, lots of women are looking for stuff that's more casual or just entertainment or some other motivation. But another consideration they'll be battling with is, is this guy just using dating apps right now as a distraction? Is he just looking to hook up or, you know, is there something more sincere here? So women usually are faced with basically a huge admin pile in the world of online dating and some difficult decisions, which are actually very difficult to come to conclusions with, with the limited information they have. And those decisions need to be made basically in a split second, really. Exactly. So when you write a low investment message, you're going to come across as basically that guy, I always call it the hey guy, because every woman on her Instagram will have some person or some man who just says, hey, every week, forever, with no response. And basically what you're sub-communicating there is like, you know what? You can not respond. You can have the personality of a stone. I don't care. You're the only hot woman I might talk to this century. So because of that, I'm clinging on in there. And that's exactly the wrong way to present yourself. You have to present yourself as a man that has really good standards. And, you know, her being attractive is simply not enough because of that. Again, even if you write a longer message, but you're like, you know, hey, your profile, it's interesting. Maybe we could get a drink sometime because she, she hasn't done anything. She hasn't responded yet. She hasn't invested in the interaction. So whilst it's definitely true that you should progress to that date quickly and use your messages effectively and not become a pen friend. If you go in immediately with a date, a lot of the time you're going to come across as the guy who's just chancing it. And that's inherently just not attractive to most women that are out there. It's funny though, because that is, you've just kind of described the male sexual, uh, strategy chances. Just like throwing out whatever I can and hoping something will stick. That's I'm a man. That's what I have to do. So, you know, you can be all like, Oh, you should have more standards. I do. I have standards, which is I need to get laid pretty soon. So I'm going to do whatever I can. Is this right? No. Oh, can I change it? Yes. Um, Right. So it's like chance. Do you want to be, you've got to present yourself or try and get in the mindset of being a chooser instead of the chancer online. One thing I've noticed in my, you know, various experiments with online dating over the years personally was that, let's say I got a conversation starting with, it started with a girl. Very quickly I got the sense, and I'm sure she did too, of having just getting bored really quick. Like, like, you know, you start a chat and the girl writes back, cool. All right. She's responding and you have a few backwards and forwards. And after like the first three exchanges, maybe I have this sense of like, if I can't meet this girl, this is, this is going to fizzle really quickly. And, and I've seen that happen, you know, many times where let's say I started chatting to, maybe I met her in real life briefly, or maybe I met her online, but let's say I chatted briefly and then I had to go away somewhere and then I didn't have a chance to see her for two, three, four weeks. I come back and it's just, it leads dead. Um, so my question is, cause I, I suspect that the timing of how you operate in the, in the Corona lockdown period will actually matter. Um, I suspect, and you can tell me what you think about this, that most of the, if you're doing field work now, let's say you're doing your, you're putting a lot of effort into messaging and so on, and you're getting responses. I have a suspicion that if the lockdown lasts for another four weeks, you won't see any of these girls. You'll, you will not see week one girls because those girls will be meeting week four guys. They'll be, the guy that hit them up a week before lockdown got them into a bit of a frenzy and she was excited to meet this guy. And then the lockdown goes, she'll meet him as opposed to the guys like, Hey, remember we've been chatting for four weeks? Uh, it's kind of my turn. What do you think about that? Yeah, I think there's a lot of truth in that. I think what's interesting though, is women I find particularly use online dating in a way that's very cyclical, which means she'll be into it, but for a very short period of time, you know? So when you get that window of openness where she's responding quickly, she's giving you decent quality responses in return, in your mind, you have to be thinking, right, I've got to capitalize on this or that, you know, she's going to get frustrated with the whole online dating thing. She'll chat someone else, she'll get bored, she'll get distracted. And that app is going to be deleted off her phone. So even if you can't physically meet her, you still need to find a way to progress things forward. I would always say that if you get, obviously if you get a woman's phone number, you got her on WhatsApp, you can do a video call with her. Then we're in a, we're in a safer zone there than if you're just chatting to her on the, on the app. And also remember as much as you might want to be waiting for like the right moment, or when you get like a really clear signal, you've got to think about it more in terms of like her openness and her buying temperature. And if it's looking good in this moment in time, you actually really want to quickly capitalize on that and move things forward purposefully. Because again, a way that you're going to signal that you are a chooser and a man that has standards and has just other stuff going on in his life is you're not there just to chit chat idly. And it's also very hard to have an interesting conversation with someone who you have not met in real life for an extended period online. Yes, extremely difficult. Yeah. I mean, I'm an interesting conversationalist and I get bored of my own conversations very quickly with a random stranger unless they're like, cause my answer to that is generally I will be figuring out if they're into kink in some way. And then, you know, if they are, then we've got plenty to talk about. Uh, and if they did not, then we don't have anything to talk about. So yeah, I mean, I would say for the guys, instead of get to just get out of that mindset of the, how do I keep her interested mindset, which is, you know, a trap. Instead, you want to be thinking intermittent and impactful communication. And I would be waiting from that first conversation. If she responds to your initial message, then you want to be thinking, right, how do I now leapfrog this into us exchanging details and at least having, you know, a video chat or something which can then move forwards in other directions. Yeah. So I guess what I like,"}
