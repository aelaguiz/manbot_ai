Now in today's video, what I've decided to do is take a trip down memory lane and go back through a bunch of my very old infield videos and roast them, basically to see if was I any good ten plus years ago and if not, what was bad about it. Keep in mind that this is very old archive footage, filmed well before we had professional infield ninjas with telescopic zoom lenses who were excellent at filming double angles. So this is scratchy, old grainy footage from the early 2010s with a much younger, full black bearded James Marshall who didn't have to wear this silly wig. So let's see, did I suck or was I good back in the day? Let's get into it. James Marshall from The Natural Lifestyles demonstrates how to approach and talk to a shy or unresponsive girl, Belgrade, Serbia, the year of our Lord 2010. Can I stand under your umbrella for one minute? Can I stand next to your umbrella for one minute? I don't think you can stop me. Ooh, James, I don't like this. The opener, whatever, fine, it's just a situational opener. Can I stand under your umbrella? And her being Serbian and Serbian just goes, no, or something. And then I tell her, well, I don't think you can stop me. Now this is very bad because it's pushy, aggressive, not hearing what it is that she's trying to communicate. And why do I need to stand under the umbrella? Was I worried about my hair? I don't know. I could have just continued talking to her from there. So not a good start. Fail, James. So I can't stand here in the rain. Huh? Are you, do you speak English? Cool. Me too. We already have something in common. All right, so I'm still pushy about the, you want me to stand in the rain or whatever. It's just, James, let it go. Just talk to her, deal with the rain, if that's where you're standing. And then I'm a bit passive-aggressive about, okay, cool, yeah, we've got something in common too. Not so good so far. Do you, what are you waiting for in the middle here? Friends. You said that so quickly, it's almost suspicious. So it's definitely a good idea to be aware of the way a woman's delivering things. So if I say, you know, what's your favorite color? And she says red, and then I comment on the way that she said that, like, wow, you're very passionate about the color red, or clearly that's definitely your favorite color. That's fine, but here I'm being combative. So she says friends in a Serbian way, and I am being passive-aggressive around it. Just ask the questions and let her answer, and try and create some rapport, James. Do I make you nervous? No. Good. I don't want to make you nervous, but right now my hair is getting really, you know how long it takes me to get my hair like this? A few seconds. And yours? One and a half hours. Okay. Do you want to ask me a question now? Okay, so here's an early James experimenting with pressure and release. So I'm going, all right, I'll just put pressure on her, and then see what she does. But you can see from her body language that she's not being held in by the pressure. She's turning away. She's not particularly responsive. I ask her about her hair. She's like one and a half hours. All right, cool. We're not clicking or gelling yet. And then I put it over to her and ask her what questions do you want to ask me? Which I would say at this point where there's not a lot of rapport is too big. I should be really just moving through with simple questions, getting to the point of creating some rapport. But here I put too much pressure on her, expecting her to now take the weight of the interaction. Will she? No. Would you like to ask me a question? You don't have any questions? And surprise, surprise. No, she doesn't want to ask me any questions because I'm a total stranger who's freaked her out by trying to stand under her umbrella and then going, ask me questions. Do you have any stories? You're the first person I met in Serbia who wasn't friendly. And then I try to resize it by saying, well, do you have any stories? No. Again, it's too big a thing to ask. Like if I'd said what's been the most fun thing you've done this summer or what do you, you know, what's a cool story about when you were in high school or something like that where I give her a specific thing to answer and we have a little bit of rapport, fine. But again, tell me stories. Tell me about yourself. Invest. It's not working. And then I'm being antagonistic and telling her that she's the least friendly person that I've met in Serbia, which what am I trying to achieve there? Like is that going to make her suddenly become friendly? Am I trying to neg her? Maybe? I don't know. I don't remember what I was thinking at that time. But again, it's just coming across as combative, passive-aggressive. She's not loving it. Oh, it's okay. It's not a problem. Yeah, I know. I know. But that's the thing when strangers meet, they don't know each other. When you met your best friend, you didn't know them and then now you do. Can I stand under the umbrella? Here's me trying to convince her that it's a good idea to talk to me. So you'll commonly come up with objections from girls that speak to you or don't speak to you, right? So the objections can be to speaking to you, to giving their name, to shaking your hand, to providing basic information, to providing more deep information, to giving you the number and so on. So we need to be aware of dealing with objections. And often that's done by acknowledging the objection and then finding a way to create a solution, right? So instead of me trying to convince her that, come on you, how did you make your best friends? Or, you know, if you're going to, you need to meet strangers if you want to make new connections or whatever is my pitch to her. Rather, if I just agreed with her and said, I get it, I'm a stranger and I'm a foreigner. You don't know me, but you know, we're safe here. So let's have a little chat and see if we get along, right? Just like acknowledging the objection, sidestepping it, creating a simple solution and moving forward without waiting for her to take the load, which is what I'm trying to get her to do here. Can I stand under the umbrella? I don't know. You want me to shout at you in the street like a crazy person? No. So I'm still trying to convince her to stand under the umbrella. Come on, dude, just get wet and get the number. It's fine. And like you look at the screen, like how close would I have to be to be under the umbrella? That's too close for a stranger. Let it go. No. What's your favorite word? Your favorite word is no. Word. What is your favorite word? What's the funniest word in Serbian that sounds to the ear? At this point, I would say it's getting a little bit better, right? Because she says no and laughs. And I guess she realizes that she's being the person that says no. I call it out. I would say this is teasing, a little bit playful. This is better. Then I put it back onto her. Like what's her favorite word? Like it's kind of a silly question, but now it's something she can answer or she has a think about it. And then I'm getting into some conversation that's about something other than me standing under her umbrella. So maybe it's getting a bit better now. Yeah, that sounds funny to your ears. I think in English, pedestrian is a pretty funny word. Why? I just find it amusing. So I half say in Australia. Oh, hang on. No, in Australia, we speak English. In English, I think pedestrian is a funny word. Why did I think that in 2010? I don't know. Is pedestrian a funny word? Possibly. We'll have to, you guys can put in the comment if you want. Like I'm talking shit now. It's kind of irrelevant, but at least we're having a chat. Let's see what happens. You don't find it funny? Oh, good. And she agrees. All right. Yes, it's funny. Okay, pedestrian is kind of funny, strange man. All right. There's a little bit of rapport here over some nonsense. And I'm now laughing a bit and it's more chill. So it's better. What are you looking for right now? You look really nervous. They're late. So I'm still applying pressure about this one thing about the word. I would have let this go now. It's just like, okay, maybe I brought up some funky weird off-topic topic. She doesn't engage. I would just dump it and move on. But I really want to know what she thinks is a funny word in Serbian. I don't know why. And then I'm calling out that she looks really nervous. Like, yes, there'll be circumstances where I do that. But again, if I'm going to do it, I want to create a solution. So if I say you look a little scattered or you look like you're a bit stressed or in your head or you've got a lot going on in your mind and she's like, oh, I'm just waiting for my friends. Then, okay. So, oh, that's cool. I'm sure they'll find you. You're wearing a bright pink umbrella here and standing next to a charming man. So let's chat until I get here. That would have probably solved that issue. Why don't you arrive? Are they usually late? Are they usually late? Um, I don't know. No. I don't know. Do you think if you keep looking around like in a fast way, that'll make them come here quickly? No. Still too much challenging. I'm still making a big deal of this. If you like, I'm teasing her unnecessarily, I would say, because she's not playing along. So it's just like, okay, she's looking around. She's not that focused. It's my job to kind of keep her focus and have some fun. So she doesn't look around so much instead of going, why are you looking around? Why are you looking around? Do you have friends? What do you do when your friends come? Are you swearing in Serbian at them? You're like, fuck you. You stood me up and now I have to talk to this strange Australian. Yeah, where are you from? Australia. Right here. Where are you from? So this is the first time that she shows any active interest because generally women won't ask you questions about yourself if they don't want to continue the conversation. So this is the first time, what are we, you know, four minutes in, where she kind of acknowledges me and decides I'm just going to ask a question so he stops asking me weird things about the umbrella. Do you know anything about Australia? So here where I ask her, does she know anything about Australia? This is fair, right? So you bring up a country and I mean, I still would ask that question. What do you know about Australia? And they'll usually say kangaroos and spiders. And then I'll have to say my pre-scripted line ready for that. No, not necessarily, but it's like, okay, that challenge is fine. She's not taking it. She's like, nope. And then she asks if I'm a student. Cool. She's trying. She's doing it in her stoic Serbian way. So now she's actually interacting with me. I don't know why. She just decided to. Not anymore. I finished studying. Now I'm a traveler, musician and businessman, I guess. Okay, so this is decent. So if a girl asks you what you're doing, don't just say the thing, right? Student, if I just said yes or no, it closes the topic. So anytime a girl's asking for information, give more than she asks for. So that's what I do. She says, are you a student? I'm like, no, I'm this and this and this. And what are you? Fair enough. School. I'm going to school. What kind of school? Technical. Are you a technical person? No. Okay, so she says she goes to school. I ask what type of school, which is relevant because that gives me an orientation. And she says something about technical college. And then I jump to what does that mean to her? So are you a technical person? And that's good, right? So, you know, if someone says they're a student of philosophy, I say, are you, you know, have you worked out the meaning of life yet? Or, you know, are you a seriously deep thinker? Rather than asking, oh, which university and how many years have you been studying? And which philosophers are you studying? I'm relating that to a character trait, which is fair here. And she's like, no, I'm not technical. Well, what is she? I'm going to that school. To learn what? Learning what? Telecommunications. Telecommunications. Telecommunications. That sounds funny in both Serbian and English. Maybe. Okay, there's a little bit of callback humor here. I won't let it go. I still want to know what's a funny sounding word in Serbian. And then we're going to come with telecommunications and telecommunications. I decide, oh, I've got it. Let me swing that back to my excellent joke previously, and she's like, okay, yeah, I guess so. I mean, technically, that's a thing you can do in conversation, callback humor. But you've got to make sure that the first joke was funny. Otherwise, when we return to it, we're like, hey, remember that joke you didn't like the first time? Well, it's back. She laughs a little. Politely. Yeah, fuck, no. I'm late. You're in a bad mood now. I'm in a bad mood? Yes. You want to hit me? All right, this is more fun. She's like, bonjour, bonjour, whatever it is in Serbia. It's like, you fuckers, you're late. And okay, so now I'm having a bit of fun with her. Like, this is better. It's teasing in a playful way as opposed to my stoic, weird intro teasing. And accusing her of wanting to hit me, and then she has to convince me that she doesn't want to hit me. That's more fun. That's flirting. So what are you doing with your friends? We're going to some party. What kind of party? Birthday party. How old is the birthday girl? How old is the birthday girl? So, I'm asking her questions about the party, and they're pretty boring ones, right? So it's like, who's party? How old is the person? Why did I ask how old she was? It's kind of irrelevant. Maybe to find out how old this girl is, I guess. Do you want me to leave you alone? Because I can see you're very uncomfortable. This is interesting. So, I give her the option to end this. Do you want me to go away? Because I can see you're uncomfortable. Now, really what I'm saying is, I'm uncomfortable. Like, there's a lot of tension here. It's not sticking, or it doesn't appear to be. And so I'm like, alright, I'll give myself an out by telling her to go. And she says, no, stay. And then I'm like, uh? Women? You want me to stay? Tell me you want me to stay. I want you to stay, okay? Alright, so then I have a bit of fun with it. And I'd say, so you want me to stay? You want me to stay, baby? And she says, I want you to stay. Alright, good. Now we can start the interaction. Six minutes in. You have to introduce yourself to me and be friendly to me. Okay, my name is... My name is Yelena. Your name is what? Yelena? Okay, my name is James. Are you ready to touch me? It's okay? James. Nice to meet you, Yelena. And so it begins. Now we're friends. Now, I suspect we could have gotten to that point. Much earlier, if I'd stopped with all the cocky pressure, trying to be a cool, smooth, seducer, banter, whatever I was thinking, which I was probably not thinking, I'm just like, I'm new at this, I'm just going to say random shit and see what happens. If I'd just gotten to the point earlier, we probably would have had this introduction and started on a better position. Actually, I think you're probably much more friendly and in a good mood, and I understand you're stressed out, and you're leaving a man here to get his hair all messed up. You would not normally do that. I don't understand what you're saying, but okay. Here, I'm finally showing some, let's say, empathy and acknowledging her situation and calling her things out. Okay, I'm sure usually you're this, and you could be that, and you're having a stressful day. So I'm shaping her behavior, ideally, and that's what I'm technically trying to do, which is to show I get where you're at currently, but I'm trying to evoke the positive emotions that I know are there and bring them out. Yeah, this is kind of fine, although it's dealing with a mess that I would say didn't need to be there in the first place, but I'm damage controlling now, and it seems to be going all right. We're more or less relaxed around each other now, or mainly I'm more relaxed, and now she's told me to stay. I'm like, all right, now I can be chill and hopefully be more seductive. That's good, because half of what I say is ridiculous. This is cool exchange. She's like, yeah, basically, I didn't understand half of all of the things that you've just said. So we can assume that pretty much most of everything I've said this whole time, she's not quite understood, and probably that's a big part of the whole problem here is her English isn't great. I'm Australian, talking too fast, and not checking in to see if she actually registers things. So she's a bit standoffish because of that, and it steamrolls or snowballs into some complex mess, which it didn't have to be. And I think I deal with this well here, where it's like, I take the piss of myself a little bit. I'm like, that's cool, because half of what I say is ridiculous anyway. Now I'm not taking myself seriously in the right kind of way. This is better. Okay, I mean, I understand everything, but I don't speak very well, so I won't. You speak okay, and you're a good dancer. A dancer? You're a very good dancer. I know that. Because right now, you're like, dancing on the street. This is cute, I guess. Telling her she's a good dancer, and she's like, I know. And then, like, making a joke about the fact she keeps looking around and moving her hips in a cute kind of way. Yeah, this is fun. Would you like to come and sit down and talk to me? No, no. I want to stay here. Oh, good. Good choice. Here I make my extraction request, so instant date. I'm like, better if we go and take her and sit her down. She immediately, no, I want to stay here. Excellent, good choice. So that's fine. I mean, there'll be many times where you'll make a request for a woman's compliance, is essentially what I'm doing here. Whether that's to shake her hands. If I put up my hand out, and she's like, oh no, I don't, because of germs, or oh no. If I make a big deal out of that, I'm not going to win. Convince her to touch my hand. So it's like, oh, we're not ready for that. Cool, fair enough. So we can put forward an offer to escalate or to, you know, get closer. And if she rejects it, I can just be chill about it and go. And in this case, because I'm kind of being a bit playful with her serbian-ness and me. Like, the cultural difference here is part of the comedy, I guess. So, oh yes, fine then. Handled well. Made the attempt. She's absolutely no, I don't make a big deal out of it, and go back to where we were. Are you all alone here in Serbia? No, I have some friends here. Some other Australians. So, I come here every year. Every year? Yeah, I like it here. Decent. So she's asking me basic questions. Am I here alone? And instead, at first when I just said no, I'm like, oh, come on, James, give her a bit more than that. And then I do. So, again, a girl asks you any basic question. What are you doing here? Tourist. No, I'm on an adventure. I'm hanging out with some people that I just met, and I've got an old friend here. I mean, loving the vibrancy and weirdness of this culture and city, which is so different from where I come from. Something like that, right? So I give her more than she asks for. Yeah, okay, I give her a bunch, but I'm still a bit like, yes, this, being a bit too mysterious. Come on, we tried that at the beginning. It didn't really work. So, just be friendly and open. She's trying. She's asking, you know, basic, normal questions. She's not paying a lot of attention, but she's still invested in this conversation for some reason. People here are passionate, crazy, full of life. Nightlife is amazing. Yeah. What's your favorite nightlife spot? Why don't you go out? That's fine. Here I do that correctly in reverse, right? So I'm telling her about what I like about this city that I'm a stranger in. So the vibrancy and whatever else it is that I said about how I liked Belgrade. Okay, we're moving in some basics. You like going out. What do you like doing? Don't like going out there. And then I just kind of dump it, right? So if you're going to open topics, resolve them. Even if there's not a lot in there, she's saying I don't go out that often. I don't have exactly have a favorite place. I mean, I could have flirted on that. I could have said, oh, well, I guess we can go and find a new favorite place for both of us. I could have just resolved it in a simple way by just saying, oh, well, it's not necessarily about the location. It's often about the company, the people that you hang out with, right? Something like that, just to resolve the thought as opposed to do you have what I want? She's like, I'm not sure. I'm like, yeah. Lengthy pause for no particular reason. You don't? No. You like to stay in? I like to be with my friends in our place. Have food and make jokes and talk about boys. Yes. Yes. That's better. Okay, so now the pressure actually did work. And if you look in the grainy footage, you can see that I am giving her a cheeky smile. She's smiling pixelated back at me. So I think that tension was okay because I wasn't just staring blankly at her, which some guys think is what tension pressure releases, just like I put on the pressure. And then I release. No, there's, okay. So there was silence, but it was mixed with eye contact and the expressions and whatever. So then she broke the tension, explained about how she likes to socialize. And I respond to it. Oh, so you like being at home with friends and gossiping about boys. And okay, so now I'm finding the why behind the what or the, I'm exploring the experience of how she likes to hang out with her friends. Cause that's a standard and classic thing for girls to say, right? Like, what do you like doing? I like hanging out with my friends and then guys are like, oh shit, fucking girls are so boring. What do I say to that? Do you, how do you, do you have many friends or where do I go to from here? Well, I look into what's the social dynamic. Okay, so you party animal or you're someone who likes to stay in. She tells me she's someone who stays in. Okay, so you have closer, closer friends as opposed to lots of acquaintances. Cool. Um, so do you find yourself more introverted or extroverted? And, uh, you know, what's your position in the group? Or are you really loyal together? Or are you a bunch of brats and you run the city? Like there's lots of things that I can explore within the context of she has friends that she likes to hang out with. And if I just make the assumption she's boring because of that, well, too bad. Then you can't talk to women because they like their friends and they like to hang out with their friends. Right? So this is, this is fine. It's decent. We're getting into some of the particularities of who she is and how she socializes with her friends. It's all good. There's so much strangers here. What do you mean by that? Uh... Really? I don't think there's that many. Do strangers come and talk to you all the time? No, no. First time. First time ever? Yeah. So I'm the strangest stranger you know. Well, now I understand why you're so startled. She brings up that there's a lot of strangers around and it's good that I clarify what she means by that. So she's really trying to say foreigners because she doesn't know that word. When it comes out that this is the first time she's ever been approached by a foreigner, which is probably true. This was back in 2010 or 2009 when Serbia was not a known place and she was young. So, and I let her off the hook there. I get it. So that's why, you know, that's possibly why you were startled. Although she, I'm sure she didn't understand what that word means either. Again, if I'd found this out a bit earlier, right? Like just brought this up in the first minute or so and said, is this unusual for you to meet someone like this? And she says, yes, I know. I am first stranger. Then I could have said, oh, well, I get it. You know why you might be a bit, what's the different word? Easy word than startled. You might think this is a bit unusual. Then probably would have cleaned up those problems at the beginning. So next year, would you like to meet me here? In this time? Yeah, one year. August 30. So 2011, August 30, we can meet here. Here I make my funny offer for a number close. Now, why did I offer to meet her in one year's time in August 2011? I presume it was probably because I was leaving the next day. I don't know why I would have not just asked for the number directly. And she plays along, right? So this is role playing, right? I'm like, so a year from now, she's like, okay, this exact spot. And I said, yes, I'll bring the umbrella this time. This is fun, although I wouldn't be doing this usually. I'd be saying, give me your number so I can see you tomorrow. But I'm going to assume it was because I was about to leave the country. So 2011, August 30, we can meet here. I can bring the umbrella next time if you want. Okay, but can you bring it today? Sorry, Pete. Yes, I will wait. Oh, and then the border crew. Is it a deal? Are you going to put it in your diary or something? Or maybe you should give me your phone number and in one year I'll send you a reminder. And in the end, it's all a lot easier than I made it out to be. She's like, finally, she's like, you want my phone number? Okay. I mean, I didn't need to do all that. Let's meet in a year or probably many of the nonsenses that I was doing in there. I just kept it fairly straightforward, clean, had a conversation with her and then said, I'd love to see you tomorrow because even though you're a little bit shy, I think you might be lots of fun. And she probably would have said, okay. But before I get your phone number, I need to know you haven't told me anything about you, except you going to technical telecommunications. What else should I know about you that's cool? I want to know what you do when you don't have to do anything. Here, what am I attempting to do? So the girls agreed to give me the number. Pull out my phone, my iPhone one, very cool and nonchalant. And there's some good physical responses here. You can see her leaning in, like tottering into the, to the interaction, look at my phone or whatever. Like she's, she's, I think she's pretty much agreed now. She actually does want me to take her number. Now, what I decided to do here is to not just immediately take it, but to try and get some more investment out of her, because it's true from what I've said that she hasn't told me much. And that's my fault. I would say from the seducer's side, because I didn't draw things out correctly, but I'm, I'm putting pressure on here to like, tell me something cool about her. And again, this question is too big. Cause she says, what do you want to know? And I'm not prepared for that. So if you get ever going to ask big questions for girls, uh, like what, tell me stuff about you, then, and she says, what do you want to know? And you're like, uh, that's not good to have something prepared. What do I want to know? And I have a thing about it. Well, what do you do when you don't have to do something? Now, this is something I've done a number of times. And I think that there's a number of examples of me doing it in videos. I sometimes see students doing that every time because they saw me do it once on a video or something. It's not appropriate in a lot of circumstances, especially if we don't have very much time. Now she's not going anywhere, but if there was a situation where she's about to get on a bus or she's kind of in a rush and me going for a quick close and then saying, Oh, but first tell me something cool about you. You're just going to make her irritated. But in a scenario like this, where we had a lengthy interaction and I become conscious that I don't know enough about her. I want more investment from her. Then this is fair enough. In which case I would make the question more specific and clear about what it is that I want to know about it. Is this how I spell your name? Really? That's a good guess. And your phone number? Do you want to write it in? It seems that I've just given up on this. Like I've asked her to tell me something cool. What's the thing she does when she doesn't have to do something. She has a bit of a think. And then I go, just give me a number, which is fair enough too. I'm like, all right, I tried that. She's struggling. So let's just get the number and I'll see her in a year. Do you remember my name? Very good. So, not bad, young man. I mean, it worked. We got to the end and we got the number. And there's a bunch of decent things in there. The opener's fine. The use of pressure. I can see what I'm trying to do in those early days where I was relying way too much on projecting heavy pressure on girls. And it certainly worked in enough circumstances for me to think that that was exactly what I should be doing. But what I recognize now with a lot more experience is that it's better to have heavy pressure than no pressure. And so, yes, girls would invest. And if they liked me straight off the bat or if they were more invested or they thought I was attractive or something, then that would work for my attention. And that's where I learned how to apply pressure and release. But in these early circumstances, early interactions, I'm really relying on that far too much. Because I'm, at least I perceived myself or I thought that I'm really cool to sit in pressure, that that's my thing, projecting gaze, putting intent on a girl, making her invest, watching her squirm, which evokes her emotions and so on, which is all legitimate. And, of course, that's a major part of what I teach and the way that I operate in field these days. But I'm much more conscious of release is just as important as pressure. And why am I putting pressure? If I'm just putting pressure heavily on a girl who's not invested yet, it's making her feel uncomfortable and it's making me look like a bit of a dick. And so, I mean, in the first half of this interaction, I don't, I'm like, who is this dude? Pushy, arrogant, reactive, passive-aggressive, all that. Once she starts asking me questions and I guess I feel more comfortable and now I know she at least is talking."}
