But at the same time, it's really, really vital that you learn skills to be able to chill. And that doesn't mean sloth, which I'll cover in a moment. It means precision tools for understanding the processes that your mind goes through to run off into directions of stress or anxiety or overachieving or workaholicism, or getting tunnel vision and only being able to see one aspect of life as being important. For example, only focusing in on money, which I see with, you know, some clients, they come to me and they're very successful, but only in a very narrow band of life. And I've had, I remember talking to one guy recently who's running a very successful business. And he said to me, look, I've done the numbers. If I do anything else other than this, it's costing me money. I'd say he was like, he knew that if he put all of his time and focus into this business, which was working very well, he would be able to make X amount of money per quarter. And every hour that he pulled out of that and put into something else, meant that he would lose a certain number of dollars. And my thoughts on that were, well, you're rich and you're going to get richer for sure. Like you've done the numbers, I see them, they're good numbers. And your thinking is that any hour not spent, you know, that's not a sleeping or eating hour, any productive hour that's not spent in the business or on the business is going to be a waste of time because nothing can deliver the return on investment like working this business. And I said, well, the problem here is that you only perceive one level of value, which is financial return and success, right? You are neglecting your body. You are neglecting your emotional states. You are neglecting learning about intimacy and women. You are neglecting the chance to use your youth to develop an art form, to absorb lots of information while you're young and supple, right? And so we had long discussions and we worked out that it was actually worth taking a couple of hours out, you know, of an evening to spend on something other than making more money. Good day, gentlemen. The Natural Lifestyles team is back on the road. That's right. After a winter hiatus, we are once again running our incredible four, seven and 10 day live workshops with myself and the full TNL crew. Now, because of the current global situation, the place that we found that is best to do that is in Kiev, Ukraine. And I know what you're thinking. Don't worry, the Russians are gone. Everything's perfectly safe here. And open and fun and full of insanely hot girls. So if you'd like to join me and not spend the rest of your life or your youth just hustling, just trying to get ahead financially, but want to explore all areas of what it means to be a masculine, grounded, sexually successful man, then check out our upcoming workshops. We've got a four day coming up very soon here in Kiev, followed by the 10 day infamous Euro tour, which is now a 10 day mega workshop here in Kiev and some others that are coming up soon. So check the link below and I hope to see you. Come join us. It's lots of fun."}
