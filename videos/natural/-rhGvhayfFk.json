No, no. Never. We can never say this, because we are women. And I think that a really mature guy should notice that, ah, she wants to kiss, so I will. For you, what are the qualities in a man that are most important? To be loyal, and to be honest, and to be mature enough. To be mature enough? Yes, yes, yes, yes, because I think one thing is that we can discuss about anything, like our sexual life, the sexual problems that we have, or what we can change about our sexual life. I think that's the most important. So I know that he's mature enough to talk about our relationships, and he isn't afraid to share his emotions. And I know chemistry is kind of a hard thing to define, but how do you know when you feel chemistry? Like, what's the proof to you? For me, that I can stop thinking about kissing him. Yeah, that's the first sign in our heart. And so we can just feel if somebody is the same as we are. But chemistry means that I am always open to talk with that somebody, and I can never get bored with him. And I can have sex with him a lot of times. Yes. Do you think there's things that a man can do to affect that, to change it? For me, it's really important, the eye contact. I think that's the most important. But it's also important to touch me sometimes, so that I can feel that, yeah, he's listening, and he feels like I am attractive for him. So why is it that if a man is confident, why do you care? Like, what does that do for you? I'm confident, like, that's good for me. But why is that interesting to you? Once I had a boyfriend, and he never talked. It was like entertaining myself. It was so boring. I mean, I'm not boring. But, you know, when I just keep talking and talking, and he doesn't have any opinion about anything, that is really boring. And I think it was because he didn't have confidence. And he couldn't express his feelings or his opinion or anything he is interested in. So that's why confidence should be really, really important to have. What qualities or characteristics do you find attractive in a man? That he knows what he wants. When he speaks, he doesn't ask me, oh, where should we go, because I don't know. So he has some concretes in his head. So what, let's say, if he invites me to a date, that he has something in his mind, what to do. Yeah, I think the word you're looking for is decisive. Yeah, I hate this line, that whatever for me, or it's fine by me. Because you have a preference every time. If I ask you a question, it's even this or that. There is nothing in between. And I think they are doing this because they want me to decide and to please me, but sometimes it's just annoying for me. How do you know? What are the signs or the proof to you that a man is confident? What does that mean? Is it about he's got a gun and a fast car and a cool suit or something? No. What is it? His look, that he keeps eye contact, like I do with you now. I hate when someone is like, you know... Breaking eye contact, can't hold it. Yeah. The way that he speaks, that... This is not confident. So what is it that is going to make one man stand out from that crowd of 100 guys in a day or whatever that want to have sex with you? Why is it that one of them is going to get a chance and the others are not? Chemistry, how he talks to me. What does chemistry mean to you? When I think that I might touch him, it gives me good thoughts and good energy. Like right now, I'm being very present with you because I'm looking at you clearly and I'm focused on you and I'm not randomly thinking about other stuff. Like if I was to be doing this interview like this and, you know, looking at my watch and... Phone and phone. Please leave answering phone. Alright, and not listening to your answers. Thank you. And if I was doing all those things, you would perceive, okay, this guy is not present, we would say. He's not aware of me. So like how important is it for a man to be like there with you? This is very important. You should give me the impression that you do care of me. Like I hate when someone is looking at his phone or looking or not looking into my eyes or just, you know, talking with someone else and this is not a good feeling and then I wouldn't be sure if he want to be with me. I had dates like this. I think one of the most important things for me is to have a good sense of humor. For a man to be able to laugh about himself because I really hate these guys who you cannot even tell a joke about some small mistake that he did or something because they get really upset. When I meet a guy who gets upset from that, I feel like, okay, we are not meant for each other because this is a big part of my personality and obviously I don't want to make him feel bad but also I'm not going to stop doing it because I enjoy it. Is there any correlation between men you've been with or are they all randomly different? I really like men with strong opinions who are comfortable with saying whatever they think, you know. Who are not afraid to not to agree with me or telling me if I'm not right in something. And it's also important for me to have some kind of common interest in politics and things that happen in the world. Have you had experience with men who are obviously trying to please you or trying to say the right thing? Yeah, there was one guy who I didn't... I never went on a date with him. He just really wanted to go and I always told him that I don't want to go with him. And whatever he said, whatever stupid thing, because of course sometimes I say stupid things, whatever stupid things I said, he always agreed with me and he was always having some fights with my friends because my friends told me that it's stupid what I think or what I say or what I want to do. And this guy was always just protecting me and it's very weird when someone does that. I don't know why they think that it's a problem if you have different opinions about something. I mean, if you're always agreeing and everything then what are you going to talk about? What do you think it says about his... Why is it unappealing to have a guy who's trying to please you? Oh, I mean, there's absolutely nothing wrong with being a gentleman or being polite but it doesn't mean that you always have to agree on anything. It's very cool to have some arguments about intellectual things or not so intellectual things. It's really great. What does that create? You have this tension and then either you solve it or you have great sex after it because you have a fight and you cannot agree on anything. So it's the only thing you can do. What do you think confidence means in a man? How do you know that a man is confident? I think to me confidence means that a person knows what he wants, first of all. In general, in his life, in a relationship, what he wants, how he wants to achieve it and where he stands right now. So that's to me confidence. A guy who is saying, I don't know what to do with my life, maybe that, maybe this. Well, that's already not really attractive at all. Why is that? Why do you care if he feels confident or not? Well, because in a relationship, you are either a decision maker or you rely on your partner or both of partners agree on some decision together. And since I consider myself rather more logical and rational and I'm prone to take actions, less talk and take action, I don't need to have a partner as a kid to take decisions for him. I don't mind, and don't get me wrong, a partner coming to me asking, like, I'm confused, I don't know what to do in this particular situation. That's not what I'm talking about. But in general, if a guy just sits on his ass and he doesn't really like his career, I mean, his career is not existent, let's put it that way. So the question is, like, so why don't you want to change it? And here comes, well, lots of excuses, excuses, excuses. So the benefit to you from a man, being with a man who's confident, is that you get to move in a direction together as opposed to you needing to be the person that leads a situation. Yeah. So basically, I'm looking for partnership. So it means that one partner can lead another partner at some point and vice versa. But I'm not looking for someone who just, you know, takes me by the hand and, like, organizes my life for me. That's not gonna happen. And the same, I'm not looking for a partner whom I'll be taken care of. I'm not looking for a kid. If I wanted to have a child, I would have a child. But if I look for a partnership, I need an equal. Tell me about what makes a bad date. A bad date when you have nothing to talk about because you have nothing in common. That's the worst. That awkward silence and you're just sitting there and, hmm, I should come up with something but I don't know what. So that's the worst. Okay. So in that situation, a guy's sitting there and he's thinking, fuck, I don't know what to say, I don't know what to ask her. What would be your advice? I think there are topics which can be discussed, like traveling, your last holiday, your dreams, where you want to be. What about touch? You were saying that you sometimes touch the guy. Do you do that in a way that's very obvious or more like it's almost like an accident? Almost like an accident. Yeah, I think so. Yes. I think every woman does that. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I teach that to guys and I learned that from watching women do it to me. Really? Yeah, because girls do that. If they want to touch a guy, they don't just put their arm around him. It's like they'll lean across and do this. Yes. And then you're laughing and you can just, oh. Right. All right, so you would say it's important for a man to notice these signals. Yes. Yeah. Have you had experiences where you were interested in a guy, you were giving him clear signals and he didn't really notice? Yes. Yes, I had it and it was really awkward because I was disappointed that maybe he doesn't like me or what is the problem. I didn't know for sure. Right. It doesn't feel very nice, does it? Yeah. And is it a good idea for a man to ask, like to say, hey, I want to kiss you or something or just to try and kiss you? No, no. Never. We can never say this because we are women and I think that a really mature guy should notice that, ah, she wants to kiss, so I will. Mm-hmm. Are you looking to see the way he treats other people as well as you? Yes. Like, for example, if you're on a date and he was rude to the waiter, would you notice that? Yes. Yeah. I would not want another date with that guy because if he can be so rude with a waiter or waitress, then he could be rude with me. And do you like it if a man says to you, obviously in a kind way, but like, okay, I didn't like this, so can we try this? You're open to that? Yes, I am. Because it means that he really cares about our sexual life and he wants it to be good, not just for me but also for him, and that's why the communication is always the best thing to do. Do you like a man to be very dominant in bed? Mm, not all the time. Mm-hmm. But most of the time, yes. So if a guy was only ever doing very slow, tender, gentle lovemaking, would that be boring or fun? It would be boring. Yeah, because I would feel that maybe he doesn't think that I am so attractive or I don't know. Mm-hmm. Tell me more about what's the opposite of that. I really love when we are just, I don't know, cooking or something really natural thing we are doing and he just grabs me and kisses me and tells me that, ah, okay, I just want to fuck you right now. Mm-hmm. And then I say, ah, okay, we can go. Yeah, so he needs to be confident and, yeah, that's the trigger for me sometimes. What is it about that that's appealing to you? Mm, it makes me feel like I am attractive and he's really interested in me right now. Right, so it's like he can't help himself. No. He can't wait until after dinner. Yeah. And that makes you feel really sexy. Yes. Tinder sucks. Waiting for a hot girl to enter your social circle and then try to be friends with her for some months or years and then make an awkward move on her and her say, let's just be friends, also sucks. You know what doesn't suck? Being able to have the balls and the skills to go up to a woman that you like the look of and make a good impression and ask her out.
