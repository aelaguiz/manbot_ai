First of all, thank you for the speech. A lot of things resonated with me. You said you believed that change can be unlimited and you said you had like a couple of examples. Can you give us one example right now, please? In terms of the function of change, as in how much things can change? What exactly are you asking? I can't remember precisely what you said. I think it was about when you were talking about taping into this unlimited power from the universe to apply change. Yes, that's a great question. Something to be aware of is that there's an assumption that if we can change, that we should just kind of get a little bit better. It's kind of what Jamie just said, which is true as well. There's a practicality to change that comes from like, let's just build strategic steps towards effective change. I think that's definitely a very powerful pathway. That's kind of like the linear deductive pathway of success. Once again, there's a school of thought. For example, look at goal setting and personal development. There's a school of thought which says like, you build a plan, you build a strategy, you stick with the plan, you take the steps, you make it happen, and you just keep on grinding. I get it. That's true. It's very fucking true. You've got to keep on grinding and get your steps in place. There's another paradigm which says that you can basically drop a seed into this powerful aspect of yourself, which you could call your unconscious or your deeper self or your heart, or you could call it like, you know, doing magic or whatever you want to call it. And the thing about that is if you get that seed programmed well and you drop it into the right place, it's almost like alignments will just start to manifest themselves. And that's very troubling for the ego to understand. The ego is like, I don't want to believe that shit. Like I've been invested in grinding my whole life. I don't want to give it up. And it's sometimes a little bit of a confrontation. The interesting thing to recognize is that as you are moving into what I would call creative mindsets and starting to trust in creation, that you can be open to the possibility that something beyond your imagination could happen. That's all you need to be open to. And as you open to that possibility, it may well just happen. And I can tell you, because I've had plenty of these experiences in my life in the sense of like, I mean, if I look at the trajectory of my life, there is no reason I should be here, seriously. Like I was like a poor kid from, like a poor hippie kid from a shitty little town in Australia. And now I get to travel the world with some of my best friends doing amazing stuff, changing like hundreds, if not thousands of lives, you know. And if I look at the pathway that got me to this place, it all started from an assumption that I was a creator and that I could make it happen. And to the degree that I believe my limitations is the degree that I'm not able to do that. You know, to the degree that I believe the possibilities is the degree that I can step into those possibilities. Now once again, there's lots of examples of that. And the interesting thing about really living as a creator is that when you really put something out there and you really connect with it, then you kind of have to get out of your own way. And one of the tricks of really projecting like a clear desire and a clear outcome and getting things done is to put it out there with intent and with power and with like a strong seed of will attached to it and then to kind of detach from it, to not worry about it, to release yourself from expectations and trust that there is like a different thing inside of you that's taking care of it. Like I've got a very cool friend who describes it like, it's like when I want something, I just write a post-it note and I stick it on the sky and higher management takes care of it. It's a really simple way to look at it, but why not? Why not play with these ideas? Because you think the thing that stops us from these possibilities is basically cynicism and self-doubt. Now, okay, if you want to live in that paradigm, that's fine. I'm actually a very scientific and sceptical person, believe it or not. But at the same time, I'm sceptical enough to be sceptical of my scepticism. I allow myself the possibility that I can out-science my science mind. And the truth is that real change and real transformation and really working with reality at its core level is that it's beyond this tiny little like way that the humans think that the world works. Like the truth is we live in an infinite miraculous universe that has literally manifest out of nothing. We have no idea. We don't know how fire works or what anything's doing. We don't know what anything is really, like what electricity is, yet look at all this stuff. We use it all the time. It's just happening. So life is kind of like that, trusting in the process, using what we have to keep moving forward and allowing the world to be something that's much bigger than what we assumed in the small little box. And this goes for yourself as well because the truth is that you are infinite beings. Like when I say that, I mean like your psyche has the room inside of it for all the gods in the universe, for imaginations upon imaginations of imaginations, oceans and oceans of universes of potential live inside of you as creative possibilities. Yet at the same time, out of all that infinity of things that you could be focusing on creating and allowing to be part of your attention, what do most people do? Most people gather up the shitty little broken pieces of themselves and they put them in a little collection and they bow down and they worship them. And they put them in their little cabinet and they walk around, come and look at my cabinet of broken things everybody. I've got, what are your broken things like? And everybody shares in their brokenness. And I understand where that comes from because it comes from an assumption that we're not good enough to sit in the reality of everything. And there's something, it's a bit of a weird idea as well, but imagine if the whole reason we actually create culture and the whole reason we've gone on this massive escapade of excessively intellectualizing the world was simply because we just aren't confident and capable enough to just settle in ourselves and be okay with the rawness of what we are. And as men, it's one of your most powerful, powerful gifts to sit in that rawness and to deliver that and to bring that with your presence. And you're going to see that. You're going to see that in us this weekend and hopefully that's going to transfer to you guys. You guys can be in your depth and your rawness as well because it's great that you go out there in the world and you have impact and you learn these skills and you do these different strategies to get effects. But it's also really important that you anchor yourself into your depth and your presence because there is a way that you can get to where eventually you can just be with somebody and they are very, very intensely affected by the fact that you're there with them. And in my mind, you talk about change and you open this question with like, you know, what's a really powerful experience of change or an example of change? I mean, there's lots of things, I mean, I've manifested money and beautiful girlfriends and like trips around the world and all kinds of shit just by purely putting my intent on those things. But what's really amazing in my mind is the ability that I can move somebody's heart, that I can shift somebody's destiny by me understanding my own heart. And that's one of the most invisible and un-misunderstood things in the whole world. Everybody wants all the shiny fireworks and people don't pay respect to the real change which is being really, really present. And you know, you'll see it. You'll see it in all of us. Yeah. I hope that makes sense."}
