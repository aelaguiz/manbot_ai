Now, a couple of weeks ago, myself and Liam announced that for the first time ever, The Natural Lifestyles is putting on its first super conference, which is called the Masculine Mastermind Conference. It's going to be held here in Budapest on the 23rd through to the 25th of June. And when we released this, we didn't make a big song and dance about it. We just put out one little video and sent an email and already we've sold 50 spots. And the venue that we've hired takes 70 guys. So we're at this point where we can only take 20 more dudes. And so here is another little gentle video to remind those who are interested that you better book your seats basically today or it's going to be sold out. Now, what is the Masculine Mastermind Conference? This is an opportunity for guys to come and meet with the full 10L team in person. So that is myself, Liam McRae, Tony Solo, Travel Bum aka Andrew Holiday, and of course, the inner game guru, Shea Matthews. So this is the first time ever that the whole crew is getting together and presenting a full weekend's worth of material to a live audience. Most of the time, if you want to come and learn from us or meet us, you have to come to one of our incredibly expensive but fucking awesome live workshops. We only run half a dozen of these a year and only teach around 70 to 80 guys. And for most people, this is prohibitively expensive and difficult to get to because you have to travel to other parts of the world. So we decided that we wanted to put on something that was very reasonably priced. The price is only 295 euros. And literally, you couldn't even get one hour Skype call with me for that amount of money. So we decided to basically take a hit on the finances of this to make sure that guys who like students or guys from poorer countries or simply guys who haven't had a chance to see us or meet us could come, hang out with us, and learn from us. So what we're going to be doing over this action-packed weekend is we're going to be putting on a bunch of presentations, speeches with exclusive material that we have never released live anywhere except sometimes in our live workshops. We'll be running guys through in the mornings, there'll be newbies or beginners conferences where we go through the basics of getting over your approach anxiety, social freedom exercises, how to have conversations that don't suck, what it means to pull the trigger, looking at the foundations of the five principles system, which is what we teach in our workshops. And then in the afternoons, we'll be putting on more advanced or more specialized presentations in areas which are the specialty of each of the coaches. I can't give away too much about that. For the guys that want to get this amazing exclusive material, stuff that you're just not going to see on YouTube, you're just going to have to come to the conference. By now, if you've been watching this channel for a while, you know who we are. You know that we're legit. You know that we speak the truth and we're fucking awesome at what we do. So come along and find it out what's going to be in there. This is a fantastic opportunity to come meet with us, get your questions answered, hang out with the coaches, and very importantly, meet a whole bunch of like-minded guys from around Europe and from around the world. We've already had some guys who booked in from as far away as Argentina. So there's some serious dudes coming from across the planet to see us. And you cannot discount the importance of having a group of men around you, a social circle or tribe that assist you in your growth. It's quite difficult to stay at home watching videos and expect to be able to make real growth and real change in your seduction and lifestyle progress. Because the fact is that you tend to resonate and you tend to operate at the level of the people around you, the people that you are hanging out with and the people you're discussing things with. Most men don't have a really progressive social circle of guys who want to change, who are willing to face their fears, who are willing to move past their excuses and get shit done. The guys that filter through to us are such men. These are guys who are proactive. These are guys who are open-minded. These are guys who really want to change and learn. So a fantastic opportunity to come and meet. At this point, 50 by the time this video is up for a few days, it's going to be 70 men from around the world that you can hook up with, hang out with, go out and wing in this amazing city, this city Budapest, Hungary, where TNL have decided to base ourselves. We didn't do that because we had to. We did it because it's full of gorgeous women, interesting architecture, great bathhouses, crazy party scene, and it's totally safe. If you were worried about Eastern Europe, thinking that they're going to take your liver out and sell it on the black market, don't worry. That was years ago. These days, everything's totally cool here. So that's it for me. I'm not going to make any more announcements about this conference because I know it's going to sell out in the next few days. In fact, we are going to close it on the 31st of March no matter what happens because we've got other stuff to think about and other stuff to promote. So if you want to come to the Masculine Mastermind Conference from the 23rd to the 25th of June, click the link roughly here or somewhere around there. It'll take you to a page which explains things in full detail. You can book your ticket right there. We'll be then sending you out an information package with regards to travel and where you should stay and how to catch a taxi without getting ripped off, all that kind of gear. It's going to be very easy. So I hope to see you in Budapest, Hungary, 23rd of June. This is James Marshall, signing out. Transcribed by https://otter.ai"}
