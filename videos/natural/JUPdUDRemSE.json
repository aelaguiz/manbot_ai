Which I remember doing back when I was a teenager. Because what I would do is turn my girl on while let's say we went to bed together, and this is embarrassing here, thinking about the 19 year old version of me that was kind of acting like a middle aged married man. All right, so Rory asked this question to me privately the other day, and now he's making it public, so I guess we'll read it. So I watched James' video on YouTube, why nice guys don't get blowjobs and hot girls marry chads or something. It got me thinking, I'm more of a pushing person and I'm not open to receive, and also I do believe taking is bad on some level, like stealing, like what James mentions in the video. And then you're asking about which workshop is the best to handle this. I'm gonna keep that as a separate thing, because I don't, and that's why I didn't answer you, because I didn't wanna go buy my workshop for this answer. It's like, let's look at the answer and you can think about the workshop another time. So what we're looking at is, I don't know if you watched that video. And this is an interesting analogy of this or way to describe this is with a blowjob. You can give a blowjob, right, so the woman can give me it out of service, or I can take it. You know, I can say, get on your knees and suck my dick. I was using blowjobs as an example of something that can be given, can be received, and can also be taken. And therefore, if I take the blowjob, and of course, as some people said in the comments, this is sexual abuse. I mean, within consent, obviously, or maybe not obviously. Within a consensual situation where we have a sexual encounter where I'm dominating or taking in the sense that I am using in a good way the woman for my physical pleasure in this moment, which is something that you, if you don't do that, then it strips the sexual element of a lot of fun and it puts the woman in a position where she doesn't get to allow you to use her as a sexual object and to objectify her and to please yourself with her or on her or in her is actually a really positive thing for a woman within the broader context of that being basically balanced, right? So of course, if we have some hypothetical male who just comes home from work and pumps his wife for 90 seconds, bends her over the table and pumps her and then passes out on the couch, and that's the sex life that they have, that's gonna be highly unfulfilling for her probably because, all right, she gets to experience the being ravaged quickly by the man who just wants to use her because he's turned on by her, okay? And that could be a really cool thing to do sometimes, right? To have a quickie where the man just grabs the woman and lifts her skirt up and fucks her and then gives her a pat on the butt and says, I gotta get back to work. That would be a really hot thing in conjunction with many other types of sex, right? Because I've talked to girls about where they've had the other side where the man figures out that here's these things she likes, right? So she likes in the bath, she likes to be touched in this way and she orgasms most effectively from this position with this kind of stimulation, with this toy, for example. And the guy has it in his head that the woman should come first twice before he does, which is not maybe an unusual idea. And it kind of comes from a good place, right? Which is that you wanna understand the woman physically, you wanna open her up, you want to give her pleasure and that's great. So you have figured this out with a partner maybe over some time. And so then you repeat that. If I do that every time, or most of the time, that is gonna get extremely boring because now I'm serving or giving to the girl in a way that I've found out works. And so I may be able to give her an orgasm each time because I know that this is how a clitoris works and this is the thing that gets her off, but that can still become extremely unsatisfying because she's now always in the position of receiving, which is like, okay, my man serves me. And in the worst case, it's like, and then he kind of hints at or hopes for a blow job or maybe in bad scenarios, he even whinges about it and goes, come on, babe, can I just get a blow job? Which I remember doing back when I was a teenager. Jesus Christ. Because what I would do is turn my girl on. Well, let's say we went to bed together and this is embarrassing here thinking about the 19 year old version of me that was kind of acting like a middle-aged married man. I remember instances of trying to turn her on physically when she was kind of not in the mood and then maybe that kind of worked and then getting it turned on enough to fuck her and then going, eh, so how about the blow job? Which is not a sexy prospect for her because now it's not like he's even trying to take it off me he's trying to bargain it or plead for it or give something with a covert contract hoping that I will get what is owed to me in return. This is where if you reframe the idea of taking as a negative thing and you put it more into this broader spectrum of what are dynamics of sexuality between let's say one partner in this situation that over time are going to nourish, excite, allow both parties to play different roles, roles for each other as well, right? Like in all good relationships we play roles for each other in some way, right? In good friendships we play roles of empathy, of sharing, of helping, of calling each other out on bullshit. On their birthday making them feel special and on your birthday they make you feel special, right? Like these are ways that we kind of reaffirm these trades within a relationship that are built upon a genuine care but the care isn't expressed and also the needs are expressed in different ways. And sometimes my need supersedes my friend's need and they're like, I really need your help man to do this thing and that might put him out because he has to take off an afternoon to help me with that thing. And I'm taking his time and he's allowing his time or labor or money or whatever to be used by me because I need that and that puts him, if it's done well, it puts him in a position of, okay, cool, I get to back my bro up in this kind of way and that is balanced in some kind of way over time. Whereas of course, if we had a friendship where that was the guy, where I'm that guy that always only calls up when I need something to whinge or to use, then we have an imbalance in this wheel of exchange and over time it will cause resentment and usually break the bond. So if we then take that back into the sexual sphere, none of those positions need to be negative. It's not a bad thing for me to call my friend and say, I need some help man, can you help me out? And we can enjoy doing that together and that person feels nourished by being needed or by being of service, of being able to help. And in the same way sexually or in the sexual variation on that, I wanna take the blow job, right? It's not a selfish evil thing that I'm doing just for myself at the detriment of the woman. I have my desire and my pleasure that I want and if it's done well and in a sexy way, then she gets to experience allowing the man to fulfill himself with her or to give herself to him in a particular way so that he can please himself. And then if it's done well and it works, which it should if you're balancing the wheel correctly, then she feels validated, she feels sexy, she feels of service, she feels that she in this moment is an object of sexual desire. I don't mean the word objectification in a negative sense which would be, okay, that's just an object and I'm gonna fuck it and I don't care what the human is. In this case, it's like no, she kind of transforms into purely a sexual object for both their pleasure in this moment and it's not that he doesn't see her as a human, he is emphasizing and so is she the sexual aspect of her humanness which then he gets to consume or use or experience which is a really sexy thing for a woman because it means to her, yes, I'm really sexy, yes, I'm really wanted, yes, I am the person that can please him in this way or even yes, I'm just gonna let go and because I trust him and I love him or I trust him at least in his dominant power that it's gonna be safe and it's gonna be fun that I then get to play this role of, I'm his sex doll in this kind of scenario. And then, cool, then if I then flip that to later on going down on her and basically doing the same for her which is where I'm of service to her, I'm pleasing her and it's not for my desire and then what do I get from that? I get the feeling of, okay, I'm making a woman scream and enjoy herself and I'm feeling nourished from that as well or she wants to take me and if the woman wants to tie you up and ride you like a pony then, or a monkey riding an elephant. And that's something that a lot of men struggle with is that the taking of pleasure because they feel like it's stealing or they feel like they're doing something against it. No, women want to experience that. Some men struggle with receiving of pleasure where she wants to come and give you something, she wants to dance for you or she wants to give you a blowjob as opposed to you taking one which is a different kind of experience. Or to allow which can be a frightening one for men which is to allow the woman to take command and lead the thing or to create the dynamic which is a really interesting one from a man too because then you get to see the woman in more of her autonomous power and you become the pleasure object. So if you're a man that is sincerely aiming to please and be pleased to really experience the depth of what is possible in intimate and sexual behavior then all of those things are good. So don't dissect and itemize them as like this is a negative one. They all have a shadow aspect, all of them. Like the person who gives and gives and gives but is doing it out of neediness and out of lack of self-worth, that's a really shadow expression of a good thing which is giving. And of course on the other side you become the completely sociopathic selfish person that takes and that's not good either. Good day gentlemen. Now in order to have a relationship where there is a good balance between giving, taking, receiving and allowing, essentially meaning that both yours and your partner's needs get met. This is something that needs to start from the very get go. Most men set themselves up in situations where they become pushovers in relationships because they don't speak their mind or make their needs or boundaries understood from the very beginning. We can help you out with that. Coming up at the beginning of May, we have our first seven day residential here in Budapest, Hungary where myself and the TNO team will be taking you around the clock to learn, install and practice the subtle and powerful arts of natural style seduction. This includes being able to be bold, go for what you want and set boundaries and challenges very early so the woman knows that you are the type of guy that she should take seriously. This complete toolkit and skillset is necessary to understand in order for you to have stable and functional relationships in the future. It's not enough to just learn how to hustle girls into bed. You need to learn how to manage them as well. We cover all this and much, much more in our seven day residential coming up on the 9th of May in Budapest, Hungary. If you're interested, just click the link below, get on a call with one of our chaps and hopefully we'll see you here for the first day. Otherwise, see you in the next video. Peace."}
