They're out very much go-getting and doing things. They're earning money, they're out traveling, they're doing things, they're more independent. So when it comes to the bedroom, they just want to be taken. James, Dr. Sater. I'm just going to assume you're a British man for some reason. First of all, great to see you on a webinar together. No kidding, and the one you had on the LDA was clearly a highlight for me. On the course, MLM is a masterpiece. You're welcome. Thank you. Now my question. Why do I like being dominant? I love it to unleash my inner beast. What is the consensus in the scientific community, respectively, respecting, I guess, R-E-S-P, C-T. What are your thoughts on why male-dominant and female-submissive behavior, R-E-S-P. You're going to have to write the exact word because we want to make sure we know what we're doing. Preferences for those behavior patterns emerge. Yeah, so what's in the scientific community? Why is the male-dom, female-sub thing a thing? I don't actually think that people have answered that question, to be honest, because they're too concerned with gender equality right now. But this is actually a good, normal behavior. It's a good, normal behavior, but because it's not woke, then it's not really looked at right now. It can't be funded. It couldn't be funded right now. Not right now. Okay, well. So what's usually looked at is females now dominating, and males becoming more submissive. Or the dangers of the toxic masculine that's dominant. It's bullshit. So I think right now, maybe one of them, and this is my speculation, just observing. So it's not science. It's just me looking. But there's a lot more women now in charge of their businesses or their lives. They're out very much go-getting and doing things. They're earning money. They're out traveling. They're doing things. They're more independent. So when it comes to the bedroom, they just want to be taken. And it's actually really healing because if you're always in that part of yourself that's making decisions, that's in control, it's hard to access your more receptive side. And as a woman, your receptive side really comes through sensuality and sense in your own body. And you can't do that when you're a lot in your head. So that's the dominant observation that I've noticed, and I think that's what makes it fun. I think for a lot of guys right now, politically correct, it's not that cool if you're overly dominant in social settings. It's like, no, no, you just gotta let the ladies talk, or you gotta not mansplain everything. So it actually probably is quite healing also for a guy just to unleash himself, and in a loving way, in a kind way, dominate a person, lead a person through something, which is really, I think, the most beautiful thing. But I do want to say something. I think a lot of guys dom because they don't want feedback. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because I've had a few of these experiences personally, and I was like... I'm the dom, I'm in charge. I was like, wow, this is horrible in so many ways. And you can't give feedback because they're in the dom position. Like, oh, you're only a dom because you're a shit lover, and it's not because you actually have a skill set. And then other people, they don't even know that they're doming. It's just a very natural thing. They're leading you on an incredible experience and just taking charge and making decisions along the way. And so dominance doesn't always look like dirty talking or hitting or this kind of stuff. It's sometimes just how you grab a body and move a body with confidence that you're, in that sense, in a dominant role. And that is so relaxing to the nervous system. Yeah, in the last few days, I've been doming a wonderful woman. Not me. Maybe we would just set a stopwatch and we're like, 30 seconds for you, 30 seconds for me. I was like, fucking take that. Yeah, okay, take that. And at the end, we just shake hands. That's right. Okay, that sounds good. Deal. In the kitchen. In the kitchen with everyone watching. All right, so yeah, I've been doming a lovely lady in some of the most special ways that I think I ever had because I'm in a special zone at the moment, which I'll gradually tell you guys about over the next four to five years. And she is, let's say she's an extreme overachiever. At the age of 21, she is already not only a qualified lawyer. Last time I saw her, she just finished her law degree. And then I haven't seen her for six-ish months. And I come back and she comes in. And the first thing, she's all totally stressed out, totally stressed out. And we start to talk and I said, how you been? She said, well, I lost my first case. And I was so pissed and I said, whoa, whoa, whoa. You just said you just lost your first case, which the presupposition would be that you have already had multiple cases and that you won all the other ones. And I'm like, how many did you win? She's like three. And I'm like, what the fuck? Since I last saw you just graduated and you're already doing divorce cases and you won three and you lost one and you're pissed that you lost the one. And let me tell you the story. It's fucking gold, right? She wouldn't mind me this at all. And this is not a true thing that happened. This is just a story I'm making up right now. So once upon a time, there was a man and a woman and they got married. And for whatever reason, they signed a prenup that said if one or other of them cheats, then the other one gets the lot. The cheating one loses and the other one gets everything. So it's a zero sum poker game. No cheating then. Yeah. You lose. All right. So one day. There's money involved. It's not poor people. There's money involved in these people, right? Medium money. Okay, medium money. Yeah. Which means rich. Okay. So one day in this story, that's not true. A lady came home a little early. Earlier than she would to pick up something. And she opens the door to the house. And inside is a full-blown orgy going on. Guys, girls, everybody, drugs, you name it. It's fucking going off, right? And she's obviously shocked and shattered. So she doesn't think to take out her phone and take photos. So she goes off to her mother. And then she goes to court with her husband. In this story, that's not true. And so there was a young lady who had recently become a lawyer. And she was hired as the defense lawyer for the husband. Oh, the orgy man. Well, not that. Supposedly. The orgy man, right? Okay. And the orgy man. Orgy man. There's an orgy man. Bob Dylan song in that. He swore blind to his defense lawyer that it was all a lie. She made it all up. And she believed him. She truly believed him. Because he was very convincing. And so she goes to work to defend her client against this woman who's lying. And she's doing her job like a professional. And she goes into court. And she wins the case. Because it's he said, she said. There's no proof. So what's happening is. So the judge in whatever country in this made up story there is. Says to. I don't know how the law works. But at some point says. Is there anything else? Like, okay. In favor of the defendant. Orgy man. Orgy man. You get free to go free. Right. And lady. You lose everything. Right. And then is there anything anyone would like to say? And the man says. Yes. Is it alright? Is it alright if I go back to my orgies now? Is it alright if I go back to my orgies now? And the lawyer. The defense lawyer. Got up and said. I resign. And she walked out of the room. Like a fucking boss. And then the judge. Who knew the law. Said you are now guilty of perjury. And so you will have a new case against you. And however or something. Something legal. Something. I now rule in favor of the wife. And you lose everything. Oh my god. Why would he say that? Think about it. He won. Because he's a fucking arrogant prick. Who was like. Yeah. I can do whatever I want. And I did it. Yeah. And now the laws on my side. And oh. Bye bye. Talk about poetic justice. Yeah. Unbelievable. And that's the case. That this person. That doesn't exist. That's not a lawyer. In this imaginary story. That I'm making up. Lost. Crazy. You couldn't write this shit right? No. Unbelievable. Next question. So the moral of the story is. Don't have orgies. If you're going to lose all your money. Don't sign prenups. Yeah. Don't get married. Don't lie to women. Don't lie. Yeah. I don't know. Don't swing your dick in court. Yeah. Don't. Yeah. Hum. Be a little humble. Humble. And be like. Oh. He lost. Everything. And I'm like. Good. Alright. Alright. What's next? Pay the cost. Be the boss. Alright. So. I don't know if I really answered the question on dominant submissive. Because I don't have that good enough information. The main thing is. I would just have to say is. Whatever you enjoy. Just enjoy it. And honestly. Looking for science to affirm us sexually is silly. A lot of science. The way that they do sex research. They can't actually measure proper things. You're actually not even allowed to do sex research if orgasm is involved. Explain. Yeah. And Nicole Prowse. She's one of the lead scientists right now for sex research and what happens with orgasm in the brain. And. Coming to you in a different person. In a different person. She did TEDx talk. You can check it out. It's really cool. And she talks about like actually the best part of orgasm is not orgasm. It's everything before the orgasm. So. So. But she can't do research on. She can do sex research. But the women that she wanted to research can't actually orgasm in the lab. Can they do it? Can they do it on monkeys? I don't know that. I'm not even. They want to do human. I don't know. They just want to do human studies for human sexuality. Chimpanzees. I'm not even sure. I would like to study bonobos before. Because I know that there was. I remembering something about there was someone that was doing research and they did make chimpanzees, bonobos, no orgasm, the females. I'll have to look it up. And then that was okay. I think that was okay. Okay. Yeah. It's not okay with humans. So it's just, um, my point is needing science to affirm your sexual experience is actually not going to help you. The most important thing is, is feeling into yourself. Do I enjoy this? Is my partner enjoying this and letting that, calling that a day really? Because there's a lot of things that I've been able to experience that I can't find anywhere in any science or sexual research. And so I have to affirm it myself. Right. Yeah. I guess I'll add, cause I went off on a tangent, but I was the, the point of that tangent was to say that this, this is a very alpha woman in her, in her, in her world. And because of her, the way she looks, which is hot, uh, she's not taken seriously and she's not a tall person, uh, and she's not taken seriously by men or women, right? And all men want to fuck her and women think like a jealous and or think she's like, you know, a child or whatever, which she's clearly not. And when she comes to me, she needs to be domed. But in, I don't know how many different ways, many, many different ways. Uh, and because I'm intuitively and technically and empathetically good at this because I wish to be, I can read and write. Now what I've realized in the last some days is that she's a, she's a lady who will orgasm every 20 to 60 seconds, right? Forever. And I'm not, I'm not exaggerating at all for hour upon hour, if you can handle it. Um, but which, which may sound awesome and it is in some sense, but my training with her now is to helping her to, let's say orgasm less, right? To actually slow it all down because she wants to get to her body, like kind of in a way forces her to get to the orgasm quickly for what reasons I won't get into. Um, and the training on her is, is interesting because in a way it's, let's say the mirror image or the reverse of, of, of a woman that can't, you know, can't come. Um, but it's again, it relates exactly to what Seda is talking about in terms of mapping, in terms of modulating, in terms of movement of the bodies, in terms of using Tantra, you know, and I introduced some basic Tantra to you guys and I explained that it's not Tantra actually. It's, it's pop Tantra. Uh, it's, you know, that real Tantra is a whole other thing. Um, and as Seda and I both kind of, I think are on the same page, we're not into technically being Tantric people and there are people to whom that is their thing and they want to be part of like a, you know, an organization where that's their thing. Uh, and that's all good as there are kinksters who like just, just not only just, they live in the kink world and that's their, you know, their space. But both of us, I'm going to mansplain for you a little bit, um, I would say are some cross pollination of many of those, you know, we learned, we learned shit loads from those communities, right? Yes, exactly. And then we, you know, went and did all this kind of stuff. And we experiment a lot. And we experiment and we take feedback and we give orders and we, and we ask for things and we, and we receive things and we give a lot. And to finish my answer, look, there's all sorts of types of doms, but the type of dom I am is I care for women, right? And I'm careful. full with women and I don't take no shit from women right because obviously we can have these shadow sides of the good things so you know you've got the good man and the nice guy right we have the the simp and the fucking abuser or whatever Andrew Tate basically you know and so out in the manosphere and out in the out in the clickbait world of YouTube where you've got to fucking get clicks by saying 10 sex positions all women love which is my highest ranked video of all time 1.7 million clicks it's also true because I'm not gonna lie but it's like okay the most extreme thing is the thing that gets the eyeballs and so then the algorithm you know feeds back in on itself audience capture look it up if you don't know what that is and the kind of polarization of the sexes but not just the sexes all sides against all sides in every aspect whether it's politics or fucking finance or whatever it is right and and and as we are funneling ourselves into our own information bubbles and as the algorithms are doing it to us and as the your influences are getting influenced by what you want actually and they don't even know it because they it crafts they're like oh that video worked oh that one got less clicks oh this and that's what audience capture is and which is why both of us don't have nearly as many fucking followers clicks fans as we should right but don't worry about us we're doing fine and why you know just having an idea that a dominant man is always taking charge and always tells the woman what to do and something something and if you're not that you're a pansy soy boy you know cuck whatever then that's kindergarten shit yeah because I find the most exquisite doms are having tremendous kindness and immense sensitivity like energetic sensitivity that's off the chart they can feel the nuances deep inside that I can't even articulate and that is something that just comes with practice and the love of other human beings really yes yeah that's a good way to say it because I would say the love of women but it's the love of other human beings and you know in the sexual sense if you're straight and it's the love of women and I've said this many times the greatest seducers love women women how did Tony solo say women and I'll finish with this point we might have a little break you were saying you were talking about doming someone yeah certainly caring for them yeah and just normalizing it and I think I'm loving okay lovely all right good seduces love women because you know what I get on workshops relatively common commonly is a guy who comes in who's banged you know less than five women and he comes in and he says you know and when I take him out and feel I always say the guys we're not here to find your wife we're not here to find your ten right you're here to learn about women you learn to practice I'm not gonna send you after a woman that I know that is a not attractive person you know on the consensus reality I'm not gonna send you after an ugly chick I'm gonna send you after pretty cute sexy you know quirky whatever like sexy girls in all sorts of ways and you are going to do it you are going to do it and the only reason you're not the only caveat is if I say go and speak to that lady you say I'd rather speak to her and if there's another one you see then go and then the way to get around that is just go and talk to women before James Marshall goes you are going to know I was in Budapest mm-hmm and I got approached by one of your students I swear of course like perfect I was like oh my god I didn't say that I knew you but I really appreciated it good it was a gentleman excellent yeah right and it and as the great James McLean once said it is a gentleman's job to try and fuck a lady now we'll put that aside so the final point is okay these guys you know sometimes guys like this come in and I take it and take them out and walking along and I said okay go on go and speak to this girl he's never approached a girl or he's done five approaches and he said oh she's not my type and I say you don't have a type you have not earned a type you have no idea what you're talking about he's like no I know what I like I said okay tell me what type you like I like skinny girls with big tits and I'm like oh really so you like models the ones with big tits or the ones with small tits there's the two types yeah and then he's like the small tits one or the big tits one I'm like okay and then I have and I tell them this and I only tell them this once and if they don't get it then I just do my job cool you know you're not gonna learn then we'll wait until we see a big titted or small titted model good luck buddy and they will shred you they will shred you good luck I'm doing my job you don't want to pay me for but I have this little chapter on right and I say something you know different ways for different people but along the lines of true seduces true lovers Casanovas Lafarios you know what's another synonym I don't know men who you know great lovers across time and space love women doesn't mean they're gonna fuck every one of them doesn't mean that they're gonna go and chase and have sex with an ugly girl or whatever it means that they love the feminine they love women in general and some women are cunts right they're not they're not good and some men are fucking cunts right and so when you meet a cunt right if people like what Australian it means what it sounds like there's a video if you look up there's about the nuances of the of the way that Australians use the word c-u-n-t because in other languages English yeah we get away with it yeah he's a funny cunt he's dumb cunt yeah he's a good cunt but if you say it like this you're a fucking cunt then there's a fight about to happen yeah all right so anyway of this speech and I say like the best ladies men that I've ever known sleep with different types of women and sometimes they bring home a woman that is not tech even though they can even though they can hit the tens or the nines or the eight point fives every time if they choose they sometimes and not and when they want wish to choose to bring home a girl that is not you know that is a six technically or whatever because they got a vibe because there's something sexy about it because they want to give a gift you know for various other reasons and they are nourished by her and she is nourished by him and now and I'm not you know this can be with any combination of male female now both of us have good representations of what is a good man and a good woman right forget about all the gender fucking politics whatever blah blah blah good man good woman right and we need each other in order to survive thrive feel love etc I was gonna say there are two types of guys there's two types of guys men who like women and men who love women and the men who like women they're very finicky ah yes that's so I can let me let me interrupt it yeah yeah cuz these these guys like they're like oh she has to be like this and this and when walking down the street you just see them like every woman is furniture yeah it's until we like oh no no and they're like no no no no no they don't see them no and of course the women don't fucking see them either right and then they're like oh that one oh no her hair's a bit something or something like dude you're wasting my time and your money seriously you can always tell and the men who love women they're like they're gonna have a lot of women go recommend them even because they're just like wow that guy was amazing good day gentlemen James Marshall hanging in my hammock now I'm a bit sick because I got COVID-19 finally after three years of somehow avoiding it I got it and it
