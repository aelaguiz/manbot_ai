And then through that, one of our contacts knew Jay Alvarez. And so, we engineered a party in Cannes, was it? No, in Barcelona. Jay Alvarez came to our party, he ate some of our food, flirted with the chicks, and then he left. And then, an hour later, three guys turned up at the gates and were knocking and going, Hey man, is Jay Alvarez here? Because we're a big fan. We're like, what the fuck? How did you know he was here? He's just left. I only had him for one hour. He doesn't even know who I am, so I can't help you. If there's anyone there, and I'm pointing at you, write something on the screen like a love heart or an emoji of some sort so I know you're there. There we go. I'm going to close this little box. Yeah, just tap on it. You can put a Mr. Mark on it. Cool, Neil says yes. All right, just give us a second guys, we're just sitting up in our pool. Hey, hey, now listen guys, here's what I want to talk to you about. I got a great deal. Off the back of a truck. Hang on, I'll be back, I just got to do a deal. Hottie, hottie, hottie, hottie. Hottie, hottie, hottie. Hottie, hottie, hottie. All right, are we live? Yeah. Oh, oh. Hang on a minute, let me just... Hey there, boys. All right, we figured it out. We're live on multiple groups. Welcome, gentlemen. I presume different people are going to be rolling in. You guys grew some beards. Yes, we did. We did grow some beards. I've gone half silver fox and I think by the end of the year, I'm going to be full silver beard and then brown hair, which is an interesting look. I think the girls with daddy issues will enjoy that. Cool. All right, so what I want to do today is basically give you guys a little impromptu micro lecture about a topic that I've been thinking about a lot lately because I've been preparing for the Lifestyle Online Academy and I've been designing my life for 20 years to be kick-ass and it's always been on my mind. So I'm going to have a chat to you guys about that. Before that, I'm going to open things up to one or two questions while people are going in. And the first one we have is from Neil. Will this course cover digital nomad jobs? Okay, so I will definitely be covering in depth the digital nomad lifestyle, which is not limited to guys who work on their laptops, right? So I've met lots of, let's say, they're not always digitally, let's just say post construction, location independent, not all the time, sometimes. Sometimes they work kind of seasonally. I used to do that. I would go and work on fruit farms when I was 18 years old in the summer. I would work my fucking ass off. That's the last time I did real hard labour before I moved to this farm. But I would work my ass off for 10 hours a day. I would save up a few thousand bucks over a month or so and then I would go and travel to India or Asia or wherever I wanted to go and study. So that was a nomadic style of life. It was just an early version of it. I was using the only things that I had to trade on, which was my physical labour. Back when I was 18, nobody wanted to pay me for anything else. If you're an 18-year-old girl, there's other things you can do. But as an 18-year-old boy, not much else you can do but lift and pick. But that was the beginnings of me starting a lifestyle where I could be travelling, working and then travelling, downsizing, making my life lean and then saving my cash and putting it into something that was really worthwhile for me on a personal level. So in terms of will I be covering how to be a nomad, yes, absolutely. I'm not going to teach you digital nomad jobs. That's up to you to figure out whether you're going to upskill in terms of graphic design or photography or massage or consultancy or a specialised skill that is in demand like nursing. If you're a nurse, you can get a job right now anyway. But there's lots of jobs which do allow you to move and there's also ones that don't. So that's what I will be looking at. And I'll be looking at what are the strategies that I used in order to infiltrate new places. You're hovering over me in a way that's really not helpful. What do you want? Alex is like looking over in that way. He's got this look on his face like I don't think it's going live. I think he's just talking to a blank phone but I'm pretty sure I'm not. Yeah, because me and my crew have moved cities, countries multiple times and we do that multiple times every year. And we have ways, strategies of arriving in a new place or me by myself or one of my guys, meeting girls, meeting contacts, setting up a living environment, setting up a lifestyle, getting involved in parties, events, projects, business things. And that all requires an understanding of real networking. Anyone who's ever heard of networking, what do you imagine when you think of networking? When I do, I imagine you go at 10 a.m. to a brunch where they serve you some brunchettes and there's a bunch of people in your industry and the girls that are walking around the floor networking are not high-level operators. They can't be because high-level operators don't go to a 10 a.m. brunch to have a chat and make a contact. That's where people who are at the same level as you go to network kind of with each other. It's not a bad thing but you've got to understand that you're not going to hit the top tier at a networking event usually. Even if you've got the main speaker there, well, can you go and talk to them? Maybe. Can you shake their hand? Maybe. Can you say thanks for your work? Maybe. But are they going to be your friend? Are they going to do favours for you? Are they going to bring you into their inner circle? Probably not, not unless you pay them. And that's something you have to understand that you always have to pay your way into an in-demand social circle. Always. Not always with money. There's always a cost. Very rarely will someone charitably just invite you into their high-level social circle with all these girls and parties and networks unless you have something to offer them. Their human nature is we operate transactionally. We always have. And it's interesting when you look at, like, old tribes where they don't own anything, right? So, like, the possessions are kind of belonging to the tribe. But there's interesting things where you would go into an old tribe and they would give you a present, a pig or something. But you would be expected to give them back almost the exact same present at some other time in the season. And what that meant was no one got anything more or less than anyone else. It just kind of got passed around. But it was this setting up the actions of, like, I trust you to repay this in the future and I've got an extra pig now, so take it. And then later, I remember, you owe me a pig or a bride or whatever's worth a pig. And that's a big, big deal because in the age of entitlement, many people think that just because they want something and they put it on their vision board that they should get it. And life doesn't work like that. I get, you know, five, ten messages a week with people just saying, can I have a job? Or, hey, here's this question about this girl, just, like, asking for stuff without even saying, excuse me. It's amazing. So, yes, I will. Okay, Sean says, I understand having an interesting social circle is important to maintain relationships with high-value women. With limited free time, how do you balance building social circle and meeting different women on their own? All right, so good question. So we're talking about when you have limited time. And right now, do you guys have limited time? Seriously? Like, unless you are still working. But, okay, in the normal times, sure, you've got a job. You're not a full-time seducer or social circle engineer like me. You have X number of hours to work on things outside of feeding yourself. Now, the best way to look at this is try to blend those things together. So on the one hand, we have building a high-value social circle. And just as a little aside, what do I mean by high-value? Because I think a lot of people, when they hear that high-value, they get annoyed or they think, or you just imagine, like, those super cool tattooed guys in an LA club like with Dan Blazarian and a bunch of models and Shandon and Rolexes and Maseratis and you're like, that's high-value. Well, I'm not that and I'm never going to be that. I'm never going to live in LA and be one of those guys. So high-value, I don't know what that means or that's not relevant to me. Remember that in every social tier, whether it's the hippies at a festival, whether it's an ultimate Frisbee class, whether it's a group of uni students or whatever, there are hierarchies that exist within this and there are groups and subgroupings that exist. You know this because at high school, if you were like me, we were in the dork group and we didn't have any social mobility at all, really. Like you could maybe secretly be friends with like one of the cool kids might kind of like you or live down the street from you and you might hang out with them but they wouldn't be seen dead with you because it's bad for their reputation. So in a way, all of us still, not all of us but many of us, live in dorky social groups within your scene or within your city or within your half of the city or within the hipster realm of the city and so on. And so that's what I'm talking about. A high value social circle is one that you want to penetrate or you want to build around you. It fits with your lifestyle so it doesn't have to be the club LA guys. It might be to do with organic gardening. It could be to do with hippie dance stuff. It might be like, I don't know, people, normal people who work in offices and still want to have fun. It's not a specific social circle. It's the higher up in the areas that you want to go. So how do we combine that with meeting women? Because if you only work only on that and I've had clients, I had a client who owned the most expensive club in Melbourne way back 10 years ago was when I was coaching him. He bought the club to get girls. He didn't get any girls and I actually met him because I picked up his waitress, fucked her, and then she told me about him and then I met him. We know lots of guys who've blown huge amounts of money trying to set up modelling agencies and clubs and all sorts of things to try and get girls and sometimes got some results but not as many as they should. On the other side, you have cold approach skills, which there is no replacement for. Just leveraging social circle, I tried that back in the day. I had a band and threw parties and I did meet girls sometimes through that but they weren't the girls I wanted and it was a lot of work. However, when I reached the point in around 2007, 2008 when I was still playing in a band and I was cold approaching, what I started to do was meet girls out on the street, say, hey, come and see my band or we used to have this thing where we would have a dinner every Sunday night at our little share house, me, Shay, a few other guys, and then we would all invite two girls. Sometimes they didn't turn up. Sometimes we had 25 girls there and we just cooked. We just cooked some lasagna and lentil moussaka and salads and had some cheap wine and then we had every Sunday, we at least had 10 people, sometimes 20 or more. So what that was, it was me going out, spending five minutes here, 10 minutes there, an online game there or whatever, getting a girl's number, chatting to her for five minutes and then saying, hey, we actually have a Sunday night dinner every week where we just invite random cool fun people. Do you want to come? Often they would and when they came, then the social circle did the work for me. They came in and there's like cool guys and girls, people having fun, we're eating, we're drinking, it's a good vibe, all the guys are well-trained so no one's cock-blocking each other. And therefore, like very commonly at the end of that dinner, the girl would go up to the bedroom with whoever had brought her or if not then, another time easily. It meant she came to the house, she feels safe, there's girls around, these guys are cool, they know people, yes, I'm going to fuck him. That's the most efficient way to run pick-up in my opinion is build a decent social circle that when a girl walks in the door, she's like, yeah, I don't mind hanging out with these people or yes, I definitely want to hang out with these people. So then you just allocate your time. Okay, cold approach, sure, you go and do that but it doesn't take long to approach girls. It doesn't, it takes 10 minutes once a day, twice a day and it takes a bit of follow-up time with texting. So you can do that and then you can work on your social life and then just start asking girls two things and it doesn't have to be a super cool thing. I remember a couple of my friends way back when we were first starting this, they just had a thing that every Tuesday they went rock climbing at the local rock climbing gym and they just did it because they wanted to go every Tuesday, two guys and then they would meet girls and they would invite them and sometimes they'd have none, sometimes they'd have one, sometimes they'd have four girls and they'd come and they'd just do rock climbing. That doesn't require you being cool, it just requires you to have a plan. Often that's all people want, someone with a plan. Sure, if she's a high value girl and she has lots of invitation offers then maybe she won't take your offer but you can time it. We used to do those dinners on Sundays, not on Saturdays because on Saturday, Friday the girls are going out. Sunday night they went out, Friday, Saturday and they're like, oh yeah, I wouldn't mind coming and having a chill dinner with some random people, that sounds cool. So, you know, work the timing in around their party life and that can work. What city's countries would you look into when leveraging low cost living with income from high cost countries? Says Tord, hey man. Okay, so in terms of like what countries would I look into moving to when leveraging low cost, yeah, cool. I think this is a really valuable thing to look into for many reasons. If you live in Germany or Norway, you guys pay 50% tax or 40 something percent tax, right, like something crazy. And you've been brought up to think that that's normal. and to think that what you get out of that is worth it, on average. And of course, like living in Germany or Norway, you guys get your housing and you've got your education and you get your medical paid for and they look after you well as a functioning member of society. Correct, yes, but you pay through the nose for it. We have one friend who's got a very successful business and he's in Austria and he's paying millions a year in tax to the Austrian government, which he doesn't need to if he was a bit more creative and a little bit less risk-averse. I would suggest looking into living remotely, but you don't need to do it all at once. Because it can be a big and daunting thing to think I'm going to leave my country, my job, my friends, my everything, and I'm going to move to the third world or the developing world and just live there forever and start again because that's what digital nomads do. I didn't do that. I did little test livings to start with. I went travelling to Eastern Europe first, just as a backpacker and as a sex tourist. And then I went, whoa, okay, this is awesome, I want to live here somehow. And so I came back the next year and I stayed for two months and I rented an apartment for two months. And in that time, I think I had one private client, so I made a bit of cash and then we ran one Eurotour back when Eurotour was very cheap and it barely covered the cost. So it was like my first time of living and working overseas, but it was a two, three-month test. I made a bit of cash and I lived in a country and I got a girlfriend and I made some friends and I made a business contact that later on became really important. And then I went back home. And then I went back to Melbourne and then I stayed there for another six months. And then I went over again and then I did it for longer. And then at some point, 2012, I think it was, that was when I went, all right, I'm ready to just grab everything I got, my cash, my passport, and I'm moving over and I'm going to make it happen. So that's one thing you can do and I suggest you do first is if you want to start living in a cheaper country that has lifestyle advantages, then test them first. Because I can give you a list of some that I think are good, but you won't know until you go because different temperaments. I really like Eastern European girls, even though they're grumpy and difficult to get through their walls. I prefer them than Latin girls because I find Latin girls too much all the time, so much emotion about everything. You know, I'm like, oh, I can't handle it. Whereas the Russian girls like, James, we must talk. I have a feeling. I'm like, okay, I can deal with one feeling. So, you know, you got to go and see what do you like about or not about the lifestyle. I spent eight years living in Hungary on and off. I was only there half the time, but I was there eight years. And at the end of it, all of us, we just went, you know what? We've had enough of this place. Like for its advantages, it has some disadvantages. You can't really integrate into Hungarian society. The language is fucking impossible. The people are not very open and friendly and they're not innovative. They're not go-getters on average. And please excuse any Hungarians on this chat. I'm not making a personal attack. I met cool Hungarians. We made some good friends, but not a lot. Not a lot of great contacts aside from we picked up a lot of girls and we made a few guy friends and some very important ones. But compared to when we moved to Kiev last year, only briefly because we got ripped out of there, but we accelerated things much faster than we did in Hungary because it was a different vibe, different kinds of guys there. And we were looking to network with high-level guys. We had enough women. So it wasn't about that. It was about, all right, what's the next tier level of influence we can have? And that requires influential men. So in terms of some places that you can look at, Thailand, for sure, Copenhagen Island, which has a lot of digital nomads, a lot of like traveling hippie yoga cheeks, Russian girls go there to kind of just get out of Russia and stay there for a year. Bali, also okay, except there's a lot of Australian bogans, which I don't like, but in Ubud, in Bali. Throughout Eastern Europe, I'm not going to, I ruined Eastern Europe by giving lots of recommendations because everyone went there, but now I'm not there anymore, I guess I can tell you. I'm not ever mentioning Serbia again. I don't go to Serbia anymore. It's just been ruined and I don't want to go back and see what it is. So if you want to go there, go there. Yeah, it's the same places, Prague, Budapest, Croatia, Slovakia, like all of them have the same kind of thing, which is lots of hot girls, a cute old city, cheap living, infrastructure that's better or worse. You know, the infrastructure is fine in Budapest, but don't expect to get stuff in the mail that well. There is no Uber Eats, but there is a variation, whereas in Kiev they have Uber Eats and the infrastructure is better. South America I haven't lived in. I've only traveled in South America, but from accounts of other people, Colombia, Florianopolis, Cali are supposed to be great. And like I spent some time in Argentina and I found that, like that's a digital nomad location that people go to. But one thing you should know about that is the guys are fucking hot and cool and well-dressed and confident and the girls are too. And they're very like arrogant or let's say overly confident about themselves. So you don't get any cachet being a foreigner there, really, not much. Like when I rocked up, me and Sasha rocked up, they were like, okay, traveler dudes, and there's all these slick bronze muscular dudes in nice shirts. Didn't stand a chance. So yeah, there's some options if you want to ask me about some specific ones. Arshak. Oh, this is Arshak the dancer, right? How do I spell? I read your name so many times and Gyozalyan and you are a fucking amazing dancer, man. How did you restart your life after you realized your musician career is over? Well, it's more like I realized my music career never started. No, it is actually an important point. There was a point when I realized and it was when I'd been playing music from around 20 in a band until 28, 9. And that's when I started doing teaching pickup as well around that time. I realized that, I mean, I had to realize, I had to look at the metrics and go, music is only going to take me so far and I've reached the top of what I'm going to get here. It sucks because I think my music's awesome and we should have been famous in my opinion, but for Australia at that time in that industry, we played every gig we could, we toured Australia six times, we sold 200 CDs in Japan for some reason at some obscure CD shop. And I could see like, even if we got a big break in Australia, that didn't mean enough for 29 to 30-year-old men, eight of us, because there was eight of us in the band, who some were getting married and some were starting to have children. There was no way we were going to make a living off this band. And we never made a living. I mean, we made a just surviving sometimes. So it was a bit of a crisis for me. I had to let go of music as a lifestyle design machine because I saw, I can see what other local musicians who are 30 plus are doing. And they're just playing the same gigs and then they get a normal job and they play gigs in the weekend. And very few of them become professional musicians, mostly as session musicians, because they're very good jazz musicians, for example, and they can play in 10 different bands. I wasn't that. Whereas my drummer was, he still is. He still plays in 10 different bands. He has his own studio. He's a pro musician, but he just does lots of different work. So I realized, what was the most important thing to me out of music? Now, I do like music. I still play music sometimes by myself. I listen to music. I like music. But the things that were most important to me about that were travel, working for myself, working on a creative project with my friends and meeting girls. Those were the things. So it was more important for me to not just drag out this dream until I was like a 40-year-old dude playing in the local pub, still trying to make it, still looking for my big break, which is depressing. It was like, cool, all right, I'm going to let music start to fade and I'm going to focus on this new thing, the pickup thing, because it still gives me the things I want. And now I've been touring since then for another 10 years. I've still been a rock and roll musician for 10 years just without the rock and roll. Because I was clear about what are the elements that I need and that I need to transfer. And this is something that is relevant to a lot of guys because sometimes you go through a period where you do become in the top area of a social scene. Let's say you're at university or a high school because you're in a sporting team or you're in a cool drama group or you were in a band or whatever it was. And for some period of time, it was working. You had social leverage and girls were interested in you because of who you knew or where you were in the scene. You were a popular person. And then university ends or the band breaks up or you move to a different city. And then suddenly all that's ripped away from you and you're back down to zero. Good. This will need to happen. If you want to be a lifestyle design engineer, this will need to happen multiple times in your life. In 2012, I took my 10 grand, my passport and my backpack and I moved by myself to Eastern Europe. That first time I was by myself. I arrived, I was rented an apartment and I went from, I was in Australia the year before that I built the biggest lifestyle design empire I'd ever built in Melbourne. Gone from back in the day when I was just a dork by myself basically to having the last goodbye party, had 300 people, had burlesque dancers, had fire twirlers, had DJs. I was the coolest dude at the time in that scene in Melbourne. Everyone knew me. I'd built that all up. And then I threw it all away. I literally threw everything I worked for away in that social scene and I moved over to Europe and started again from zero at the age of 30. And I'm sure glad I did because if I'd stayed, I would have still maintained king of the scene for some time. Right. I mean, maybe still, you know, I still could have been running parties and doing, having interesting people around and stuff and gotten laid out of that. Sure. But it would have, and that wouldn't have been bad, but that would have been where it ended. And for me, you know, I'm like Scarface. I want the world. I don't want all the riches of the world. I want all the richness of the world. I want to induce the world into me. And so that's why it was worth it to me to go and start. And when I was there, I was lonely and I felt like a dork again because I was like, oh, and I went and approached some girls and they went, you know, I'm like, I'm a nobody. Yeah, cool. But I'm a nobody with exceptional skills of building myself up into a somebody. And I did. Took me a couple of years and I imported some friends, got some girlfriends, build a new business, got a lizard, you know, bought an apartment there for 120,000 euros. That place that you've seen on so many videos, 120k, which in Australia, if I wanted to buy something equivalent, would have been over a million, well over, right? So like I leveraged my small amount of investment money and I turned it into now it's that apartment's worth 650. So I put another hundred into it. So let's say I at least doubled and a bit more my cash because I was smart about it. I looked at Australia and I'm like, if I stay here and save up for a deposit on a house, I will be in debt and mortgage bound for the rest of my life. And then at the end, I will have maybe paid off a two-bedroom suburban house. So what? And whereas for that, for that same amount of time, I can move here and I've become a millionaire. You know, I have two huge properties. I have friends and lovers all around this great continent. And it's just, and I'm just started. Like even though Corona is knocking us down, we'll be back and we'll be back bigger than ever. So keep that in mind. Living, living, this is not right now, but soon, is such a rare time in history where you get to the ability to live in other countries and it's not hard. It's not hard at all. It's fucking easy. Even before the, even before the internet, it was way more difficult. When I was traveling when I was 18 to India and there was, you know, I didn't, couldn't email anyone and I, and I was using a guidebook to try and figure out India and I got ripped off and kidnapped and all sorts of shit. And you know, we're back to my parents' generation when travel overseas was backpacking into the unknown and just figuring it out step by step. Now, you can sit, you can spend a week online and have networks set up, people to meet, meet up groups, couch surfing groups. You could go and woof on a farm. You can, yeah, couch surf on someone's, in some group student house. There's so much that you can do that when you arrive, you have people to meet and things to do. And if you don't, like, why not? What a waste of this amazing time in history. Just take a month and then fuck off somewhere. Live there. And what does it mean to live? It means get friends, get girls, have some reason. So if that means just going to do yoga classes there or when I was in Argentina, I hired a really good tango teacher, Xuxu, and she just taught me every day. I just, she came around every day and that was why I was there. I'm in Argentina, learning tango, meeting some, learning a bit of Spanish and meeting some girls. And it was hard to meet the girls because they all had hot boyfriends, but I was living there for a month as opposed to I'm a tourist looking at stuff. That's a big difference. All right, Lucas says, what exactly will be in the new product, the Academy Lifestyle Design? The Academy of Life, the Lifestyle Design Academy. I actually prefer the way you said it, the Academy Lifestyle Design. Well, funny you should ask that. It's like Lucas is my shill. I paid him to ask that question. Funny you should ask that. Okay, so what is inside the Lifestyle Design Academy? So if in case you don't know, I'm launching a product on Sunday, this Sunday at 5 p.m., 6 p.m. CETO, 6 p.m. Central European Time. It's going live. And this I've been working on for the whole lockdown time, but I've also been working on this for many years. I've actually have notes on this product that were written in 2009, like 30 pages that I wrote at the time on seductive economy and then just shelved it. I mean, I used it in the master class a bit, but then I just never used it again specifically to the public. I teach Lifestyle Design to private clients and have for a long time. So what's in the Academy? The way I've designed it is that it's based around live lectures. So something like this where I will be on every week for eight weeks for 90 minutes."}
