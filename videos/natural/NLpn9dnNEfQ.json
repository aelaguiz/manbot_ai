James Marshall here. First, very important announcement, which is that you have less than 24 hours left to join my Lifestyle Design Academy. That's right, just one day left, after which time I'll be closing the doors, full good, and moving on to coaching the guys in the course. So if you'd like to take advantage of this, to be mentored by me through this epic, chaotic, confusing, and potential-filled year, then now is your last chance. I've had quite a bunch of guys writing in to me with questions about the course, asking exactly how does it work week by week, what are the features and bonuses included, and so today what I'm going to do is take you on a little jaunty tour through the insides of the LDA to show you how the course works and everything that is involved. So if you've been sitting on the fence wondering whether or not you should join, hopefully this will clear things up for you. So as I said, you have just one day left to join, so if you're interested, click the link below, full details, and I hope to see you on the first day of the course. Now, without further ado, let's check out the LDA. The LDA works as a live mentorship program, and it's broken up into two specific parts. The first is the initial eight-week accelerator course, and this is where you will receive weekly lectures by me, live, covering the eight primary principles and areas of lifestyle design. So this is where I cram in all of the theoretical aspects, show you my frameworks for building epic social circles, for reaching out to gatekeepers, for, you know, tapping into brand new networks that you've never had access to, to increasing your own personal charm, influence, attractiveness, because these are the X-factor pieces that make a massive difference in terms of whether people want to hang out with you or not. So over these first eight weeks, I have really in-depth lectures week by week. These are held live on Zoom. So I deliver the course material, and plus there's plenty of time for you to interact with me through questions, and then through the follow-up missions, drills, and accountability systems that are attached to this. So when you first join the LDA, you'll receive your welcome introduction video, as well as some initial missions to get you started. The LDA is designed as a very proactive, interactive course. So each week you'll be given a whole bunch of missions that work not just on your external lifestyle, but also work on your subjective or lived experience. So we're going to be looking at your sensuality, your diet, your basic lifestyle habits, the people, media, and material that you surround yourself with, as well as looking at your personal self-esteem, any areas of traumas or emotional stuck blockages that need to be cleared up, and so on. The first eight weeks of the Accelerator program are broken up week by week into dense lectures and interactive forums, where I go through primary areas of what you need to implement in order to supercharge your lifestyle. So moving through lecture one, we do a life autopsy, which is where you basically break down where you are at currently, looking at your social circles and the makeup of those social circles, because not every friend and collaborator is of equal value or of equal loyalty to you. And so you need to break down into different categories, groups of people, those who are your inner circle, those who are contenders for moving into your inner circle, and those who are followers and Facebook friends who don't really bring much value to your life. Now how do you juggle those numbers and move people into your collaborative inner circles? Moving on, week two, we look at seductive economics, and this is the overlaying methodology or map that I use in all of my personal exchanges with people when I'm attempting to grow something with them. So if I want a new collaborator, and I want to build a business or a social event, a party, a trip, a learning experience, or whatever it is, then I need to be able to speed up that which often happens as slow natural processes, the slow glacial process of getting to know someone, building trust, starting to like them, and then collaborating, building things together. With the seductive economics framework, you can supercharge that and speed that up in today's weeks or months so that you can build tight social circles really quickly that want to have your back and collaborate on mutually beneficial projects. Week three is all about experimentation and exploration. So if you want to become an expert lifestyle designer, you can't be stuck mentally in your old paradigms of thinking, I'm this type of guy, I hang out with these types of people, and I only do these four hobbies or things. Those who have incredibly vivacious, vibrant, and varied social circles are guys that have gone out and met different types of people and adjusted their mindsets, their mentalities, opened their minds enough that they were able to accept new ways of thinking and being. So in this week, we're going to be really helping you to explore internally, but most importantly, to explore the world externally and to plug into brand new different social worlds. Week four, we look at negotiation and confrontation. These are areas that a lot of guys that work with me are not very good at. Classic nice guys, classic people pleasers, those who would rather avoid conflict and then deal with a mess later on than confront it head on and clean things up. It's a vitally important process and skill set to be able to internalize and then to be able to use in the world. Otherwise, you simply won't be heard, you won't get what you want, you'll be passed over, you'll have to compromise constantly, and other people's needs will be put before yours if you do not learn how to create clear boundaries, negotiate, and when needed, to confront people. Week five, we look at gatekeepers. Now within every social scene and particularly social scenes that are of a high value or many people want to become part of, a party scene or where there's hot chicks, fun experiences, money, all those things, those things are not always and often not easy to get into because they're coveted, because people protect them and because they're valuable. If you want to move up in the ranks of your social circles, you can't just rely on the social circle that you came out of high school with unless you're very lucky, very unlikely that those guys are going to be international movers and shakers in the VIP scenes. They may be cool dudes, they may be your close friends, but this is not about how to hang out with your old friends. This course is about how to break into brand new social worlds or create them yourself. It's about how to social climb. It's about how to maneuver through your city and later on, hopefully, through other cities in the world in a way where you are a valued member, where people want you to be involved in their awesome social worlds. So you need to learn how to approach, ingratiate, charm, and influence gatekeepers. These are the people that have access to these things. It's often not the leader, the CEO, the head of it, because that kind of person often is really difficult to get in touch with. Whereas within their social scenes, there's often someone who is a people person, who is a connector, who is a social butterfly, and they are the people that most usually it is much more beneficial to approach. So we show you how to figure out who are the movers and shakers, what are the different hierarchies that are in operation, and where and when and who to approach so that you have the best chance of being included. Week six, we're going to be taking a deep dive into charm and loyalty. So these are the kind of personal X factors that make a massive difference in terms of whether people want to help you out, want to hang out with you, have your best interests at heart, or whether they just see you purely as a strategic ally at best. The reality is people help people that they like. They want to be around people that they're charmed by, they feel at ease with, that they have a shared sense of trust and loyalty. And it is vitally important that you build this matrix of loyalty within your tribe, within your multiple tribes, because this is the thing that means that, okay, firstly, you're not going to have lots of drama, people stealing each other's girls or fucking each other over or generally being dicks. If you have a good ethical code within your crew, then it means that you're not going to have to deal with a lot of those dramas. And of course, it means that when the hard times come or the challenges come, or even indeed the great triumphs and successes come, that you're all going to actually have your back, each other's back. So this is a vitally important piece of the whole networking, lifestyle designing, digital nomad type of ethos, and it's very rarely spoken about. What is the interpersonal actions that really glue people together, that really make someone want to go out of their way to give you an opportunity or a job opportunity or introduce you to girls or whatever it is that they have access to. So in this week, you will have to look at yourself on a deep level and recognize and come to terms with some of the areas that are not attractive or that are not charming, not creating of influence, and I'll be giving you really specific strategies on how to improve that. Week seven is about merging tribes. Most guys, when they think about improving their life, at best they're thinking some new cool friends, the odd extra girl in their life, maybe some parties or some travel events. But when you start thinking about lifestyle design on much bigger levels, then you recognize that you're not just going to be involved with one group, just one tribe. If you're doing this properly, you're going to be reaching out in all sorts of different directions, meeting people over here who can help you with your career here, people who are sexuality or lifestyle experts over here, people who are really fun and supportive to be around and so on, and you'll start to infiltrate multiple tribes. Then we reach a level where we can get really creative, where we can start to introduce one crew to another, where we can collaborate on inter-tribe projects, where we can go from one country to the next and visit collaborators over there and take advantage of all of the scene and all of the resources that they have collected, and then we can create a trade where they can come over and do that with us as well. In this way, you start to not just multiply your effects between you and your inner circle collaborators, but then have these multiplying multiplying effects where other social scenes that are working on their own lifestyle design projects, you can then come and plug into and vice versa. And finally, in week eight of the Accelerator part of the program, we'll be looking at tribe life creation. And this is where you take all of the skills, the new people, the close bonds that you have built in the preceding weeks, and you then move on creating something with that. Because this is not just about finding some friends to hang around with, or trying to get a wingman to stand next to you in a bar so you can approach chicks more easily. This is really about galvanizing proactive, creative people who want to make real change in their lives, and then producing something out of that. So whether that is a shared business, whether that's a growth house where you move in together to work on all metrics of your lifestyle success, whether that's throwing events, parties, picnics, hiking adventures, or whatever it is. Because these are the payoffs that you get from all of this lifestyle designing. This is where all of your hard work and your strategic work and your interpersonal work pays off where, cool, now we get to be the cool dudes at the party, or now we get to bring this creative project out into the world, or now we get to pool our resources and create a business or some kind of profitable event. Because these are the outcomes that I'm looking for, and this is the whole point of the LDA. You are here to recognize that alone you can achieve only so much, whether that's through cold approach, seduction, or working harder, or trying to start your own business. I didn't do all of the stuff that I've done in my life alone. Most of the big successes in my life were collaborative efforts. Even though each individual might be getting something personal out of it, there will be different levels of input, of investment. But overall, everyone benefits, which then reinforces the tribe and makes it so it's a no-brainer for us to then continue working together in the future. So that's the first eight weeks of the course. These lectures are held every Sunday afternoon. I originally advertised them as running for two hours, but last time we did this, not one of them lasted less than four. So get ready to lock in for some epic Sunday afternoons with me over the coming eight weeks. After that period, there is a full follow-up coaching. So what this means is that after the first eight weeks, there will be monthly webinars where you get to check in with me to see how your progress is going, to work on your missions and your lifestyle design projects. And also, during these months, I'll be bringing in a whole bunch of extra specialist, elite-level coaches to help you out with different specialty areas of your life. So in the past, we've had experts on BDSM and alternative sexual lifestyles, on digital nomadism, on throwing elite high-level parties, on advancing your career through leveraging of currencies and different locations, so the art of the digital nomad or the lifestyle entrepreneur and so on. So basically, I reach out to my networks of all of the kick-ass, killer lifestyle designers that I know who have constructed their own unique version of what it is to be completely free and to live a life based around their passion projects and basically doing what they want when they want. So I know a lot of people in those positions, and they've all approached it in slightly different ways. And so I bring them in, and you can pick their brains about their elite-level, secret-level methodologies that they have used to live a life less ordinary. The LDA is not a passive experience. This is not Netflix. You don't just sit there and absorb information and hope that somehow that's going to translate into real-world results. This is a very active and proactive course. The lectures are designed to cut off years or countless amounts of time in the trial-and-error phase that you would have to go to to try and figure this out yourself. I've spent the last 20 years traveling the planet, seeking out masters, mentors, and contemporaries who are working in these areas. I've uprooted and moved cities and countries a dozen times, and I've experimented with a vast array of different types of lifestyles. And the point of lectures is for me to condense all that down to save you the trouble of trying to figure it out yourself and to give you very actionable blueprints, plans, and maps to go out there and effect this change in your own life as well. So week by week, you'll be receiving drills and missions to go out and apply, how to work on your self-esteem, your presence, your groundedness, your enjoyment day by day. Because this is about designing a life that is enjoyable, that brings you pleasure, that brings you satisfaction, that brings you intimacy, that brings you a sense of community. And those things are not done just by hustling 24-7 on your online business, for example. Those are done by consciously, proactively reaching out and creating real bonds with people. So week by week, you'll have a structured course which you can go out and apply. You can work with collaborators in the LDA. This is one thing that happened with the last group is that there was nearly 400 members for the first round and over time those guys started to set up their own subgroups, hook up within their own cities and countries, create their own growth houses, go and party and pick up girls together. And so we've gradually started to build this epic global lifestyle crew and that's what you'll be plugging into as well through the daily accountability group, through the telegram group where we have year one guys and now the year two guys coming in so that you get the wisdom and the experience of the older guys, the pre-made for you community which is extremely vibrant, really positive, really accepting, there's no macho bullshit, there's no dick swinging, there's no being cruel to each other and bragging about how many chicks we've got or anything like that. This is a place where guys come with their problems to get answers, with their achievements to share that with people, with ideas that are still confusing to them or unformed to discuss them and work them through. So this group has become a really tight, loyal and really inclusive crew that you will get to become plugged into when you join the LDA. So that's the meat of the LDA program. The first eight week accelerator portion which is over 30 hours of live lectures with myself followed by monthly lectures that's another 40 plus hours with myself and with all my epic collaborator friends that I'll be bringing in to talk to you. Plus you have the accountability systems through the weekly missions and drills and the extremely active and supportive LDA telegram group so you can collaborate with guys all around the world to work on your lifestyle design projects. But that's not all. The launch is only available for another 24 hours and then everything is going down as I move on to actually teach the course live but in the meantime you have access to a huge bunch of bonus support materials that I've thrown in for no extra cost to make this super sweet. So let's talk through the bonuses for the LDA. The first is the MMC at Home, the Masculine Mastermind Conference. This was our huge live yearly conference that we ran for three years in a row back when that was a thing that you could do and we will do it again in the future but not for now. But what we did do is film all of the speeches and the masterclasses from these TNL conferences that we put on over the last few years and as a bonus, as part of the LDA, you get access to eight of the best and most iconic and life-changing speeches that have ever been put out. Much of this stuff has never been released on the internet anywhere. You get to hear from myself, Shane Matthews, Alex Leon, all the TNL crew plus the few outside collaborators that we really trust. So this is an epic course within a course itself and today it's available for you totally free. Next we have the great library of Netropolis. So over the last many years, I've done all sorts of live webinars and masterclasses answered hundreds of questions from students on all sorts of topics. So what we decided to do was go through all of those old webinars and individually cut out each of the questions and answers and put them into a library, which is what we've done. And as part of the bonuses for the course, you get access to over a hundred videos, which answer very commonly asked questions about sexuality, dating, texting, lifestyle design, inner game, meditation, sexuality, like all the stuff that I have been spending my life working on and the guys have asked me questions. I put all these answers in an easy to sort library. So when in doubt, you've got some question about, okay, what do I do on a second date? I can search the database and there will be information there for you. So that's over 20 hours of never before seen material that you are able to access in a simple to use format. So that whenever you have one of those pesky questions that you want to ask, you can either do them live on the webinar or check the answers that I've already given. Next bonus is seven of my most iconic speeches. Now these were speeches that were delivered at the 21 convention from 2011 to 2017, I think it was. And these are speeches that I spent many months preparing for and that now cumulatively have had millions of hits, hundreds of thousands of guys around the world have seen them. And I still get feedback that these speeches were some of the most life changing hours that people had ever spent watching anything. So I bought the license of the owner of the 21 convention. We now have them available in HD, no advertising and no danger of YouTube taking them down because it's all a bit too saucy. So you can get lifetime access to classics such as the three pillars of seductive success, what women want, multiple relationship dynamics and much more. Your fifth bonus available totally free when you buy the full LDA package today is two weeks of live movement classes with me. So that's right. I'm going to be your zoom trainer for the first two weeks of the course, Monday through Friday. I'll be running 30 minute ish live courses where I go through my own personal stretching, breathing, movement, grounding routines, and I teach them to you in real time and lead you through them. This is because I know for myself that to have an epic lifestyle, to be really successful in life, this is not just about your external baubles or income or achievements. This is about how you're experiencing life day by day and you're experiencing it as a physical entity. So being able to be relaxed, pain free, to be graceful, uh, and to be able to clear your mind so that you can actually access your creativity and your enthusiasm is vitally important. These are the routines that I have done myself for decades now, and I've taught hundreds of my live clients and now you get the chance to, uh, every morning. And when I say morning, I mean 12 noon wherever I am because that's how I do morning. So whenever that time is, you'll get the info on the calendar, you'll be able to log in and there'll be my track pants ready to work out with you. We can get start the day, uh, creating more looseness flow and groundedness. Bonus six is connected to bonus five and this is a library of guided meditation techniques that I originally taught in the martial meditation method. So I've provided you with the movement classes primarily so that you have accountability. We all know what it's like to sign up to something and then just not do it. Uh, but when you have me there kicking your ass gently every day for the first couple of weeks, hopefully this will set you in motion for habits that can become integrated for a lifetime essentially. So what I'm doing is I'm adding some extra bonus material that goes into more depth into the meditation methods that I have personally used most over the years. I've studied many different schools of spirituality. I've traveled the world from India to China to Thailand to all over the planet actually seeking out different masters and systems for, uh, personal optimization. And these meditation techniques which I offer you is as another bonus, uh, the most stripped down non sectarian, non religious, no fluffy crystals and bullshit. These are the practical tools that allow you to relax your body, to deepen your breath, to get in touch with the moment in a real, really, uh, felt sense way, not just as an idea so that you get the more out of life constantly. I know I bang on about this a lot, but meditation is the foundation for everything we teach at TNL. It's the first principle. Uh, you know, I've taught many different courses specifically on this and I think it is vitally important that this is included. So I've given this bonus today so that you can spend more time in your personal time getting deeper into the intricacies of your meditation practice and then you can come and practice those live with me in the, in the movement classes. The last couple of bonuses are a bit of fun and a way of looking at yourself not just as a productivity machine, but also as a Renaissance man, a man of culture, a man of science and art, a modern man who is actually exploring all areas of what it means to be a lived human. So many guys who get into personal development stay there. They only read, read how to books. They only listen to thinkers that are trying to solve specific problems. That's important stuff. But the guys that are really charming and influential, uh, and who are able to move up and down cultural groups, right? They're able to infiltrate new scenes where people talk in a different way, have different belief systems or have different bands they're into or media they're into and so on. And if you can become a Renaissance man, a modern one that's able to dabble in a whole bunch of different areas, whether that's anthropology, sociology, arts, culture, uh, you know, all sorts of alternative lifestyles, then you'll be someone that's welcome in more places that's able to connect to more people and take advantage of more opportunities. So what I've done for the last two bonuses, the first one is to give you a copy of my book, which is called A Natural History. And this is my memoir, essentially. It's the story of me going from a broke, lonely, horny young man who was not destined for anything particularly great in a boring town in Australia, how it was that I came to master the arts of seduction to start building the prototypes of the epic lifestyles that I now live today, uh, how it was that I started working with different wingmen, started traveling the world and having lots of really bizarre and wild adventures. So it's a fun read and it also gives you, um, a real time and personal example story of how you can go from being pretty average on most metrics to being very extraordinary in a fairly short amount of time. We're talking months or a couple of years, which is not a long time in the scheme of things when you think that most people never make it or never really evolve outside of the basic personality structure that they've grown up with. So this is a saucy, naughty tale, hope you enjoy it. And then the final bonus that I'm throwing in for everybody is the Marshall Charms School. And this is essentially a collection of resources. Every week we give you a book, a movie, YouTube clips, maybe some music, maybe some poetry of different artists, thinkers, writers, philosophers, lovers, uh, that myself and my Thai collaborators have found really influential over time. So that's, that's a fun thing you can do. Chuck on a, an interesting classic movie, read some books that you wouldn't have otherwise. And it's not just self help stuff. I'm talking about actual literature and poetry and travel writing and philosophy and other things that I think are really important. And I mean, I've proven that I think over my lifetime because I'm now much more, uh, multi-dimensional, right? I can, I can, I can talk to and relate to people and ideas on a vastly expanded matrix than I could back when I was, you know, just some dude in Canberra, Australia. So there you have it, the full suite of bonuses going along with the LDA launch, right? So we have the eight week accelerator course, you have all the accountability systems, and then you have seven huge bonuses and that totals well over 50 plus hours of material. Plus there is one other bonus, which I will be adding, which is recordings from all of the live webinars that I did with the first group of LDA members. So that the 10 months of, uh, webinars that I did either Q and A webinars with me and the dudes or with special guests, I think we had six or seven guests so far. All of those recordings, this is 40 plus hours of material, extra material will be available to you as well when you sign up to the LDA. So you get your own private LDA lectures with me, you get your one-on-one, you get your FaceTime, you get your real time with me, and then you get 40 hours of recordings of what I did with the previous guys, where again I'm answering dozens and dozens of questions which will no doubt be relevant to you. So there you have it, massive, huge package, over 100 hours worth of material in total. This is as close as you are going to get to training with me live. Uh, I know it's, you know, it's a badly held secret that I'm really expensive. So if you want to come and learn with me in the real, then you have to come and do one of my five figure plus live workshops. Here is your chance to have access to me, interact, interactive access with me, uh, and over 400 amazing guys from all around the world who are working to create kick-ass lifestyles for an entire fucking year. That's right. That's the LDA. It's epic. Last year's guys got incredible results, uh, interpersonally, personally, sexually, and of course in terms of building, uh, at least the prototype and in some cases the, uh, you know, the finished version of their most excellent lifestyle. So if you'd like to join me, you've got one more day to make a decision. Click the link below for full details. Uh, there's no extensions after this. There's no like, oh, in a week or two, like, oh, maybe I'll check out the LDA thing. No. As of next week, I start teaching live, I shut the doors and I forget about all the sales and marketing and all that stuff, and I focus on what I really love doing, which is teaching, sharing my knowledge, and helping other guys to live the lives that they deserve to live, to help them to unplug from the matrix, from their negative conditioning, from their limiting beliefs, from their shitty, toxic social circles, and to branch out, branch out mentally, emotionally, and to branch out into the world because it is such, uh, an exciting time to be alive. It is challenging. We've all been through a pretty rough year on many levels over the last 12 months. It's shaken things up. And if one thing, if not many things, but one thing that the pandemic and the lockdowns have exposed for many men and people in general are the holes in their life, right? Where do they not have backup? Where do they not have resources? You find, if you find yourself in an apartment, you know, doing the odd zoom call with your high school buddies and swiping on Tinder, hope and waiting for things to get better. That's a pretty, um, depressing place to sit in. And lots of people think you have to, that, okay, until the government or whoever sorts this out and says, and like gives me my life back, that I have to wait in stasis. I haven't been waiting, my collaborators haven't been waiting, the LDA tribe has definitely not been waiting. And over the last 12 months, even in the most challenging year of many of our lives, we've managed to succeed, to pivot, to work out ways, to work around the difficulties and the challenges. And in some cases to thrive far more than people were doing back when life was normal. This is what I have done."}
