And so I'm curious, what do you know about me from the way that I dance? You, especially you? Yes, me. Well, for me it was a big surprise that you can do things that another man maybe take two years to understand or to start to do in one week. And I am sure that it's because you have a lot of training with your body, the conscience of the parts of your body, the conscience about your energy too, because you have a very clear understanding not only with the information and processing here, you immediately send the information to your body and your body understand and do it immediately. Then I think, without to know you too much, that you are one person very integrated, balanced. You have balance, you have harmony between your different parts, your head, your emotional center and your down chakras that represent the most primitive things and instant. You can integrate all in your life. And I, it's my opinion, really the women think that they need one full man, not only one man with a head or a body, you know, dissociated. I think that the women need, because it's very complex, as you said before, need and like very much one man that is complete. I talk about that a lot with men, about how a woman has many different needs that are satisfied by men. So emotional needs, sexual needs, protection, like emotional understanding, all of these different aspects. And if she cannot find one man to fulfill these roles, she'll find three or four or five or as many as she needs. And she'll find one man who is all balls, who is all tough and he's, you know, takes what he wants, but he's not very sensitive. She'll find a man who she's friends with to have her emotional needs and so on. I think that the men in this moment of their world, their life, need to make a big work to make role, there are other parts, because he is not enough. Or he can be more. Yes, he has all the parts. He only need to connect with the part and make role and he will be better man than before. More complete man. He's not a poor man in some aspect. Because all the men has importance, all the qualities, than one man who has a lot of value. That's interesting, like going to Malongas and watching people, like when a couple dances well together, it doesn't matter if they're old, young, thin, fat, whatever, they just look beautiful. It's because in that moment, all of their best aspects is coming out and you can see that they're inside this person. Like before, maybe she was an old fat lady and then now suddenly she's dancing and you can see her femininity and her beauty again or same with the men. So that's been another beautiful thing in learning this dance and I intend to continue this for many years to come, is to see that it brings out qualities in people that maybe they didn't see before. Yes, the thing that you can see in that couples are the harmony and the energy. And maybe can be old or fat or you know, maybe are not professional dancers, but while you can receive that nice energy, you say, ah, they are nice, they dance very good. It's one feeling that they transmit because they are feeling that. And you can feel that when you see them because they are involved for that energy that I said before, that is the harmony and connection between them. It's like a light, electricity and you turn on, you have light, then it's not a physical aspect. It's something about the energy and that is the beauty that you can see. Would you say, because I know that a lot of men that I teach, they are very worried about things like how handsome they are or how tall they are or what race they are and they think that women will judge them because they are not a male model or they think they will judge them because they are five foot seven or whatever. How would you describe what is really the most important things that make a man attractive? I'll tell you one fact. We say, in the tango and in the bed are not short persons or tall persons. I'll say that again in case you didn't listen. In a tango and in the bed, there are no tall people and no short people. Yeah, no, no. Because it's not important. The important is how is the connection with another person. Again, the men can have any age or size or part or thing. That is not important. They need to develop that part that we are talking, that is invisible to connect with her. I know a lot of women that are crazy to dance with one fat man and me too. Because he is like a double bed, but he make feel us very, very nice. We don't need, we close our eyes and we only travel between their arms. That is not a problem. I mean, the life is same. I know a lot of nice guys that are nothing. You mean beautiful, like attractive men who are nothing? Yes. A lot of muscles, tall, but maybe they spend a lot of time into the gym, but they are nothing. They are only muscles and they are not attractive. They only are working to give something for the eyes. And after that, they have nothing to offer. That is a very important point, gentlemen. Please take that on board. That's wonderful. Thank you so much, Shushu.
