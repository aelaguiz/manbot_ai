How's it going? Alex here for the natural lifestyles We've a bit more facial hair and longer hair than usual straight out of lockdown so in this upcoming video you will get a glimpse a Behind-the-scenes look into one of our high-ticket life seduction workshops, so what you will see is Eric and Stefan two guys who were Agreeing to be filmed while they go for this insane transformation, which is really fucking cool. Thanks again to those guys You will see those two guys in their first very first Infield session, you know, so that's when me and the other coaches Listening in on the guys. We're giving feedback We are Monitoring their behavior. We are checking, you know certain habits They might have acquired over different content or just throughout their life and we are pointing this stuff out and we're trying to just make conversation smoother more natural and In a way more successful, you know raise the chance that the girl will want to see the guys on a date again So keep in mind. It's the very first session Obviously, it's a bit clumsy still, you know, the approaches aren't that smooth They don't go too deep into certain conversations and The way they close is maybe a bit, you know Yeah, just not as smooth yet. So that being said I'm really curious what you can take out of this video if something resonates with you and What you especially want to see more of you know, because we will now that Things are slowly easing up again work on your content and let me know what you want to see One last thing before we jump right in please click the like button It really helps the channel if you enjoy our content then take two seconds make the like button blue. That's it for me Now, let's jump right into the video Okay First infill session Finally we guys can do what we're here to do. So I want you guys to take it really easy now. This is not super focused on technologies now Important you open girls you close girls No matter if it goes really well for 10-15 minutes or it's a quick one or two minute interaction As soon as there's some report with the girl as soon as there's some connection try to close her in the end, you know Try to get her number or if it seems a bit strange to number because she really don't doesn't know you ask for an Instagram Or Facebook And then the rest will look at in the upcoming days. So let's do it My name is Eric I'm come from Norway I Feel I lack in In communicating with girls and expressing my desires and in a constructive way Excuse me. Hi. What's the name? Eric nice to meet you Yeah, of course You Like it No, no, no just vacation, okay. Okay. Where are you from? I came yesterday. I'm leaving about about a week, but we should I need to go but do you have a Instagram or Facebook maybe you can Go for a drink tomorrow. Do you have time? Okay, so this is me All right, cool she was so into you there's so much potential for you to make a connection You could ask her anything. You didn't even ask her anything. Where she's from. Oh, she asked you and then she said So, yeah When it goes well, no reason to close. Okay, cool, but good job first number amazing. I'm a bit too nice or Fine, like don't worry about that too much now. Okay, you have a good vibe It's it's more the vibe the momentum, you know, like focusing on technologies now to stay in longer and see what happens Okay, I had never actually Approached a girl on the street just like that Like You think you want to do it? But then you just talk yourself out of it and you can get a bad feeling afterwards But now it's just eyes on target and go no problem It's funny funny. How do you have it all just switched? What's your name Well, what is that I'm Irick What did you in Barcelona do you live here or You don't She's broken She said I don't speak English in English It was just like so I didn't really know why you're here. Yeah, right. Yeah, it's just like yay Are you and then it was a bit of awkward tension? Yeah That how can we deal with that the way to deal with this awkward tension is by calling it out, you know You have to feel like okay. There's something wrong. She's like, yeah. Hello, but Don't speak English. It's then the thing she's saying to get out of it What she means is like this is a bit strange to me. Oh, it's maybe too fast because you're so full-on like hey, what's up? It's a very smooth approach. I actually love it Just you have to feel the awkward tension and be like, oh, sorry. Is this strange to you or don't worry? I'm not dangerous. I'm not crazy or I just for you cute. Like you have to make some kind of opener To then call that out. Yeah, and then she's like, oh, yeah, it's a bit strange. Oh, it's fine But just building pressure pressure pressure pressure without releasing it then makes her escape out of it. But yeah, cool next Excuse me How you doing what's your name I don't I like nice to meet you I just walk with you. I saw you from over there and I thought you're really pretty Yeah Are you vacationing in Barcelona or Where you from? From Barcelona, okay. I Thought maybe Russian or something. I thought maybe you were Russian or something because you was like really elegant and What was your name again, I don't I don't Bird the opera Italian opera. I don't know what they Like I died if the name comes from Oprah here Oh, okay interesting Like I said, my name is Eric and you must guess what Eric means Yes Eric means King Eric means king. Yeah, it means King This is funny Have to catch up with my friends, but what is your do you have Instagram or something Instagram? It's nice to meet you All right. I Love how you turned it around like she was a bit standoffish and you kept persisting in a good way. It's really cool So I saw that she got messages from the boyfriend Right in that moment. Yeah, but she didn't tell me. Yes, which is a good sign Yeah, which like either she just enjoys the attention and you have no chance, but she enjoys the attention Okay, but maybe it's on the way out, you know Maybe he's on the way out or he just cheated on her and she wants to revenge fuck or you don't know She has an open relationship, you know, who knows? Again like you're just closing too quick. Like there's no reason now like you did such a good Job of getting her back because she was a bit like this is weird Then you said I saw you and I wanted to stop you. Okay, you did the open after that's totally fine And then she opened up to you. He smiled and then you're like, oh, let's close You know like suddenly as soon as she warmed up then you went for the clothes like you didn't get to know her at all So next time I want to ask So next time I want to ask Few things like hey, what do you do work? What do you work? Do you enjoy your work? Uh, would you rather do something else or do you study? What do you study? Why do you like get into some basic conversation? Okay, okay Excuse me How you doing fine fine Are you guys on vacation or yeah, we're leaving in a couple of hours and we just Really? All right, like you have to balance your amazing persistence with reading her signals, you know when she's like Sorry, we're not here for long a bit in a hurry like she's not in a hurry She's shopping and how long she's here for doesn't matter in that moment. She's not saying it because she's in a hurry She's saying it because i'm a bit uncomfortable with this. I don't really know why you're here like you do the hi How are you approach? Which maybe you also saw a video which is a good approach but in this context of busy street, uh, you're You you are potentially a street salesman Or whatever. It's just not clear why you're here And then there's a bit awkward tension, you know, and then you're like I don't I kind of want to get out of this because you're very friendly. You're open you have distance So they don't have reason to like be like no Because you have a good vibe. You're smiling. It's all really good But you they don't know why you're here and The hey, how are you? What's your name opener can be very powerful but in a context of You already made eye contact with her, you know, there was something established or she sees you coming not straight out of the dark or out of the blue Excuse me How you doing Um, then it's confusing for her and she feels uncomfortable. So keep that in mind. Uh, we swap now a good job I like your vibe. You're gonna do really good. Like you have to make some adjustments Um, that's why i'm here. Of course Um, and you have to obviously learn a lot in conversation because right now I didn't hear any of that. Yeah Um, but initial approach like your especially your distance your vibe is good and you have persistence you just have to balance it, you know, don't be Persistent with a sledge hammering through it and think if I just persist enough she's going to open up like yeah I noticed earlier that With those two But I wasn't getting anywhere. Yeah, but uh I thought like Romantically, but then maybe I can get that conversation in. Yeah, you have to call out the awkwardness You didn't do that, you know, they were uncomfortable and then that's a point where you could say something Okay, take off the mic and then you can approach that girl that you looked up For the guys who Are still considering whether or not to do this You can take a phone call with either john or one of the other coaches That is free. You can you can just do that. I took a chance and I won't apologize for it. It's it's been amazing So I'm stefan. I'm from switzerland Uh, i'm basically on a journey to expand my comfort zone i'm, actually not comfortable with it because as you said from the nice guy syndrome It was always nice and giving and people exploited it I had a hard time protecting my Sexual intent because I had the tendency to be always the friendly guy I had no trouble making friends this way, but When I really liked the girl Well, it never went really in that direction Uh, we'll take it easy i'm just gonna say hi to some people and see what happens. All right, thank you In portuguese I just felt like saying hi to you hi to you Well, I mean you look really nice today and I want to share that with you She looks very nice today You're welcome It's obviously harder than mom's daughter I don't mind that it's more the language. Uh, yeah everything. No, you shared good vibes Before, I was really too friendly. I had a disconnection with my sexuality and some negative experiences. And during the workshop, some NLP exercises from Shay helped me to reconnect that and reframe to positive experiences. So that gave me a huge boost of self-love and confidence. Hi, I'm here to meet you because you look cute and sexy as hell. What? Yeah. Damn. Beautiful, thank you. You're welcome. What's your name? Laura. Pleased to meet you. I'm Stefan. Are they already cheering you on? We're kind of in a hurry. All right. How about we get to know each other doing a coffee so we have more time for this? Okay. Do you have water? Yeah. Cool. How long are you staying in Barcelona? A week or so. A week, yeah. Well, I'll stay here for a couple of time for a long, I feel like. Okay. Bye. Okay. Where are you from? Switzerland. How did you get to know each other? Sorry, I'm actually... Okay. I kind of lied. I'm from here. Oh, okay. I got too nervous. I'm from here. Wow. Crazy, isn't it? I'm surprised. Like, I've never heard this. She told him, like, that they're tourists. And then, mid-sentence, she's like, sorry, I lied. I mean, you can hear it because you recorded it. But I was like, this never happened. Like, I'm surprised it's going on. It's amazing. Well, your English is very good for this. Thank you. Yours? Nice. Thank you. Well, I had some Australian friends. So... All right. You got it? Coffee. Awesome. High five. High five. Yeah. Let's have a coffee together. All right. Thank you very much. Bye. You were bold, which is great. And then you were lucky that the two girls totally loved that as well. And, like, instantly, like, let you alone. Like, supporting us. Yes. It doesn't happen always. Sometimes it happens. It's a gift of the universe. So that's really cool. What happened with her saying, no, sorry, I lied? Like, I heard something, but I was really confused. She told me that she's from another country. Yeah. Then a bit later, she said that, oh, sorry, I lied. I'm from here. Wow. Then I said, well, your English is very good. That's crazy. Like, why do you think she lied at the beginning? I don't know. Maybe scared? Yeah. Just like some defense mechanism of, oh, no, I will leave her. That's amazing. Like, she became so comfortable with you then. Because the approach, okay, was very bold, very full on. Maybe she was a bit shocked, but charmed. And she made up some story. And then she was like, oh, yeah, this guy is harmless. He's really cute. I feel comfortable with him. Like, okay, now he's the real truth. Like, it didn't happen to me. I was really surprised. It was funny. One feedback. Okay. The approach could be, like, it seemed a bit as a line, you know? Like, the way you approached was like, hello. And, like, the smile was a bit set up. Like, it's more like, hmm. And then, I want to meet you because you look tall and sexy. It's a little bit like, yeah. Like a little, like, you read it or you saw it in a video. And then you're replicating it. I'm here to meet you because you look cute and sexy as hell. Which is fine at the beginning, you know? At least you're making things happen. And she appreciates that. But get into a little bit more like, whoa, hello. Wow, you look cool. I just wanted to meet you. You look really sexy. How are you doing? You know, it's like, understand? Like, more in the flow. Like, feeling, right? Right. Like, give her the feeling that you're, like, still like, oh, wow, hello. How are you doing? You know, like, you're still affected by her versus just like a robot. And like, I wanted to meet you because you are really hot and sexy. With three girls, you have to be aware you don't have as much time than one-on-one, right? Because obviously the other two girls will maybe drag her away in whatever sense. Like, they are on a mission together. You're shopping together. So you already have to be aware, I don't have that much time. So you don't want to go into very deep topics as you maybe usually would want. Well, you got a number of beautiful girls. Yeah. And you only did, like, three approaches. Yeah, now the question is what I do with it. Basically, just a very quick advice is there's no perfect approach. Like, if you're like, I'm only happy if I do the perfect approach. And I'm only happy if I'm in total flow state. You're going to be unhappy for a lot of the time. You should just be unhappy because I am. Like, the happiness must come from within you, not from exterior thing or did I get a number or not? Was the approach perfect or not, you know? My experience with Alex was he was a very strict teacher, but he really knew what I had to do. Like, getting out of my thoughts of, wait, I don't like this. And he was telling me like, no, just go and see what happens. Okay, cool. And that's really helpful. I really like to be free and having the opportunity to suddenly create a wonderful day for me and someone else. All right, that's it. I hope you could take something out of that. If you're thinking now, holy shit, Eric and Stefan are pretty courageous for making such a massive step towards their transformation, towards becoming a better version of themselves, a better seducer, a better communicator.
