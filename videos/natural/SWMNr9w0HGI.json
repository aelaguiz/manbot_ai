Now, on the 1st of January, I dropped a cluster hydrogen napalm Hiroshima bomb on this channel, didn't I? Where I announced that this would be my very final year as the head coach for The Natural Lifestyles. I've been doing this for 10 plus, more than 10 years. A baker's dozen years, I think. And I've announced that it's time for me to do something else. Now, I received a huge response from you guys. Outpourings of grief and gratitude and a few snarky comments from those few guys who just have to say something nasty because they're not enjoying their lives very much. That's fine. I understand. And which I greatly appreciate. And there's also lots of questions like, what are you going to do now? What's the plan? I mean, I'm 39 years old. Like, I'm too young to go and sit in a retirement home in Miami and I'm not rich enough to just do nothing. So what am I going to do next? Let's talk about that. Now, before I talk about what's next for me, I wanted to address the response that I got from you gentlemen. I put this video together kind of impulsively. The whole decision was a bit random. Like, I wasn't really intending six months ago, if you'd asked me what will I be doing for the next few years, I'd say coaching for The Natural Lifestyles probably and doing some other mad shit as well. But the decision became apparent to me rather quickly that I needed to evolve and move on. So I put this video together, put it out thinking that I'd probably get, you know, some responses of guys going, cool bro, thanks for the vids. Or, lol, who cares? Or, well, one person did say that. Or, I like Liam better anyway. You're too old for me as my mentor or something. But what I received was a deluge of amazing comments from you guys with incredible amount of gratitude and people talking about that they were sitting in front of their computers with tears rolling down their faces, which is good, men. We need to cry sometimes. It's important. We have emotions. And if I can make you cry, then that's cool. I'm happy to do that. So it was really, really touching actually to see that there's a big effect that I've had. And of course, when I meet guys live and I'm teaching them in field or I'm teaching them on my workshops, it's very apparent the effect that I'm having on them. I'm spending many hours a day with them. I'm going through the changes, helping them face their fears, discussing at length their issues, digging deep into their psyche and then taking them through a hero's journey, an accelerated hero's journey. And so I see, yeah, of course, my teachings are having a massive effect. But it's less apparent with the videos. You know, we put out videos, people say they like them or they don't like them. In some ways, it's a one-way street as a media production company. Obviously, we see there's metrics, people are watching things, people are liking things. But I didn't realize what an effect that I was having to guys that I've never met. And just to, you know, give you a couple of, some of the cooler quotes. One guy says, I feel like this is when Ragnar died on Vikings. That's about as good a compliment as you can give a man. Just like, you know, when you leave the room, it's like Ragnar just died. Great show, right? Isn't it awesome seeing Vikings slaughtering each other? Although I think the problem with that show is that the guys just can't nail the accents. So, you know, it's like, it's what our father would have wanted. And it just doesn't sound that convincing. And so I just wish they'd shut up and just slice each other's throats, which they do. Another guy says, Barry says, I can honestly say, I don't know if I'd be alive if not for you. And I take that seriously. I don't think that's just a flippant comment. Uh, if, you know, if you come in contact with information that means that you stay alive, then I'm really pleased that that information came from me. And I'm really glad, Barry, that you're still with us. Stick around. Even if I don't make any more videos, hopefully you have the spark inside of you to know that life is fucking amazing. And sometimes shit, sometimes shit. But even when it's shit, it's amazing because it's way better to be living in shit than dead. Right? So you've got billions of years to be dead. So please, please stay around for as long as you can. Another guy says, usually I don't care about these things, but that's like a legend. But damn, but damn, emphasis me, but damn, that's like a legend stepping down. So, uh, thank you for sharing your wisdom. You've helped me crawl out of a living hell when it comes to life and dating. So a lot of comments like this, not just, hey man, that was a cool vid or your production quality has improved, which it has thanks to the guy behind the camera and several other gents in the background. So I really appreciate this guys. It means a lot to me. I'm not, you know, I'm a human. I feed on vanity. I feed on compliments. I feed on, um, you know, significance. And although I'm a person who's happy with myself and confident, it's good to know that this is, this is working, that we're having an effect. So thank you all. I really, really appreciate your responses, your heartfelt, honest, open responses. And I intend to keep giving something to this audience for quite a long time to come, which brings me to some of the questions that guys were asking. First question is when is this year's MMC? Now, if you don't know what that is, it stands for the Masculine Mastermind Conference, which is TNL's once a year corroboree, where myself, all the other TNL coaches, plus some guests get together in Budapest, Hungary, right here to present unreleased material, presentations, question and answer forums, drills, as well as the creation and reinforcement of the worldwide TNL brotherhood. Tickets are on sale right now from today. And I'm offering an early bird price of only 350 US dollars, which is insanely cheap. If you, there's no way that you can get any other coaching with us for anywhere close to that. We deliberately keep the price really low so that anyone who really wants to come can come. If you're a student or you're working a shitty job, you can still afford that. If you're in Europe, you can get on a bus, you can couch surf. We've had guys literally come from as far away as Australia, South Africa for this event. It's incredibly amazing, life-changing. And aside from all of the exclusive material that's presented there, because there's no rehashing, this is always brand new stuff that all the coaches put a huge amount of time working on. And for me this year, this will be the last time that I'm presenting on seduction related topics. So I intend to deliver the final word on many of the areas that I've spent over a decade specializing in. Another benefit of the MMC is that it has become a crucible for the worldwide brotherhood of guys that are following TNL material, trying to live a life based around the five principles, based around authenticity, based around projecting their clear, unapologetic desire whilst taking responsibility for their own actions. This is literally a place where men have gone from being asleep, being irresponsible, being weak. And I don't mean that in the don't be a fucking pussy kind of way. I mean, weak in the sense of not actually having stability in their core, not knowing who the fuck they are and not being able to deliver their destiny to the world. And this conference has been a catalyst for massive change where men have come out of that sleepwalking state and gone on to amazing greatness. So if you'd like to become part of the TNL Brotherhood or for those guys, the couple of hundred guys that come every year, I'm sure you're gonna be there this year as well, right? I mean, this is my last year, so why the fuck would you not be? 24th to the 26th of May, Budapest, Hungary. Click the link in the description to get tickets today. I'm offering the discount only until Valentine's Day. Why did I choose that? I don't know, it seems ironically poignant. You won't forget. You've got until Valentine's Day to get it for the cheap price, so you may as well buy it right now because tickets will sell out. They did last year and the year before. A couple of guys asked, will I be deleting the videos on this channel? To which I say, are you fucking kidding me? Why on earth would I delete my entire body of work that I've spent over a decade collating? I mean, that's a really big power move, you know, to just nuke everything that you've presented to the world. So no, I will absolutely not be doing that. Don't worry. All of the videos will stay up. And actually, Tony Solo did do that recently, right? He just nuked his whole channel. I don't know why. People ask me, I don't know why he did it. He's a very intense man and when he makes a decision about something, he does it. So wherever he is right now, I wish him all the best, but it seems silly to do that. For me, no, I'm too vain. I'm too invested, too outcome dependent on your guys' likes. So no, the videos will stay. Don't worry about that. A bunch of other people were asking, so what's the deal with this property in Portugal? I was hinting that I'm going to be doing something there, some strange activities, some kind of occult things, perhaps something, some eyes wide shut, you know, tying virgins to a stone tablet in the forest kind of things. Did I say that out loud? That's not happening. That's not happening. Not happening there at all. No virgins being tied to stone tablets. Definitely not going to happen. So what am I doing out there aside from chopping wood? Can we just cut to me chopping wood? By now the editor's like, that's it. No more wood chopping. We can't justify any more chopping wood. And then there'll be one cut there, right? Just one, one chop, one little chop. So what am I going to be doing out at the farm? Aside from chopping wood and growing some chickens and stuff, I have big plans for that place. And when I got it last year, which was a very impulsive decision, as was me retiring, it wasn't clear what was the purpose, except that I needed to have a space to go out and be in nature and work on the next evolution. Now, recently I was in Australia. I'm just pointing that way. I don't know if that's where Australia is actually. Recently I was in, isn't down. Recently I was in Australia, catching up with friends and family. And I did a really fast trip. I went bouncing around to different cities and saw a lot of old friends and family members and then also did some coaching. One thing that really struck me was I'm 40. It really struck me that, like, I'm going back and seeing all my old friends and seeing, okay, well, these people have families. Like they have children and they have mortgages and they have ex-wives and they have lawsuits and various, and, you know, paunches and various other things that people get as they get older. And it was really telling to look at the lives of others because most of the year I spend my life with a group of X-Men, you know, the TNL crew and all sorts of people that we collaborate with, the John Kegans, the Gareth Jones, the Hayley Quinns. There's only one each of them. So, you know, each one of them, imagine if they were cloned, that would be cool. Hanging out with all these excellent people who are living at a very high vibrancy and are always doing interesting things. And then the other people I'm hanging out with is, well, beautiful girls. And so they're being that beautiful girl living that life and students. And so the students may be coming from a position of feeling stuck, but they are people who have admitted that they need help or are seeking excellence. And so they're going through a process of change. So pretty much everyone I surround myself is in motion, is in evolution of some sort. Going back home, I got to see people who were living normal lives. And I'm not being down on my old friends in the sense that they're not losers and they're not necessarily hating their lives, but many of them have reached kind of end points in terms of their evolution. It's pretty clear that the guy now is gonna be the same when he's 60 or 70, just older and in worse shape. And yeah, it was kind of depressing just to see the way that people really, really get engraved in their habit patterns. And I think pretty much this happens almost universally, unless you are very specifically being vigilant about getting out of your rut. Because we are creatures of habit, right? Like human beings love habits and we need them because otherwise if we didn't have sets of habits, every morning we'd get up and have to try and reinvent what we do every day, that would be stressful and tiring because you'd have to think about which way do I go to the university or to my workplace every day instead of just kind of robotically going and doing it. So patterns and habits are an integral part of our life and we need them, but they're also the worst traps that we can put ourselves inside. Because once we start living on autopilot, it means that days, weeks, months, and a lifetime can pass without you actually ever stepping out of your habit patterns and going, whoa, hang on, how did I engrave this course of action and is it the best one for me? And going back home, seeing people who had been in dead-end relationships for years and years and sometimes like one of my best buddies is in a 15-year relationship and it's finally coming to the end and he's really looking at it and he was talking to me and asking questions like, what is the whole point of this relationship thing? And I'm like, well, I don't exactly know what the point of relationships are, but I know that you should be enjoying them most of the time. Another buddy of mine, I asked him if he was happy and he said, well, what's happiness? And I said, because he's been with a girl for a long time who I can clearly see he's very unhappy with and I said, well, you know how sometimes you get up in the day and you feel shit and then you get up another day and another day and you do that like 30 in a row and you're feeling shit? Well, that's probably being unhappy. Come on, man, you know what happiness is. If you're asking me that question, you're not happy. And it's startling to me that people will acknowledge that they're unhappy or that they're stuck in a rut and yet not have a sense of fucking urgency that they have to change it. And for me, like I've been someone who's been breaking my ruts, breaking my habits very, very often throughout my life. You know, I'll get in some kind of habit, whether it's a relationship or a job or a city and when I start feeling really comfortable or when I start feeling like nothing's changing and evolving, I tend to shatter the whole thing and go off and rebuild. Now, sometimes that's a bit too impulsive and sometimes it causes a whole bunch of damage and wrecks something that I should have spent a bit more time in. I'm not saying that I'm perfect in this sense, but the thing that has kind of driven me to do that is a sense that if I stay in this one thing, It's kind of the end of my life. It's like if I'm not evolving, if I'm not growing, if I'm not learning, if I'm not being challenged, if I'm not up against the tension of uncertainty, then I don't really feel alive. Now, I'm a kind of extreme case. I'm not saying you need to be doing what I do all the time, but it certainly has kept me supple, right? It certainly has kept me young at heart, young in mind, and it's meant that when something I could see in my life was no longer serving me, maybe I stayed a week, a month, two months longer than I should have. I've been in relationships where I spent six months longer than I should have, but I didn't spend six years longer than I should have. I spent a bit of time and then I'm like, this is really not serving me or not serving her or not serving us, so let's get the fuck out. Same thing with the country, same thing with lines of work. For me, over the last year or so, TNL ironically in its current form for me has started to feel like a bit of a rut. Now, it's a very interesting one. It's a very fulfilling one in many ways. I get paid a lot of money. I get to have an interesting life. I can travel. I can meet girls. I can kind of do whatever I want and funnel it through the TNL infrastructure, but for me, it was starting to become too easy. And like I've, you know, the amount of times I've taken a guy out on the street and said, okay, so let's talk about preframes and let's go over and talk to girls. I've done that thousands of times and I have to admit like that one piece is not challenging or interesting for me anymore because I know that when I take a beginner guy on the street and I explain to him a beginner concept, we're going to get beginners responses from the girls. Yeah, it's like it is what it is, right? But for me, it's time for me to move on and do something different. So when I was in Australia recently, I was teaching an experimental workshop. This is a private workshop that is not advertised, is not publicly known. It's called The Natural Elite and it's a place where Liam and I and several other coaches have been experimenting with new levels of presentations of working on different areas of coaching that are not related, not specifically just related to cold approach on the street. And the one that we were doing in Australia was a shamanic tribal initiation retreat. So what we did is we took a friend of ours who is a very high level Peruvian trained shaman, someone that I've spent weeks within the Amazon jungle on trips where I've gone deep into the jungle and lived there for weeks at a time and studied this Peruvian shamanism and using specifically plant medicines. So you may or may not have heard of the plant mixture called ayahuasca. If you haven't, look it up. You'll learn something. But essentially, it's a very, very strong psychedelic plant, which in conjunction with a whole bunch of rituals and various meditation practices, as well as dieting, as well as doing ascetic training, essentially stripping yourself back to your bare core and then facing yourself at a deep level with the utilization of these psychedelic drugs can take you to really, really powerful and often confronting and terrifying breakthroughs where you have to see aspects of yourself, which most people don't ever see. Most people avoid the darker or the uglier parts of their psyche. Most people never work through their childhood issues, particularly. Human beings are pretty amazing that we can last and function through an entire lifetime without ever fixing ourselves. We don't need to be perfect to survive. It's good that we don't need to be perfect to survive. Otherwise, none of us would survive. But we can be broken and limping and fractured and repressed and still kind of go to work and get shit done and feed ourselves and breed and make more fractured, traumatized children and continue this cycle indefinitely. However, although we have the capacity to be walking wounded, we also have the capacity to heal. And each one of us has something to heal. I've never met somebody who was born and grew up in perfection, like had the perfect parents, the perfect upbringing, the perfect set of circumstances, the perfect genetics, and everything just worked wonderfully and they just sailed through life as this blessed kind of golden child. Everyone, to greater or lesser degree, has been fucked up by their parents, by their conditioning, by life, by traumatic experiences, by themselves primarily. You do it to yourself mostly, don't you? Don't you? Most of the things, really, I mean, it was your parents' fault initially and the church and some other brutalizing factors early on. But then we continue to recreate and compound our own traumas. And it was funny, when I was tripping hard on Ayahuasca, I was sitting there and I just started laughing and I said to myself, Holy shit, it takes a lifetime of healing to heal a perfect life. I've got a great life, one of the best lives you could have. I'm very, very grateful. I don't want to whinge about anything. I am truly blessed, very lucky in some respects, and also I have done smart things with the lucky breaks that I've been given. But still, I have childhood shit. I went through deep down into my psyche during these trips and looked at my relationship with my mother and with my father and saw how that had gone through time and affected me and how that affected my relationships with women, you know, in some really heavy and confronting ways. And I think it's vitally important that if you want to be able to have an exceptional life, not a perfect life, but an excellent life. You'll never have a perfect life, but an excellent one, one that you fucking love to live and one that is of benefit to you and to the people around you, then you're going to need to dig through and deal with your shit. You are going to need to look at the traumas that you've picked up throughout life because you can't have a functional relationship, for example, with a woman or a man or anything if you are heavily walking wounded. Because otherwise you'll project, you'll be codependent, you'll be needy, you'll be possessive, you'll dump that stuff on them and they'll dump theirs on you and you'll just end up fucking shredding each other and then you'll break up and then do it over and over again. So you have to deal with your stuff. So that's what we were working on in this workshop where we had my shaman friend as well as some movement specialists who looked at the ways that we inhabit this physical structure. One of the students that was there, and no offense, he knows who he is, but I'm using him as an example. He's 26 years old, incredibly intelligent, like scary smart, very, very high-level systems architect in a very big tech company. And at dawn, he and I went for this long walk up a hill. So we're in the Australian kind of outback and we went for a long walk and we got to a fence which was just kind of normal, like a normal fence that a cow doesn't get through. And I just like climbed the fence and got over. I'm 40 years old, I can climb a fence. And then I hear his footsteps not walking and I turn around and there he is, like, I wish I had a fence to, kind of like this. This is what he was doing. I'm not exaggerating. And then he got to here and then he just fell like a fucking sack of shit, just like splattered, splattered onto the ground. And I said, dude, that's not okay. You're 26 years old and you're falling like an 80-year-old man, like you've had a fall, like, you know, when grandpa has a fall, not okay. So we were working on, with this movement therapist, working on how to inhabit this body in the way of a warrior. Because so many men now, they just sit behind computers or cars and their ranges of motion and motion are like robots. And even if they go to the gym, a lot of you guys are fit, but you're doing linear movements, you're just lifting weights, you know. And so that puffs the muscles up a bit. But so many guys come to my workshop, some of them are very physically robust, but they don't know how to move. They can't dance, they can't shake, they can't groove, they can't fuck properly because they're not actually embodied. So a lot of the work that I've been doing personally over many years through martial arts training and then moving into more of the Ido Portal stuff and ancestral movement and so on, is looking at the way that we inhabit our physical structure because it so profoundly affects how you feel, your grace, your sexuality, your charisma. Like a big part of the reason why you guys perceive me as somebody that you should listen to is because I am embodied. I'm not just staring at you and ranting in this stiff body. You would not, even subconsciously, you just wouldn't accept me as a mentor if I didn't look comfortable. So a lot of the work that I'm going to be doing later this year and then going into next year is mentoring men and women, I hope, on deeper psychological aspects. It's not just in a game in kind of a generic life coaching sense. Looking at really how to draw out the deeper traumas and how to expel them, on how to live a life of joy, how to live a life where you are really, really fucking present and drawing the juice out of it. I have such a sense of urgency these days and I haven't. For the last couple of years, I've been in some ways in a bit of a daydream because things have been working really well. I went through the tension periods of, fuck, is this business going to work? Are people going to listen to what I'm going to say? Can I do this? I went through that years ago. For the last bunch of years, things have been working. I know what I'm doing. I know how to do this. I know how to run a business. I have an excellent team around me. We're making money. We're getting results. I could keep doing this for a long time and not have to really think about it. But one thing that really, really sparked in me over the last six months is a sense of, fuck, time, time, time is passing. And it's urgent. It's urgent that you rush to stop. It's urgent that you're rushing to the moment. And everyone always talks about the power of now and living the moment. But that's not just some words that sound nice and you can say them to yourself and maybe feel better for a second or two. It really is a daily and moment-by-moment practice. It is done through meditation. That's the way that I have tried to give it to you guys, and especially my clients. It's done through embodiment. It's done through decisiveness of thought and action. There are so many things, particularly this screen that you're looking at right now and the one that you're going to look at soon, Instagram or other YouTube trash channels of cats jumping out of buildings, which is kind of funny when cats just jump, and they don't even know that they're up on the 13th floor, and they just jump, and then they're dead, I guess. But they don't show that bit. They just show the cat springing out. You know that video? That's one that's such a poignant one to me when the cat just launches, and then it's gone. It's deep. But there's so many forces that are just drawing your attention away and fucking wanting you... All they want is to hijack your system, which wants salt and sugar and fat and easily digestible bite-sized pieces of entertainment over and over and over again until you're fucking dead suddenly. And I have a really clear sense that my life is passing. I'm nearly 40. That's half my life gone. And I lived a great life so far for the first 50%, but not nearly good enough. I missed chunks of it. A minute. A day. A month where I was kind of in a bit of a daydream, or when I was depressed, or when I was watching porn, or when I was hunched over just watching too many fucking stupid somethings, or when I was stoned, or when I was fighting with my girlfriend over stupid shit, or when I was estranged from my parents because we were having a tiff and so I didn't talk to my mother for two years. Two whole years. There was a time where I didn't speak to my mother. I can't get that time back. So I try to spend time with her as much as I can now. And all of you have done this, and you've probably done it much, much worse than me because I'm a specialist at living a fucking great life, and I've still wasted heaps of it. You're wasting way more. I know you are. I know you. Except for that guy there. He's like, fuck you, man. I didn't waste any of it. Okay, except for that guy. But you know it. And we do not respect our time enough. We do not respect our lives enough. And you must. Because it's going to be over in a fucking fraction of a celestial second. And then what happens? You don't get to come back. Fuck that. That's just vanity. We're just scattered into stardust. Maybe. Maybe you get to reincarnate and just waste your life over and over and over again. Maybe. Certainly not going to heaven. That one's a very, very wishful thinking. That's my opinion anyway. Catholics, feel free to disagree. And fuck you for killing 68 million people throughout history and still managing to just rape the third world continually. And everyone still thinks it's okay. The Pope is still cool. Really? That's something for another time. As I give less and less of a fuck about towing the party line and needing to only talk about seduction right now, the guys in fucking PR are like, James, shut James off. He's only supposed to talk about pick up. Nah, things are going to change. So, does that answer the question? What am I going to do? I think that gives you some hints. That clearly right now I'm going through an evolution. I'm feeling really, really alive. And I'm really enjoying that. And I'm really raw. And so I want to be able to give that to you guys. Throughout this year, 2019, I'm pumping out a lot, a lot of material. I have mixed feelings about it, right? Because in some ways I'm part of the problem. I'm producing something that means that somebody will sit there and watch it. And in that time, they may not be doing what they should be doing. But on the other hand, what I'm providing you with is inspiration and practical applications to go out and live a good life. So please don't just sit there and binge watch my shit. One thing I noticed from when I announced that I was retiring was that a lot of the comments were like, Oh, okay, yeah, now I'm going to do something. This is the year I'm going to get something done."}
