She comes really close for extended periods of time but never seems to reach the point. Reach the point? What could be the causes? What would be a set of steps to unlock that? And also, what would be the right attitude to adopt in case it never happens? I think part of the problem we have with this pursuit of orgasm is we forget about the most important part of sex, which is connection and pleasure. So for some ladies, orgasm with a partner really is difficult. They can do it on their own, it just can't seem, no matter how great the lover is. So I wouldn't take it personal for one. And I would get really, I just get really curious about ways of amplifying her pleasure. So learning how to edge, for example, where you're heightening her pleasure and then calming her down and then heightening her pleasure and calming her down without the idea of tipping her over can be very helpful because it creates a more robust nervous system. So perhaps her nervous system, maybe she's very stressed all the time, maybe there's a lot of funny thoughts going on in her head that, you know, for some ladies to surrender to orgasm is terrifying because it means letting go of control. So there's a lot of things that could be happening unconsciously. She could have had an experience in the past where she was close to an orgasm or had an orgasm, this happens frequently, where in that moment of expansion, she really let go and then she was shamed. I hear about this all the time. So again, there's, we all come with a bit of baggage, so that can be quite difficult. Another thing to do is you might want her to do her own mapping of her pleasure system, so her own external genitalia and inside and just mapping for herself, maybe even in front of you and telling you what she's feeling, where it might be pleasurable, where there's numbness and maybe where there's even discomfort. Also, I have found that men who are really insistent on giving me an orgasm, I come very easily, but if they're insistent on giving me one, it's almost like my body goes, nah. Yeah, nah. Nah. These germs are yeah, nah. Yeah, nah, not today. So if you let go of that need then, and you just pursue pleasure, like how can we expand this pleasure? How deep can we make this pleasure go? Using different rhythms, maybe even different ways of contact. Some women don't want a lot of front body contact and other women really need it. So you might want to experiment, like how are you positioning your bodies together? But definitely the pleasure mapping first, her mapping herself, hopefully revealing to you like what she's finding, and then you're noticing as well where she is. So then the second stage would be to map with her anatomy with your fingers, and the third stage is actually to use your cock. So you would do the same mapping, like how does it feel here, and just touching different areas with the cock externally, and then slowly internally, and discovering together what's happening. So I think that's a really great start. Start. And just opened 16 other boxes. Yes. So I can maybe talk a little about cock mapping. Yeah, you want to map your cock. Because I know quite a bit about that, but I've got a couple of follow-up questions, and I think this is a really important question, guys. So we're going to stay with this one for a little bit. So I've got a- I'm not actually taller than James, by the way. There we go. You put me on this huge cushion. No, look, there we go. That's about right. Okay, cool. So firstly, you said an interesting thing about a woman maybe having an orgasm and really letting go and being shamed for it. So I'm thinking like an example might be just like a girl's a screamer, for example, right? So she screams and lets go in some kind of way, and the guy's like, I'll fucking keep it down or something like that. That would be an example. That can be that. For some ladies, they have a sensitive energetic system where even the first time they have an orgasm with someone, it can almost be like a psychedelic experience. It's very where the eyes roll back and they kind of almost leave their bodies. There's this expansion that happens. And when they are in that, their psychic space, their psychology is very sensitive. It's really right. And so anything you say in that moment has like a long-term impact. So some of them in that moment, the guy's like, what the hell are you doing? Like, that's disgusting. Or your face looks weird. Yeah, exactly. Because you've got to like, ugh. Exactly. And then it never happens again. And then it's a very difficult thing to kind of reclaim. So it's not always the case, but often it's like this. And sometimes it's not that obvious. It could just be, she's in this place and she's wanting connection. And that's the moment he pulls away. And maybe he's pulling away for another reason, but she takes it as, it's disgusting. I don't like it. So there's a lot of, especially young people, they're not very good at communicating. So it can be a lot of misunderstandings. Lots of people, people are not good at communicating. That's true. But I think when you get a little older, you're a little shameless, a little more shameless. Well, we are. Yeah. Okay. We are. I just wrote down, um, unshaming as like a technology. I'll think about that. Okay, cool. Now, now, now, so. So. Dr. Seda. You know the system. You did mention mapping, right? And in the product, Seda has added a short module, but a very important module for those who got the gold version, which is the vast majority of you. So if you haven't watched that by now, you must certainly will after this. Cause you're like, whatever she said, I want to know more. I'm going to presume. Um, but maybe you can give a bit more explanation. Cause you said first mapping with, uh, should be getting her to map then mapping with your fingers, then mapping with the cock and maybe I'll handle the cock mapping bit. Okay. That sounds good. So the, um, mapping with the external genitalia, whether it's her fingers or your fingers would literally be, and this is what pelvic pain, uh, physiotherapists will do. They'll come and they'll just do like a gentle brush down. And sometimes people have on the labia and they have no sensation. So do you feel that? Do you not feel that? Um, and then touching the inner lips very lightly. Do you feel that or not feel that some people have no sensation or that actually hurts? So it's really important to kind of just do an overall, um, and it's called it's called the wink where you just lightly touch over the anus. And if it goes like this, it's healthy. What do you do over the anus? So you just, yeah, I just brush like that. And it goes like that. It just is a little weak. And that means it's a healthy butt. Yeah. Oh, there's something, a healthy, but healthy, but what's the song? I like big butts and I can not lie. That's right. Yep. My Anaconda won't get someone unless you walk up. So, um, so the external, and then you want to, in the external genitalia, there's the area where the clitoris is. And then there's the vaginal opening between those two is where the urethral opening where the pee comes out that can hold a lot of tension and a lot of pain. Is that also where squirting comes out? Yes. Some of it. Yes. Okay. Yeah. There's layer different types of squirts. So, um, the hole where the pee comes out is the urethral opening on either side of that hole. There's actually little ducts, little like slits and it's like saliva gland ducts. So you know how wet your mouth can get. So your body uses these ducts to create moisture. It's the same here. And, um, there's a lot of release of fluid. So that's one type of ejaculate. Right. Then the other type is a kind of a changed urine type that happens within the bladder and that uses the urethra. And that's the smelly one. It can be, but not always. Like if, if the woman is well hydrated and is healthy, it can actually be clear and no smell at all. If there is a smell often it's because there's a blockage in the system or there's a lot of heavy emotion. And then once that's cleared, there can be no scent at all. And it can actually be quite lovely. So, um, let me just tell you a little story. Oh yes. I'm in Brazil. Okay. And did you have an adventure? I had many adventures of all sorts of types, but, uh, what I discovered is from my, you know, um, unscientific, uh, focus group that all Brazilians squirt because of the, because of the samba, because of the, you know, they're in their bodies. Right. And I think I mentioned this on the group chat, but I haven't told you. Okay. I'm interested. So I go down like 69, which is not my favorite position, but whatever, you know, so I go down and I literally just touch her clitoris and she fucking unloads right, like right in my mouth, like a full squirt direct right in the mouth. I take a shot in the mouth and it didn't taste good. I'm just like, I didn't throw up. I just like blurted all out. And then I went, went back to all punishment. I touched it again, again, fucking just shot me all the way. Just one touch. I'm like, that was clearly not my amazing technique there. That was, it could have been, maybe you don't know. Some of you are sensitive, um, or they get incredibly aroused. So you want to make sure, um, and also feeding your lover, things like watermelon or really hydrating yummy things prior is really important, but a lot of hydration mint tea is a really great one. So I know drinking is a thing people do a lot on dates, but actually it makes these things work. Not as good. One of the many reasons why, and of course, like the young guy in a party, like I don't take home wasted chicks for a number of reasons, legal reasons, the sex sucks reasons. Uh, and now these reasons as well. Yeah. And well, cause the thing that I always noticed was everyone's mouth dry. Yeah. And so you can't, you know, he's trying to kiss and it's all dry. And then you're like drink some water and it doesn't seem to really make any difference. No, no, because you need a bit of time for the hydration. I'm remembering all my party, disgusting party days. Oh, did you remember something too there? Yes. Okay. So what else have you got? Awesome insights from Dr. Seda Desilets and myself on how to get your lady off.
