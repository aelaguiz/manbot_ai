So I'm going to give you one of the biggest in-the-game hacks of your life today. So stay tuned because we're going to go deep down the rabbit hole of how to change your physiology to feel better as well as use your mindsets to be on top of your game. So let me talk about this thing, embodiment. So let's dive in and start talking about this powerful secret of in-the-game mastery that I'm talking about today which is actually physiology because the truth is you are one being. You are whole, you are complete and that includes your physical, your mental, your emotional and your energetic being. So we need to work out how to bring all that together and not only that we want to bring that together with the intention of being able to interact interpersonally in the world. So that's one of the reasons why I love being an in-the-game coach and a dating coach and working with the natural lifestyles. Doing the work that I do is because it is such a powerful interface to be able to work with this beautiful thing we call life and the most interesting thing that you can start to be aware of is that you're existing. You are actually alive and a big part of being alive is the body. Now if you're like a lot of guys out there and this is me talking to myself to a degree as well, there's a very heavy tendency to be very mentally orientated, very heavy tendency to be very like constantly thinking about ideas, analyzing, pulling things apart, you know being tactical, being technical because I mean that's useful. It's useful to be able to organize yourself, to be able to manage your life and if you have a technical job or something you need to take care of then that's a great part of yourself that you need to be aware of. But when it comes to being interpersonal with women, when it comes to experiencing life, enriching yourself with the fullness of what life is all about, it's really important to start to work with your feelings. It's really important to start to work with your emotions. So that's what we're going to be talking about today, the power of feelings, emotions and physiology and how you can use that together. Now on a basic level you have two parts to your physiology. You have let's call it baseline physiology and baseline physiology is the kind of energy that you have based on your current physical health, based on the amount of sleep you've been getting, based on the level of nutrition that you've had and your body's ability to have a kind of biochemical baseline of health and vitality and healthy vibrations. So that sets the kind of baseline foundation. Now on top of that level of physiology you have a secondary level of physiology which is your mental ability to change your physiology. So for example right now I can change my physiology by taking a deep breath. You can do that too with me, take a deep breath with me. Notice one simple thing, just taking a breath starts to change the way that you feel, starts to change what you're doing. You're taking an active role in changing your physiology. I can relax, I can relax my body. I can be mentally aware, scanning through my body, where am I holding attention and then I can release that. So for some of you guys that might mean you're holding a lot of tension in your shoulders a lot and you don't even realize that you're doing it. So start to try and consciously relax that, bring that into your awareness. You can even do exercises like clench and release and clench and release. So these are little ideas that starts to show you that you can actually change your physiology based on your focus, based on how you're choosing to use your skills of focus. So physiology, massive key. Using your breath, using your posture, physically relaxing. If there's one powerful superpower that I could tell you today from this video that you could take away that would help you in your life, that would help you with women, it's relax. It's relax and feel good inside of your body. Now to do that you need some kind of frameworks, some mindsets, some techniques, some tactics. So that's a big part of what I actually teach in workshops and I'm going to give you a little bit of a teaser today to how you can do that. You can start to work with this awesome thing called your body, this awesome thing that is the process going on inside your body called your physiology and you can start to change it. So how can we work with our physiology? I've already given you some tips. Breathing, relaxing. I'll tell you another really powerful one. Smile. Put a smile on your face. Start to be somebody that smiles at the world. Start to be somebody that smiles at yourself. Start to bring that energy of the smile, the intention of a smile. What is the intention of a smile? Why do we smile? We smile because we feel good. We smile because we're feeling a pleasant moment. Bring that smile into yourself. Bring that smile into your chest. Bring that smile into your body, into the core of who you are. Smile into the space of what you are. Because life's not just about doing things all the time. It's not just about trying to get things. It's not just about trying to be cool or be seen or achieved so that people will love you. It's a big trap that some people get caught in, the identity trap of accumulating things. And it's also not about escaping. It's not about, you know, sitting like some vipassana vegetable on the sideline of life and just like observing everything like some piece of space dust. That's not the way either. It's about integrating the two parts of your reality together. The fact that you are consciousness and physical. You are material and mental. And those two aspects can start to come together. So that begins with chilling out inside yourself. Smiling, relaxing, enjoying the fact that you can, if you choose, focus on pleasure. You can, if you choose, relax. You can, if you choose, start to feel good, to feel better. And that's a very powerful thing. It will relax your body. And if you do it well, you'll start to feel good, positive, healthy, happy, light, playful, friendly vibrations inside your body. And how much is that gonna help you when you put yourself in front of a stranger? How much is that gonna help you when you see that pretty girl and you're like, I wish I could go and talk to her? And then you feel a lot of love. You feel present. You feel relaxed. And guess what that presupposes to yourself as well as to her? It presupposes that you're okay. It presupposes that you've got good energy. You've got something to give. And that will be transmitted and translated through your physiology. It will be transmitted and translated through your body language, through your micro-communications, your eyes, your smile, even the feelings. Because if you pay attention, you can actually read people. And people are reading each other all the time. You know when somebody's happy. You know when somebody's sad. You know when somebody's angry. You know when somebody's playful. Because we've been doing this since we've been babies. We've been doing this forever. It's a big part of what we are as humans. We're reading each other. We're social mammals. We're part of a social world. And our nervous system is reading these cues all the time. So it starts to become somebody that's putting out positive cues. That is putting out relaxed cues. That is being in alignment with what it means to be a happy, healthy, friendly, curious, social version of yourself. Now, I understand this is not always easy because I mean I spend a lot of hours telling guys this stuff. And we do a lot of practices and things. And oftentimes what happens is that they get focused back onto the fixation of the outcome. They get focused back onto the fixation of the technical side of things. Ah, she doesn't like me. Ah, I'm not getting numbers. Ah, I'm not getting dates. It's not sticking. It's not working. Yeah, okay. That's part of the process of becoming more technically competent. It's part of the process of playing the numbers game of this social casino that you're part of. And you can't guarantee anything. You've got to go in, have the experience and see what happens. But yet again, the one thing that I want to draw your attention to is you can chill out. You can manage your physiology well. You can start to take care of yourself. Which for a lot of people is very, very important. Especially if you come from a past where you experienced trauma or difficulty or suffering or depression or pain or isolation or doubt or insecurity. Because if you've come from those places, your nervous system has become conditioned to feeling lack, to feeling fear, to feeling insecure, to feeling a feeling as if there is a threat, to feeling a feeling as if there's something wrong. And maybe there was something wrong in your past. Maybe there was a threat in your past. But hopefully, and I'm wishing this, that you don't have that in your life right now. And if that's the case, well, it's time to come out of that threat mentality. It's time to come out of that fear mentality. This is also important because if you're coming from fear mentality, lack, insecurity, tension, stress, fear inside of your body, that can telegraph to people around you. People feel it in you. People read it in you. People sense that there's something wrong. People sense that you're insecure. People sense that you don't have confidence. People sense that you've been traumatized. Sometimes that's okay. You know, a lot of people are mostly friendly. I mean, we don't tend to judge people based on this, but it's not attractive. And if you want to be the kind of guy that can walk up to a woman and have an emotional impact, to make her feel alive as a woman, to make her feel turned on like really instantly, to make her feel compelled to give you attention because you're a strong, confident, powerful man in his body, embodied in his positivity, embodied in his confidence, embodied in his vision of himself, embodied in his strength to be able to take her on a mission. If you want to be that kind of guy, we've got to learn to let go of that stuff, that stress, that tension. And that's partly practice, breathing, relaxing, doing the kinds of activities that I teach guys in workshops. You know, it's exactly the work that I teach in the Black Dragon Yoga that I'm releasing. This very powerful technology to be able to change your mind through archetypes, through intention, through physiological movements, aligning imagination, movement, breath, and energy all together into one system so that you can be a whole and powerful man. And if you're somebody who doesn't know how to do that, or you're out of touch with your body, then you're going to be running at a loss. You're behind the game. You know, you don't know what you don't know. And whether you realize it or not, you pay the price for that. You pay the price if you don't have the skills to relax. You pay the price if you don't have the ability to trust yourself, to love yourself. So ultimately, embodiment is about learning how to come home, to come home to this beautiful frame, this beautiful technology. You know, it's a temple. It's a vehicle. And you can work with it through movement, through learning to exercise. It doesn't just mean pumping weights. That's good if you want to do that. That's good for your posture. It's good for your strength. It's good for your muscles. But it equally means stretch, and breathe, and work on your flexibility, work on your dynamism. Learn to dance, learn to do martial arts, learn to flow, learn to express yourself physically. It's very beneficial. Start to do things like shaking, getting your body alive, releasing tension, releasing starkness. So that's a big part of this practice, practicing change, practicing techniques that help you to be able to create new physiological patterns, new nervous system patterns. The secondary thing, which I talk about a fair bit as well, is you need to work on your mindset in terms of where you've been coming from in the past. It's another huge part of the work that I do, one-on-one and in workshops, is helping guys to clean up their idea of themselves in the past. And this is very personal work. It's very detailed work. But it's also very important work. So if you've ever heard of characters like Jordan Peterson talk about things like self-authoring, future authoring, these are powerful technologies. It's a similar thing to what I'm talking about here. Being able to take the conception of yourself, the self-image that you have with all the details that have been associated with that in the past, and to be able to go in and to specifically find moments where you created definitions of yourself that were limiting, moments where you became crippled, stifled, stuck, because things were not given to you, or because somebody shut you down, somebody knocked you down, somebody held you down. And then you had a reaction to that experience that you carried forth from that time. So the practice is to go in to find these... these knots, these blocks, these challenges, and to undo them. And guess what? You don't have to do it by yourself. I'm here. Good coaches are out there. Good therapists are out there. Talk to people who know what they're talking about. Talk to people who can work this out. I had to go through this stuff for years to understand what I understand now. So you can't just learn this in a few minutes on a YouTube video. But I can give you the idea. This is about cleaning up the past. About giving yourself healthy mindsets, changing beliefs, re-imprinting, re-installing, reprogramming the subconscious mind. Because that is part of your physiology. That's your neurochemistry. That's your neurology. It's part of who you are and how you feel about yourself. And the really juicy thing here is you learn how to get into positive, resourceful, powerful physiological states, which I've already mentioned many inside of this video already. You get into these states and then you take these states, these resources, into the past and you use them to help you to move forward. And what that does is it starts to move you away from the emergency. It starts to shut down the siren of emergency inside of your nervous system so that you can be free. You can be at ease, relaxed, expressed, whole, at peace. And I don't know about you, but that is the best feeling in the world. It's the most important feeling in the world. And this whole game of women, relationships, sex, growth, learning, holistic self-development, it's all tied into this. It's all one system. It all has to begin with you. It all has to operate within your physiology and to feed back into it. So to come back to practicalities for you guys now, because I'm sure you guys want to take away some really good stuff. I mean, I've already given you some good tips, so pay attention. Recognize that wherever you are, that's exactly where you need to be. Recognize that whoever you are, that's exactly who you are right now. That doesn't mean that you cannot change. It doesn't mean that things will not change. But it does mean that you need to accept things as they are to begin, to accept yourself as you are to begin, physiologically, emotionally, energetically, to bring yourself home to yourself and start to say, it's okay that I am who I am. It's okay that this is what it is, because it's a big tendency for guys to beat themselves up and to make it hard on themselves, to be self-critical, to be judgmental, to be doubting and heavy, and to basically be putting a lot of shame on themselves as if they're not good enough. Why? Because it's a habit. It's a mindset. It's a habit of what they do to themselves. So one thing you can do, one of the biggest hacks that you can do, use your physiology to change your mind, because your physiology is related to your state. Now in the natural lifestyles, we talk about this idea, you don't want to be state-dependent. It's a very powerful thing to be aware of. At the same time, if you're coming from a baseline of a shit state, if you're coming from a baseline of a bad sense of self-worth, you don't know how to hold your posture well, you're not breathing well, you're not sleeping well, you're not taking care of your energy, you're not raising your vibration, you're not doing things that are basically good for you, then you're against the odds. You're working twice as hard to get the same result that the guy who's relaxed and appreciates himself and takes care of himself is doing. So in some sense, you don't want to be state-dependent, but you want to be working on assisting, raising, supporting, and creating positive states inside your life. This is part of lifestyle design as well, getting into flow states, understanding the mechanisms of flow states, understanding how to put all this together into one powerful package. And I see this all the time. It causes huge pain for guys. They're stuck in feelings, stuck in bad emotions, stuck in the same feedback loops. But I know this changes. I just finished a four-day workshop with a bunch of guys, and some of the most powerful feedback that I got after teaching them the techniques that I teach in things like the Black Dragon and the workshops that I do with the Natural Lifestyles, the biggest feedback is they say, I feel calm. I feel relaxed. I feel blank in this positive way that I can just be what I need to be. And they're surprised sometimes because they're not used to feeling so free. They're not used to feeling so strong. They're not used to feeling so relaxed inside themselves. And you can see it in their face. You can see it in their bodies. They become soft, yet focused. They become open, yet fierce. It's a powerful combination that's available. And once again, it's something that is not a new idea. It's not like I came up with this stuff. What I have done is taken the time to refine this into a very specific package for guys, exactly like you, that are trying to define and refine a particular kind of expression inside their life. Taking the best from martial arts, the best from meditation, the best from shamanism and mindsets and seduction and psychology and bringing it together into one package. Because that's what I love to share with guys. That's what I love to create and to explore myself and to give that to the world because I know this stuff works and it creates powerful changes very, very fast. Very, very fast. And that's what blows me away. I'm constantly fascinated with like, how much change can we create in the smallest amount of time? How much change is possible when you put the lever in the right place, when you apply the right technology? And the truth is, a lot. And it can be permanent. But you've got to want to change. You've got to want to show up. You've got to want to say yes to wanting to step into this world, to wanting to step into this kind of training, to find mentors, to find coaches, to find teachers. Don't sit on your fucking ass watching YouTube any more than you need to. By all means, watch videos. It's fantastic. Absolutely fill your brain with good data and good content. At the same time, get off your fucking ass and get out there and experience life. This beautiful experience. This life that's all around you. And hang out with people that are doing cool shit. One of my highest goals my whole life has been to hang out with cool people and to do things that I love, to be surrounded by good vibes and to be basically in a feedback loop of positive socialization and experiencing life to the fullest. And that's my wish for you guys, to find yourselves, to achieve your highest goals, to be surrounded by good people and to do the things that you really love. So my offer to you is to stay on this path. Check out the material that I'm offering you guys at the Way of the Black Dragon. You can come and check me out during the workshops. You can get to one of these workshops. They're a very, very powerful, life-changing opportunity. Or check out the products. Way of the Black Dragon coming out soon. You can check me out on my website, shaymatthews.com You can also check out my Insta, which is a liberated man. And let's stay in touch. I want to hear from you guys. Where are you guys at? What do you guys need? How can I help you? How can we grow together as a brotherhood? Because this is our time and we're creating our future. And it starts here in your body. With your breath, with your focus, with your intention, with the practices that you do on a daily basis and how you show up and relate to others. And that's the thing that's going to change the game for everybody. You're going to start showing up as a man of worth, a man of power, a man of freedom, a man of authenticity. And that's priceless. So thank you for paying attention, gentlemen. I'll see you in the next video. May all your dreams come true. This is The Shaman saying, Peace out. Peace out."}
