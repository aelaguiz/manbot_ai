Fun things. What? What's all this fun things that people didn't tell me about? What's the point of me living vicariously through my students if they just go, oh yeah, fun things? What's a fun thing? Tell me all about this thing that's fun. Kind of blows your mind really. Yeah. I mean, for anyone, right? Most guys, that's a thing they heard about a story and it must have been, he must have been a DJ. Must have been. Yeah, no, that never happened. Or he must have been the coolest dude in the world. No? Well, I mean, maybe, yeah. Pretty cool. Cool enough. Welcome to the Natural Lifestyles four-day residential. It's an absolute pleasure to have you all here. You all know me, presumably, I've been running this company since the beginning, since 2006 or seven or something like that. I'll be, you know, leading this workshop. Generally, what I'm going to be working on is embodiment, is a very functional street level meditation, right? So the types of awareness and meditation that means that you are able to actually be in the moment, be present, because that's vitally important with women, right? If you're scattered, you're off in your head, you're thinking five steps ahead, your body is betraying you in some kind of way with physical tension or with shaking and nervousness or many of the manifestations that come when you are physically nervous, then that's not going to assist you. And also it just makes it not very fun. Also, your embodiment, your posture, the way that you express physically, things like types of breathing, ways of walking, expressions, projections of intent, because I think you're probably all familiar with the idea of the five principles, which is kind of our overall map and framework for the seduction aspects of this course. And it's almost impossible to project very good intent if your brain's full of shit. If there's all sorts of white noise and tension, it's pretty hard to zap a girl with like raw sexual intent. So you need to be able to at least create enough space that you can communicate messages or sub-communicate messages without words, because that's often the juice that really gets seduction going. What's up, handsome gentlemen? Excited to be here back in Budapest teaching. You guys know me as well. I've been in the company for a very long time by now as well. Worked my way up, I guess. I know all the things that it takes to get from the introverted, analytical dude who I was and am, to the playboy or whatever now. Like you know, how to go for different stages, how to reframe a lot of things at the beginning, how to go from this stage to this, to the next, to this, and back and so on. So I am in a good position to help you with all of that, to get you from wherever you are to wherever you want to go next. And I do this in the real world by doing a lot of approaching, because I've done a lot of approaching myself, and I love it. And I want that you guys love it as well, because I'm still doing it after eight years, which is crazy, right? So I keep going, I keep improving my skills in the real world, and also in the virtual world I'm becoming really good at manifesting things from the online world into the real world. So I'm good at building an online persona, displaying a certain style, displaying a certain archetype to the ladies that I'm meeting in the real life, continuing seduction online, and getting them out on dates with a higher closing rate. Cool. Welcome, gentlemen. Great to see you guys. So time together with you this week is going to be an exciting adventure. So what I'm going to be working with is helping you with your identity, what's your story, where you're coming from, who do you think you are, how do you think the world works, some technical stuff, building a stack, who you think you are and how you can project that into the world. So working on what's the content, the skills, the sort of repertoire that you need to build over time. Obviously, that's going to be coming from lots of different directions from all of us. So I'll just be trying to keep an eye on what's happening for you in your mind, body, state, and your identity and how that's moving forward. And the third magic part of the scenario is obviously going out and having experiences, getting feedback, and in some sense being aware of the right kind of feedback, right? Because you can go out and have a lot of experiences, but those experiences could be framed in a less than positive way, less than useful way. So a big part of my job and all of our jobs is to try to help you to positively reframe this whole experience and also to, me in particular, what I really want to find is like what's going on behind your eyes, really. What's going on that's holding on to these limiting assumptions? So we can talk about things like limiting beliefs or limiting behaviors, et cetera, but it's very hard to shift anything inside yourself if your subconscious mind's not on side, right? So we want to try and get alignment with your identity, your skills, your experience, so we can put that all together. I look forward to sharing this week with you, getting to know you, becoming good friends with you, and finding the things that really make a difference in your life so that you can leave with some sense of new identity and magic and purpose and meaning in your life that's powerful. Particularly the four-day workshop, we don't have a lot of time and we've got a lot to pack in, right? So it's going to be moving at a very fast and quite intense pace because we're trying to kind of cram in the full methodology that we use theoretically and technically as well as practicing it basically at the same time, but we want to make sure you guys getting into decent interactions as much as possible to get you over that hump of not doing it, right? Because who has not been really regularly approaching girls prior to this? So if that wasn't a problem, you might not be here and I know a lot of the time that's the kind of the primary thing that guys feel like they need to get through is like that sense of fear or anxiety or like stasis that just you don't do it and you want us to make sure you do, which we will, right? There will be no escaping it. You will absolutely be doing that, but more likely than not, you'll probably find that once you get through that first, you know, seconds in the cold shower that that actually becomes not that hard, right? The getting yourself to do it or us booting you in the ass to make you do it until you can do it yourself is actually way easier than you might think, right? And all that's in your head. It's technically pretty easy to do that first bit and then all the other stuff that comes after that or in conjunction with that is kind of where it gets juicy and interesting. The internal game, the, you know, the reframing, the understanding your own, let's say social pathologies or things that have been holding you back in relation to the street, in relation to the women that you're meeting and then us micing you up and being able to listen in and give you extremely precise and individualized feedback. That's where you're going to be making your big compounding gains. And those are the things that you're, the advice and the techniques and the, you know, the feedback that you get from the coaches. That's what you will then take with you out of this after the four days and then continue to polish in your own time. Now we will be here to do absolutely everything that we can to make sure that you have momentum and you have more than enough tools to work with, you know, for a long time and more than enough tools to work on to actually get real results, right? You're not going to get every single supermodel that you look at on the street, I don't, but you will be able to get hot girls and girlfriends and lovers into your lives if you apply this stuff for as long as it takes to really, really install. Because four days is a, you know, this is a catalyst. This is a compression chamber where we will speed up your learning, possibly, you know, more than you would ever do otherwise. And if not, at least by years, we're going to be cutting out many of the dead ends and the mistakes and the limiting beliefs and the things that have been holding you back or the things you've been doing and not really getting the results you wanted because you're repeating the same mistakes over and over again. Because when, you know, you can see guys that do thousands of approaches and don't get anywhere because they're just doing the approaches better or they're just miscalibrated or there's some element that we look at and go, ah, that's obvious. We can, we can polish that up pretty quickly and then that saves you years of awkwardness and loneliness and dying alone and all that stuff that's not fair. Good day gents. Right now, I am offering free coaching calls with Alex Leon and Rayan. So if you'd like to take advantage of this, get on a call with one of the lads, have a chat about your current dating issues and create some pathways to making sure that 2024 is the year where you get this shit sorted, click the link below, book in. And there's only 10 free spots, so get moving. And now, back to the video. Expect that you will have all sorts of different internal emotional experiences. I don't want to like tell you what they will be because it'll be your own particular journey, but it's not unusual for guys to have, you know, mini meltdowns or to like get overwhelmed or to burst into tears or manic laughter or all sorts of reactions to being well outside your comfort zone. Put in, put in a pressurized container, which is supported, right? We don't throw you out into panic. We don't make you do, you know, completely insane stuff unless you want us to. You know, sometimes guys want to be pushed really hard in certain areas, but we are very experienced and skilled at knowing or figuring out pretty quickly where your edges are, right? What you can handle and what you think, maybe what you think you can handle and a bit more, right? And then to be able to also put on the brakes as needed. Okay. You know, we are not drill sergeants. We don't want to fuck around. We don't, I don't want to waste my time or your money, right? We make sure, and we put everything that we can into these workshops. We don't sit on the sidelines and go, yeah, just go and talk to your guy. What did she say? We're there with you every minute and pride ourselves on that. And so, yeah, you can expect that things will come up. It won't just be like, oh, I just need to, you know, get over that, you know, slight trepidation of talking, saying hi to a girl. Yeah, maybe that and some other stuff, you know, so other things can well definitely come up. And we are here for you, particularly me and Shay, and Shay, I would say as a specialist, have a lot of experience of dealing with men's trauma, men's anxieties, men breaking down in tears on the streets, you know, all sorts of stuff. Try and shock us if you can, unlikely. It's going to be really beneficial for you if you can be as raw, open, honest, and real with us as you can be, it's up to you to decide how much you want to share, but don't grin and bear it, right? Don't just try and power through things all the time. There will be times and places where it is, don't be a pussy, do the thing, right? But that's not the main message that we want to put out, right? It's like you're going through some kind of internal and external battles, and sometimes they become parties, and sometimes they become really fun, and other times it feels like work, and other times it feels like you really don't want to do it. Suddenly you're like, actually, I'll just change my mind. This chick's thing is not for me. And then you might enter flow states where it feels really natural, or it feels really easy, and all of those things and various other things may well happen. So the best thing you guys can do is to communicate with us. We're pretty good at reading people, but communicate on the go how you're feeling, and if you know how you need to be treated in those moments, we will accommodate that as long as it's not I've decided I want to go home, because I'm not going to let you go home. So the attitude you want to have from tomorrow is I'm looking for a girl to go out with tonight. Because if you go with attitude, some of you will be on dates tomorrow. I can almost guarantee that. Really take advantage of this space that we're in for these four days. Immerse yourself into this completely outside of any obligations that you absolutely must do. The rest of it, drop your usual distraction stuff with pornography, with YouTube, with being isolated, if that's things for you. You're here to be social for these four days, and you're here to grow, and you're here to push yourself, and you're here to meet women, right? We give a big shit about this job. There's all sorts of levels that we could do and get away with it, but we don't. We exhaust ourselves on these workshops typically, because we are highly invested in your change. This is our life's work, and this is something that we don't teach a lot of people. We teach a small amount of people really well. So anytime a coach is giving you something very specifically to you, it's not cookie cutter. He's just rattling off the thing he says to every person. He's very precisely listening, watching you, and giving you the feedback that you need. So please do take note, and even if it comes out a little bit on the abrupt side, it's for your own good. All right, so actually this is the last thing we need to do for the night, because we did it in reverse, and we did all the other stuff before, is to go around and introduce yourselves and say a little bit about what's going on for you. So the things I want you to hit is roughly why are you here, like what are the things that have not been functioning or that you're wanting to improve that have led you to choose to come and join this very select group of brave individuals that you are? Please keep that in mind. You're not like remedial humans. Most guys struggle with this and never ever get anywhere close to where they would like to be. It's a very tiny percentage of men who actually have the balls to face this. So congratulations on being brave enough of the millions of people, literally millions who watch us, to turn up here. Hello everybody. I'm Zeb. I am here because I really want to explore myself romantically, sexually, in a sphere that I've not had a lot of experience in. I've not had a lot of role models or sense of this. I didn't date in college, I didn't date in high school, and so I'm figuring this out as I go now as an adult, and I wanted to join a group of people who were in the same position looking to go through a transformative experience together and to learn some things that hopefully it can carry over to other aspects of my life. The crux of the problem, I think for me in this case, is that I do not approach women during the day. I'm kind of reliant on online dating and on meeting people maybe through social circle or through activities that I do. But those opportunities are few and far between and I don't feel like I have a lot of agency or choice in my life. So certainly one thing I'm looking forward to walking away with from this workshop is that ability to choose. I think that's something that you talk about a lot and that really speaks to me personally. In terms of measurable goals, I think just building the habit of approaching women every day, continue that for the rest of my life, or as long as I need to, I think is something that I would like to walk away with tangibly. Other goals I think are just being comfortable in my own head in that space and being able to sit in pressure-filled situations. And then concerns. I think that I'm a person who feels very enthusiastic about things before I do them, but when you get in the moment, a lot of thoughts, a lot of feelings can start to overwhelm you. So I think my major concern would be I don't quite take the risks that I want to and I don't quite commit in the full way that I would in life. a dispassionate, removed circumstance as when I'm in the moment. So hopefully we can work through some of that. Fuck yeah. My name is Zeb, I'm from Hawaii originally, and now I live in New York. I think since moving to New York about two years ago, one of my big goals for myself is just to become more social, to be able to explore connections in my life, be those friendships, romances, business opportunities. And I've been trying to do that on my own in New York, and it's been challenging and exciting and fun, but I was looking for a little bit of coaching, a little bit of assistance with that. I'm a big believer in getting help from experts in things that I'm quite not expert on. And though I feel like I've had some success, I really think that this is not only an opportunity for me to learn some new skills, but also for me to develop as a person and learn from some people who I admire and I've been following on the internet for a little while. For me, it's really the honesty that comes through with all of it. Like, everything that I see, you guys just seem genuine and true, and also kind of aligned with my core beliefs and philosophies. Whether it comes to meditation and awareness and being present, I think that that's not only a valuable skill for use and pickup, but also just being a human. It's kind of like a holistic self-development package, as opposed to a very targeted skill. I felt like it would be an opportunity for me to grow and learn as a person, as a man, as much more than just this one little area of my life. So that kind of resonance with just the energy. I think there is something to just feeling like you connect with people, even if you don't know them. The way they speak, the attitudes they have, everything that comes through in just the subtle interactions and the way information is presented in the videos. I think that that's something I resonated with. It built a sense of trust, and I was like, OK, I think that these guys know what they're doing. I am still very heavily reliant on online dating. That's a very big goal for me to overcome by doing something like this, is gaining confidence to be able to approach people both in the daytime in the street, and then also if I were to go out at night with a bunch of friends, to a bar, or even alone. I certainly have tried going out on my own or with friends at night, and sometimes it's more successful than others, but for the most part, I don't. So am I feeling nervous, intimidated? Yes. It's something that, that's the point of it, right? Is to feel that emotion, to roll with it, and to get through it anyways. And that's why I'm here. You know, on the one hand, you can have a lot of expectations for something that, like, you've invested a lot of mental energy in. I feel like I've spent a lot of time with TNL just watching videos and things over the past few months. And also you invest a considerable amount of effort, time, and money to be here. So expectations can be high. I'm trying to moderate those, because at the end of the day, this is four days. This is the start of a journey. This is certainly not a full arc. So what I'm looking for is some rapid skill improvement, just by getting a lot of practice under my belt, and also being able to, like, trying to stay open to learning, such that I can internalize some of the frameworks and principles that are going behind things, and that way I can carry that forward and continue to practice on my own. People who have really good mindsets in any realm, right? I mean, all of you have good mindsets in some areas of your life. You've succeeded enough to be still here and functioning and could afford this workshop, right? So there's areas where you have, let's say, even delusional mindsets that work positively, right? I can do this. I'm going to kick ass. Where's the proof of this? I'll just, I'll make it real, and then it becomes real. And very commonly with men, we make up all sorts of stories about how scary this is, how awful it's going to be, which then tends to mean that you don't take action, right? Because most people don't really want to run towards pain. Usually, we try to protect ourselves from all sorts of types of pain. When you perceive, you make an interpretation that this is going to be hard, that I don't like day game, that, you know, I'm full of dread, or any of these things, and I'm not coming down on anyone. I just want to draw your attention to the way that you're writing your own stories. We need to be really aware of that. So, if we can't necessarily go from, I think that I feel scared and anxious and not bad, not good. Trying to take a jump into, I'm the best at this and all the chicks love me, just intellectually tends to not work, right? Because then you're having a battle with yourself where you don't really believe the words you're saying to yourself, right? So, there's a bridge between those two things, those two extremes, which is an acquiescence, a relaxed, just acceptance of things as they are without putting labels upon them. It's a very unusual thing to bowl up to a stranger and try and start some kind of conversation and try and put your penis inside her later. It's not a normal thing to do. For me, it's pretty normal now. And so, my level of activation, I mean, I might get a little rise, like, oh, oh, I felt something. And occasionally I do, you know, if I've been on the farm for months and I come out and I'm very rusty, then, yeah, those sensations will be there. But I'd never perceive them as dread or particularly fear or anxiety because I know they're not now. Like, I empirically know that, for me, they are not. They're just like, oh, I know what's about to happen, more or less, the predictability of just walking down the street to get a coffee to the activation, and now I interpret it usually as an excitement because it means, oh, cool, something interesting is about to happen. And it is. I know that something more interesting than me just, you know, staring at the ground is about to happen. And I also know from my previous experience that something awesome could happen or something hilariously disastrous could happen and that I will absolutely survive whatever it is and it won't be a big deal because I've proven it to myself enough, more than enough times to know the truth. Where does the pain really come in? Feeling that you've lost something. Okay, yes, a feeling that you've lost something. Hang on a sec, on that one. So, yeah, well, did we lose something? Because we never had it, right? What did we have is we had a moment in time. And those are like, we can't lose that. It's there, it's like music. Like, you hear it, you experience it and it's gone. So, you know, the real-time experience was like I had a little moment with somebody and then our moments separated. So we didn't lose anything. We had a moment. And what did we gain is another thing to look at. Okay, you went and approached a girl and then you fumbled and then you dropped the ball. What did you gain from that? That you can do what part, let's say? Sure, okay. So you've gone and you've experienced something that you didn't want, that you were scared of and you survived, right? As with anyone, you know, any like pick one thing you've done in your life that was scary and you got past the fear of it. Someone. Public speaking in front of hundreds. Right. So prior to that, that was probably something that you were like, I could never do that or and then you did it and you're like, I couldn't, well, I did do it. But I could never, oh, I did. Yeah. In the initial stages of this building this skill set, you need to get like a hundred-ish approaches in to get a data spread that shows you more or less accurately where you're at, right? You guys are all science brained-ish sort of, right? Mostly? Anyone who's not? I've done a lot of empirical research actually. Like I met, you know, it's funny that guys are like, well, I went and did two approaches and then they didn't fuck me. So this doesn't work. Like that's not very science brained, mate. Yeah. That's a woman talking there, right? I did something I didn't like it. That means it's never going to work again. So we need to get enough reps that we see, okay, where you're at currently, this is the average results that you're going to receive. And then of course, you know, your data set, you repeat that, right? My first hundred is very different to my current hundred. Okay. So let's get a little physical. So I want you to move out. So you've got enough room to put your arms out without touching anyone. So elements of good posture. Firstly, you got to take up more room, especially you because I saw you arrive. Don't stand like this, men. We stand with our feet shoulder width at least apart. Put your arms down for now, but that's good. Okay, lock your knees. So straight knee. Now slightly unlock them until you feel your quads engage a bit. All right, because like elements of bad posture is basically if I lock my knees, it'll create a chain effect where it'll tilt my ass out. And then my neck will need to counterbalance, which means that now I'll have some kind of posture like this. This is exaggerated, but you get the idea. Which means that there's tension in base of my skull, down my neck, pressure in the spine and pressure in the knees. All the places we don't want pressure. That creates chronic fucktimus, I believe is the term. So instead, unlock the knees a little bit and then put your hand on the sacrum and other hand on the belly. And what you want to do is you want to tilt it just enough that the hand is flat and pointing directly to the ground and your abs engage a little bit. Okay, now let your head just and upper spine just kind of drop like you're a puppet that's just been kind of lowered. So you're loose and your head's just dropped like literally just floppy. Now bring your awareness to the base of your spine and move up your spine. And as you do imagine that you're elongating in between each vertebra. So slowly track and move up your spine and the head will be the last thing it lifts. Don't lift your shoulders, they're relaxed and loose and then you lift your head and you imagine that there's a thread just lifting you up like stretching you not like putting any tension. It's just like you're being lifted up a little. Okay, put your hands out to the sides and imagine someone's pulling you out pulling your fingers by the bones, right? So the meat is just hanging off the bones and it's the bones that are elongating and stretching and then lower your arms and leave the shoulders where they are. Just shake it out a little bit. Okay, roughly this is good posture. What's this got to do with talking to girls? Well, in order to be your sexiest self, you need to be embodied relaxed and sexy and we can try that on by putting on the mask and the appearance of like a man that is standing confidently or we can just learn how does our body mechanics work? How are we holding stress in different locations? How are we putting physical blocks in the way of being in flow? So, you know at the starts of these workshops, I like to get the guys embodied that is to get out of there just only in their brain thinking about stuff into the full body experience of like, okay, I'm a moving living organic being that is trying to communicate with people. So if I come up all stilted and thinking too much then immediately that comes across as stressed out or unconfident or weird or awkward. So it's really important that I can help the guys to just get into their body to learn how to relax, how to have upright but not rigid posture and to really experience the moment, right? Which is often put forward as a cliche being them be in the now. Well, how do you do that? This is some of the ways to do that by being observant of your breathing, of being able to change your breath, of being able to scan through your body and to relax it, of being able to elongate, stretch and to have better control over your movements. All of this stuff is a foundation so that when they then go out on the streets, they're feeling good, they're looking good and the ladies love it. You've all heard this be in the now and be present and all that shit, right? It's a cliche that means nothing if you think it. It's kind of worse than useless because you think you're being present when you're just thinking about being present. Yeah. Get out of your head into your body is how you get present. So we did that in a structured stretch routine. Like we could have been doing that whilst watching a podcast and worrying and we would have got the stretch, but we wouldn't have been getting into awareness, right? So generally most people find it much easier to meditate whilst moving than sitting on a cushion, which is also good. But this type of moving meditation, I want you to take this with you as we go out on the streets, right? As you're walking through the streets doing the thing with the coaches, feel your feet on the ground. Feel the breeze. Feel the touch of the sun. Look around and see the vibrancy of this pretty awesome city, right? Drink in the people, the hot girls, the interesting folks, the river, the Austro-Hungarian fucking castle over there that Orban's now chosen to keep as his private house because that's what happens in soft dictatorships. Keep returning to yourself throughout this workshop so you can view it as an infield in a game workshop as opposed to I'm in my head, I'm in my head and then I go into an approach and then I go back into my head. You're always going to be somewhere in your head. You know, there's going to be thoughts happening. We can't get rid of thoughts, but we can just redirect our limited focus away from them if they're not serving us and in the realm of seduction, it's not problem-solving. It's not analysis. We'll do analysis afterwards. There will be elements of analysis that happen throughout it. Your coaches will be analyzing. You'll think about things as you're deconstructing things, but when you're in the action, most of the time you want to be in creativity and improvisation. Improvisation and analysis are not the same thing. They don't really work together at the same time, right? There's all sorts of technologies, you know, different types of Qi Gong and breathing and stuff which I'll show you on the next session where it's kind of like intensifies it. It's like a hyperchamber of it, but it's like what's our choices? Like I'm at home and I'm thinking about this and then I'm like, I have to go and do the approach and I walk out in my bubble and then I go, you know, crack out of this chrysalis and go over and then I go, hi, I just saw you from over there and I thought you were cute. Oh, crack back in. Like that sucks and it's not practicing being social really. It's some strange insect that goes, yeah. No, right? That's not the best way to seduce. Although please do that for my entertainment. No, it's like I walk out the door. I lift my myself up, elongate my spine. I direct my eye line at the world, not down here, you know, furtively looking around. It's like I own this city. It's my playground is the attitude you should have. Not in an arrogant way. It's just like this is my lounge room. Hey, glad, welcome. Good to see you here. Hi, excuse me. This is a little forward. I don't even know you, but could I have your phone number? No, no, no, I totally understand. I'm a strange person. You don't know me. You don't know where I'm from. But I could have, could I have your phone number? No, it's totally get it. Totally get it. This is this is like really weird. This is really weird. And yeah, I like don't want to creep you out or or do anything weird. But can I have your number? No, no, you sure? You're triple sure? Okay, I've asked you three times. So you're very sure. Have a nice day. Okay, that was interesting. Because at first I was like, oh, this is gonna be bad."}
