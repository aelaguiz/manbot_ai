Top 10 experiences of my life. I'm a new woman. I feel like I need to bathe my soul after this. Now that sounds like you're being sarcastic because it sounds so good. Are you being serious? No, I'm not being sarcastic at all. I think my son left my body at some point. It was great, thank you. I should pay you. And I think that's where the real, the sensitivity and the art really comes in. It's much more than just like, you know, being a guy who can throw a girl around or being able to pound away and like, you know, make a girl come or something like that. Which I think is oftentimes where a lot of people are coming from because that's how they see it from the outside. But when you actually get on the inside, you realize it's so much more of an act of empathy, an act of intuitive response and leadership to different traits and qualities that are coming out in the interaction. So, what do you think about like the subtle side of this work, if you will? Like, because a lot of this is about really getting to know yourself and also getting to like really understand somebody on a deeper level rather than just sex, even though that's what's also happening. One of the big questions I get is what is it actually like to be a dominant when, you know, you have to be hyper aware. And for me personally, my experience is that I'm aware without thinking. And for me, that's my own form of meditation. So, yes, I am in complete control of what's going on. I'm thinking, but I'm not. It's a hard thing to kind of grasp if you've never really experienced this kind of flow state. But that's what I love out of it. And it shows me that, you know, I have the ability to lead and be compassionate at the same time. And the submissive definitely feels that. Yeah, that was when I first saw you doing scenes. So, I've seen you a number of times, you know, with a girl who really, really likes high impact and that you're running through a scene. And we did one of those a couple of days ago in this house for our select group of VIP clients who came to the Sex God Masterclass. And that was a, I mean, I think we can put some overlay of that whilst I'm talking. But essentially, it was a scene with two girls where you, like, created quite an interesting complex dynamic of... And, you know, it's kind of a sick premise that the daddy is teaching his daughter the family trade of BDSM. And then they bring in a slave and then he teaches her. And so, he has to punish his daughter into training on this other girl. Like, really awesome, like, dynamic. But interesting to watch those kinds of scenes is that certainly at times you get brutal, right? Like, you hit the girls. And this is obviously negotiated. And the girls like it. And you're grading it. So, it doesn't just go in there and just belt people. It's like it builds up. There's intensities that arise that as the person gets more aroused, they can take more impact and so on. So, you certainly see those, like, let's say savage or striking harsh elements. But there's probably more of the sensual side going on. And that's something that, like, especially if you've read a book like Fifty Shades of Grey, like, it's a bad representation of a dom. Or if you just see just the, like, okay, it's a guy looking stern hitting someone. Misunderstanding that I know for myself in my play with girls, yeah, I certainly do extreme things. But in watching you, for the most part, there's this sensual dominance. There's this, like, subtle interplay that Shea was mentioning before. There's this, like, moment by moment, like, micro adjustments. Feeling when a girl is reaching a limit or feeling when she suddenly becomes vulnerable and she needs to, you know, she needs care as opposed to force. So, maybe, like, talk a little bit about that in terms of how the sensual side comes into, let's say, into dominance and control. The sensual side gets heightened as it's a release from the pressure. So, in the scenes that I enjoy doing, I apply a bit of pressure, whether it be through pain, whether it be, you know, really guiding and directing the submissive in quite a stern way. And then the release comes with the sensual aspect. So, it's not just one way. And it's the contrast of the two which makes it such a yummy experience. Fuck yes. It certainly does. It is really a delicious thing. And it's, and paradoxically, it makes people very close. Like, the intimacy that you can get through taking someone through an ordeal in some ways where she's really tested and pushed to her limits and then soothed and relaxed and cared for and maybe that goes through waves. Like, comparing that to, you know, even when I was in love with a girl and we were, like, having quite, you know, lovey intimate sex, but there was still a lot that we didn't know about each other because we hadn't tested each other in these arenas. Well, with BDSM, you get to explore the entire range of human emotions and sensation. So, it's once you, you know, really explore both sides of the spectrum, whether it be pleasure and pain or force and, you know, freedom, whatever it may be, it just creates this special intimacy between the two people. Because it's like, we can go through all this together and look where we are. So, unfortunately, a lot of people in the vanilla world don't get to explore the shadowy aspects of their own nature, let alone their interplay. And then, unfortunately for them, what they say shun or fear ends up controlling them. And then on the female side, all of us have had, you know, consciously relating kind of kink relationships or love affairs or short-term flings or whatever. And it's very evident to see the powerful, often healing effect that it has on women. And it's kind of a bizarre situation to be put in, but where beautiful, coveted, desired women are thanking you from the bottom of their hearts. Like, literally, like I've done them the best, the most amazing favor or gift that they could ever receive. And very, very sincerely, because it's true. Because it's like, you know, a partner being able to explore with you her repressed desires. Maybe she needs to kind of resolve some traumatic event that may have happened to her. She just wants to, like, drop the facade of having to be a nice, good, sweet, virginal, innocent girl that she has to put forward to the world. And then with me or any of us, they get to drop all that because we don't judge them. Because even if we don't necessarily understand each of their desires, because I'm not her, but we can hold space for it. We can accept it. We don't judge it. And we will facilitate within our boundaries whatever it is that she wants to explore. And then at the end, even if we, during the play, we were playing with abusive language or, you know, calling her this or that and within, you know, negotiated bounds. When that's kind of sealed at the end or the scene is finished, she's looked after, she's praised, and she feels like a goddess because she is. And you become a god. Like, literally, in these plays, you can have that sense where you really are seeing the divine in each other, even if you are strung up by your toenails. So, it's like, I think for guys that most men that come to us have good intentions with women. They want to bring them pleasure as well as, of course, have their own pleasure. So, there is no dissonance there, which is hard to understand at first. But it's not like, if I have these desires inside me, that makes me, I have to like then, you know, become Darth Vader and go into the dark side. As opposed to, no, I can reconcile these parts myself and she can too. We can both get what we want and we can both heal from it. Like, it totally locks in with your identity or your value system as a good person. Maybe you can talk a little bit about some of the healing or some of the effects that this has on women, especially that women come and pay you to facilitate their desires. But it's not just about like the scene. You've told us many stories about how this changes the person and, you know, can sometimes help some get over lifelong traumas. A lot of women that have come to me, they've had these repressed desires. So, even the act of just exploring it for the first time is a massive healing experience. So, they've reconciled that what they've had burning deep inside them is actually okay. Because unfortunately, a lot of women in society are not encouraged with their sexuality. There's a lot of slut-shaming going on. There's a lot of misconceptions going on. And they feel that. They experience it really, really deeply. And unfortunately, a lot of the clients that come to see me are married. So, it's showing me that a lot of the husbands, you know, whether boyfriends, husbands or otherwise, are not really taking the time to understand them. So, essentially, the healing starts from being understood and having their desires acknowledged and saying, you're actually okay and normal for all of these things which excite you. So, how can something done in a healthy way that is exciting be unhealthy? Right. And I think that's an important takeaway for guys. Like, if you're with your lover or your partner or whatever, and if she brings up something, and often women will do it in a kind of a hinting way. So, she might not necessarily say, I want you to tie me up and, you know, dress me like a nun and tell me to say my Hail Marys whilst you whip me. Whatever the thing is. She might just be giving a little hint. Like, showing, you know, a meme or a picture or saying, oh, someone did this thing the other day and she might not say, I'm into that. And often what a woman is doing is she's kind of sounding you out. And I've heard many stories from women where they're like, oh, yeah, I wanted to try some stuff with my boyfriend. And then I said, oh, you know, I hinted in some way and he went, oh, that's weird. Or that's pretty freaky. Some way judged the act or judged her for, well, that's the kind of thing you're into, huh? Like, anything like that, you're just going to shut her, you're shutting her sexuality down because she realizes, okay, this is not safe for me to explore. Because the consequences could be very destructive to my self-esteem, to my reputation, to this relationship. So, as a man who wants to be, you know, an evolved sexual being, allowing space for women to just have those desires, even if you don't understand them or they're not yours, will go a long way to her then starting to open up more and reveal more of this rich and dense and juicy world, which benefits the man incredibly. I mean, we get huge amounts out of this, right? It's like, it's not all just a, we're not just martyrs to the desires of women. You know, when a woman feels wildly expressive and not judged, then she'll do all sorts of crazy stuff that she won't do with another guy.
