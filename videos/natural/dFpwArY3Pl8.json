The reason why it's special is because I show you guys my thing that I do when I'm talking to women, which is I fill into where they are based on how much clarity they're using, based on how much they're moving, the clarity of how they move, and I allow myself to be completely matched to that. Because what you'll notice is that once you start to meet a lot of women, many women will be giving you different things, and the style of seduction that they like tends to be very different according to women. So see if you can catch the moment in this where I just completely become quiet and I settle into the moment with her, and you'll notice that it's very easy and it goes completely natural. So I'll see you guys on the other side, I'm out. Hello. Hi. Did you see me walk past you? Yeah. Yes, I thought you were so pretty that I had to run you down the street like a maniac and come say hello. Thank you. Yes, I know this is not the most comfortable thing to do or to be in for you. No, I mean props to you. But I'm Anthony. Hi. Hi. Nice to meet you. What's going on? You seem like you're in a very I-don't-want-anybody-to-bother-me zone. Oh, no. No, you're fine. I was just very going to my car. Oh, okay. That's why. To go meet my friends. I love you. Okay. Well, I know you're going to go meet your friends, but now that a guy's in front of you and he wants to get to know you, are you in college? I'm actually in law school. You like it? What? You like it? It's fine. It's hard. So the answer is no. Yes, I love it. Yeah, but what about you? No, I actually don't live here. Oh, really? Okay, are you from Illinois then? No, not from Illinois. You thought I was here for the game? Well, I don't know why I thought that. Yeah, well, I'm not wearing any badges though. You obviously look like you're in college. Yeah. You look like you're in college though. You do. Yeah, I know. But my shoes are red just like yours, so you could have said I was a badger as well. There you go. You're going to support us. I really appreciate that. No, I'm not from Illinois. I'm actually from here, but I've moved away. Oh. But now I'm back for a little bit, so. For what? Until January. Oh, but I have family here. Oh, okay. Gotcha. It's a good place to be. Yeah. What are your plans for tonight? I think I'm going to go out, but I'm scared that everybody's going to be drunk already because everybody's been drinking since earlier. No, I know. I just got back from the library, so I'm sure my friend's extremely drunk. But what are you going to do? Are you always in that situation? What? Where your friends are drunk and you're the one that's sober? Actually, this is the first home game that I haven't tailgated this season. But I have a lot due next week, so I had to get some stuff done. It tortured me, especially because it's homecoming. But what are you going to do? School has to come first sometimes, you guys. Hey. How are you? Good. Where's your car at? Because I don't want to walk you all the way there because you're going to think I'm going to get in with you and I'm not. It's by the Capitol. It's way up there? Yeah. Ah, okay. Well, I'll walk with you for one more block because I like your energy so far. Oh, thank you. Yeah, you seem lovely. It's nice to know I have any after the day I'm at. So, what have you been doing all day? You didn't watch the game, I'm assuming. No, I didn't. Are you mad at me? No. Oh, my God. We were killing him anyways. It wouldn't have been that exciting. So, what have you been doing? What have I been doing? Yeah. I've been listening to people sing. Nice. Like over here? That's entertaining. No, no. Do you know who Piano Guys are? No. You don't? Oh, it's a sensational YouTube band, I think. Oh. Actually, it's a green light. I don't want to get killed. Hold on one moment. Oh, dang. Sorry, I'm so used to it. Yeah, just following the crowd. Yeah, that and just walking. Oh, my God. You're like the sheep that everybody say, don't do it and you follow the crowd. It's a college student. People are used to it, I think. But, yeah, no, I normally don't walk before I cross. Are you well-known here? Oh, no. I went to undergrad here, too, actually. I'm from here. You're lying. No, I'm not lying. You just saw somebody and said hello. Oh, yeah. Well, Luke and I have mutual friends. A lot of people who went here stayed here. Midwest has a way of doing that to people. You fell into the trap. I did. I escaped for two years and then I came back. Where did you escape to? Texas. How is Texas different? I've actually never been to Texas. Austin is the greatest city you will ever go. I am very obsessed with it. It's like Madison, just a lot bigger. A lot more to do. A lot more places to see. What's the memory that sticks out the most for you? ACL. Have you heard of ACL? No. Oh, yeah, on your knee. What? ACL? No, it's a music festival. Oh, okay. So, yeah, it was really fun. Okay. There must be craziness that you remember from that. What? Craziness from that. Yeah, well, I mean, it's like thousands of people. And I saw Drake. And I saw Queen and Pilots. And Washington. Lots of different people. And I saw Drake. Yeah, I actually am not used to Drake yet. But I did know most of the songs. I was impressed with my songs. So you have some hip to you. I'm a huge country fan. Oh, you are? Yeah. That's mostly what I listen to. But I think if you're going to any concert live, it's a good experience. I'm actually... You know I've actually never really been to a concert and seen somebody I wanted to see? Oh, oh. You know that? What? I've never actually been to a concert and seen somebody I wanted to see? Like, my favorite artist is Chris Brown. But I've never been to a Chris Brown concert ever in my life. Is he still performing? Yeah. You sound like he's old. He's only 27, I think. I know, I know, I know, I know. He's not that old. But I haven't heard anything from him in a very long time. But I also don't really love him, so... Middle school. That's the last time I remember hearing anything from him. Oh my god, how old are you? I'm really old. I'm 24. Aw, I'm 25, I'm older than you. You said like you were so old, I thought you were going to say I'm 28. I'm like, oh my god, you are old. I don't know, I don't know. How old did you think I was? 25? I don't know. I should have said some big number. I don't know why I was so nice. 50? Yeah, I should have said 37 or something. Like, actually... Judging by how long this coat is and those rolled up pants... Definitely 57. Definitely 27. 27. You're like, uh... I'm off work. I'm kidding. Hey, that's not an insult. You're like, I love the mom off work look. That's the sexiest look I can come up with. Oh my god. What is your name? Ariel? Yeah, it's Ariel, I forgot. Do you remember mine? No, I forgot yours. Yeah, it's good. We were so deep in conversation, we totally forgot. I'm really bad with names. Yeah? What is it? Anthony. Anthony? Yeah, Ariel. I know they ask. Well, we've walked long enough. We chatted long enough. Now this is the critical moment for me to ask you, would you like to have a coffee another time? Would I what? Would you like to go for a coffee another time? How about I give you my number, you can text me. And no promises, that's what it sounds like. No promises. I knew it. How about I give you my number and you can text me. Mostly because I don't have time. Okay, let's stop here. I do have coffee, please. Yeah, let's stop here. Oh, we can get a coffee now. Oh, very convenient. I would, but I have to go meet my friends. It is convenient. We're standing right here. If I didn't have to meet my friends, I would. Tell them that you have to go to the bathroom. Just tell them that. Very convenient. It might take a while, so don't be alarmed. Yeah. You want to get a coffee now? I truly can't. I guess the only thing we can do is just do a number. Okay. I guess I'll settle for that. You can tell your friends, you know what, I have to go to the bathroom. That could have just been a reason. You know, if I wasn't meeting your parents too. What do you know about me? What do I know about you? I know that your name is Anthony. What else? I know that you've got family in town. I'm trying to see. Do you know the person that's getting your number? Well, that's probably a good thing to know. You seem nice. Yeah. Maybe I'm too trusting. Should I not give it? Yeah, don't. Are you a crazy serial killer? I'm only the serial killer that you don't hear about. So that's perfect. That's good for you. You're not getting caught. I know, I don't get caught ever. I only go with girls who wear red, so this is perfect. Well, you'll find a lot today. I know, so many victims. God, this is going a weird way. It's so weird. It's so bad, I love it. That's the only reason why I said that. Is it 608? It is. Did I spell your name right? Not even close. Who fought as that? Who fought as that? EL? Is this right? The 608 number? 335. Do you approve of my victimizing ways? Yeah. Great, that's great. I think you have a good technique. What do I do? You just snap them off the street? All the girls with red. Let me know how it goes. Yeah, no, I'm going to snap another girl off the street. Actually, don't. I don't want to know. I don't want to know. Keep me out of it. Keep me out of it. Alright, and then the last thing that I do is that I give them a hug, and then I whisper in their ear and say, we're shit. I'm kidding, I'm kidding. God, you scared me. Alright, see you. Bye bye. Bye. Bye. Bye."}
