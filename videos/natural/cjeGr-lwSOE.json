Over the last few years, I've made a lot of great strides in making deep and consistent changes in my patterns of behavior and discovered a path to follow. As a result, I've been much happier, and several women have started acting very positively towards and around me. Thank you for that. Well done to you for actually doing it. Slightly less than a year ago, I moved abroad, and recently my father, who I have a good relationship, came to visit me. During that time spent together with him, I've experienced a huge fallback into old patterns of behavior, being shy or more submissive, being less present than I've been for months. I would like your take on the specificity of returning to the old habits and ask how to make changes persist. All right. Yeah, that was a great question, very well thought out and put together. I think generally what you're sort of asking is something along the lines of why is it that I made these changes in my life and everything was going great, and then my dad shows up and all of a sudden stuff starts to go backwards and I just find myself being the same kind of old guy that I was before all this stuff. Well, one teacher said once that if you want to find out how much progress you've made, go and spend a weekend with your parents. But the thing to say with that which is good to make sense of the context or the situation is that the reason why that happens is because you have, as I said before, invested interests, identities, attachments, aspects of yourself that are related to this relationship with your father, for example. And keep in mind when we say father, it doesn't have to be father. It could be mother, it could be peer group, it could be authority figure, it could be religion, it could be society. So we have these vested interests in these identifications with things. And the truth is, I mean, your father's a very pinnacle, sorry, not pinnacle, your father is a very pivotal person in your life that's been around for a long time. And part of that is that there's identities that you're invested in being around him because he has identities that he has as the father that he wants to experience with you. So it's almost like this kind of father-son dynamic that happens in this situation is a kind of a role play of identities. And what it comes down to really is like how identified are you with that role play? And it's not necessarily good or a bad thing. And I mean, honestly, some of these things are really hard to break. I mean, when we really look at our deep level relationships, and especially with people like our family, they can be some of the hardest things to deal with. But they can also be some of the best opportunities to see how we are identifying and how we are creating our attachments to certain things. So like I said, if you can understand that, you know, there is this dynamic of this role play happening between father and son, or, you know, whatever it is, subject and authority figure or whatever we're talking about here, then you can start to realize that it's about understanding like, how are you tied to that? How are you invested in that? And how can you detach from that? And also the question is like, what are the costs of doing that? Because for example, a part of the reason why you go back to being, you know, boyish or into your old patterns, etc, when you're around your father is because there is probably an aspect of your identity and your unconscious mind that doesn't want to be like this kind of, you know, big man who's like, yeah, I'll do whatever I want now, Dad, thanks very much or whatever, because that might change the whole dynamic of your relationship. So in a way, if you've been conditioned over a lifetime that my relationship with my father is me acting this way and him acting this way. So for us to share love or whatever it is for us to share this, you know, relationship of, you know, father, son, I have to be this, I have to do this thing. So yet again, it's not to say that it's not possible to change, it's just something you need to be conscious of and start to untangle your identifications, your attachments. And aspects of doing that is like become aware of how you do that. It is can be hard to especially with parents, for example, and this goes for peer group very much so as well. Something that we talk a lot about in workshops is, you know, how do you adjust and integrate into your life after you've had these big shifts? And something that is a reoccurring theme is that you need to negotiate your identity, you need to negotiate your new position. And part of that is just showing up as that, like owning it. Once again, like I said before, it's Jamie's famous quote, you know, make no apology, take full responsibility. So own who you are and go for what you want. And with your parents, that is a bit tricky, but it's still got to start with, this is who I am, this is what I'm doing, this is what I believe in, this is where I'm going, this is what's important to me. And you know, I don't want to hurt you, but this is what I really need to do for the betterment of myself. So I hope you understand that. And maybe there's actual conversations that need to happen to help solidify that and to reset boundaries and change those things. Maybe that won't help. Maybe it's just showing up in your action over time. Or maybe it's also a very difficult choice that you need to make sometimes, which is that the boundary conditions of your relationship to these people that you have around you, including your family, may require that you create distance and space and a different opportunity for yourself away from them, okay? Because it really can be a huge trap in terms of like, making yourself into a lesser human being to satisfy the people around you that you love, which, you know, is understandable, but nonetheless is costing you time, it's costing you opportunities, it's costing you the things you really want to do inside your life. So you need to make a very clear choice from your understanding that if you really want to invest in these choices and creating a different lifestyle and being who you want to be, that that may require that you remove yourself and reset your whole world around really establishing this. And the truth is, over time, he will recognize that. He will start to come into the knowing. It's like, oh, my son is now a man. He's his own man and he does his own thing in his own life. And therefore, part of that is he does this weird lifestyle thing, whatever it is. He has multiple girlfriends or, you know, and he might have resistance to that depending on his program. He might be the opposite. He might be like, that's my boy. So it depends on his conditioning and his perspective of the situation. So I hope that's useful. I hope that's helpful. And I'll see you in the next video. "}
