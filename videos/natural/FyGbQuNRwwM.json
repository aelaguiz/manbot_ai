Well, if you're in the first group of men, let me tell you, let me be the guy who gives you the honest truth, who gives you the honest raw feedback, it is not okay, bro. It is not okay if you go for such a long period of time without being sexually active. Of course, there's times of intense focus of work, of projects, of getting stuff done, of monk mode. And you know, I love monk mode more than anyone, where I lock myself in a villa with other guys and just work on my projects, no women for five, six weeks. But this has nothing to do with just not getting laid for 90 days or more, 180 days, 365 days. Months, years go by without you doing what you should be doing as a man, which is being sexually active. And of course, nobody talks about this with you because sex is a taboo topic. Obviously, at family reunions, you will not bring up how long you didn't get laid for. Your grandmother will maybe ask you if you have a girlfriend or not, but not if you're getting laid. And your friends, even though they might know that you're not getting laid, they're not gonna call you out on that. So let me be the guy who calls you out on it. Bro, you need to change something about that. Let's first ask ourselves, how did this happen? How did this dry spell even happen? And you know, obviously, your environment plays a part. Your friends don't get laid or they have a long-term girlfriend already. You don't have that many friends in general. You don't have female friends. You are not in social circles where new women come into. You don't talk about it much. You don't have a very high social life. And in general, you just lower your standards more and more if you want to get laid. Because the only way of meeting women now for you is probably apps like Tinder. And if you've used Tinder for more than a year, you just know it consistently gets harder to, first of all, get any girls on there and to get hot girls. So the only way to get laid off dating apps, if you're not in the top 2% of men, is just to consistently lower your standard up to a point where you just like rather not sleep with any girl than taking what you can get off these apps. The main reason, though, is you don't have a consistent way of meeting women. You, as I mentioned, don't have a social circle. You're not approaching women during the day. You're not going out. Maybe you're not a club guy. You don't want to go out. You don't want to get drunk, which I totally understand. Me neither. But if you don't have any way of manifesting new women into your life on a consistent basis, well, how are you going to expect to get laid eventually? Of course not. There's no traffic. How are you going to expect selling product if you don't have a storefront or a website? How do you expect to get laid if you don't meet any ladies in the first place? Also, probably you're full of excuses. I'm busy. I'm working on this project. I'm not that into sex anyway. You know, all these sex addicts, they're overrating it. Women are evil. You know, I'm preserving my energy for a wife. Blah, blah, blah. It's all this bullshit that just comes up after you realize, damn, getting laid is kind of hard. I'm not good at it. I don't know how to meet women. I'm too afraid to approach. I hate clubs. I don't get any results on Tinder. How can I protect my ego and tell myself that it's okay to not be sexually active for multiple months or years? Oh, yeah, I'll just blame it on I'm so productive. I'm so into focus, you know, I'm so creative and I'm writing a book actually right now, and it really takes all my focus. Therefore, I cannot here and there have some fun or have sex or, you know, spend some nice hours with a lady. It's bullshit, bro. You can do both. You know why? Because I'm doing both. I'm managing a lot of stuff. I'm managing multiple projects and I still find time to have hours with the ladies. You don't have to become a lazy slob. That's the other problem. A lot of guys, you know, they get a girlfriend. I get it. And then they stop showing up to social events. They stop, you know, going to soccer practice. They stop doing sports. They go less to the gym because they're constantly with their girlfriend. All they do is like work in their nine to five job and then spending time with their girlfriend. You don't have to do that. You can just have a lover, see her two times a week for three hours each. Have a great time. Eat some food. Watch a cool show. Have sex and then say goodbye. I'm going back to work. Because really, bro, think about it. Maybe you're in your 20s now. Maybe you're in your 30s now. Maybe you're watching this in your 40s. Imagine going a year without sex, which is not that uncommon anymore. Or let's say you go a year without good sex. OK, maybe you had a sloppy handjob from a girl from Tinder. Maybe you went home with some drunk chick or you had an escort prostitute type of situation. But I don't want to count that. I mean, good sex, a girl you were into, a girl who was into you. How long did you not have that? And let's say it's been a year. How many blocks of one year you have in your 20s? How many blocks of one year you have in your 30s? Especially when you are single, when you can experiment stuff, when you can, you know, try out different things. You're going to get into certain relationships at some point. Are they going to be that good if you're so inexperienced? That's a topic for another video. But just think about how valuable one year of your young adult life is. One year could be whatever you have left. 5%, 10%, 20% of what you have remaining in your masculine prime. It's not a lot, right? Each year is very valuable. Please don't waste your prime. Nobody's going to give it back to you. If you are so focused on projects, so focused on money, so focused on networking or your body, let me tell you two things. First of all, you can make money later. I'm not against making money. I'm not against getting fit. I'm just against the notion of that all of your energy needs to go only in that and you need to block out women. You need to block out sexuality. That's not how it works, first of all. Secondly, being more social, being the kind of guy who does manifest hot girls, being the kind of guy who can get laid, who is surrounded by women will help you building a body, being more interesting for your male dudes, being better at projects, actually being more focused at work because you're not constantly like getting distracted with porn or other weird fantasy thoughts and so on. So please don't waste your prime years is my ask to you. And then the question is, well, okay, Alex, you're so cool. You got these girls, da-da-da, thank you. Where do you start? Okay, fair question. In my opinion, you need to overcome the anxiety or the resistance of approaching women during the day. You have to be able to approach a girl and give her a compliment when you see her on your way to work, on your way getting a coffee, on your way getting groceries, on your lunch break, or you're waiting for your friend and your friend is 10 minutes late and then the woman walks past. Like imagine, imagine you're waiting on a park bench for your buddy. There's this woman in a red dress and she walks past and she even looks at you and you look back and you maybe even smiles, right? It doesn't happen that often, but damn, what an invitation from the universe. And you think, damn, this would be so easy. I could just walk up and stop her and say, hell, excuse me. I really think you look great in that dress. I just wanted to tell you that. And she blushes and she smiles and she's like, oh my God, thank you. This is so nice of you. What's your name? And you say, my name is Tom. What's your name? My name is Sandra. Wow, nice to meet you. You're on your way to work? Oh no, I'm meeting a friend. Oh yeah, I'm meeting a friend too. That's cool. You live around here? Yeah, I moved here like a year ago. Oh sweet, you like it? Yeah, I love this area. Cool, well, what are you into? Da, da, da. You have a little bit of a conversation. You get to know her. Mainly the vibe is good because you're comfortable, you're relaxed and you take her number. It's that easy. And then you meet her for a coffee the next day and then you maybe make out with her or you don't. And you meet her again and you take her home or you don't. But imagine just being in the vibe of doing that. Imagine doing that on average five times a week. Is that so much to ask? That's like three minute conversations five times a week. And imagine what meeting 300 new women a year like that would do to your sex life, to your social life, to your confidence, to your testosterone levels, all that stuff. I need you to be more social, bro. I need you to go out more, say hi more, open people more and say hi to women and giving them direct, honest compliments. If you don't know how to do that, you can book a call below. I want to help you. Book a free discovery call with me or my team and share where you're currently at, where you want to get to and we see if we can help you or not, right? I want to work with people who want to work with me and that I can truly help. Again, if you didn't have sex for more than three months, it's not okay. And you have to do something about it. And it comes from the heart. I'm not angry at you, but I will be angry if you watch this video and you agree with me and you're not taking any action. Then I get pissed. So don't make me pissed. All right, see you in the next video.
