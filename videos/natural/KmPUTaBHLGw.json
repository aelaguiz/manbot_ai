Okay, so you got a job or you've got a reason You have to be in one place Firstly look at like is it the right place in the longer term? I don't I'm not sure if we talked about this a lot but Many cities in the world suck for many reasons, but socially many many many cities suck, right? they have too many guys like the west coast of America in places like San Fran and and Colorado and stuff have a lot more men than women because there's a lot more blue-collar jobs and various tech tech stuff Whereas New York has a lot more women than men and a lot of gay guys, which are basically out of the game Anyway, so that's great you know cosmopolitan cities over 200,000 or Like more the best sized cities are about a million people that have a tight compact city center places like Budapest Belgrade Barcelona is bigger, but it has a has those kinds of elements In Melbourne is much bigger, but it has those elements as well so it can be 1 to 4 million but it needs to have centralized areas where people walk around if you want to have and where there's a bar area and when there's a Music scene and where there's an artistic scene or a gallery scene or restaurants So, you know, it needs to have an life going on if it's a totally suburban out in the middle of nowhere family-friendly retiree type of city it has limitations and A lot of people are really attached to their location even when it's shit. I Impress upon you that the those who will inherit this earth are those who are willing to move move around it because this earth is Not static no more Cities, you know crumble within a generation You've seen you know, you guys have all seen that recently places go up in flames economies tank Demographics change and I'm ready and willing to move where the action is until the point where you get to where I am I'm finally at the point where I can say still and the world will come to me as it is right in half an hour's time It comes to me now because I've built enough that I can choose to step out of the the city life for some time anyway, and still yield results, so Thinking longer term. Okay, maybe you're living in your city now and it's where you are. You've got your job You're doing your studies, whatever. You can't leave right now But when could you leave and why why not if the city is awesome? Okay, let's milk it and make Awesome life in the city if the city is shit because it has no bars No nightlife scene too many men. It's a mining town. It's only a faith. You know, most the average age is 45 plus Look at it and be realistic. There are systemic limitations to this environment You should move within 6 to 12 months from that place, even if it's a short-term thing Yeah to test if you've never lived in another city You have to like from my perspective if I'm to get if you want to listen to any of my advice try a different fucking city I've moved cities a dozen times now and each time I've learned something different I and some it like well, I was brought up in Canberra Australia, which is a fuck cunt of a place boring sterile conservative fucking unimaginative Nice place to retire. All right, if I'd stayed there my life would fucking suck my life would fucking suck there was there's only there's very little I could it like I Just thinking about it makes me want to cry and feel well, I'm like, oh no, there's a timeline where I didn't leave I Had to leave because I wanted to play music So I had to go where the music was or I wanted to pick up chicks I had to go where the hot chicks were or I wanted to live a vivacious interesting life with interesting people So I had to go there and so on Please do think about this over time Okay, I know sometimes you can't afford to do it right now You have to finish this thing, but if it's family obligation or if it's like, oh, well, you know, it's this is you know It's an easy place to be or maybe I'll take over the family business or you know Maybe I'll buy a house in this fourth-tier city that no one's ever heard of and Have a mortgage there for my the rest of my life for what know what reason I? Would be looking at the globe. There's a lot more options out there What up gents? I look bleary. I don't know. Yeah, I'm just in transit between Ukraine and Hungary today keeping my internationalist lifestyle alive even in the midst of this ongoing pandemic and lockdowns because For those who dare and those who are willing to stretch themselves and step outside the box. It's still possible So I hope this was this video was a little bit of a wake-up call Perhaps you're thinking about how you can improve your lifestyle your dating career opportunities But it is really important that you consider are there systemic limitations to the location that you're in because so many cities a Fucking sock and then I'm about to go to one that really doesn't so if you'd like to join me on the LDA adventure Coming up very soon. It's very soon.
