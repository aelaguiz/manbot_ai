Have a great day and I'm glad you like this, this city. It's a beautiful city you live in. Maybe I'll move here for a while. Hey! Hi. Can I walk with you a second? No, I go to my boyfriend. Okay, see you. You look really good and I wanted to stop you. Thank you. So, can I walk with you 30 seconds? I won't stay here forever. I'm going to meet my boyfriend, sorry. Sure you are. Okay, bye bye. Hey. Hi. Hi. I was just standing there with my friends and you walked by looking beautiful as hell. Well, thank you. And I thought I'd run up to you. Well, hi. So, are you looking for something in particular in the shops or just looking around? Good question. Just looking around, I think. Maybe a jacket, I don't know. It's hard. I mean, not a heavy jacket. No, no, no. Just hanging around. I hope I won't need a heavy jacket soon. It's funny because it was actually supposed to rain when I booked the flight. Yeah, it was supposed to rain the whole week. Yeah, and I was like, please. One week a year I have. But it rains. I feel like it will rain every single day, but then here we are. I hope tonight it won't rain. And tomorrow. And never. Why? What are you planning to do tonight? A few of my friends, international friends, are also coming. So, we plan to go out somewhere. Nice. How did you meet the friends? They were studying here. They studied veterinary. A lot of people come here to study veterinary. It's cheaper, I guess. Veterinary, like on pets? Like vets, like animal doctors. One of them didn't finish school and didn't like it, so she moved back home. So now she's here visiting. It's hard sometimes to do stuff outside of home. Like if you've been used to it your whole life. Yeah. I know that feeling. I'd really like to continue talking. Maybe if I can catch up to you tonight. When you go away from your friends. Yeah, you can catch up. Maybe I'll be busy tonight. But when you finish, I can text you or you can text me. And we can meet up. So, I'll take your number. So, you're going out partying and drinking hard tonight? Yeah, and maybe tomorrow as well. People were actually in the street yesterday, already partying. So, I don't know. I don't know. Okay. People were actually in the street yesterday, already partying. Was it a party? Like, not full on party, but they were pretty into it. And they were drunk as hell. I think it's... This is my number. And my name is Sofia. I'm Andrea, by the way. Nice to meet you. I think it's before exam period, so everyone is going crazy. Shouldn't they be at home studying? Well, this is my last semester. So, I don't have that many exams. Okay. But seriously, you're really friendly. And thank you for talking this long. You're really brave. I was surprised. Thank you. Bye. That felt good. My story started at the end of high school. We went to Mykonos, a Greek island. A girl I really liked, who was my best friend for 13 years. And she went with my best friend at the time. This coat. That looks really stylish. As well as... I don't know the English word for it. But fine. Fine. Do you know fine? Yeah. So... I want to introduce myself to you. My name is Michael. Danda. Danda? Yeah. So, Danda, what are you doing on this beautiful day here? On a Saturday? I'm going to a cafe. A cafe with my boyfriend. With your boyfriend? And then to Mexico. Spanish festival. Near the parliament. I haven't been there. I've only been here a few days in the city. But that sounds like a good thing to check out. I was going to say, let's go together. But you're going with your boyfriend. And he probably wouldn't like that. So it was great meeting you. Enjoy your day. Your boyfriend is very lucky. Thank you. This coat. Like, come on. You don't care about the coat matching or something. It's like, she's an elegant pretty girl with freckles. That's what I'd say. Oh, stop. You're an elegant pretty girl with freckles. Right? It's like, okay, I'm attracted to you as a woman. That's why I'm speaking to you. And with your intention. As opposed to deflecting your intention. Going, oh, the clothes look nice and something. That all relates to your core issue of diffusing your sexuality. Well, I'll stop for a minute. You look great today. What's your name? It can be that simple. But it's like with clear intention. Knock, knock. Knock, knock. Knock, knock. Knock, knock. Yeah, because you're very confident. Yeah. I know. I understand you're a bit insecure speaking English. But other than that, it's really comfortable talking to you. Thank you. You have beautiful lips. Oh, thank you. What James was talking about with the intent. That comes automatically if you draw your attention to your cock and balls. Which I never did because I was ashamed of it. That's something I'm not supposed to feel. I'm supposed to hide. That was my program that I was running. And putting my attention there. Then I don't even have to express it in words. I can just look at the woman. Wow. And she can feel it. The feedback is so helpful. So spot on. When I go back into my life, it's like being responsive. That's such an important key. Really being with the women. Seeing where she's at. And responding to that. It's so simple on the one hand. But on the other hand, it's like, wow. I feel like most men are simply not doing that. In order to be really responsive, the whole meditation and the presence is just the prerequisite. That's what you need. Now I see how the whole course plays out. And how the whole meditation plays out here in the field. Being with women. Basically every woman I've talked to. I think 80-90 women in the past few days. It's crazy. Now when I'm with the women, it's pretty easy for me to be in the moment. To be present with the moment. Sometimes women have pointed it out to me. When I say I'm doing this meditation, they say, yeah. I can feel that you're with me. It's a game changer. I just saw you walking here. And you're extremely elegant. Thank you. I had to tell you that. Very nice. Thank you. My name is Michael, by the way. Lisa. Lisa? So what are you doing on this beautiful day? Walking. To a castle. So are you a tourist here or do you live in Budapest? No, Russia. Oh, from Russia. Where is that? Where in Russia? Where in Russia are you from? Where? In Russia? Moscow? Moscow. So how long is your vacation here? Yes, vacation. Nice. I understand. That's the only line I know in Russia. What? That's the only line I know in the Russian language. I understand. So I'm just going to walk you for a little bit. I have to leave soon. You are living here? No, I live in Berlin. I think Berlin is a very good place to live. Maybe not so good for tourists. But I heard that it's one of the best places. Oh, yeah? What did you hear? It's comfortable. Especially for young people. Multicultural. Your English is good for traveling, right? Yes, but not more than traveling. I know that it's not very good. It's just enough to ask where to go and something else. But that's awesome. You can have a conversation with a stranger pretty well. I want to show you this building here. This is the castle? This is the castle. I have not been there. But I was told it is very good. And I'm here until next Wednesday. And I want to go there. Now? No, I'm going there on Tuesday, maybe. On Monday, when I'm off. Ah, you're working now. I'm here on a workshop. And I'm having my break now. I thought you were working like me. What are you doing? I'm just wandering and enjoying the city. What are you doing? What's your job? Back home, I give seminars. It's more about personalized nutrition. I understand. I was a vegetarian for some years. But it was too difficult for me. It's not for me, I think. Well, you have an astonishing body. And that means, I would assume that you eat somewhat healthy. Or take care of yourself. No. No? No, it's just nature, maybe. I don't know. Good genes. Yes. Your mom and your grandma were... Yes, yes. Splendid. Because of this, because I'm not very... I don't usually eat something. Only healthy food, I mean. So, you must go, as you said. No, I have some time for the break. I already ate. But I could go for a coffee. Would you like to go for a coffee? No, thanks. I just had and I want to visit the castle today. Oh, you are adorable. What? You are adorable. I like your energy. Thank you. Yeah. And... Why don't we exchange... Do you do Facebook or... Facebook, yes. Facebook, yeah. And maybe we can... I can find. You can find yourself. Yes. Good. Nice picture. It's Greece, Greta. Greta. Yes. Did you have some feta cheese and olive oil? What? Did you have feta cheese, the white cheese? White cheese is very... Ah, feta cheese. Feta cheese, yeah. Ah, yes, of course, because Greece. So, I have very short time, I should go. Yeah. It was nice to meet you. It was very nice to meet you. Okay, I wish you a good vacation. And you. Bye-bye. Going out with James, he's very spot on with his feedback. So, Russian, first long interaction with a Russian. Yeah. All right, special thing. On this trip. What was your impression of a Russian? Very eloquent, challenging. Because first I thought that wouldn't go anywhere. When I first approached her and she was kind of like, what do you want? I did not think that would go anywhere. Yeah. Yes, well, Russians and Serbs, Ukrainians to a lesser extent, are a particular type of species of woman that are quite different. And the characteristics of them tend to be that they are no nonsense. That they won't give you a lot of encouragement. But if they're engaging with you, then it's a good sign. And what they also don't do a lot of is a lot of playful banter and flirtation. And they don't like irrelevancies. Like the last thing went at the end when she showed you a photo, I guess, and she was her in Greece and then you started talking about olive oil and feta cheese. She was really losing it there. She's like, what? Feta cheese? Yes. Okay, feta cheese. It's an irrelevancy, really. I mean, you could say, oh, did you love Greece? What did you love about it? The food. Okay, now we talk about the feta cheese. Meeting lots of Russians is great because they give you really immediate feedback on things that a lot of other girls would let you get away with. So they just tend to give you like, what's that? Oh, yeah, that's good. Which is good. You didn't find out, is she here alone? And what's her logistics until the very end? We still don't know if she's here alone. I think she is. But that's the kind of thing, when you walk up to a girl who's a foreigner, she's very beautiful and she's by herself. We need to figure out, is there a boyfriend around? Is she part of a group or something? Because these logistics are useful. Sometimes hot girls travel alone, not that commonly, but sometimes. And we need to find that out. And you also didn't really get through her test well enough at the end, where she was like, you offered to go for coffee right now? She said no, she wants to go look at the castle. Fair enough. If they weren't with me on this workshop, I would have suggested saying, all right, well, I haven't been there either, I didn't go with her. But I'm glad you didn't because I didn't want to have to follow you. you for an hour but then you then you were trying to figure out like what's going on she's going to Warsaw there just get to the point when you're leaving Budapest tomorrow morning all right so maybe we can meet some to this evening when you finish your program all right that there probably is a space because she's also said she's got a bit of a plan but not rigid plan but she wants to do a fun bunch of things and if you'd worked around just said okay there's got to be a hole in here because she's like a clear Russian woman you need to be you need to be clear and get to the find the place where this is gonna happen what when you started walking and walking walking walking I was like ah don't just walk forever and I'm glad that at some point you pulled her aside and said let's look at this thing that was you could have done it maybe even earlier but like I'm glad you did that because it's like you're at least registered that yeah she's here wandering strolling and we can do the stroll forever but let's go and have a moment together so that was really good I want you to dial into your into your sexual intention and don't make it a thing like I'm trying to do a thing it's just like that woman was sexy and she was fucking tall and lithe and had huge breasts and was like fucking banging in some hot dress right allow yourself to settle into that and when you said you have a spectacular body I didn't feel it all right and it was a perfect moment to do it good good context but well you have a magnificent magnificent what word to use I think but something something well you have a magnificent body did you work for that all right I'm okay in that moment I'm relishing it well I think you're you were like I think you're adorable she didn't understand the word well I think you are adorable and I would love to see you tonight this is this is in sincere intention of masculine presence that particularly Russian women need and respond very very well to there's so much greater polarity there that's why here I'm it's great trying to meet aggressive Slavic women as much as you can but doesn't matter I mean women are women they still still operating in similar operate similarly so yeah that's that and it's being aware of the like not trying to not trying to have the perfect posture and walking down the street like I'm doing the thing it's just like all right I'm a loose and chill I'm walking around I'm doing and I'm reaching out I'm not waiting for the perfect opportunity perfect girl even it's just like I'm reaching out whoa you're sexy what's your name hey there rather than like I wanted to come over here and tell you that I'm gonna meet you because that's what I'm doing is meeting you it's just like hey what's your name well you're really sexy get into this flow of like reach out express reach out express and then try to move from details what's the plan today I'm shopping for yourself someone else myself selfish lady good to be what you want all right that's a from shopping to something about juiciness mm-hmm that's that's that's what you need to work on mm-hmm okay everything he said was like made so much sense because I've been going out meeting women before I came to the course pretty much for the past few months and the feedback I got I would have never gotten that even if I probably would have done a thousand approaches it was so so efficient to get this feedback and to work on that and I specifically first day I had this realization and then with each training each coach and it kind of became normal it's a specifically pointed out what what I was what I was doing and I just wasn't aware of it and another thing that that they teach is to become aware of it so when I go out now in the world I am more aware of me and of the women so now I have the skill set to teach myself when I first met everyone the coaches they were exactly like in the videos and I mean that was one of the main reasons why why I decided to go with the natural lifestyles is because they are so real they are so congruent I really like their approach and I really like every one of them everyone of the coaches is so real and so authentic in his own way and that affected the entire group so we are all in here we are all vulnerable and that create that in and of itself creates a creates a really strong connection between all of us and I mean I knew from the beginning okay I'm gonna go with with I'm gonna go with whatever is is asked of me even if it's painful and like I'm opening up and so and that's what I didn't that's what everyone else and that's why we have created this strong connection between the other students as well as with the coaches I mean it's very intimate very intimate we are we're fairly small group and it's it's like a few days really feels like a year it's even after the first day I thought wow this is feels long and every day I like wow this is like really it feels like a really long time and that's we've created a lot of connection between everyone and and I feel like because everyone is real everyone is authentic and everyone is runnable because we're going through this very challenging journey that is goes to our night deep fears and insecurities and we are working through this and it's it's amazing connection we have created so I can't wait to meet the other guys later on and see where we will be at when I came here I was very excited and now it's almost at the end of the workshop and I'm very excited still or for different reasons I would say I'm excited to go home and to start going out and expressing myself expressing my sexuality my intent meeting women what I've done before the workshop but now I've learned so much of so many tools at hand but the tools are just one thing my primary thing we're on the tools we learned a lot of techniques and strategies and tools great amazing stuff but the primary thing for me was to express my intent to express my sexuality to be comfortable with my sexuality and I think that's the biggest game-changer as well as being in the present moment and being responsive to the women and yeah I really can't wait to go out to to to yeah do it to practice it to and to have to create real connections with women I mean that's what it's really all about and and oftentimes when I went out before I I did techniques and stuff and it didn't work out so well and one major point I missed is being responsive and being real and now I have now I'm excited because I can finally try it out and I also understand it's a huge process process and I mean so so much stuff I have to work through and and compress and so I'm I'm also excited for the changes that that probably happen subconsciously like after the workshop so you huge growth huge growth and very challenging challenging week I'm still energized from it but probably I'm gonna be I don't know sleep a lot I don't know but at the same time I'm so excited so we will see"}
