That at every age, from 16 to 60, there is an attractive archetype for a male. You can be a 60-year-old guy who's established, confident, sexually experienced, and then a 25-year-old hottie might want to fuck you as well. It was like, I'm okay being broke and young and figuring my shit out. I don't know myself. I'm not the man I'm going to be. I haven't succeeded yet, but I'm learning. I'm growing. I'm loose. I'm funny. I'm making mistakes. I'm fucking up. I'm living on that edge. And yes, sometimes I'm just so broke that I can barely afford to pay rent and I'm going to live on lentils for the next five days. And that's part of the funny wackness of being down and out as a young dude. It gets old, right? Like, you don't want to do that forever. I'm not here to give advice on how to be a 50-year-old guy trying to hustle glamour girls into bed and trick them into thinking you're rich or anything like that. Some women will screen you out at various levels based on your swag, right? They will. And that can even be on teenage girls or young girls who have had a taste of the good life. And then they're like, yeah, well, if I'm going to date a guy, he has to be fun and cool and I like him. But he also, okay, he needs to know some people or he needs to have access to this scene. Or when I hang out with him, I get to eat good food and go to nice places. Some girls care about that. And as they get a taste for that, they will care about it more if they get access to that. That's true. But that very same girl will still, because I know those girls and I see that they will at the same time be dating like a rich guy where they will see him once a week or whatever and he takes them out fancy dinners and flies them to places and buys them shit sometimes. It's not like a prostitution thing, but like an informal sugar daddy, right? Just she's dating a rich guy. That same girl will also be dating like a down-and-out rapper or like skater kid or whatever who's, you know, her age, is fun. They live in the same world, they speak the same language. She gets him in a different way and she's into him and she fucks that guy. And she also, you know, sometimes fucks that rich guy and she feels feelings for him too, right? So you can play different roles. And as you grow and change over your life, you will need to. The secret to lifetime seductive success is to be a man of your age, right? That at every age from 16 to 60, there is an attractive archetype for a male, right? You can be a 16-year-old who's fucking cool and 16-year-old girls want to fuck you. You can be a 60-year-old guy who's established, confident, sexually experienced and knows how to treat a woman, is not needy, has, you know, doesn't have that same young man's like need to prove an ego. And then a 25-year-old hottie might want to fuck you as well, right? If I'm doing my age well. So if you're at the period where you're the, I'm the broke dude age, wear it well. Invest what little money you have into like dressing in a way that looks cool even though it can look broke, right? Like I wouldn't wear any more converse and ripped jeans and the flannel shirt. Yes, I would. But like that's the uniform of like a broke skater that's cool, right? He can wear black ripped jeans, converse and a t-shirt and that's it, right? And he can be cool. His outfits don't have to cost a lot. He needs to understand style to an extent, right? You can be a boho hipster and you can do that one into your 40s. Actually, I know I'd still do that. You can be like a cool hipster in your 40s. You know, one who brews at home. Is that how you're doing my mad home brews here? It doesn't have to cost a lot, right? You don't need to be rich to look cool and to have experiences that are great. My brother and his wife are very low income but they have an incredible life. They've put resources into travel, learning, experiences over all other things. And as a result, they spent the last 10 years doing those as opposed to being poor. They were technically poor the whole time but they didn't live a poor life. They had amazing experiences all around the world. They just did it cheaply. Cheaper than I would in order to make it work. So in conclusion, I would say it's important to look at your finances as one of the pillars of your seduction. I'm not someone who lives for money or it's my primary goal or motivation. But I see money as freedom. That's why I became successful, like why I pursued business success was so I could have more freedom. Not so I could have more shiny things or more impressive stuff to try and get girls to think I was cool because my watch gleams in the sunlight. It was so that I could decide to f**k it, travel here or go and learn from this person or there's that awesome girl and she's in that place, f**k it, I'll go and see her. And I'll get an Airbnb instead of a hostel room because I got a bit of cash and that's going to be better for the seduction, right? So therefore, money becomes a tool for freedom, for leverage, for experiences. Not for one for self-validation or for propping my ego up.
