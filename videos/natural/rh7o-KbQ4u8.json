I don't just whip my shirt off in the middle of a wedding or whatever like you would. Because you feel a bit hot. And you feel a bit hot, so you just take your shirt off in the middle of the wedding. So I have a question for you guys. What's one thing that you think now is absolutely critical to what you do, but you actually didn't realize was even important back when you were getting started with the take-in? I mean you look confused. I can tell you what it is for me. For me it was that I wasn't doing it and then I started doing it. Yeah, now you know you can do it. For me it was, I didn't even know this concept existed. For me it's social freedom. That was the most important thing. Because I just thought it was just about having the balls and going over and how to flirt and how to do all these things. But actually when I just felt comfortable enough doing what I want to do and I just stopped caring what people thought, and I was able to express myself without fear of judgment, that's what changed it for me. And that was the key component for me. When I really, really, really stopped giving two shits what people thought, then I could run up to anyone and do anything. The rest kind of fell into place. It's funny that, isn't it? Because I wouldn't say that's not my guiding principle. Because maybe I still do care about what people think more than you do. Sure, definitely more than you do. I don't just whip my shirt off in the middle of a wedding or whatever like you would. Because you feel a bit hot. And you feel a bit hot, so you just take your shirt off in the middle of the wedding. I don't walk through Rio de Janeiro with six day old bunched up underwear pulling out of my pants while I have no shirt on, saying hi to people like you do. But I think definitely one of my guiding principles is freedom. And I guess I've done it in different ways. For me it wasn't so much about the social pressures on me. It was more around like I want to navigate the world from a place of freedom so that all my choices were not based on either fear or obligation or things I had to do or people expected me to do. It was that I wanted to be able to find my own path. And that led me through different areas, whether that was creatively music, taking business risks, not getting a normal job. And then when I got into seduction that that was something where I was like this is the ultimate freedom for me as a man. Because it means that I actually have choice now. The things that I hated was living in yearning, in regret, in scarcity, in feeling like I just couldn't. There were certain things that were not available to me. What's one thing that now you think absolutely like this is so important but back then you didn't even know about. You didn't even realize it was important. And now you're like super important. Probably the physical game. When I first started out I had some advantage that I'd done a lot of meditation before. So my principle of awareness was with me all the time. And that is my base principle of everything I've done since then. Teaching, seduction, everything else comes from that. So that was always there. But I think it was recognizing that the dialogue between men and women is mostly non-verbal. Because I used to talk too much and think too much. So when I allowed things to be more simplified and to recognize that what I have is enough, that I don't need to be clever, I don't need to prove myself. I do need to improve myself because I want to be better and more at ease with myself. But where I'm at now is okay. And I have what it is the woman wants, if she's at least interested in me, which is that she wants the comfort, the sex, the sensuality, the feeling my power, the eroticism, all of that stuff. So I think when I became more sensual and less cerebral that shifted a lot. A lot of things pop in my mind. One thing is that my instincts were more powerful than my mind. That my instinct to want to connect with people, what I used to feel like is that it was dirty or it was bad or I was up to no good or being creepy. And I used to also feel like women were some alien species. Even though I had known women, I felt like all these women that I desired and didn't know were somebody other than me. And I felt for a long time like I had to force it to make it happen. I had to force it, I had to prove it. I had to keep trying as hard as possible. And then it got really... The real understanding is that it's not a forcing, it's an allowing. It's that it's simply just my job to create, as the man, to create the condition by taking the risks to initiate various sequence of events over and over and then just allow perhaps a connection to happen between us. And that I can't force it. But what I can do is I can take all these risks and create this condition for boy and girl to connect. The more I started connecting and loving myself and just feeling like I'm okay, I'm actually an okay guy and people like me, that just gave me the freedom. So it all comes down to the relationship with the self. And a big part of that is caring what people think, which doesn't make any difference, it's what you think about you. So that shift and the more I think it's an ongoing process because as we get older, we actually get more and more like I feel you guys are more solid in your being now than when I met you seven years ago. You were so much more you than you were in every way. So now I get it when older people are like, it's great when you get older, it actually is great. Until you get really old and then it's bad. But at this point, it's really good. Because, yeah, so that relationship with the self for me, that's really the thing.
