Just taking a stroll in my lovely weekend estate here in Budapest and today I wanted to talk to you guys about something that is very interesting and I'm sure it's on the minds of at least some of you and the thing I want to talk about is should I use psychedelics? Now this is a big topic, it's something that's very interesting and it's something that it's becoming more of a hot topic these days because there's been a lot of research happening on it lately and it's become part of a somewhat of a pop culture movement or a resurgence of psychedelic use. Now if you're like most young people out there, you're at least somewhat curious about what psychedelics are and maybe you've even used them a few times and it's something that can be a big doorway into transformation. It's something that is very useful at the right time in the right way. Now it's also something that needs to be understood properly and needs to be used within a context of responsibility and knowing what you're doing. So I speak from some experience because I've been doing this for quite a while and I've worked with a number of different medicines and psychedelics that have been very useful to my evolution at different stages. So I'm here to say that it's a good thing but I'm also here to say that it's something that needs to be used with respect and care. Now some things to be aware of is like if you're considering, you know, should I use psychedelics? Well first of all, know why you want to take them and know what you're taking. Some of the worst ways to take psychedelics is to take them randomly and not really know what you're doing and find yourself in a position when, you know, it's actually not that healthy for you. So first thing is understand what exactly you're taking and then start to understand like what's the, you know, the right dosages and things. So do your due diligence, do some research and once you've done that then start to get into contact with what is the best circumstances, the best setting that's going to help you in that environment. So making sure you've got a nice comfortable place, ideally having friends around you that are really good and they can support you, people that are able to not get lost in their own sort of psychedelic journey, maybe somebody who's done that sort of work before a little bit so there's a bit more trust in that. Doing it in places like nature and stuff is really good because it gives you a kind of a connection to the world around you which is very beautiful. And in some sense part of the value of using psychedelics is that they can lift the shields or the filters of perception for periods of time so that you can have alternative views, you can have different perspectives and different perceptions and you can receive input that might be very useful to gaining insights or making changes inside your life in different ways. So in that respect it's a very useful thing and that's why it's important to have a very soft or nourishing kind of setting that's going to be very good for your psyche when you remove the veils, when you start to remove those kinds of separations or things that stand between you and seeing those things on a regular basis. One of the things to also recognize is that psychedelic use is not an end in itself in my opinion. It's a way to see things and adjust to the world in a different way but it's not something that actually gives you lasting transformation because the tendency is you have an altered state of experience, maybe you have some peak states and some insights and then you come back to your everyday consciousness and it tends to slip away, it tends to go back to normal fairly quickly. And it can be somewhat frustrating because then the idea is that people go back and they take more and I've seen a lot of that. People in psychedelic communities or taking medicines and things and they keep coming back over and over and over and over again for years and years to try and get some resolution or transformation inside themselves and really it's not actually serving the purpose. What I've also seen though is that people that use psychedelics sparingly in conjunction with healthy lifestyle, in conjunction with things like getting into their bodies, being fit, knowing themselves, doing self-inquiry, taking care of themselves with things like meditation and doing actual work like real spiritual work or real self-transformational work then psychedelics can really activate that structure. Psychedelics can really bring out deeper levels of understanding and experience of those kinds of practices that people are doing. And then as that happens they can integrate that and it becomes like a kind of an anchor that then they can work with over time to keep coming back to raise their levels, their baseline of understanding of what's going on. Because one of the virtues of things like psychedelics is they can give you an insight into a world that you may have never seen before and as a result of that insight it's going to give you a kind of access to different states of consciousness for periods of time. So it can open things up. And there's plenty to be said about the fact that having psychedelics can often open you up to a kind of extra-dimensional slash mystical experience of the world which many people have never had before and it can be an extremely game-changing kind of experience if you're ready for that kind of thing. So some of the things that I would also say about using psychedelics is make sure that you're ready because once again a lot of people get curious about these things and they just want to take them to take them. They want to take them because they want to have some kind of exciting experience or they want to be part of the cool crew or whatever. But the thing is if you have things like unstable trauma inside yourself, if you're taking any medications that are for depression or to try and balance yourself in different ways or even just on medications because you've got some condition, then that can be really risky as well. So make sure you really understand the effects of combining different things and if you've been on any antidepressants and stuff then you definitely need a period of time before you take psychedelics, maybe even months of weaning yourself up. So make sure you've got the right kind of constitution and the right conditions as well. The other thing is that I would say is that psychedelics are really good for people that are in a phase where they're doing a lot of self-inquiry or at least they're open to self-inquiry. They're looking for something. They're looking for some different ways of seeing themselves, seeing the world and they're open to those kinds of possibilities. Psychedelics are not very good for people that have a strong ego, they're really holding on to a particular kind of thing and they don't want to let go of their own grasp of the world. I've seen over and over again that can actually result in kind of traumatic experiences because as the psychedelic takes effect and the veils start shifting and their personality starts to become a lot looser, a lot of the constructs of their identity that they've been living by become sort of released, then there can be all these secondary mechanisms of self-protection that come up and they manifest as a lot of anxiety and fear and uncertainty and in the context of a psychedelic journey that can often manifest as like a kind of a psychotic episode basically or a very bad trip. And once again, I'm not here to judge that either because there's actually funnily enough a lot of benefit in going through bad trips and integrating them, but there's not a lot of benefit in having bad trips just for the sake of having a bad trip. So it's not something that I recommend, but if it happens, it can be really good to learn how to balance yourself, how to center yourself, how to take care of yourself and how to understand what's necessary to cope with difficult situations. So it brings me to something interesting as well about psychedelics in general is that they can be a kind of an ordeal. They can also be a kind of a gift. So that's part of the beauty of them as well because you never quite know what you're going to get. You don't know exactly what the outcome of the usage is going to be. You might have a very light and insightful journey. You might have a very heavy and quite tormented kind of journey. That can happen. But in between the spectrum of those two things is your consciousness that's constantly engaging with this and learning. And it becomes an ordeal. I say it's an ordeal in the sense that you're creating a container or a space where for at least a few hours you're going to have an altered state of consciousness. But that can then teach you a lot of things in a very accelerated way. So you can have somewhat of the equivalent of maybe meditating for weeks or maybe even months through using a kind of a psychedelic to activate a certain kind of experience. But the difference is, and this is a pretty big difference between actually doing the work of meditating to get to that state versus taking a substance that can get you there straight away, is that when you do the actual meditation then you learn all these skills like patience and discipline and self-control and witnessing and a lot of subtle mechanics that are really useful to understand navigating your mind. So when you add a psychedelic to that then all those skills are just as useful. They become very handy because you're going to need to learn how to navigate your mind more than ever in that kind of space. So be prepared for the fact that it's an ordeal and that it can compress quite a lot of learning in a limited period of time. And that can be very healthy but it can also be very testing. And in that sense it's really important to remember that when you're working with psychedelics you're really engaging with the process. You're engaging with the process of evolution. You're engaging with the process of self-transformation. And in many ways it's a very exciting thing indeed to be involved with, but something like I said that needs to be taken with absolute care. So we talked a little bit about the idea of the psychedelic journey as an ordeal, which it definitely is. But it's also a learning tool. And one of the things that it's good to keep in mind when you're approaching psychedelics is what's a useful mindset, what's a good mindset to approach. Once again, some people look at psychedelics, and this is a big thing, as a kind of entertainment. You know, a lot of people will take it to trip out and to have a weird experience, whatever that is. And I think that's somewhat sad because they let themselves down and they don't necessarily take advantage of the psychedelic experience for the fullness of what it is. And I get that there's a lot of desire for getting fucked up for a lot of people, and whatever, each to their own. I think another approach to that situation is to look at it as it's an opportunity to do something quite sacred with yourself. It's an opportunity to share something quite intimate with yourself, which is to really open up your doors of perception, to go inside and to see what you can see, to learn what you can learn, and maybe even do some renegotiating. Especially if you're working with things like more natural psychedelics, whether it be like mushrooms or some form of cactus or other forms of medicine that are quite common these days, then there's definitely a component of a kind of a spiritual communion or a kind of a conversation that can happen with yourself and the psychedelic space. And a lot of really powerful things can come out of that, revelations about yourself, revelations about your place in the world, revelations about how the world works. And those kinds of things can really have a positive change if you can learn how to capture them as well. So that's part of the mindset to keep in mind, is that you're going on a journey and you're going kind of like as a, I guess a bit of a secret agent or something, you're going into this space, or a fisherman maybe, to go into this space to try and collect something, to try and find something to bring back, something useful and valuable to retrieve from the experience, and something that you can then ideally integrate into your life on some level. Now some of these things will be unconscious and you won't need to think about them so much, they'll just happen as a result of having these kinds of experiences, and some of them will be more conscious, where you have a revelation of some kind, and then you have to kind of work out how to integrate that into your life, or how you can emulate that in a more of a non-psychedelic kind of context. So you might have a huge heart-opening experience and realize that everything is amazing, everything's full of love, and everything's packed with this perfection and beauty and stuff. And the challenge is then when you come back to the everyday life, how can you honor that? How can you open up at least a little bit of that? Maybe you can practice a little bit more appreciation and gratitude, or maybe you can actively look for the beauty in things and engage with the beauty in things, for example. And like I said before, it's a real gift when you gain access to that kind of knowledge through some kind of psychedelic, and then you can start to replicate that in your everyday life. So that's a really big thing with the mindsets, is use it as a medicine, not as an entertainment. And that can change the whole experience as well, how you approach it with respect. For example, and once again, I'm not judging here, but a lot of people take psychedelics at parties and stuff. You know, they go and they want to dance and they want to get high or whatever. That's cool. But just be aware that if you're doing that kind of thing, then you're really creating a different kind of container for your experience. You're probably not going to have so much of an introspective, self-transformational kind of journey in that sense. It'll be probably much more of a stimulating, superficial kind of entertaining experience. So recognize that if you want to be somebody that's using them with more intention, that you may want to avoid that kind of circumstance and instead create, like I said, a place in nature or just a really nice environment around you, like maybe have a house with some really cool friends and some cool music and good lighting and something that's set up in a way where you can really get into a zone of enjoying that. And set the intention. Very important. Set the intention that you would like to have this experience as a self-transformative kind of experience. Now, there's something subtle here to have as well, to be aware of, which is having intentions is important, but at the same time, letting go of expectations. Because some of the things that I've observed... Quite often with psychedelics is they have a kind of an arc and there's there's many layers to them so for example when you first take them the thing is you have to Adjust to the fact that your nervous system is going to go through a change Might take 10 minutes might take an hour might take two hours and in that change There can be awkwardness in me you feel kind of strange Maybe your body feels weird maybe little started little glitches in perception start to happen And it's really important in that phase to really relax and breathe and give yourself some time to adjust to What's happening in that process? so Just learning how to center yourself and learning how to observe with patients is such a powerful thing in that particular stage After you've gone through that veil and you start to integrate into that shift of perception then there's more of the journey begins and Once again the journey can be a little bit of roller coaster for sure Sometimes in psychedelic journeys, you'll have Subtle things that will begin for a while and they might become really quite intense and engrossed and you'll be in a very deep Journey, if you will or a deep kind of vision for a period of time and you might be unpacking something maybe your minds gone on a particular kind of trail and you're dealing with some emotions and and And unpacking something and in that sense you can have quite an intense engagement. You might even go into a very deep Difficult place maybe emotions will start to come up maybe intense Experiences that have never been integrated will start to come up and you'll start to have to face them in a different kind of way Now keep in mind that like I said before when you're in the psychedelic state, you're in a quite a vulnerable state But at the same time it can be quite useful because you're in an altered state. You're kind of outside of it Now you may need Support from others, which is another really important thing especially if you find you're somebody who's really sensitive or Hasn't really had a lot of these experiences and you don't really trust yourself a lot with your own emotions and control Then definitely have somebody around as a guide have somebody who can support you have somebody who can be strong To create that kind of base of grounding and support that you may not have inside yourself But ideally you want to provide that for yourself But when you're going through that phase of really unpacking stuff recognize that it can go dark Or it can go light and it may even go both you may have a deep dip a dive to find some gold and have to fight for it and then you'll come back and have A revelation or an integration that comes out of that so the reason I mentioned that is because it's very important to be free from expectations along the way as well because expectations tend to create a kind of difficulty in really experiencing The the journey because you're kind of trying to adjust and make the experience exactly what you want as opposed to Letting it reveal What it will reveal and that's one of the trippy things about Psychedelics literally they're a constant mystery. We don't actually know what we're going to get But setting intentions for example having an intention when you go in when you're using a kind of medicine to say something like I wish to experience a deeper connection with myself or I wish to receive some Some healing to open my heart or I wish to experience a deeper connection with the world around me so that I feel more At peace or something like that setting the container of that kind of intention And they're just some examples you can use whatever you want setting the container of that kind of intention can be really useful because at least it starts to focus and hone the Experience into something that has a context and that can be really amazing. I can really start to help you unpack things But you also keep to have to keep in mind that just having an intention is not enough It'll be enough to set the tone of a kind of a trip, but it's not enough to necessarily drive the whole trip So you're gonna have to be aware of how are you directing yourself in the journey? And that's a really big thing about like becoming you know, I guess a master or you know, maybe not a master, but somebody who's comfortable with psychedelic use is You've got to learn how to sit with the process and navigate it with skill and and how to Keep yourself on point whilst you're in an altered state of consciousness and that's where the ordeal part comes in because you it's a really is an ordeal to stay focused whilst you're You're feeling woozy or your brains trying to take you in a different direction. Your emotions are going in a different direction You're seeing strange things. It feels very intense And if you can just be really centered in yourself, and this is where things like meditation is so powerful You can come back to your center and be like hmm. This is really interesting. I'm observing my mind moving I'm observing the content of my psyche manifesting. I'm observing an altered state of consciousness. That's manifest through this you know this psychedelic interaction and then you can really like you know have a really cool experience of the kinds of Mechanisms and functions that are creating your perception in the everyday world that in itself is a very cool thing so recognize Those ordeals as part of the process Recognize that having that learning kind of mindset of really wanting to have an intention is really important and also recognize that you need to navigate with intention as you move So sometimes in the experience It's really powerful to do things like prayer or to come into presence or to really spend some time with appreciation and gratitude of what's really happening spending some time connecting with nature or And really giving thanks for you know your life who you are in the relationships you have and Looking for the real gold that's in the experience and that kind of intention of using Positivity and reframing and and things like prayer for example and when I say prayer I don't mean necessarily like religious prayer to any deity or anything like that. I mean more sincere Heartfelt intention to express something of value from yourself to the world now that kind of thing can really change your vibration, which is could be very powerful when you're having a kind of a psychedelic experience because Psychedelic experience is a very much a reflection of the state that you're in and the kinds of things that are happening in the moment so when you have a Shift in tone of being it's kind of like you start to go through this thing They talk about in mystery schools Which is this idea of like the rising of the planes? The rising on the planes and know what that kind of means is you if you start from a pretty base level or you've gone into a pretty deep level of What you could call, you know self inquiry or introspection into the underworld into the depth of yourself into your emotions Then you might be feeling quite heavy and quite dense Maybe even quite tormented by something Taking the time to remember to send to yourself Pray and then find the the revelations within that so that you can raise your vibration back out of it is incredibly powerful That in itself will mean that you can start to improve so many Different layers of your perspective perception. There's fucking dogs in the way so in the mystery schools, there's this thing called the rising of the planes where you Start from a base state and say for example You you've been tripping or you've gone into a quite a heavy state of being and you need to You know do something to get out of it because it's intense or it's not really a nice place to be One of the things you do is work with your prayer For example work with your positive intention to come back to centering to come back to your body And then you start to lift your vibration bit by bit by bit and you will literally start to move through Different experiences of the visions that you're having different layers of the trip and that might happen in minutes it might happen in hours, but you recognize and this is a really important thing that that One of the biggest dangers with psychedelics is is not taking responsibility for your own mind Not taking responsibility for your own state And if you can get good at that as I was saying earlier with practicing things like meditation Practicing things like centering practicing understanding your own mind and thoughts and your own emotions so that you're not excessively attached to them So they possess you all the time Then it would be really useful when you have a psychedelic experience because then you can navigate it a lot easier And as you rise through those planes eventually, you'll get to a point where you'll reach a resolution You'll reach a very high level of amazing Insight and and that is is a huge thing. It's a very healing thing for the nervous system It's something I've observed over and over again in myself and in others that after you tend to go through these journeys of working With psychedelics, for example, especially more natural psychedelics And they take you through this curve of revealing different aspects of your psyche and and retrieving elements You can come back with actually quite a lot of vitality. Yeah, and it doesn't mean that You know, it's it's something that you should do all the time, but oftentimes when you do a successful psychedelic journey you'll come back with the kind of new vigor a Rebirthing if you will or a kind of a new Insight to the world that can last for quite a while. It might last days It might last weeks and sometimes it can might even last like months or years To really set you up in a particular kind of path Now that's not to say that psychedelics are always good because for sure be very aware that Psychedelics can have side effects that they can be destructive. They can be damaging particularly if they're taken in an environment That's not healthy for you Or you've taken something and you didn't understand why you took it or how much you've taken for example And you just overdose on it. It can have very, you know strong Side effects like being intoxicated on Psychedelics is not a very pleasant thing And in that sense then, you know You really got to take care of yourself if you find yourself in that kind of position And also be aware that sometimes you can damage yourself on psychedelics and it takes time to heal It might take weeks or months even to fully integrate that and that may mean you're gonna have to get some therapy for example Or you're gonna have to get some healing on your mind and body to come back to a level of peace You may even have to go back and do some more psychedelics But do them in a different context to see if you can reframe and heal the kinds of distortions that happen there So there we have it some thoughts on psychedelics Should you take psychedelics? Why you should take psychedelics some of the ups and downs some pitfalls Some of the tips and tricks that might be really useful for you in that Yeah, so on an end note I'm not here to say for or against I know I'm not necessarily here to judge anything in particular either But I'm just here to say that if you're going to do it do it with awareness And if you're going to do it make sure you're going with the best of intentions and you prepared yourself effectively The one last little piece that comes to mind before I end is that the things that you've been exposing your mind to Particularly for the days before but often the weeks before you do a trip will affect you So for example if you've been immersing yourself in a lot of like heavy thoughts about something heavy thoughts about the world You know difficulties of the world difficulties with you know relating to the world or whatever Then when you go into a trip that stuff's going to come up for you Just as much as if you've been like Reading beautiful poetry or studying some kind of cool subject that really enthralls you and gives you passion Maybe even studying music or meditation or something and then you go into the psychedelic journey all that stuff will come up as well So just be aware that what you program what you put in what you have been programming yourself with is often what you're gonna have to deal with in that journey I Hope that's of use to you gentlemen.
