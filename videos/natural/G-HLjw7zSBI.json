Now I hope you've been enjoying all the extra content that we've been putting out recently in the lead up to the launch of my five principles of natural seduction product. There's more info about that at the end of this video. Now a couple of months ago I released a video where I demonstrated how sometimes I can really suck with chicks. That's right, I put out a blowout roll and a lot of guys seem to really enjoy that, maybe just because they're nasty and they like watching me fall flat on my face. But I think more importantly, guys could see that yes, even the professionals can screw it up and when you're okay with yourself, it's no big deal. Recently I was in New York City, we went out to do some filming one afternoon and it just wasn't my day. I was sucking, getting blown out and so we thought we'd put together another blowout reel for you guys to enjoy. So without further ado, James Marshall in New York City, failing with women. Please enjoy. Excuse me. Hello. Hi. You can take your headphones off. Like that. Were they on or were you just putting them in there to stop people from talking to you? I actually have them on with my mobile phone. How do you know that that's what I want? How arrogant of you to assume that I was coming to pick you up. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. That's funny. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. Is that what you think it is? What is it? Yeah, that's what it is. Alright. See ya. Ok. Hello. Hello. How are ya? I'm good. How are you? Good. I just saw you and I thought you were adorable. I wanted to meet you. Is that cool? I'm kind of going to school right now. Ok. Shall I walk with you for a minute? For a minute. Maybe, probably, if you want to. Maybe, probably, if I want to. Yes, I do want to. Alright. What's your name? Seva. Seva? Yeah. How do you do? I'm James. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. You look Slavic. I am Ukrainian. You're Ukrainian. Excellent. I'm a quarter Ukrainian. My grandfather was Ukrainian. Nice. From a very small village called Nikopol. I... Where is it? Where is it? Near Cherkasy. Yeah, ok. Yeah. And you are from where? Crimea. Huh? Crimea. And what are you doing here? I live here. You're right. There, there. Yes, it's a wild place. You like it? Um, yeah. Um, yeah? It doesn't sound... You don't sound that enthusiastic. Yeah, I'm used to it already. You've been here a while? Three years. Ah, ok, yes. And I'm still fresh enough that it's all weird and wonderful. I think you were with your friend, no? Yeah, I was with my friend. But I left him because... Why did you leave him? What do you mean? That's so weird. Do you think it should be bros before chicks? Yeah, it's... Why did you come here? I don't want to interrupt, but I was like... No, it's alright. I don't... No, I don't want to be left out. Don't you... What? You don't need to be left out. Well, he's going to... At some point, he's going to... That's not nice. But what about when we go on our first date? Then he's going to be left out. What? When we go on our first date, he'll be left out as well. Oh, why not? We're not going on a first date? No. Why not? Because I'm busy. Busy for life. What? Busy forever? Yeah. That's such a Ukrainian rejection. I'm busy for life. No, I'm actually really busy. I don't see my friends. I don't see my... My own mom, you know? Oh, dear. Yeah. So you don't have time for fun. I have like a half an hour break, so I want to... Well, you should free up some time for life. At some point. At some point? At some point. It's happening. I will get cravings. Alright, well... So you don't want to go on a coffee date sometime? No. Alright, well... Is that like a... Okay. That's a Mormon handshake. Okay. I'm a Mormon. I was trying to convert you. It didn't work, though, did it? Okay, hold on a second. I'm a little confused. I'm making... Is that what I should do? I'm making it up. So right now it seems pretty good. Okay. Bye. Bye-bye. Bye. Hello. How are you? Don't worry, I'm not selling anything. But I thought you were attractive and I wanted to see if you liked me. Oh, um... I have a boyfriend, actually, but thank you. That's alright. You can still like people, can't you? I'm James. Victoria. So I'm not trying to pick you up now. So now we can relax. Yeah. I know girls instantly say that as a defense mechanism in the city. Oh, no. Yeah. I actually live with him, but yeah. Yeah, cool. And what are you doing in your life these days? What? What are you doing with yourself? Manicure. Manicure. I've never had one. Should I have one, do you think? Um, maybe. I have thought about it. I don't know. Do you feel sort of pampered afterwards? Um, no. I just... I have a date tonight, so I need to fix these cars. Oh, I see. You have a date? Yeah. With your boyfriend? Yeah. Do you still think of yourself as dating even though you live together? Yeah. Well, we both work from home, so I have to schedule a date night. Ah, that's actually really important, otherwise you get kind of complacent, huh? Yeah. Yeah. Alright, well I'm going to let you go. You have a wonderful day. Thank you. See you later. Hello. Hi. Oh, don't look like that. Oh, no. What does he want? I just think you're cute. I just think you're cute, that's why. Huh? I came to say hi. Hi. Yeah, what's your name? Brianna. Brianna? Viola. Viola. Viola. I'm James. Nice to meet you. How do you do? You look like you're looking on a map and you're not sure which way to go. Yeah. I know. You can always tell when people are like... I know, it's my birthday here. Uh-huh. It's confusing. Yeah. The best thing to do is just give up and get lost. Yeah, I know, but I want to go to the... Washington... Brooklyn Bridge. Brooklyn Bridge. Yeah. Oh, you're a little way from there. Yeah, I know. But it's a nice day for a walk. But I was in Central Park. I'm walking. She's still alive. You're having a big walking day. Yeah. Uh-huh. And are you an Italian? Yeah. Uh-huh. I'm an Australian. Oh, okay. I've been in Australia. I lived there. Did you? Yeah. You didn't like it? New Zealand. Oh, New Zealand's not really Australia. Yeah, but I lived in New Zealand and when I was there, I went to Australia. To Melbourne? No, to Sydney. I spent one month in Sydney. Uh-huh. Just on holiday. Did you like it? Yeah. Australians are pretty relaxed, I guess. Yeah, but I like Australia. Simple. Sydney is plenty of Italian people. Do you try to avoid Italians when you travel? Yeah, because I was with a Colombian girl, so I was with her and with her cousin that is Australian, so I went with them. With her cousin? Yeah, that's it. Uh-huh. Yes. But when I'm traveling, I tend to try to avoid Australians. Yeah. But for you, it's simple because everyone speaks English. That's true. I don't know. It's true. We are very lazy English speakers. Yeah. Yeah. But your English is fine. Thank you. You can communicate. Thank you. That's the important thing. Yeah. What's the one thing about you? I don't know. Yes, you do. I don't know. Yeah, I know, but so is everybody else in Italy. I'm sure you have something unique about you. I don't know. What do you like doing? You look pretty sporty. Are you sporty? No. You just dance? Not at all. Not at all? Me too. We're just gifted with genetics. No, no. I'm not sporty at all. I hate to dream everything about sports. I don't watch any sports. Me neither. And I'm not gay. Isn't that amazing? Yeah. Every Australian is very interested in sports. Yeah. So that's why I had to leave. But are you living here in New York? At the moment, I'm living here, but I live in Europe mostly, in Budapest. Okay. Yeah. I've never been there. It's cool. It's a funky place. It's a little bit... Do you know the word dodgy? No. Sketchy. It's a very important word. It means something that's... It's like on the border of illegal. Okay. But it means something that is not quite... Fuck. It's good and bad and... Whatever it is, it's not a bad thing. Okay. If it's not too much. Not too much. Okay. So it's like a dirty city, but a regal city. So it's gorgeous and... It's like Prague. Yes. Yes. Okay. I've been to Prague. Yes. Prague is dodgy. Okay. Because it's beautiful, but there's a dirty underside. Yeah. Okay. Got that? Yeah. Okay. Remember the word? Dodgy. Dodgy. Dodgy. Dodgy. Dodgy. Dodgy. Yeah. Okay. Do you... Are you sure? Yeah. Even a little bit? No. That sucks. I like people who are a little bit dodgy. I'm not. You're a good girl. What does that mean? I'm a good girl. Good at what? I'm a student, so I study. I travel a lot. You always finish your essays three days before... You always finish your schoolwork three days before it's due. No. What? Oh, I'm saying because you're a good student. Yeah. So you don't leave it to the last minute. No, because I have the exam every month, so I have to study. I must study. You must study. Yeah. All right. And do you have time for fun? Yeah, of course. The night is for fun. Good. Good. All right. Would you like to have fun with me one night? I'm here with my best friend, so I don't know. So do you guys are like twins? Yeah. You never separate? No. Now, for the moment, he's living here. So I went here to meet him. Uh-huh. Now, can I ask you a personal question? Is he in love with you? Yeah. I think so. What's going to happen when he tries to kiss you? No, but we know each other since three years, so... So he's been waiting for three years. Yeah, but... You should tell him. No, he knows. He knows? Yeah, he knows. Does he really? Yeah, he knows I have a boyfriend, so... Oh, he's given up then. No, he doesn't. He didn't give up? No. He's still waiting for his turn. Yeah, I'm still waiting. Oh, no. You shouldn't do that. It's not my fault. No, it's not your fault. It's true. But it does happen a lot to girls. I think the best thing is to tell them that there's no hope. No, I told him, but... He didn't listen. No, it never changed. Do you want me to talk to him? No, no. I can explain it. No, I don't want to. I've been there, and it's not a good place to be. The friend zone. Do you know that phrase? Yes. We use the same Italian word, friend zone. You have a different word for that? No, no, no. It's universal. It's so common in the world. Coca-Cola and friend zone, everyone understands it. All right, cool. Well, I'm going to friend zone you. No. Yes. No, I did it first. You are my friend for life. Okay. I don't care if you fall in love with me. Whatever happens, we are never getting together. Okay. All right? Okay. All right. Bye. Bye. How many kisses in Italy? One, two? One, two. Four? All right. Bye. Lovely to meet you. Bye."}
