I'm 57. Well, here's one, Zan, which I'm interested in as well. Christopher Millington, which is one of my favorite names to say because it's so British. Christopher Millington. And I always say it like that. Esquire, Esquire. I don't sound like that. Esquire. So, Zan, what is your secret of youth? Because you are very youthful. Oh my God. Why aren't you asking me that? Look, there's two dudes in a row asking you that and no one's asking me. Yes, fair enough. Do you, yes, are you particularly healthy? Do you have great genes? You know, I've always been a hacker of my life just because it's fun for me. So, I take a power nap every day. I sleep maybe four, maybe five hours a night and I take a power nap. Oh, Jesus. I eat one meal a day. I've been intermittent fasting for years and years. I eat between seven and nine, basically, in general. You know, sometimes I won't, but I'm not strict with it, but I generally don't eat food at all in the day because I have a sedentary lifestyle. I don't stress and I have a young girlfriend. Keeps you young. Yes. Keeps you young, you know? That really does keep you young, yes. Because I've seen that with friends who stayed with their high school girlfriends and now they both look terrible. Yeah, so for me, because I had this crazy upbringing of hardship, I guess, you know, and there's something in me that's very stoic in that if something doesn't work out that I really want it to happen and it didn't work out, I'm like, okay, well, I guess I'm doing something else. And I just have this real kind of, you know, I zoom out. I have a perspective of zooming out. So, I see here's my troubles for the day, but I zoom out to my entire life and cradle the grave. I think, man, I've had some good stuff and I've had great times in my life, you know? And I zoom out further than that and I look at myself in this spec on this time in history. I'm born in this modern age where technology is incredible and I'm living in a science fiction future, you know? And I have that perspective. So, and I don't stress when something doesn't work out or something I'm thinking, okay, that didn't work out. So, you know, so I have that kind of attitude and I don't work a lot. I relax a lot and I contemplate a lot. And I want a life, I want a life of a coffee and contemplation, sit with my girl. I have girls in my house that come over and we play guitars and it's simple, you know? So, I have a very simple life, very, very simple. My place, if you ever saw my apartment, it's very simple. And I have a young girlfriend who adores me and I adore her. So, it keeps you young, you know? I'm 57, man. I'm almost 60. I know, which is really stunning. I have some gray hair, look. Yes. It's starting to come in now. Yeah, finally, because I've got, yeah, I definitely, I definitely have some grays and by the end of this year, I'm going to be totally white in my beard, which is going to be interesting when white beard brown hair. I think that's a really good point because I've looked into longevity and, you know, I've had a health coach before and yeah, looking like what are the things that make the difference? And there are all sorts of things with, you know, your macro and micros and your sleep patterns and your exercise and stuff. But often people do gloss over the effects of like stress, getting enough rest, whatever that is for you. I mean, if you can live off five, I can't, I need nine. But, you know, getting the right amount of sleep, not being awfully stressed and with a knot in your stomach the entire time, not being absurdly overworked and yeah, being nourished by the community and, you know, the intimate relationships that you have around you. These are the things. Because I remember looking into that, like where do people live the longest? I think it was Okinawa. Okinawa. Some Italian villages and Florida. Yeah. And when I do eat, I eat the Spanish keto diet, which is basically fish, olive oil like crazy and vegetables, you know what? So I don't eat processed food. I don't eat sugar unless I go to Deanna's parents and they make a cake, you know, for whatever. So I also, I'm not strict with it, but I eat a very, I eat a fish and olive oil based vegetable. And well, I eat meat, I eat steaks and whatever, right? But I don't eat a lot of processed food and I don't eat sugar very often and I don't eat fruit. I eat a lot of berries. Do you find, do you have, does that, because for some people that would be, require extraordinary amounts of willpower and discipline. Like, do you feel like you're disciplined in this or you've reached a point where you feel like this is what your body wants and it's natural for you? James, I'm telling you, like, I am not kidding. And I mean this very strictly because I mean, I grew up in the Western world and I ate all the, you know, junk food and like anybody else, right? I cannot remember when I felt hungry last. I cannot remember the last time I felt hungry. I don't eat till seven o'clock at night. Those cravings are gone. And I eat sometimes at night at seven o'clock because I better eat something. Is it seven? Oh, I better get some food. I am not hungry ever. So your body gets used to this cycle. You know, it's the paleo kind of thing where you go hunting all day with your brothers and you kill something, you drag it home and then you have a feast and then you do it the same the next day, you know? You just go out there and you like, so I don't know if it's right or wrong. I don't study these things. I'm curious about it. But I've been doing it accidentally for a long time because I've never been hungry in the morning. And there's a couple of things that made me, that I did accidentally that now science has caught up that I've been doing. I'm 57. I was in the sun all the time. I was black. I was dark, right? I've tan, tan, tan. Cause I tried, you know, I want to get to girls, right? And so I'd be tanning away and stuff like that. But I have a skin condition called vitiligo. It's only on the ends of my fingers. So because of that, I first saw it in my early twenties. And I'm like, what is that? And I went to the doctor, said, well, it's cosmetic only but be careful going in the sun. So when I go to the beach, I'll kind of like find an umbrella and make sure I got a hat and stuff like that. And I've done that kind of thing. So maybe that's accidentally done something to it too. You know, I don't know. Yeah, I think I've done a couple of accidental ones too because I'm, my sleeping patterns is I sleep in every day, every day of my life. And then I don't feel hungry until the afternoon either. So yeah, I tended to just like have long periods of not eating, sleeping a lot and having sex with lots of young girls. Yes. It's the young man, that lifeblood. The energy of young girls who looking up into your face like this and adoring you and have devotion to you, that'll keep you young forever. Henry Miller. Yes, Tropic of Cancer, right? Yeah, Henry Miller, when he was in his old age, he met this woman named Brenda Venus. I'm friends with her on Facebook and she's, I've talked to her a couple of times. She was in a Clint Eastwood movie. She was at this, look it up, Brenda Venus. She was a hot girl. Henry Miller fell in love with this young girl who she was 18 or 19 at the time. And she became his muse and he wrote a book in the company of her. He was about to die. And she met him or he met her. And this young girl, he wrote about it in letters to her and wrote all in his notebook about this beautiful young muse that came into his life and extended his life by five or six years by his own admission. Yeah. Absolutely 100%. Because he could feel the like, okay, that's it. My purpose is over. I'm dying. And then suddenly got another five years. How can you die when you got this beauty come in your life, right? She's 19 and she's looking at you and she's like, loves your work and it keeps you young, man. There you have it, gentlemen. The one and only Zan Perrion with his timeless wisdom for ageless beauty. Now, if you'd like to learn how to achieve one of those tips, not the intermittent fasting one, but the one where you have adoring, wonderful, beautiful girls looking up at you and filling you with eternal youth, then you're gonna need to learn how to approach them, get them on dates and get them into bed. So if you'd like to do that, then you should consider joining me and the crew for a very special four day intensive residential. It's gonna be in Barcelona coming up very soon from the 30th of August through to the 2nd of September. So this is gonna be an action-packed four days running around the streets of Barcelona with me and the crew learning the tools of the trade.
