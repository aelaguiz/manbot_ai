I have a challenge and a question for you at the end of this video. But for now, welcome to part two of New York City Infield. Let's go. One thought I just had, like, do you know GTA, Grand Theft Auto? Yeah. So I played this as a young kid, right? Like many people do when they're young. And then so you play it, and then in the game, people scream stuff at you. And as a European, you don't understand why. And then you come to New York, and everybody is screaming something. And I'm like, oh, that's why. Hi. You are so cute. Thank you. Wait, before you go, my name is Alex. Seems like you're in a hurry. I am. You walk very fast. I walk very fast, yeah. What's your name? Tania. T-A-N-I-A. Hi. Alex. Hi. Where are you hurrying to? I need to get back home. I'm waiting for somebody. I need to get them into my car. Sorry, I'm in a hurry. Are you nervous? Yeah. Okay, before you go, one last thing. Uh-huh. I know it's strange, but I'm new in New York City. Uh-huh. I want to meet cool people. Uh-huh. Do you have Instagram? Meet? No. Do you have WhatsApp? Meet? Not really. I just sort of like text. I don't really stop using it. Do you want to give me your number, and I'll send you one message? Thank you. I'm going to go. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Hi. Sorry. You look adorable. Thank you. I just walked past, and if I would not say hi, I would bring... Oh. What's your name? Uh, Yvonne. Alex. Nice to meet you. Aren't you scared you're going to drop dead? Oh, this? Yeah. Oh, yeah. I mean, I just had class, and it's the only thing that I was bringing. I'm too lazy to bring it back. Are you walking to class now? Oh, no. I just came from class. What are you studying? Marketing. Business marketing. Do you have a boyfriend? No. I don't have a boyfriend. You don't have a boyfriend? No. You don't have a boyfriend? No. You don't have a boyfriend? No. Do you like it? Um, yeah. I mean, it's a pretty general field, so... I did study marketing for three years. Really? Where? In Austria. Oh, awesome. Are you originally from Austria? Yes. I am Austrian, but I just moved to Budapest. Oh. I'm spending one month in New York now. Oh, just a month. How do you like it so far? Uh, it's my third time. Third time? Yeah. It's crazy. What I say, uh, one thought I just had, like, do you know GTA, Grand Theft Auto? Yeah. Uh, so I played this as a young kid, right? Like many people do when they're young. And then so you play it, and then in the game, people scream stuff at you. Yeah. And as a European, you don't understand why. And then you come to New York, and everybody is screaming something. And I'm like, oh, that's why they designed the game like this. So that's how I feel about it. Everybody is crazy, you know? Yeah. It's the city of, if you're here for two weeks, nothing surprises you anymore. That's true. Yeah. It just kind of blends in after a while. Yeah. It's like, oh, here's some crazy dude. Oh, here's a crazy lady all dressed in green. Oh, here's, like... Yeah. This is my second year living here, and I kind of get the gist of it now. I'm still not walking fast enough. I'm, like, always blocking people because I walk really slow. I still walk like a tourist, but... You do. I'm getting used to it. I saw that. Yeah. It was easy to catch up to you. Yeah. Yeah. Where are you from, then? Singapore, originally. Isn't that, like, a super busy city as well? It is. It is. Or do people walk... Or are you just a slow walker? Yeah, I'm just a slow walker, but... I mean, I guess it's slower than in New York, but it's also very, like, urban, and everyone takes public transportation. It's very crowded. So, in that sense, Singapore. I think... I don't know if this is racist, but you're, like, the chillest Asian person I've met in a very long time. Really? Have you met, like, very not-chill Asians? Yeah. They're very freaked out, usually. Really? Like... Like, in New York? Generally. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Generally, everywhere. Like, there's obviously like Koreans, they travel a lot, Chinese people travel a lot. I guess, yeah. I don't want to put you in the same spot. I didn't grow up here, so I'm not, like, Asian American or anything. Okay, well, what I want to say is, like, they're, like, always... It seems like they're always scared, you know, at every bus stop and entrance, and then they have look at cat videos to calm themselves down. I love cat videos. I have a lot of cats. I have, like, seven cats back home. I had one, and it died, because it ate some toxic, and I miss it so much. But it died, like, 12 years ago, but it's still a little baby. Do you have another cat now? No. I travel so much. Like, I would love a cat. I'm a cat person, and I like cat persons as well, like, you know, people who behave more like cats. I don't want that. For example. Exactly. Skateboards. It's the only thing she cares about. Skateboards. Where is the skateboard? I don't see one. But I travel so much, so it wouldn't make sense. Where do you plan on going after New York? I'm going back to Budapest at the end of the month, then I spend one week there, and then I have to go to Portugal for three weeks for a job. I'm here for work as well. Like, I'm basically everywhere for work. Like, I did spend two weeks in Thailand in the summer. Oh my god, I love Thailand. I was in Thailand for the summer, too. I used to go to Thailand for work, and I was like, I'm going to Thailand. I was like, I'm going to Thailand. I was like, I'm going to Thailand. I was like, I'm going to Thailand. I was like, I'm going to Thailand. I was nice. I love it here. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I love it here. I'm so happy. I love it here. I love it here. I love it here. I was in Thailand for the summer. I was in Thailand for the summer, too. I used to go all the time when I lived in Singapore, cuz it's so close, but I love it. I'm so happy. It was my first time. Really? What part of Thailand? I tried to cover it all. I was a little bit in Bangkok, then I was a little bit in... what's the name? So, it's Koh Phan Yang and I'm in Thailand, so I have a lot of appointments. I'm in the middle of Bangkok. other side and Phuket. Oh, Phuket. I did five days of surfing in Phuket, cuz it's like the west coast, so there are waves, and then I went... I skipped Koh Samui, cuz apparently it's just a party city anyway. It is. It is. My friends go there. I've never been. My brother loves it, and he like... I'm like, I'll skip it, and I went straight to Koh Phan Yang. Yeah. Which is like more... It was cool. I did meditation there. I did capoeira. I did like weird acro yoga. Really? I tried like different things. Does it work? In what way? It works for you? What? The yoga? Well, I did it one time. One time, yeah. So, I guess I'm not qualified to say, but it was cool. It was fun. I do meditation a lot, like that helps. Yeah. You need that, especially in New York. Meditation, yeah. Yeah. People are very in their head. People are. I was today at the Natural History Museum. Oh. And when you look at all the things, like stars and universes and galaxies, it's like, holy shit, why do we care so much about little things? I know. It's like we don't even matter anymore. Yeah. Because we're so small. Nobody even knows we exist, and yeah. Do you have that feel often, that like existential crisis? Yeah. Sometimes I just wonder, like, what if I am a totally different person in everyone else's world, or like everyone has their own world and no one actually knows each other, but it's a weird thought. Yeah. What do you mean nobody knows each other? Like everyone has their own version of reality. It's like when I think of like this being the color beige, and other people agree it's beige, but we probably aren't seeing the same beige, but we all agree that this is beige because we're used to what we think we see. So like our green and other people's greens are probably different. And then even feelings and perceptions, you know, like, everybody has different reference experiences. Yeah. They would see a photo of, I don't know, a guy and a girl, and you would interpret totally different things into it. I'm not a philosopher. I don't want to put you in that position. Just marketing. Well, yeah. I did study marketing, but then I was glad I finished it, because I was working so much already during the time. Do you still work in marketing? Sort of, yeah. But not really what you learn in uni. Like more like online marketing, email stuff, social media marketing. Stuff we learn is very outdated. It's like you're using the same textbook from like 20 years ago. We're like, okay, we'll memorize it, but I don't know how much of it will be application. Yeah. You never know. Like it is easy to become very egoistic about it, but also you're right. Like they kind of missed the rapid online thing, right? Like so much is happening online now, and it's not really present in the book. What are you doing after? Like do you want to join a big marketing company or you want to start your own career? I don't know. All of my peers seem to have jobs. I don't. I haven't really tried yet. There's also like I have to fill out some applications. You work too slow. Because like international students, so there's like I can't start working until my senior year. So it's like a whole thing. But now that I can like apply to work, I haven't actually done the applications. You work too slow. Yeah, I do. Like in the two senses. Nah, it's cool. Yeah. It's good that you chill. How old are you? 19. How old are you? You shouldn't stress at all. Yeah. I'm like, it's okay. I'm like a teenager. It's okay. I'm just a kid. How old do you think I am? I don't know. I'm very, very bad at ages. And I tend to look at people, so you're going to have to sell me, okay? Maybe I'll stay a secret forever. Okay. Or not. I'm 26. 26. Oh, okay. I should have guessed. I would have said 26. Okay, the one time I don't guess. You should try. You should trust yourself. Trust your heart. Yeah. It's inside you. You're so cute. Do you want to go on a tea sometime when you have time? If I have time. I have a boyfriend. What kind of boyfriend? Long term. Three years. Cool. Since I was like 16. So, it's like a very long time for me because I am only like 19. That is crazy. But, yeah. And he's in Singapore? No, he's here. He's... I mean, I go to NYU. He's at Columbia, so he's uptown. But... Cool. Yeah. Well... It was really nice meeting you. Very nice meeting you. Having a very deep, short conversation. Nothing matters. Everything matters. Yeah. It's weird. It freaks me out. And then also, like, when you go there, you want to think, Oh, I will quit everything. Fuck marketing. Fuck work. Fuck making money. I'll just be a scientist and discover new animals. But then, you get dropped back into this world and money matters again. And you're like, Oh, shit. Yeah. It's a weird feeling. All right. Nice meeting you. Very good. Yeah. Have a good... Day. Week. Life. You too. Day. Week. See you. Bye-bye. You have one very good interaction. It is. It's the honest truth. It is, for me, harder to keep going. I mean, this was not a sexual conversation, which I often have too. It was just very friendly, philosophical, super cute vibe. She was totally chill. And... You give a lot. That's just the reality of day game. If you approach 10 girls, 15 girls, you will be exhausted at the end. That's why it's also important to have strong sexual intent, to find out if they have a boyfriend quick. Usually, they tell me earlier, it's quite surprising that she waited that long. I mean, I guess she enjoyed the conversation and the attention. Usually, girls would tell me pretty quick, because it's very strong in my eye contact that I'm like, I want to. So, yeah, you will be exhausted. That's fine. Don't worry. Excuse me. Hi. You look very shy, but also very cute. What's your name? Emotion. I have to take a midterm. I don't need to be rude, but I have to take a midterm right now. Is that an exam? Yeah. Oh, shit. Okay, before you go, let's talk when you have brain space and get to know each other over like Instagram or something. I don't have Instagram. Do you have WhatsApp? Yeah. Do you want to give me a WhatsApp and I send you one message? Sure. Okay, cool. What is the midterm about? Logic. Logic? Philosophy class. Isn't that a thing you cannot study? Yeah, it's like philosophy. Wow. Do you feel prepared? Hopefully. What's your name? Emotion. All the best. Bye-bye. Hi. Excuse me. Hello. You look like a little angel in the madness of New York City. I was compelled to say hi. Wait, before you go, because I need to go the other way. I don't want to walk with you. I'm literally like Wednesday moving to LA. Wednesday moving to LA. What are you going to do there? I've got a job there. As? As a model agent. Of course. Yeah. I'm really sorry. Are you excited? I'm really excited. It will be a great opportunity. You don't need to be sorry. I don't live in New York and I travel a lot. So... Well, when is Wednesday? That's in two days. Yeah. Shouldn't you be packing? Yeah, I work tomorrow. I pack at night. Let's exchange numbers. The world is a small place. Do you have... Instagram. Instagram Because I'm a stranger right would be weird to give me your numbers See As she walked past me as I was crossing the street She looked like a cute innocent shy girl And that's why I use that opener like you look like an angel in the madness of New York City, which usually If she's a shy girl, I cracks them up. She's like, oh, that's so cute. He She actually it turns out she's like a confident model who's moving to LA because she's got a model job so my advice is Don't give overly big compliments to girls where you are pretty sure They are paid to be beautiful because they hear it all day every day And if you don't another guy like you're an angel, you're so beautiful. You're great. You're sexy They're like, all right, I get it. Yeah, I've heard it many times So I would open them differently usually but I miss read that one.
