Good, I'm James. Happy. Not selling anything, just think you're cute. Thanks. Yeah. That's it? Well, who knows? We'll see. Yeah, what are you doing? The purpose of what we're trying to do here is to start looking at your inner world, looking at the way that your mind, your body and your emotions interact, interrelate, right? So one of the things that we'll be working on a lot here is Mostly people do what? With the voice in their head. They talk to it all day. They switch in and out from being the voice to listening to the voice, but it's always there. It's your voice, probably. Maybe not. And that narrative becomes your story, right? That's how you navigate through the world is filtered through this internal story that you're running. Now, some people run really effective internal stories. In my opinion, if you have a rigid mindset that you know that you are a master of anything, you stop learning. I'm not a master of anything. Please don't call me master of anything. Sometimes people do and it embarrasses me because I'm nowhere near a master of anything. I'm just some steps along on some pathways that I've invested time into. You want to be able to maintain a beginner's mind, as they say in the Zen traditions. A mind that is as devoid from you placing meaning over the top of what is apparent reality as possible. And if you do choose to place a meaning over it, that you're doing that positively for a purpose. It's not that like if I say to myself, I'm a boss, all women love me and they all want to fuck me all the time. And that's not, I haven't experienced that lately or ever. I can't just say that to myself and expect it to do much at all, except make me feel like a hypocrite really. Or like to grin, you know, just to be grinning like I'm good, I'm hot, I'm sexy, everyone loves me. That kind of positive self-talk doesn't work if you don't believe it. And the fake it till you make it thing, I think is not a great way to view life, right? It's not like there's, like step out and do something you don't quite know how to do and fail at it or succeed at it in that moment. That's kind of faking it till you make it in the sense you guys are going to do that today. You're going to go out and fake it in the sense you'll be running up straight into, not immediately, but later in the day, you'll be running into going up and just doing cold approaches on girls. Some of you have never done that before. So you don't know what you're doing. You'll have some basic ideas and some roadmaps. We're not going to overload you with technical theory today because if we do, you'll just get overwhelmed. Today is about throwing you out there for us to see where you're at. So it's diagnostic. It's also for you guys to go out there and try out a bunch of tools. The emphasis for today is on awareness and social freedom. So really it's all about awareness. So we're not dying. That's a good thing. Yeah. I mean, we start to get used to it. Yeah. I feel the reaction is really more about the girls as well. If they're uncomfortable, they try to go away from the situation somehow. Even if the reaction is bad, it's their own. It's their feeling. The reaction is about themselves and about us. Even with bad reactions, I was feeling I would be more and more, but actually let go. You just walk away. That's it. Hey, excuse me. We're going to work on this, but you need to push from here. So think of it like this. I'm talking through your head. Like where I'm aiming for is back here. Right? So in that way, I'm projecting through you instead of kind of trying to get it to you. You know what I mean? Hi. How are you? Good. I'm James. Not selling anything. Just think you're cute. Thanks. Yeah. That's it? Well, who knows? We'll see. Yeah. What are you doing? On my way home from work. Rough day. Long day. Fun day. No, great day. I love my job. Yeah. Why? What do you do? I'm a matchmaker. So am I in a way. Yeah. Yeah. Cool. So people sign up and they go, I want this type of someone to, and you hook them up? Yep. Find rich men in New York love, that type of thing. To meet with young, pretty women. Yeah. You work in seeking arrangements, don't you? Kind of. Well, you have to pay them to do that, obviously. They don't do that normally. Did you see my, the, the way that I opened? I just was like, I mean, I was like, like we're old friends. Excuse me. Sorry. I'm not saying anything. So you're walking. What's your name? Sorry. I have to go. All right. Nice to meet you. Excuse me. So you're walking and I just want to say that I like the color of your dress. It combines with your bag. What's your name? Where are you from? Oh, so where are you up to? So what was strange about that is the position you decided to have the conversation in. She's here, we're facing this way and you're having this conversation here. So this is like, she's not really there. Like she's still going. She's just paused. So, okay. You managed to, you know, you tried to stop her and then she, and then she ended up here. What should you have done? Just come around to the front. Yeah. Just get into a position where it's like, this is because this is like a weird guy trying to like have a conversation half across my shoulder. Okay. We ended up stopping that way. Well, reposition myself. Here I am. Hey, excuse me. I saw you walking from over there and I think you're a very lovely person. Thank you. Where are you going? Hey, I saw you walking from over there. I think you're an attractive girl. What's your name? Thank you. My name is Wendy. Wendy. Alonso. Nice to meet you. Alonso? Alonso. Where are you up to? I'm meeting my friend. Look, maybe this is sound crazy, but I think you're a lovely person. Would you mind if I get your phone number? I'm not lonely. Yeah. We can go for a coffee maybe sometimes. Where are you from? I am actually from Mexico, but right now I'm just looking around the city. Great. Trying to find a place. I don't know. Great. So where are you up to? Right now I'm just having a, came to a seminar, which is about meditation and how to relax your body. We're on a break. So I saw you there and I said, wait, no. Express my feelings to that lovely girl. I just like this park and I just like walking around here. Yeah. What do you like about walking around? Is it the people? You see different people, you know, find some cute things here. Okay. What kind of cute things do you like? It's hard to describe, but you just feel it. Yeah. Maybe it's the people, atmosphere, the colors, the noise, the energy. All right. I have to go, but let's, let's make that coffee. You don't mind? No, maybe it sounds strange, but I don't really give strangers my number. That's fine. If you have maybe your WhatsApp, Facebook, whatever you feel comfortable with. Okay. What kind of social media do you use? Look, if, I mean, if you don't want to give me your phone number, that's fine. I mean, I wouldn't be a fan. We don't know like this guy out of the blue what he's doing. You take the decision, but again. But nice meeting you. All right. Nice to meeting you. Have a nice day. Bye. Okay. Well, that was a vast improvement. So things you did well was you, you pre-framed, you stopped her, you got into a decent chat. Now the problem was you asked her, asked her out and she was a bit like, I'm not sure because of this and that. And then you handled it well initially. Right. We were like, Oh, well, you know, we don't, I don't know. We don't know each other. I know it's a bit strange. You were acknowledging her thing. Good. But then what she said was, well, and then when you ask her at the end, well, let's do that coffee, which was good. That was good. Like you tried soft, soft close. She was like, I'm not sure you made a bit more rapport. And then you went back to try and close again. She said, Oh, I don't really give my number out to people in the street. That to me sounds like she wants to, right. Cause she didn't say, I don't give my number to people in the street. She was like, I don't usually do this. And she's like hinting that I don't feel a hundred percent comfortable with this, but make me feel. And then you made it too easy on her to say no. You're like, Oh, cool. If you don't want to give me a number, that's fine. You don't have any social media. That's fine. That's where I, that's where you could have just said, well, I can understand why you don't do that usually, but you can see, I'm going to, you can see I'm a lovely guy. I guess we can get a cup of tea in public and see how we go. Stop. Cause then, cause you were, she was sort of starting to give her objection and you kept on making it easier to her to say no. Yeah. So I think that probably could have been turned into a yes. Yeah. But you were good. It was good though. Like you, you handled the initial objection. Uh, you are repeating what she says a lot, which is a common early mistake. Nearby. How long have you been here? Three years. Wow. And this is the first time I'm calling you out on that. Start to be aware of it. It doesn't change instantly because it's a, it's a, it's a stress related habit, but okay. Now you're aware of it. Try not to do it. Okay. But that's, it's getting better. Uh, so I've never really cold approached a girl without having the interest or the signals of really, really strong signals that I could think, okay, that's going to be an easy thing. Somehow while it's trying to cold approach, it was always so many things happened to my body that it really never went there. In this split second where I saw the girl, it was like my feet would walk away in the other direction. So I actually really never cold approached a girl. Yes. It makes me really, really excited. Uh, it makes, of course just the, the, the thought about it makes my, my heart pump and my body react to it, of course. Um, but really having someone besides me or training me in what will happen or what could happen, or just really having someone who knows what's going to happen and makes me feel very safe about what's going to happen. So I really give myself away in other hands, in professionals that know what they're doing. When a really hot girl goes around the corner and you say, ah, I missed that. I don't want to miss that anymore. It happened so often to me in life. And now I want to take action and really go after that second where my brain says, or my feet say, go walk away. I want to go into this fear. I cannot imagine now on my level I am now. I cannot imagine what's going to happen in a week or two. Hi. I just thought you look very interesting. What are you up to? Excuse me. Hi. Hi. How are you? I'm not trying to sell anything. Just try. I saw, I thought you look interesting. Say hi. What are you up to? I'm meeting some friends. Okay. So you're from here then? If you have friends here? Yeah. Oh, that's good. Yeah. Yeah. Have a nice day. Thanks. One thing that's interesting, and it'd be good if Adam can play it back to you so you can hear. You're hearing what his voice does, right? So when you're, when you go into set initially, you suddenly go up like this. Excuse me. Hi. Hi. Now that will change, right? That is first stage it is. And I can, so I know that I can see you as tense. It's all right. We're just going to have to move through this, right? So, okay. We can take, you know, you can take moments of breaths to check through it, but it's like, okay, you're in the, you're feeling elevated. It's, it's, it's overwhelming in some ways. Let yourself be overwhelmed. I mean, just let it move through you like it's a, I don't know, some fucking virus that's coming through and moving out. The other thing is when you leave, when you decide to end or like, it feels like it's falling apart, do it with dignity, right? So even if, even if it's like this, I'm talking and then you walk off on me, right? I'll say, well, have a good day to the back of your head. I'm going to go now. Right. So don't let this thing happen, which is happening where it's like, you're sort of just like giving up and it, and it melting away. Right. That's not good for your mindsets. Yeah. Like, okay. It's I understand that you're like, ah, just fuck it. I'm going to get out, but do that consciously. Go. All right. If you just totally can't do anything else, say, all right, well, have a nice day. See ya. And then, so you're leaving, you're exiting. You're not kind of just being blown out, right? Do it for you. Cause it's, it's good for clarity of entry and exit. Uh, okay. Let's try again. Well, it is getting better. It's really exhausting because you have to not think about too many things. So it's going to be a good night's sleep tonight. I mean, that's why we're here, right? To get things. If we know everything, I wouldn't be here. And so it's work and it's play. It's a grind. It's awesome. It's all these things you're starting to see. Okay. And it is the first day, which is the hardest day. You guys don't have much experience. You don't know what you're doing. We're throwing you into the most advanced city in the world. You're doing fine. You're surviving. All right, do some more headphones in. Don't worry. Nothing's wrong. I don't want to sell you anything. Everything's fine. Don't be afraid. Uh, I just thought you look very interesting. You're on your way to, Oh, I'm just going home. Oh, you're going home. So you're from here. Yeah. So you have that every day that people just talk to you around and need something with music, I suppose. Okay. So the violin. Okay. That's cool. Is it like, okay. Can you do that as a job? Are you, are you playing in an ensemble or something? Yeah. That sounds interesting. Yeah. Cool. Well, I don't want to take any more time. Have a wonderful day. Go and ask for a number. Do it again. Go and ask for a number. So yeah, I completely forgot. I'm sorry. No, sorry. I have to bother you again. I would really like to meet you again. I mean, you're from here. I'm staying a couple of weeks, a month, maybe here. Maybe if we could connect again, if you're willing to. Would you swap numbers? My number? Yeah? Yeah. Cool. You're using WhatsApp here, or what are you using? No, I don't have WhatsApp. But the number would be fine, right? Um, 914. Hi. Very nice. I'm Marco. Nice to meet you. What's your name? Cheyenne. Cheyenne? Yeah. Very nice to meet you. Talk to you soon. Have you ever done that before? No. Awesome. That's good. Look at that look in his face. Yeah, I want more of that. Awesome. You triggered me now. Yes. Now, what was the difference between you not getting that and not getting it? Asking for it. Oh, yeah. Yeah. So, yeah, don't let girls walk away when they're being friendly. Yeah. It's really having a task somehow. Well, it's like, why are you here? You're here to make a connection and you have to get her number to see her again. Makes sense. And you're not looking for approval. That's, I think, I don't know what you're looking for in terms of, like, permission, but it's like, you don't need it. She was quite happy to chat to you. Why not? You always ask. Unless she's giving you, like, weird vibes or whatever. Yeah. So, yeah. Okay, so that's good. Well done. First number. May or may not flake. Don't get too excited, but it's where it has to start, right? Yeah. It was fun, but really, really exhausting as well. Yeah. It's hard, but we keep it up. The first day was hard. I hope tomorrow will be easier. Like a hard workout for your brain. After every approach, it was easier and easier. The girls reacted a lot nicer and better than I ever dreamed of. Every reaction that still didn't went perfect, went perfect in a way. Like, from every interaction I had, there's something I can take away from. There's a lot of interaction that needs to come to practice and to get good. Honestly, on my own, I mean, maybe it would have been one or two approaches, and that's it. Today, it's maybe 10. I don't know. I started asking maybe more. But it's good to have that support from the coaches. Like, if you think you can do it. And at first, it's hard. But eventually, I'm hoping that it will become, like, automatic. It's essential, the coaches. So many things happened today that would have never happened without coaches. I mean, I got my first number just because James made me approach again and ask for it. So I asked for it and I got it. That would have never happened if James didn't kick me in the ass. That was the first number you've ever got? It was, yes. We felt awesome, yeah. And it's not going to be the last one. I'm sure about that. It feels amazing. Like, I think I can't really put it into words yet. It's just, everybody can do it. It's so easy, but, I mean, it was so hard for me at the beginning. And it's still going to be a very hard grind. And it's going to be practice and more things and really grinding it. But, yeah, everybody can do it. You just need the right tools and the right works and the right teachers. Yeah. For me, it's almost a dream come true. Like, absolutely. Like, am I doing this? Yeah, you are. So, yeah, it took a little bit to process, but it's coming out. Yeah, yeah, looking forward to it. Again, it was a rough day, tough day, but it was good. Very good. Quick, very important announcement, but relax. Chill, it's OK.
