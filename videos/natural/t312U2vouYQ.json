First is the hippie chick, the one who is doing yoga classes, she's always going to concerts barefoot or in sandals, she's getting her groceries in those uncomfortable small like linen bags, and she's trying to save the whales by writing letters every month to local politicians. Then there's the religious girl, the one, the good girl, the conservative girl, the one who, you know, is trying to make her parents proud and who is a virgin and is only going to have sex once she got married. Then there's the career girl, the PhD student, the one who's always studying for exams, you know that, you're trying to ask the girl out, she's like, no, I'm busy, exams are coming up, I'm studying, she's not going out, she's fully focused on her career, she wants to make money and that's it. And the flip side of that, the only fence girl, the one who is like, fuck all that, I'm not going to spend years and years studying something to be smart, I'm just going to post naughty photos on the internet, make double the wage that the PhD student ever will make, and she's going to have got flown around to different villas and yachts all year round and has an amazing life, usually she has the best Instagram out of those four. Now, question to you, which of the four are you going to date? What's your dream girl? You have to choose one of the four. I'm just kidding, there's way more girls than that. But why did I start the video like that? Because you should be aware that you want to attract a certain type of girl into your life. As you are a certain kind of guy for girls, you have to have clarity, what are your dating goals? We talk a lot about dating and attracting girls, but do you even have a definition of your ideal partner? Did you ever even sit down and write down what is important to you? And what should she have and what should she not have? Those are questions you should starting to ask yourself. If you want to not end up in a horrible relationship or even long lasting marriage, where you after 10 years realize you've wasted a decade of your life, then make sure to watch this video. Now, when defining and choosing your ideal partner or your perfect future girlfriend or wife, we have to use some metrics, right? Usual metrics can be like looks, values, education, and so on. As you can imagine, the OnlyFans girl who is making money with her sexuality, with her bodies, will have a whole different set of values than the PhD girl who wants to use her brain and her education and her hard work to make money. Usually, the PhD girl maybe is not as attractive as the model, the OnlyFans girl, or even the hippie girl who is outgoing, who is in touch with her body, who is doing yoga, who is doing ballet dance. Another metric can be her lifestyle. Do you want a girl who is really busy and hardworking, who is more free, has more free time, you know, who is ready to go on a little holiday with you? Somebody who is studying all the time will have less time. On the other hand, obviously, you want to have a girl who can hold up a conversation, who can challenge you on an intellectual level. I'm assuming if you watch this channel, you're a smart guy, you want to probably have a girl around you that matches you at least on some level on an intellectual basis. So will the OnlyFans girl or the hippie girl do that trick for you? Or will you be bored really quick and you need a girl who, you know, is studying, who is learning new stuff, who can ask you good questions? As you can see, many different metrics and things that are important for you will lead to different outcomes, will lead to different women that you want to date. So write down a list of things that are important to you and also write down a list of things that are not important to you. Because most guys only focus on what is important. And in my experience, guys end up with a list that something looks like this. They want a girl who is obviously super attractive. She's hot. She's a 10 out of 10. She's at the same time really good in bed. She's super open. You know, she's very sexual. She wants to try out new things. But at the same time, her lay count is less than three. Otherwise, you will not girlfriend her. So she's never basically had sex with anyone, but she really understands how sex works. She is super loyal. Soon as you get her, she will be forever loyal to you because you're such a cool guy. She's at the same time really smart and ambitious. So she's like socially smart. She knows how to charm people, but she's also educated. She knows about things. She can hold up a conversation, has one or two degrees, speaks three or four languages, but at the same time knows how to present herself, takes care of herself, has a sense for fashion and so on. And ideally, she comes from a good family and is not broke. And to the icing on the cake, she's also available to meet you. She's happy to go on dates with you anytime. And if you're planning a holiday or you just want to do a trip because you're a digital nomad, she's always available to travel and come with you. So let's dig into that a little bit. Obviously, you see where this is going. And a lot of guys make that mistake. They think this is their ideal partner and they don't think that this person does not exist. Like basically it doesn't exist, right? You see where this is going. So let's dig a little bit deeper into each of those traits and see where there will be problems, where it will become basically impossible to match several of those traits in one person and figure out what really is important to you and who you will date in the future. First, attractiveness. Every guy wants to date attractive women. Of course, that's kind of what we are conditioned to do, conditioned to want. And I see that a lot on workshops. Guys come to us, they want to get better with, you know, approaching girls, talking to girls, dating girls, ending up in sexual things with girls. And often I would call out girls on the street like, hey, how about you talk to her? She looks cute. And guys are like, oh no, she's not my type. Oh, she's not hot enough. And on the one hand, I, you know, get irritated because I'm like, well, you're here to talk to girls. Why are you resisting? But on the other hand, I understand that after dozens and hundreds of hours of watching porn and swiping on Instagram and basically watching, you know, perfect girls in movies and music videos, we are conditioned to only go for like the top. And we basically then spend, you know, years and years fantasizing and basically watching soft porn because that's what Instagram is. It's soft porn. If you regularly swipe and you look at girls on Instagram that you don't know in real life, stop it. It's not helping your brain. It's setting wrong expectations. You can learn so much about women, feminine energy, relationships, and much more with other types of girls as well. You need to get in reps. You cannot expect to, you know, successfully date the girl of your dreams if you don't have any experience with dating girls. All those little things of like meeting her on a date, you know, leading her to the table, then talking to her, getting into her mind, being able to talk about things she really cares about, then getting up, maybe having an ice cream on the way home and then leading her to your apartment. And she agrees. She wants to spend more time with you. So she walks up to her apartment. How do you treat her in your living room? What do you offer her? How do you touch her? Obviously, you can imagine where this goes because sex is not just this like, you know, perfect thing you see in porn. It can get weird, you know, the condom doesn't fit or you lose your boner and you need to deal with that emotion the day after. You know, what do you do then? Do you kick her out because you got to work or you let her stay in your apartment or, you know, you try to do it gently and you quickly have a coffee, but suddenly you ordered milk and she's lactose intolerant and so on. There's many, many things you can learn. Dating, let's call it a less attractive girl who is still cute, who is still charming. So please don't get caught up on the Instagram world where everything is, you know, airbrushed and Photoshopped and perfect. And then only go for that because even if you get it for a little while, you will lose it very quickly because you just lack experience with women in general. And let me tell you a little secret. Top girls require you to be a top guy. I'm not talking about looks-wise. Sure, you know, be groomed, have nice clothing, smell good and so on. What I mean by top guy is he knows what the fuck he's doing. He knows what he wants. And if you have not experience with other types of girls, the sixes, the sevens, you know, the cute girls, the crazy girls, the top girl will leave you anyway. She will get bored. She won't feel challenged. She will know that she's way out of your league and usually girls don't really date down. They date cross and up. So even if you magically get one of those 10s that you dream about, she won't be with you very long. Because let's think about it and let's be honest, an eight, a nine and a 10 on a bell curve, they're more rare. More guys wanna date them. They have way more offers. If I would guess a nine has like 10 times more offers than an eight, a 10 has 10 times more offers than a nine, an eight has 10 times more possibilities and offers and, you know, invitations to stuff than a seven. So basically a 10 has like a thousand times more access, invitations, offers, being able to do cool shit than a seven, okay? So you need to grind your way up in that sense. So please don't take attractiveness as the only factor when choosing who to date. And not only date, who to talk to, who to open, who to give a compliment to. Stop only looking at the girl's body and face for two seconds and then making a rash decision that it's not worth even saying hi to her, even having a conversation with her. It's not smart. The next point is really important for guys is that she's smart, that she's educated and they always say that she can hold up a conversation. Cool, but what does smart even mean? Does it mean she has a high IQ? Does it mean she has like, she read the encyclopedia and she can quote poets and, you know, understands movie references really quick and she knows bands from the 70s that you know? Does it mean she has a really high IQ? Does it mean she has a degree in a very complicated science? What does smart even mean? I've dated girls who I'm obviously outsmarting because I'm an analytical guy. I probably have a high IQ and I have education in that area. But those girls crushed me when it came to social intelligence, how to charm people, how to get what they want, you know, how to understand even the bigger picture of groups, social dynamics, how girls manipulate other guys to get what they want and so on. So please define, first of all, what do you mean by smart? The second point is why is it so important that she knows exactly the same set of things that you know? I always hear that with guys. They're always like, oh, I need a girl who is, you know, listening to the same music as me or who's even, you know, been to the same countries because then we can vibe on how the church in this city is really beautiful and the architecture and she needs to understand, you know, who were the poets of this century because I know it. Like, what do you get out of a girl that already knows the thing you already know? And you probably will know it better anyway because you're a smart guy and then you're suddenly filtering for girls who kind of know what you know but they're not at that level and then you feel kind of stimulated. You're not dating a girl to get the same emotion that you get when you watch a YouTube video like this one because we understand each other or when you buy a book that you're interested in. You date a girl for many other reasons. You date her to make you feel like a man, to feel sexual vibe, to feel energy and spirit of life and to learn things that you didn't know before. And most importantly, to have somebody who supports you, to have somebody that just feels good spending time with, where it feels better to spend time with her than spending time alone. Sometimes that's not the case. Sometimes you have a girl and you're like, I would way rather spend time alone and if that's the case, you should break up with her. You should have somebody who supports you, where it's a good energy to spend time with you and of course, choose smart but really be careful what smart actually means. You can learn a lot from the OnlyFans girl. You can learn a lot probably from the hippie, you know, spiritual girl if you're not that at all. Doesn't mean you have to become a hippie or you have to become an OnlyFans model. Probably you wouldn't make a lot of money on OnlyFans. I wouldn't. But yeah, be careful what you see as smart and the limitations you put on yourself when it comes to dating smart girls. Because again, it's the same like looks. You talk to a girl, I see that on workshops, guys talk to a girl for 30 seconds or whatever, three minutes and they're like, oh, she wasn't so smart. Like, how do you even know? You didn't ask her a single smart question because you're not smart in communication, which she might be and you made an early assumption on that she's not smart just because she didn't get that banned, weird or whatever movie reference you jokingly told her and she didn't laugh. So now she's not on your level. Bullshit. Please, I'm calling out on your bullshit. Now I can relate with this. You know, as harsh as I'm saying this, I can totally relate with this because I'm Austrian. I have a good education. I have a degree. I have, as I said, you know, probably over 100 IQ at least. And a lot of my identity for a long time came from being smart, being, you know, able to solve problems, being able to understand things faster. You know, I can read some physics thing and I understand it faster than certain other people. So therefore, the girl I date must be on the same level. Otherwise, I'm not dating on my own level and I'm dating down. So be very careful when a lot of your identity comes from your intellect and from your grades and from your, you know, achieving certain results in this. area of life. Very tricky because if your identity comes from that suddenly you assume that the identity of the partner you date also must come from that. Another issue with that is the society is kind of rewarding that behavior, right? It's like wow this guy achieved this and that and this list of things and da da da. Oh what he's dating this stupid gold digger girl? Oh that's really dumb of him. So don't fall into those traps please. The main issue which gets me to my next kind of point on the list is if you both match on the same level of intellect and you know intelligence what might be missing in a relationship is sexual polarity. So let's talk about sexual polarity. Now the next thing that's obviously really really important in a relationship is sex. Good sex, being sexually open, trying out new things, having fun in the bedroom, you know not having the same position all the time. Maybe sometimes having a threesome or using a sex toy or watching a porn together and you know doing what the porn stars do or filming yourself and then watching it while having sex again or you know trying something in in the woods or in a clothing shop in the exchange cabin and so on you know in the airplane and so on, right? Sex is fun. We want to have sex. Good sex is amazing. It feels good. It makes us feel alive and having a strong sexual relationship with somebody is a big part of a relationship. The issue becomes if you go only by the look, basically the picture of a girl because there's a big difference between her sexuality and if she arouses you and she's confident in her body and she knows how to move and she's you know totally fine with herself and the Instagram image that she puts on Instagram. I know girls personally who look amazing on Instagram they have a hundred thousand plus followers, they're on OnlyFans, they're making thousands of dollars on OnlyFans, they look really sexual and they're a virgin. I know those girls personally. So if you only scan by looks and what we just discussed, the intellect, you know the level of degree she has, the level of education, what can get lost is the sexual polarity between you and her. Especially if you guy is trying to work on himself who is you know upgrading in business, making more money, upgrading in fitness, you work on your body, upgrading and just being a boss, a man, being able to lead, being able to you know approach which is very masculine, your testosterone level goes up, who just vibes on a higher frequency. You know you will feel it if you don't jerk off for seven days, you will just feel how you vibrating on a higher frequency. Now if you become this kind of guy, you will want the type of girl who is vibrating on a feminine frequency. Now if you date a girl who is always career driven, always hustle driven, always education driven and trying to study a lot, she will lose the often the feminine side. I mean it's quite logical if I'm a girl and I have to study 60 hours a week you know to to pass my exams, I'm not gonna be in my body the whole time and you know do yoga class in the morning and take time for myself and like you know choose an outfit very carefully and always be perfectly you know my eyebrows always perfect, makeup perfect, no hair anywhere. Of course not, how could you expect that from a girl? Here we kind of start seeing that if you really want one thing you might not get the other thing and where you then have to make a compromise, where you have to start thinking what is important for me right now. Do I really need the PhD girl because that's just the highest importance for me otherwise I cannot stay with a girl in the room if blah blah blah or do I want to have a girl who is open to me, who has more free time, who can come out, who can you know sleep in with me and have sex all day once or who needs to rush off at 6 in the morning to to go to class. Next up loyalty. Now whatever we define as loyalty as in she doesn't cheat or she doesn't look at other guys or you know she's not on Tinder while you're in a relationship or even she's like basically loyal to herself as in she doesn't sleep around a lot. What I want to kind of like get at is be a little more open-minded with the sexuality of a girl. Yes we know the old thing right a guy who sleeps around with many women is you know a player and a game guy and a cool guy and a girl who sleeps around with a lot of men is a slut and that's still really in our society and women have a challenge with that and I think the ministry is not really making that any better like I've heard guys say things like oh my wife if she has a lay count of more than two or three guys I will never marry her you know she basically needs to be almost a virgin and so on and I think that's not a very helpful mindset especially as a guy like you are who wants to improve your dating skills you know your masculinity you want to open up you want to explore things you want to have experiences why don't you kind of set the same standard for a girl you're gonna date one day shouldn't she also have had a certain period in her life where she explored herself and kind of learned what she really likes and what doesn't like and then ended up with you and decided this is what I want do you want a girl who has no idea about her body about her sexuality about any of that stuff sure a lot of guys have an ego about oh I'll be the guy who shows her and da da da guess what you will first need women to teach you all that stuff so you can teach it to a girl in the future and the girls are gonna teach you they gonna be experienced they're gonna have made their sexual experiences and so on do I say you have to marry a girl who has you know a body count of a hundred plus no you know I know that that feels weird even for me I admit it right I'm not that open-minded like some other guys are maybe it has to do with my ego maybe I still have to work on that you know maybe it is insecurity I have a lot of friends in the swinger kind of culture and they say yeah they felt like me but then they entered the swing of culture and they became way more open-minded and now they get a rush when they you know meet like they're a couple and they meet another couple and all fuck each other too crazy for me still but I want you to have at least of a little more of an open mind in that area also understand women want to explore they want to often date casually sometimes they don't have the I need a monogamous boyfriend right now thing on the top of their priority list sometimes they're not just an exploration phase they want to have fun they're in their early 20s let them do it don't judge them you know if you can't handle it don't ask her about her past if you can't handle the answer and develop a little bit of a mindset of you know let's say you hear about a girl and she was on some holiday with a bunch of other girls and some guys and you hear oh she banged two different guys in two days and back then I would have thought what a slut how can she do that that's crazy and now I'm thinking what a slut how can she do that that's crazy right like it's cool now it's for me it's like nice she's open she doesn't care how people see her which actually aligns with my values way more than a girl who is constantly stressed about what other people think who is living in her shell who cannot open up who is basically you know in chains and being held by all those societal structures so you know at least open up a little bit as I said you don't need to go all the way and become a swinger tomorrow but we still have very you know conservative structures in our society and women do have battles with that and I know from a personal experience I'm organizing trips you know where girls can open up where they're not gonna be judged and I talk to them and I know how hard it is for certain girls to break out of that and how much shame they receive when they would tell a little crazy story or they you know post on OnlyFans to make money like I understand a girl who if she's from Ukraine would earn $400 $500 in a full-time job and if she's on OnlyFans and she doesn't even have to you know send any porny stuff to guys just beautiful photos she makes 10 times that more power to her to be honest right she's trying to break out of the matrix of the structure I'm totally supporting thinking like that I like hanging out with girls like that because they teach me something and they're actually vibing on a similar frequency that I am so be careful you know again of judging people too early or putting people in a box or thinking she needs to be this and that and also this which might not all fit into one and the same person the next character trait in a woman that a lot of guys are looking for and I know I'm personally guilty of that one is to find a girl which is super ambitious hard-working and even like entrepreneurial so basically she has her own project she's founded her own companies she's really trying to make money and hustle and you know hack the the money world and increase her income and basically think like a male entrepreneur hustler does like a hustle chick right and this for me personally is tricky because the way I grew up we all graded in the same system you know we're girls and guys in a class and you get grades and pass your exams with certain percentages and then you get certain certificates or not and you get a grade and this is how your employer will you know he will look at that and he doesn't care at all if you're a man or woman so where I'm from from Austria that is very logical to think like that you know and is quite it's quite normal here in this world that if you have a household budget you married and have two kids that the man and the woman both contribute to that budget maybe even on a as much as possible equal way way different in the East you know where it's like very clear that the guy will make a hundred percent of the money and the woman will take care of the kids more she will do the housework she will cook and you know be a housewife I even had like this kind of discussion with my Russian girlfriend she's like when you say housewife you mean it in a bad way and when I say housewife I didn't say it in a positive way so sometimes we had this you know confrontation where I was like you housewife and she kind of felt that I'm like say it in a condescending way and she's like why you say that it's a good thing I'm like really it's a good thing yeah where I'm from it's a good thing it means you have a successful marriage and your husband is working well and you have kids and everything is perfect I'm like wow yeah it's an interesting way to think about it so the issue with that is I'm not saying there is not girls out there work really hard and make a lot of money absolutely they are right I mean look around they're successful women out there what I'm saying is if you a guy who works really hard answer the question why do you work hard why do you make money what are you trying to you know amass more wealth have more disposable income often the answer is to have more freedom to have the freedom to travel somewhere to have the freedom to buy something they have the freedom to do a holiday to rent a car to do a road trip with a girl you know to go on a crazy adventure now if you expect that you find a girl which is everything we listed you know she's loyal to you she's sexy she's good and bad she's good-looking she's funny and then she's also supposed to run her own business she's not gonna be able to to travel with you you know to just leave her business she's gonna also stay at the office till 9 p.m. and so on and my last point on that which is really important to understand a girl's reality is just different her whole timeline is different to a man's timeline we as guys first of all don't rely as much on our beauty so we rely way more on how hard we work how much we suffer how much money we make how smart we act with our resources what we're fighting for what we get then how we are born genetically right of course I'm not saying look homeless like get a nice haircut smell good wear nice clothes I always say that that's actually easier things to fix then you know self-love and overcoming approaching anxiety so do those first but a woman just has a totally different reality just from a timeline her prime in her beauty will be from and I'm generalizing 18 to 28 and she knows right we as guys when we're 18 we're fucking dumb as shit when we're 25 we slowly understand the world 26 27 28 now we're starting to get it and starting to hustle and making you know proper income and so on and that goes beyond in our 30s and 40s and so on most 30 and 40 year old guys are still just children in a man's body really it is that's the way it is now girls have to grow up way faster and they if they're born beautiful and it's the girls we want right if they're born on a scale you know I don't like this scale but it helps because everybody kind of understands it she's more than a 7.5 and works out and as you know keeps her body fit it's way smarter for her I'm sorry to say that but it's way smarter for her to bank on her beauty you know to make a lot of connections to get to meet a lot of people a lot of guys to network to travel around to be invited to things to you know be an image model for a bit like there's girls out there let me blow your mind they make 500 to $1,000 in one evening going to a dinner and eating and talking a little bit with guys for a couple of hours and then leaving nothing sexual they don't have to undress they don't have to send anything or sign anything you know like it would be stupid of them to not bank on that and use their charm and use their beauty to meet a guy who they want to date after if they would spend their 20s getting a degree and getting you know some skills in a job and trying to build a business they will be left at 32 without a husband without their beauty and if it didn't work out and we know it business is hard"}
