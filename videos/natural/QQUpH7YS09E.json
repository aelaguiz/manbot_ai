Alright, here in my robotic Japanese apartment, here's a bunch of buttons which took me quite a long time to figure out. This one here. And now heat. And we go in here, and I want to have a bath, so of course I need to... where's the tap? There's no tap. So maybe I just need to press... Oh, thank you robot. Uh... Boop! Yeah! This is Raccoon Dog. Raccoon Dog. Japanese is tanuki. Uh huh. So I've made it to Yakushima Island, which is this pristine, glorious paradise in Japan. Miyazaki, the Japanese animator, was inspired by the ancient forests of Yakushima to create the mystical environments for Princess Mononoke. In these primeval forests, some of the trees are up to 7,000 years old. And walking here, it's timeless, pristine. I need these times away from the madness, from cities, from people, to reconnect with myself and nature. This continuity of life, in harmony, ongoing. Early morning in Tokyo, and I've just had an amazing trip in Japan. What an incredible and weird and wonderful country this is. And now I'm heading to the airport to catch a flight back to China, where I have not been before. Beijing, baby! Let's see if I remember any Chinese. I still got it. Good morning, Beijing! So I forced myself to get up very early, much earlier than I had to, for my last possible sleeping day before I start kung fu training, because I wanted to see something that I remember being the most special thing that I ever saw in China, which was going to the park in the morning and seeing all the old folk doing their stuff. So let's see if they do that still, or if they don't. But first, I'm going to go check out a hutong. So I'm here in one of the last remaining hutongs, which are the old Beijing suburbs, of which there's maybe half a dozen left, because the government likes to knock them down and stick up huge skyscraping towers full of people. But this one still exists, and this is what China would have been like about 100 years ago. 1970s China, 19th century China. I first came to China 16 years ago when I was a very severe, skinny, intense young man. And I was obsessed with Buddhism and Chinese martial arts, with kung fu, and so I came here to further my studies. And then I took a break for a long time, 14 years, went off and did other things, didn't I? Became an international sleaze merchant. And now I've come back, because I've had a yearning in the last couple of years to come back and do some more training. I found an amazing teacher. And so here I am in Beijing, up early in the morning, about to head off to Dejiao in Shandong province. Behind me they're doing the eight pieces of brocade, which is like a qigong morning ritual. Arrived in Dejiao, Shandong province. Made it to the An family kung fu traditional cultural academy. This is where I'll be living for the next three weeks. This is my room. This is not technically a mattress, it's a torture device. I didn't come here for cushy, rich lifestyle design shit, did I? Is there a difference between a principle and a technique? We're being taken in the school bus with all the kung fu kids to fuck knows where. China's the only place in the world where the girls will open you. The last couple of days have been incredibly frustrating. If you are tired of doubts, fears, anxieties, worries and continual monkey mind self-talk preventing you from doing what it wants, especially when it comes to going out there and meeting strangers, going out there and talking to girls, then I highly recommend you join me on the martial meditation method journey. My most popular ever online course is being re-released on the 16th of September. I've tweaked the course, taken feedback from the previous students and made it extra awesome. If you'd like to find out more about the launch, click the link in the description, put your email in and I'll send you a free video on one of my most powerful and favorite meditation techniques, the sex god breathing method.
