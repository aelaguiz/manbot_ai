You don't grind your way through a meditation retreat. What this period in history gives you or forces you to have the opportunity to have is some time for healing, some time for introspection, some time for allowing yourself to feel certain emotions that maybe you've never allowed yourself to feel. These will not all be positive ones. This is not a motivational video in the sense of I want you to be positive all the time and hustle and be productive all the time and always see the silver lining on every shitty cloud. What I want to look at here is what about the other parts of being human, such as being sad, such as being lonely, such as looking into your past, maybe into your childhood and looking at traumatic events or patterns that were given to you probably by no fault of your own, maybe by your parents or by your social conditioning. That's why I think that you should, yes, hustle, sure, hustle, get shit moving, get buff, get ready to approach girls when you can, learn skills that you haven't had time to do for sure. And I advocate that and I will be teaching that, but I will not only be teaching that. I'm not just a hustle monster. There is this like addiction to hustle culture and hustle porn, right? Because you probably know what I mean by that, right? Like Gary Vaynerchuk, he's hustle porn. He's awesome. Like I check in on him every now and then and every time I'm like, where does this dude get the fucking energy to do this? You know, he is just so positive, so on it. His information is good. You're put in this funny position where you have to always be like hustle, positivity, grind, you know, don't waste time. I don't have time for any of your, you know, insecurities or any of your issues. It's like, that's all excuses. Let's cut through the bullshit. Let's get to the point. Let's hustle. Let's grind. Let's get shit done. Let's execute. Let's make fucking money. Let's increase all metrics and blah, blah, you know, that kind of shit. You just have to do that forever. And that's not really true. I don't think so for most coaches out there because I presume they have bad days. I presume they feel depressed sometimes. I presume they try to do something and then it fails and they feel shit about themselves because they did their best and it didn't work, right? So all of these things. I presume they have childhood issues or things in their past that they probably need to clean up and that still affect them today. I assume this because I know that's true for me. And what I want to talk about more in detail today is this essentially is about healing and therapy, right? This is a time where, yeah, okay, you've got time to do stuff that you should have done. But I would say just as importantly and maybe for a lot of guys out there much more important, probably much, much more important is to use a good chunk of this time to actually heal yourself from wounds that you have either created yourself or have been created in you by other people or circumstances because if you don't clean that stuff up, it will remain with you throughout your life in some form or another and it will tend to calcify. Like as we get older and we tend to get less adaptive and more stuck in our ways, our histories start to get ground in like at first they're like a line in the water and then a line in the sand and then a line carved in rock and then it becomes, you know, these habit patterns become very rigid. You know that because your parents have them, your grandparents had them, older people around you have them. They have these habits that they don't seem to be out of shift anymore. And you can see probably looking at your parents, do you have this clear issue, dad, mom, that I can see if you just did something, anything, like talk to somebody about it, went and meditated for 10 minutes, took some MDMA or something, that you'd probably get some kind of breakthroughs and that can be frustrating when you're a person that wants to evolve and seeing, you know, your parents that you love being unable to evolve even if you offer to help them. I know that that's been a case for me. So I want to say today that firstly, it's okay to feel sad, especially now. It's okay to acknowledge that you're lonely. So allow yourself to feel those things, to feel sad, to feel robbed, to feel cheated, to feel that this is unfair, to feel like all that work you put in for all those years and that thing, which has now just been ripped away from you, that that's a tragedy, a personal tragedy for you, right? And also don't feel guilty that your situation is not as bad as other people's, right? Like I'm struggling with that too because I, you know, when I have days where I'm like, oh, this sucks, I lost, you know, my business is tanked and, you know, I'm away from people that I want to be from and I'm like, well, I've got it fucking sweet compared to everyone in India or, you know, the 20 million people in the United States who just lost their jobs or the people that are fucking dying, right? Or the people that are directly living, you know, have had family members or close friends die. I haven't had that happen in this situation. So you can have a bit of survivor guilt where you're like, oh, I shouldn't feel any negative stuff because other people have got it worse. Now I'm not saying don't have empathy for other people and don't, if you can help others, you know, you can donate money or you can help in some kind of way. You can get on one of those things where you talk to a granny in a retirement home to make her feel like someone cares, like, yeah, sure, don't be selfish, give if you can and in ways that you can. But at the same time, you need to allow yourself to feel your own personal tragedy and not just now, right? This video is, okay, it's happening in the middle of the Corona crisis in 2020, but I would hope that in five years, I don't know, I mean, hi there five years from now, please tell me what like the very old, the very young and the very infirm tastes like when you put them in a smoothie because that's the dystopian reality you guys are living in now. Silent breed is people! I don't know what it's going to be like, probably not that bad. But my hope would be that you could watch this at any point and, and, and even if that means taking a weekend to yourself to actually maybe for the first time, acknowledge your own pain, acknowledge your own sadness and loneliness, acknowledge the fact that your parents fucked you up in some way, which most of them did, right? Because they weren't given the perfect handbook on how to do this. You should, right? Because hustling and pushing and working does not solve those things, right? It solves other things, right? It solves poverty sometimes, you know, if you get to get it right. It solves a feeling of like not, not achieving things like of course, hustling and hard work and smart work is very important. You don't hustle your way through therapy, right? You don't, you don't grind your way through a meditation retreat. You take time to sit with yourself and when and if necessary to sit with a therapist of some sort and go through things and that and that's what I really recommend that you do."}
