Yes, today's a good day to talk about storytelling. All right, let me tell you like a not particularly interesting story, because I mean, I have interesting ones. Let's just one occurred to me and maybe you've heard me say it before as an example of a boring story done well. So when I was in my mid-twenties, I started learning the trumpet. So I played flute most of my life and then I had a band and I picked up a trumpet and was blowing it. And I'm like, maybe I could do some horn lines. And so I thought, well, go and get a teacher. I want to speed this up. And I found this trumpet teacher who was about my age and she was hot. She was really hot. So I found her through a friend of a friend. And I would go over to her house and have mad sexual tension. At least that's what I thought. And we would be in her room, like practicing. And, you know, she would be teaching me trumpet. She was very good at it. And it's fucking sexy watching a woman's cheeks inflate and like abdomen, you know, because you have to look. You should be like, look at what my belly's doing. Like I am. I'm looking. Oh, yes, ma'am. She would, of course, give me homework, things to practice. And some weeks I did and some weeks I didn't. And there was this week I was going, I was riding my bicycle to see her and I hadn't done any practice for the whole week. And I was talking to myself, like thinking of excuses to tell her. And like, how could I fake it? I'm like, I can't, you can't fake getting better at the trumpet. You need to be practicing at least an hour a day to keep your embouchure tight because the moment you don't, you lose your fucking perky trumpet lips. So I'm just riding along thinking, gosh, fucking excuse. And, you know, I care because she's hot and I want to impress her. And I know and I've seen that look on her face before where she just gives me a look of like, why are you here? Like you didn't do any practice. I'm like, ah, yeah. And riding along thinking about this. And then I hit a bump and I stack my bike like I haven't done in years. And I flip and fucking stack it and really fucking hurt my hand. And I get up and I'm touching it, touching it. I'm like, oh, oh, oh, I think it's broken. And I felt elated. I was like, yes, thank you, universe. This is my excuse. I broke my fucking thumb. So I text her on my old school phone. I'm like, hey, it's a crazy thing happened. I just was riding my bike, fell off. I think I broke my thumb, can't come. And I was liberated. Of course, I went into the hospital or the doctor or whatever. And so I'm in the waiting room and there's me. And then there's a girl with a mother like a seven year old, eight year old girl with a mother who's like broken her elbow. And she's there crying and I'm first in line. So I go in. He's like, yeah, if I can break your thumb, start strapping it up, you know, does the cast. And then says, oh, doctor says, what color cast do you want? I said, well, what are they all white? He said, no, no, we got like pink and blue and stuff. And I thought it wouldn't be funny to get a pink cast. I said, I'll have pink. All right. And so he straps me up and I'm like, this is hilarious. Like, I'm a badass, masculine man. I've got a pink cast and I got out of my trumpet trumpet class. Awesome. And I walk out feeling quite pleased. And they give me some nice drugs. So I'm a little bit high. They're standing doing the whatever paperwork. And then the doctor goes to go, oh, hey, there you had. What happened? She's like, I fell off my something. And she's like, oh, that's all right. Well, we'll fix you up and we'll get you a nice cast. What color would you like? You would like a pink one, wouldn't you? She's like, yeah, pink one. And he goes, hang on a second. He just goes into the office and he comes out awkwardly and he goes, yeah, we've only got blue left. And then the mother and the daughter look over at me. And there's me, 23 year old man with my pink cast, like obviously just taken the last pink one. And I'm like, I'm out of here as the girl is screaming and crying. I wanted a pink one. And I walk out into the into the street. So there's the story. Now, I could totally tell that story like this. I was riding my bike once and I was a bit stressed out because I didn't practice for my trumpet lesson. I was learning trumpet and my trumpet teacher, she was like hot. So like I was a bit embarrassed and then I fell off my bike and I broke my thumb. And I thought, oh, fuck, that's great. I don't need to go to the lesson anymore. And so then I went into the doctor and like the doctor said, what color do you want? He said he had pink or blue. And I said, oh, that'd be funny. I had a pink one. And then I walked out of the walked out of the office and there was a girl there and she was like six, seven or something. She was crying. And the doctor said, oh, what color do you want? And she said pink. And then he said, oh, we ran out of the pink ones. And then she was crying. And I was like, oops, I got the pink one. And then I left. All right. So same story. One, I would say, was the most interesting and fascinating and scintillating story you've ever heard. And one was not. So tell me why. Like, OK, so what were what was the elements that made that? And I'm not again, I'm not I'm not going to live and die by this story. It's not the greatest story of my life. But OK, so what happened in there? Right. So I said I said I said a scene first, like an emotional tension between me and the trumpet player. And and the story is not about that at all. It's about a little girl who I was an arsehole to by stealing her cast. But in order to set that tension up like I could have sure I could have like cut all that section out. I could have said I could have just started with like I broke my thumb once. The story would have worked fine as well. But OK, so we're creating this tension of like a status exchange between me and this hot trumpet player. The internal monologue of what's going on for me, the tension of because you think the story is going to be about how I resolve things with the trumpet player, but it ends up being this other occurrence happens that then derails the story and it takes it in a new direction. Yes, I'm talking about my feelings in the situation. And like I'm doing an impression of, well, the trumpet teacher's disapproval and then the doctor who's caring and so on. And then the child and embodying the child's like emotion as well. So you can have that juxtaposition of like, oh, whoops. OK, so that's kind of cringe and kind of funny, you know, and it's like it's cruel in a way, but it's not the end of the world. Like I didn't I didn't break her elbow. It's not my fault. It was easy to identify with you, right? Because like, you know, what's the lesson or whatever? It's just like human stuff. And I'm showing myself as, you know, flawed and that this series of kind of like slightly disastrous events ends in this in this comic moment. All right. So and the other one, like I still said the other one with kind of expression, right? When I gave the other impression of it, I didn't just say I fell off my bike. I broke my thumb. OK, so I'm still like trying to explain it. But then I'm kind of losing myself because I said, oh, yeah, the trumpet player was hot, but so what? Right. Like that doesn't doesn't mean anything. It means something in the first version where I talk about the tension of like she's hot, so I want to impress her. And I feel like there's central tension between us, but there's probably not. All right. So the fact that she was an attractive young woman made was relevant in the story, you know, as opposed to like same thing as like I've got a hot lawyer right here. And so the story I'll tell about her is like, oh, you know, I had this dodgy as fuck lawyer. He was great in that he could just work in amongst the cracks. He had this little sign on it on his desk that says a good lawyer knows the law. A great lawyer knows the judge. Like, you know, that tells you all you need to know about that character. Right. You're just like, oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Better call Saul, Hungarian style. Yeah. But he is dodgy and he charges too much. So my friend hooked me up with this other lawyer and I walked into her office and I was like, nope, I have to leave right now. She's too hot. Right. Like I can't relax and tell her about my dodgy business practices when she's sitting there being that hot. Right. Like so in that situation, OK, the the characteristic of the of the character, her attractiveness or the weirdness of someone or the madness of someone makes sense and it's sewn into into the story. What else is going on in there? Yeah, there's the there's the pressure release of that. You don't know until the end. Well, until close to the end, what the story is about. That's that's like, you know, the secret of good comedy. Unless the unless the comedian plans it in such a way that he wants you to know the punchline just before he delivers it, because you're you're in on the joke in advance, sometimes I'll do that. But a good comedian creates tension, creates a dissonance and then resolves it in a way that you don't expect, which is where you laugh. Like that creates creates the humor. They all go, this fucking thing sucks. I can't get it to think. Give it a second, would you? What else is going on? There's a there's a clear like there's a clear point. Like I know what my punchline is and that the punch and I have to be aware of how I deliver the punchline because you can fuck up the punchline so bad. I know in that circumstance, the punchline is about the, you know, the girl finding out that she she can't have the pink one. OK, that's that's the little moment where it's like it's a disaster. I'm like, oh, fuck it. I'm out of here. And that's the end of the story. Right. So you want to be aware of, OK, what's the point of your story? Where is it going? Does it have a point? Because many people start just telling a waffling story, which which doesn't really go anywhere. And even though something amazing or hilarious may have happened, they can't express it properly. Because if you just say, and it was hilarious and it was amazing and it was so weird, it doesn't matter with how much expression or passion you say that the person has to be there mentally in order to understand the hilarity of it. Right. So I have to be able to pull out a joke or give some example that can put the person in the situation. I foreshadowed about the girl in the waiting room in the first version. Yeah, that's right. So so I added in the character. So I was waiting in line. There was a girl there who had her elbow broken, but I didn't say, oh, and that girl had her elbow broken. So it's just I'm saying it as if it was just I was in the thing. There was a person there. There was a person there. But I know that character is about to become very relevant. But I don't want you to know that yet. All right. I want you to know that there was a young girl with a broken elbow, but that that's that you like. That's superfluous to the story. And then you find out that actually that is the point of the story. Good day, gentlemen. Today's video is brought to you by our favorite sponsor, which is me, as always. Now, if you'd like to learn how to tell scintillating stories, how to qualify, how to flirt, how to engage with a woman on a sexy and deep level, then you might want to consider joining me for our very last workshop for the year, which will be held in New York City from the 4th until the 8th of October. And we have one spot left. So I'm talking to you, that one guy who's going, fuck you. I want to hang out with James in New York and learn how to pick up chicks. Click the link below. Get on a call with Alex. Grab the spot. We'll see you in New York soon. Back to the video. There's some there's you know, there's some like in terms of like examples of what makes a good story, setting the scene, putting yourself as the primary character and evoking something about the way that you felt or what was going on for you. If I'm bringing new characters in, I want to paint a picture about them quickly by giving them some characteristics. So all you know about the trumpet teacher is she's attractive. She plays trumpet well, and she's a bit of a hard taskmaster. And I feel intimidated by her. Right. And that's all we need to know about her in the story. There's there's action where I'm deliberately misleading you, right, by by talking about how I'm feeling, riding a bike and so on, because that's the setup. And, you know, you see that in like Simpsons or Rick and Morty or whatever, where the first three or five minutes of the thing is like some wacky adventure, which then creates a segue into what is the main story. And you don't always have to do that, of course, but it's a good storytelling technique. It's like I thought I'd give a little pre story, set the people, get them interested. And then you find out that, no, it's actually about something else. And it leads them on a on a journey. Right. So it's like a narrative journey through the through the story. Chekhov's gun, is that the don't pull a gun out on stage unless you're willing to use it? I think that's it, right? Unless unless it's Money Heist. Money Heist breaks that in every episode. Who bothered after season one? Because they always just do Mexican standoffs. Everyone pulls out guns and then says cool Spanish stuff. And then no one gets shot. No me jodas, Berl\u00edn, que esto no es una pel\u00edcula de Tarantino, eh? Yeah, that's where they lost me. They broke the Chekhov's gun rule. Now, if I was doing that live, I'd be checking in with you, right? So I'd be talking to the audience, whether it's one or a group, creating those pauses, making sure I got the person's attention. Sometimes I'll check in with an audience if I'm telling a story. So like, you know, you know how it feels when you just haven't done your fucking homework, right? And then someone says, yeah, it's like, all right, let me tell you about a time when I didn't do my homework. Cool, so I'm engaging the person, checking them in, and I'm again, deliberately misleading you that it's about missing the homework when it's actually about something else. But I want your attention before we get there. If there's a gun on the wall in the first act, it must be fired in the second act. These are the rules. Cool. What we can do with this. Let's put this as a bonus mission. Sit, sit down and pick out a story. And sure, you can choose something that's really interesting, right? Like I was in my head. I was like, should I tell them the Mongolian bar fight story? I'm like, nah, because that sounds interesting to start with. It happened in Mongolia in a bar. And I'm like, cool, that has interesting components already. But see if you can, like, look through your life. And these things happen, right? They're not about the most amazing adventures. They're about human foibles, about misunderstandings, about embarrassing situations. They're about the human experience. Sure, if it happened on a fucking spaceship or in some exotic location or something cool, that might be interesting to add colour to it. And when I'm telling stories about adventures in exotic countries, I don't rely on it having happened in India. I'll create a little picture around what that experience of India was like. You know, like the time when I got kidnapped in India. I went travelling in India when I was 18. And by the time I got there, I thought I was a pretty seasoned traveller. Like I'd been through Southeast Asia. I knew how to bargain. I knew about scams. I knew what to eat and not drink. So you didn't get the shits every day. And I get to a train station in Jaipur. And I know that when you get out of the trains in India, you don't say yes to the first person that comes and offers you a rickshaw because they're all working for various scammers and mafia and people who are trying to sell you carpets and whatever. So I got out being an 18-year-old, well-travelled, don't fuck with me, I know what I'm doing kind of kid. And I walked past everyone. I was like, nope, nope, not interested. And I walked right up to the back of the car park where there was a gentleman sitting in his rickshaw being quiet. I went over and I said, excuse me, can you take me to the Pink City Guesthouse? And he said, of course, sir. And we got in and I was congratulating myself. I'm like, yeah, I know how to do this country. And so he drove me around the corner and then he got out of the rickshaw and he walked away. He just left and I'm sitting there. And then another gentleman with a big moustache, short guy, walks up and he says, allow me to introduce myself, sir. My name is Freedom. I will be your driver today. And he got in the rickshaw. So there's the start of the story, right? Do you want to know what happens now? Too bad. So it's like, you know, it evokes imagery again. I mean, I could have coloured the imagery of the train station more. But, you know, and it creates the situation of like, OK, I'm making a little fun of myself. I'm proud. I know. I'm doing you know I'm experienced and really the story is now setting me up for a fall right because I think I do I think I'm in control of the situation and then suddenly I'm not. So in these these kinds of way where this creates the curiosity hook sets the scene and by now by now the audience is interested. A good story like a lengthy story should have multiple either punch lines or like moments of levity or moments of like whoa rather than necessarily relying on like one big punch line you know in amongst that story which ends with me being robbed and kidnapped essentially. When I'm telling it there's interludes where you know I meet I meet a girl who gets involved in a scam and me and her a little bit of a romance and then I and then there's danger and then I and then I make sure that I help them escape right so that's and that's part of the you know the tension and then like what happens that girl and I won't go into the whole thing now but you know there's there's multiple points with it where it has moments of tension release or moments of surprise and then you know leading to the to the final you know outroad punchline or the resolution of the story. It's not necessarily about whether there was a lesson learned and often like I think good stories will say good things about you maybe like it may may represent aspects of you but if but if it's too obvious that I'm like and then I gave all my money to all the poor people or you know I'm such a great guy as the punchline of a story then people can certainly see that as just bragging but if it's like I'll take I'll take the piss out of myself I'll build my ego up in the story to then have it shattered you know I will embody the cringe and embarrassment of the certain moment so that you can be there with me like feeling my awkwardness or all my awesomeness or the thing that I did so well but I can't believe that I pulled it off right like so within that you get to go on the emotional journey with me empathize with me hopefully and even if the story is not relatable in the sense you haven't experienced anything like that specifically the human aspects of it are relatable because look I've certainly been around plenty of like especially like wealthy adventurer types who just want to go who just go like everything that someone says goes oh that reminds me we were sailing once in the North Atlantic and blah blah blah and just it's always just like and I will tell you impressive anecdotes about people I know rich places I've been how I'm awesome exciting things that I do that you don't do you know like these kinds of things tend to not that's not particularly charming and one or two or three of those like I know even I've even known people who all their stories are good but it's always there it's always about them right like it's it's just that there and it's and some sometimes those people I'll be like cool I'll listen yeah it's like that's a fascinating story that's another fascinating story but it's really done as a brag or as a performance and that person has no curiosity in me and so they're in it they're entertaining possibly or they're holding court which is a thing but it's not actually drawing me closer to the person it's just making me see them as like a two-dimensional kind of like character and and I like characters I like people who like I mean it's interesting to me I'm like wow that person is so themselves so oblivious to everyone else around them so self-centered and absorbed but it is kind of fascinating so I'll watch it I'll watch the show all right but I but I don't feel like I'm actually connecting as I was saying like a mission you can do is record a story video audio preferably let's I would say not written because that's a different totally different art form to be a good writer who can evoke a story sure like that's that's a great thing too but we're talking about live communication here so I want you guys to sit down and plot out pick your story it can be interesting can be boring you know technically boring or whatever like mine one was it's not like technically that interesting the things that happen but you can see how you can make it interesting so look at paint the scene create whatever characters need to be as succinctly as possible with what only what is needed for them and sometimes like you have to you have to paint a bigger character picture before we get into the story right so I'll tell you about a client of mine and and and I need to like give some idiosyncrasies and give some quotes of his to like set the scene of like what kind of guy this is so that then when we get into the action it might he's not just a name it's someone that people have like imagined that we've got possibly a misdirection like I just did with you where it looks like it's going one direction but it's actually going another direction so it's not easily predictable well in advance where this what's going to happen in the story or the people think that they know what's about to happen and then you rip the rug out from underneath them and send them in another direction at the end which is also advanced storytelling let's say there's a journey right so there's like something happens we're building it through the narrative you're there with me in terms of my emotions the other characters emotions as needed and then we have a clear sense of like what is the point of the story you know is is the only point that we were in an interesting place like and and wow I can't believe we went to dinner in Mongolia or something like it's like that's not enough and people will if people apply it they'll still be like oh wow interesting but it's not that not necessarily the reaction that you're really after which is to enthrall to surprise to show pathos and empathy to paint yourself you know in not just in a good light but in a human light right so from that story you can tell a few things about me that I'm not scared of showing right that like you know that I have an ego that I'm I can be petty that I'm intimidated by a woman that I stole something off you know that I just fucked with a child and was like well see ya you know like okay it's not I'm not evil I'm not but I'm not a hero in this story it's just like I'm human and they can then they get to feel human too what are the difference be between performing and the more connected type of storytelling well I mentioned checking in I'm not gonna finish the Indian maybe I'll tell the Indian story later it is like you do need to hold court when you tell the story right so it's like I am going I'm telling a story now once I'm committed to the story I'm gonna do it if I don't get interrupted and like I'm not checking in all the time to me you know it's that that obviously could get weird too right so if I'm like oh I broke the thumb and I got I was fucking hurting like have you ever broke this have you ever broken a bone tell me how it felt right like that's irrelevant now I'm now I'm just like pandering to the audience as opposed to just checking in maybe once or twice if necessary and like I don't always check in the checking is often just the eye contact it's the person smiling and engaging with me it's the timing of it and so you know I'm telling a story and then their their text message being goes off or something and maybe they look at it I'm not gonna keep rolling I'm gonna I'm gonna pause for a second and and you know allow attention and make sure that I have their their attention again or some something we're doing we're talking in a bar and then I'm telling a story and then something happens someone comes in the barman offers a drink whatever it breaks the story then I need to pick it up again and and it won't always people won't always go oh so please do go on so you know the barman comes in goes what you want more drinks or something yes thanks anyway as I was saying okay so here we are there we are in the Congo right malaria you know pygmies back back in the story okay so the next thing that happened was or as I was saying so the so the pirates has just said right so you remember that cool and then I go back in so yes I'm reading people's reactions I'm there with them through the timing of the narrative and so yeah I may check in as I wish to if I'm holding court and I'm delivering the story and the person's listening and they're enthralled and then that is it you know it's like okay we're engaged together I don't need to necessarily step out break the fourth wall constantly to make sure that they're paying attention it's just like okay cool do I have your attention or do I need to check in on something or you look a little confused right so yeah what I would like you guys to do as a bonus mission is record a story so plot it out with those those aspects set the scene a hook creating characters as need be building a narrative leading having some kind of tension or perhaps misdirection or confusion and then knowing when and how you're gonna drop the mic right like how you're gonna do your your punchline because if you and especially if you haven't really practiced it you may think that it's just funny inherently but it's not it's only the timing that makes it funny or it's the fact that the person didn't know until the last second what you're about to say and then it becomes funny or it becomes funny because they realize just as you're about to say the thing and they go oh no he's not going to like and that's yeah you got it just at the last second is also good and look honestly I have I mean I don't know how many but I have dozens and dozens of stories that I had an event and then I thought about the event afterwards and I went that's a good story there's an anecdote there and then I told it usually it's because I'm telling one of my close friends straight away I'm like well dude listen what happened and I enjoy entertaining Gareth or Liam or whatever because we get off on like having the stories from each other not just going hey so this happened this happened this happened yeah it's like all right let's let's be evocative let's create the scene even if we're really good friends and we could just get through the details the point is like we want to entertain each other with a story so I've said many of these stories dozens of times and I have short versions of them longer versions of them ones with all the details ones where we just get to like one scene within it and then you know that's part of my charm kit right it's like that I see life as narrative and story and I see all of these story elements heroes journey aspects the fool the confusion the tension the pride of the antagonist getting broken down and like all that stuff I'm interested in and I see that in life and so I think of it in story terms so it becomes a practice something that absolutely you become good at I come from a long line of storytellers like my grandfather was a great yarn teller right here he would you know he started what story once he's like in Hill End and Hill End was a town of like 100 people it's like in Hill End in the 50s there was one hooker the name was Joanie Barefoot and she had more more pricks in her than a secondhand dartboard I'm like grandpa grandpa that's now that's the start of a story right and he's like and she had hatchet men and that that's where he started like there's a it's a it's an old gold mining town with 100 people there's one hooker Joanie Barefoot you like already Joanie Barefoot more pricks in her than a secondhand dartboard and she had a hatchet man like I mean whatever the wherever this story's going I want to know I can't remember what the rest of the story was but yeah like you know I come from a line of men who like that that art of speaking in and entertaining and enthralling and creating characters and and going back in time and bringing them those moments to life so yeah it's it's you know it's a it's a skill set it's a performance improvisational delivery type of skill and it's a great one to develop and it's one of the things that like you know if you're going about living a kick-ass interesting poignant pathos filled life you'll collect them like it's just like by me going about my life stories happen I think of them in narrative terms and often record them to myself as well just for my journaling like you know sometimes I tell myself a journal story which is this happened this happened there was that it was this March we went there because I know I can fill in the blanks but but most of the time when I'm recording those I tell them to myself like I was telling it I'm telling it to my future self let's say and I'm telling it in narrative form assuming that I'm gonna forget because I often do because too much shit if you new to this channel welcome and you should definitely take advantage of my free three-part video series
