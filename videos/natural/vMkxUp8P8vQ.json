Would you like to go for a tea sometime? You seem very lovely. Yes, I am here picking her up, exactly. Because you were late, she had to deal with me. I can see you're a little bit shy. I just think you look adorable. Really nice to meet you. I'm sorry. In Australia, at least two dozen dead, more than 12 million acres destroyed. You have to project your intent through your eyes. Obi Bryant has been killed in a helicopter crash. Do you have Instagram or Viber or WhatsApp? She has to feel your intention. So, if you guys want to meet up tomorrow, I'll be around. Don't talk back to me. Coronavirus. The coronavirus pandemic. COVID-19. The coronavirus. The coronavirus fatalities. I've got to get out of here. I am the world's most locked down man. After six months of being on this farm, we're pretty much not leaving it. I'm about to head back to civilization. Budapest, here I come. All right, made it to the Austrian border. Now we see if this little bit of paper and my ID card will get me back home. Budapest, Austria Budapest, Austria Budapest, Austria Budapest, Austria Excuse me. They work. Man-cancelling headphones. Are you listening to music or are you talking to your mother? Oh, right. Okay, well, say hello for me. Hi, do you want to be on TV? All you have to do is go on a date with me. That's all. We're vloggers. We're influencers. I've got 40,000 followers on Instagram. Come on. 50. Well, I know you're in a rush, but would you like to get a tea sometime with a stranger? A stranger? Sorry. Me. I have a boyfriend. Excuse me, lady. Excuse me. What's your name? Why do you want to know? Because it's polite to find out who you're talking to. I don't even want to talk to you. Hi. How are you? Fine, thanks. Good. You look awesome. You're totally my type, so I thought I'd better say hi. What's your name? Lily. Hi. We both said hi like three times already. Yeah, I know. I'm James. Nice to meet you. Oh, you're brave. What if I'm infected? No, don't do that. No, actually, I had a test. Have you had a test? No, so just don't. It's pretty horrible, actually. They say it's not good for you. It's not good for me. It's not good for me. It's not good for me. It's not good for me. It's not good for me. It's not good for me. No, so just don't. Oh, my God. It's pretty horrible, actually. They stick this thing up your nose and then twist it four times. I don't want any tests, thank you. I don't want... I didn't get the right test. Well, no one seems to care here because I came from Portugal where everyone's being super careful, and then I arrive here and it's like 2019. Oh, answer it, quick. Yeah, I did. I finished a beautiful flight, and... Meeting somebody? Yeah, we're going to go to a mini festival or something like that. Like an underground secret festival? What kind of festival? Yeah, it's like this. Okay, cool. Like a circus performance? My friends do the festival, so it's going to be music. I don't know. We can sleep in a tent, so... Oh, so it's out of town? Yeah, it's like a festival, but a small one, so we can go now. Oh, like it's an illegal one? I think it's legal, but under 500 people you can't do anything. You can't do anything, so... You can have 499 people. Yeah, so we'll try our best. That doesn't make any sense, really, does it? Yeah, I know, I know. Yeah, cool. But I'm so excited because it's summer, the first time I can go anywhere. Yeah, everyone's like really pent up. They have a lot of energy they need to let out. Cool, alright, well, what are we going to do about this? I can give you my number. Good idea. You're full of good ideas. Thanks. You live around here? Yeah, kind of. Me too. A little bit aside, but... Okay, I live down the road. What's your name again? Lily. Lily. And when do you get back from your festival? I think... Three days later, maybe? I think so. Three days later. Yeah, on Friday. That's what they write on the screen. Maybe on Friday. Okay, write your number. As far as I know. Here you go. Just call me. Yeah, my name's James. James, I know. Do you have WhatsApp? I don't have. You just do normal shit. Yeah, but I have iMessage, so... Okay. Bye. Hi. Hi. Whoa. How you doing? Good, how are you doing? Good. Don't sound so suspicious. You look so sexy today. No, thanks. Thank you very much. Yes. Yes, yes. And what's your name? Anna. Do you want to just walk, or do you want to just keep walking away? I was thinking to go and walk and explore. Do you want me to come with you for a couple of minutes? Can you do that? Just to get to know you, see what you're like. See if you're interesting. Thank you. Because, obviously, I'm attracted to you. This is the way men do it. They see someone, they're like, she's attractive, and then they... What's your name? James. James, where are you from? How do you do? Oh, we're just doing that one? Yeah, that one. I'm from Australia, and you're definitely not Hungarian. Okay. What do you do in here? You're Belarusian, aren't you? No. Ukrainian? Neither. Okay. I live here. Oh, you live here. What do you do? I run several businesses online, and I also have a farm in Portugal, which produces olives. Oh, lovely. Why are you here, and why not back in... I've just spent the last six months on the farm, and so I needed to come to a city and see people again. And you? Nice. I'm visiting family. Yeah? Yeah. And what else about you? I don't know. Well, what do you like doing for fun? I like warm weather and just walk and see nice cities. All right. Do you have hobbies or something? Like, what do you do when no one's looking? What do you do on a Sunday morning? Having a big brunch with my friends. Yeah, brunch. Are you any good at cooking? I would think so. Yeah? So, are you Swedish? Where are you from? I don't play guessing games, because they're just for children, so... I live in London. Yeah? But I'm from here. Oh, right. Okay, that's where you've got the mixed accent and the attitude. All right? Perhaps. Yeah. Well, I understand. People in London have to be... I've tried smiling at people in London and talking to them, and they don't like it. They love it. Do they? No. I freak them out. Have to do the right place at the right time. Right. Yes. Well, that's pretty much life in general. Right place, right time. Yeah. So, what do you do now? Oh, I was just going for a walk to get out of the house. I've been working all day on laptops, so I thought I'd get some air and... Home office. Oh, so if you do your own business, you do it wherever you want to? Yeah, wherever, whenever. I mean, I have to do it sometimes, but... Yeah. Yeah, wherever, whenever, basically. But this year has been a bit weird because of COVID, obviously. Everybody's doing the same thing. Either they don't work, or they lost their job, or they're working from home. Yeah, I mean, I just work wherever I am. I used to travel all the time, and then this year I didn't. As Australians all the time do. That's true, isn't it? Aussies are all the time on the way or surfing on the beach? One or the other. Well, it's because once you leave Australia, it's so far away that you can't just go for a week, right? So if you're going to leave Australia, you have to travel for months because it's so far away. But I can't go home now because they locked the country. Yeah. So now I'm in exile. How long have you been here? On and off, and mostly off, but... On and off for eight years, I think. Okay. Yeah, so I mean, I usually spend about four months a year here, and then... What made you come here to Hungary, then? Originally, I was just traveling, like, I don't know, ten years ago. My grandmother was Hungarian, and so I thought I would come and check it out just for, you know, to see, and I liked it. And so I just stayed for one summer, and then I stayed another summer, and then it became my base, and I bought an apartment here. So, yeah, just... Lots of Aussies run Airbnbs and pub crawls here, I found. Right. Yes, yeah, that sounds about right. I can't run an Airbnb in my place because the old Hungarian ladies hate me in the building, and they always cause me trouble. I offered to actually paint the inside of the building because it looks so ugly, and they refused because they thought it was very suspicious that I wanted to do something for free, and they didn't believe me. No, Hungarians do not do anything for free. Yeah, well, I was like, well, to make the building look nicer, it's selfish because I want to live in a nicer building, but they didn't believe me, and they're like, nem, nem. They wouldn't let it happen. They wouldn't let it happen. Do you speak any Hungarian? No, I tried for a little while, and then I gave up. So, no, not really. Yeah, and what are you doing in London? Or were you doing... I already told you what I'm doing in London. I forgot. Oh, wow. Very forgetful. Studying. Visiting family. But you said you lived in London? I am living in London. Ah, yeah, that's what I mean. What do you do there? You just go to visit family? No, I'm visiting here. Yeah, no, that's what I meant. What do you do in London? Well, working in business. Very big corporation. Is it called Big Corp? Crossing around people. Ah, right. Managing a project. Telling everybody what to do, what not to do, when to do, how to do. Does that translate into your social and personal and sexual life as well? Why does it matter? Well, it does matter. You ask me what I do, I do it for a living. Yeah, I know. That's what I'm saying. This is a Segway, you've got a Hornet. I think that's the beer. Ah, no, it's because of your sweet drink. That's what they like. It's good. Yeah, I know, but they can smell it. Or maybe not. It's your matcha. Yeah, yeah. The police came and... It's interesting. It's really good. I haven't seen anything like that. It's really, really good. There's a cafe... You know, in London, everybody drinks kombucha. Yeah, it's disgusting. It looks like a beer. Yeah, I know. It comes in literally like a beer bottle. Yeah, the police came and asked me about this earlier today. Oh, did they? Yeah. Oh, that's fine. They didn't believe me. I'm like, no, no, trust me. This is the opposite. And then they looked at it and then they asked me where I got it. And then they wanted to get some. So, yeah. Yeah. Cool. All right. Well, stroll on. Enjoy your time here. Thank you. You too. Have fun. On the off time? I'm off whenever I want to be. How long are you in town for? For the next two weeks. Okay. Do you want to get a drink sometime? Hmm. Let's see. Why not? Why not people? That's my kind of people. Why not people? All right. Let me take your WhatsApp probably. Yeah. Yeah. Do you remember my name? No. I don't remember yours either. That means we're both guilty. I'm a bit drunk. A bit drunk? What's in there? That's why I'm drinking this. Okay. I've been drinking wine all afternoon with a very good friend of mine I haven't seen for 12 years. Oh, wow. We've been just drinking and drinking and it's way too hot. Oh, okay. Well, now you... Okay, good. All right. So, now remind me. I don't have an excuse because I'm not drunk. I know. I know. Well, it's... Okay. Gotcha. 622. All right. I will text you from a Portuguese number. Are you from Budapest originally? Yeah. Oh, well, then you know, don't you? I know this area, but I feel like a tourist nowadays. It's very weird. Yeah. Sensation. I know. I live in a country for 15 years. Yeah. Is this your first time back in 15 years? Oh, no, no, no. I don't know, but since you lived here. I come here every year. Okay. You know, it's different when you leave the road. I know. I mean, I've been on the road for 10 years, so I don't know what is home anymore. I would kiss you on the cheek, but we'll do that later. See you later, Ana. Bye. Hi. Hello. Oh, you have such a nice smile. Thank you. Yes, what's your name? Rica. Rica. I'm James. Yes, pleased to meet you. I can give you the corona elbow. Thanks. I just came from Portugal where people aren't touching each other, so it's very weird for me to be here with no masks. Do you speak English? A little bit. A little bit? Yes. Do you speak Australian? No. Australian English is very bad English, but I will try to speak slowly. I'm Australian. Why are you here? Because I'm locked out of my country. It's now in quarantine, so I can't go back. Oh my God. So I'm a refugee. No, I live here. I live in Budapest. Yes. No, I live here. I live here too. Oh, good. Good, good. And what do you do with yourself? I study here. Antisocial? Are you antisocial? Not really. No, you seem pretty social. Just a little bit. No, I think you're pretty social. Oh. Oh, what? I'm studying here, law. Down there? Yes. I know this one. Are you a good student? Sometimes. Sometimes. You get the job done. What are you doing here? I have a business. So I have a few businesses, like online business. And then I don't work too hard. I like to relax and have fun. And I do lots of crazy projects. Yeah, I do a lot of different things. You wouldn't believe me if I told you. Try to convince me. Oh, really? Okay. Well, one of my jobs is that I'm a professional BDSM teacher. Do you believe me? Yes. Good. These make you go blind. You don't care. Living on the edge. No problem. I'm too tired. You need the energy. So have you read Fifty Shades of Grey? No, I've just seen it once. Did you like it? Not really. It's not a good book. It's not good literature. It's not a good example. Did you write this book? Well, no. I'm a better writer than that, I think. But it's a friend of mine who is a professional dominant. You know what I mean? Yes. He's a professional dominant. Yes, I know. He said that after this book came out, his business exploded. Before that, it was underground. And after this book, every girl who is a librarian or works in a shop wants to try. So he said this was the best thing to happen to his business ever. Do you understand what I'm saying? Yes. Good. Excellent. Why? Because now all normal girls read the book and they're like, hmm, I want to be spanked and I want to have ropes and try these things. Right? Yes, I understand. Good, good. Well, I told you. You said, try me. So would you like to go and have a date with me sometime? I will decide it later. Okay. In that case, you'll need to give me your phone number and I'll text you. Okay. Reiko, right? Yes. And? James. James. Okay. Do you live near here? Yes. Me too. I live just there. We're neighbors. Almost. Do you have WhatsApp? Or do you use that? Yes. Okay. Is it like this? Yes. Okay. Okay, you can do this. You don't have Corona, do you? You promise? Have you been tested? No, I've never been tested. I have. It's not fun. Up your nose and these... Yes, I know it hurts. Hang on, I'll text you now. And you're studying... Are you on holidays now? Summer holidays or no? I have a flat near here, so I'm just here on holiday. But you're not studying now, right? No. Okay. Well, maybe we can meet on the weekend or something. We'll see. Okay. Got it? That's you, right? Yes. Glamorous, darling. Okay. Okay. Okay. See you soon. I'm with you, man. Gentlemen, I hope you enjoyed my origin story, going from shy, disturbed farmer to street-walking ladies' man. Street-walker is a prostitute. Probably that's not what I meant. But you know what I mean. I hope you enjoyed this series. I plan to do more, because why the fuck not? Everyone keeps saying in the comments, seduction is dead. Try this in my city. Can't do it with a mask. Yeah, we can. We can do it with all sorts of things, all sorts of locations. Women are still women. They still need to meet men. I know the world is all fucked up and crazy, but life will go on and we'll find a way. So, if you'd like to help find your life to find a way and join me for the last workshop of the year, it's this weekend. Starts on Sunday the 25th. So if you're just randomly like, fuck it, I'm just going to do this, then contact us right now and join us. We've got two spots left. After that, TNL is going on its winter hiatus as we all scatter to whatever is the warmest part of the globe that we're allowed to get into. And then we will reconvene next year for a bunch of workshops. The next chance you'll have to work with me personally will be April 2021, starting on the 18th of April. You can click below for full details. Sign up now because that's going to fill up well in advance. It's six months away, so there will be a high demand for it. So if you'd like to make this year the year, or next year early the year, then you better get in contact with us soon. That's it. Peace! Oh"}
