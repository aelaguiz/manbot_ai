What you need to do is you need to own where you're at financially, because if you try to fake it, you'll get caught out and it's going to be embarrassing and you will not recover from that, right? So maybe it means I need to look at my finances correctly, but I need to be able to have enough cash to go on dates with girls and dates don't have to be expensive. Most of my dates back in the day were a cup of tea and a walk, a smoothie, you know, one or two drinks, a little picnic where I'd buy some, you know, some salami and bread and cheese and I'd say, hey, you grab a cheap bottle of wine and then that was it. So the dates were like 10 bucks, 20 bucks maybe, right? So if you can't afford that, then you need to change something. Yes, if you want to be out seducing girls, you need to be able to afford paying for cups of tea and train tickets basically, transport and food and drinks. That's all though. It's never a good idea to be taking girls on extravagant dates. Recently, I was working with some guys who were stupid rich, you know, like 0.1% rich and I was talking to them about how they're dating girls and they would say things like, oh, you know, when you take them to a nice restaurant and something, something and I said, don't take girls to restaurants until you f**k them, ever. And he's like, what? And I'm like, especially not, I know you probably go to fancy restaurants in general, but don't take them there first because it sets all sorts of weird precedent. Firstly, it says, I'm trying to impress you and when a girl senses that she's trying to be, that a man's trying to impress her, then she decides, am I being impressed or not? And then she's like, okay, I'm in control. That was impressive. That wasn't impressive. No, I don't want that. Secondly, at the case, it can create a weird sense of obligation for the woman. If I take it to an expensive thing and she sees that, like I've obviously invested in this event, she sees that I'm trying to buy her attention or impress her and then therefore she's, there's some kind of obligation. She owes me something. That's not a nice feeling. So she's less likely to f**k me if there's a feeling that she's obliged to f**k me. So that's another reason not to do it. The other one is that it's just formal and uncomfortable sitting across from somebody in a formal setting of any sort, I don't think is a good first date. So try to keep money out of your dates as much as possible. Even when you are, even if you become wealthy, yeah, look, listen, sometimes I do take girls out to dinner and stuff once we've started a sexual relationship and I've taken girls on trips and I've bought them things and the fact that I have more money than the younger girl that I'm dating, yeah, I use, I'm not stingy, I use my resources, but not to try and impress her or win her or buy her. So as a poor boy, just you can look at it like I'm going to do poor boy dates and I'm just going to, I don't need to say because I'm poor, I can just say, hey, you want to go for a walk and have a picnic? If it comes up where there's a thing where she wants to do something and it's outside your budget, you need to just own it then and there, right? And you just need to say, hey, listen, that's well above my income, I can't do that kind of, doing that kind of thing is going to ruin me for the week. I don't know what it is. She wants to go bungee jumping with a golden cord, I don't know, whatever rich, she wants to do a rich thing and you say, listen, honey, I ain't got no money, I'm just here for the good times, I got good times, I got good lovin', that's what you're here for. So that was my attitude back then. It was like, I'm okay being broke and young and figuring my shit out. I don't know myself, I'm not the man I'm going to be, I haven't succeeded yet, but I'm learning, I'm growing, I'm loose, I'm funny, I'm making mistakes, I'm fucking up, I'm living on that edge and yes, sometimes I'm just so broke that I can barely afford to pay rent and I'm going to live on lentils for the next five days and that's part of the funny wackness of being down and out as a young dude. It gets old, you don't want to do that forever, so I'm not here to give advice on how to be a 50-year-old guy trying to hustle little glamour girls into bed and trick them into thinking you're rich or anything like that, it's not that. It's that some women will screen you out at various levels based on your swag, they will and that can even be on teenage girls or young girls who have had a taste of the good life and then they're like, yeah, well, if I'm going to date a guy, he has to be fun and cool and I like him, but he also, okay, he needs to know some people or he needs to have access to this scene or like when I hang out with him, I get to eat good food and go to nice places."}
