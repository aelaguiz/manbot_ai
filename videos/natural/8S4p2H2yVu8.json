Coming up right now is an in-depth interview between myself and my long-time collaborator and friend, Shea Matthews. In this interview, we discuss some of the backstory, the dark history of how it is that we got to be where we are today with women and life in general, and we discuss at length some of the themes surrounding sensuality, sexuality, and specifically sensual massage. Now these are areas that I feel are incredibly underrated, misunderstood, yet vitally important if you want to become not just a pick-up guy, but someone who has long-term consistency in terms of their relationships and having a great sex life. So gold information. Check it out. Some of the audio is a bit choppy because we're recording it across continents, but the info there is gold. Also, at the end, we are officially announcing the release of an amazing product, which has literally been in the works for over 10 years. Myself and Shea have been working on this material, studying it, putting it into action, and finally it's ready very soon for release. So check that out at the end. Or you can click the link below now in the description, and that will take you to a VIP advance list with all the relevant info. So without further ado, I present myself and Shea Matthews having a late-night chat about what it means to be an incredible lover. Welcome back. I am here in Budapest, Hungary, reporting live for Natural Lifestyles, talking to my good friend, longtime associate, and spiritual brother on the path of wackiness, Mr. Shea Matthews. How are you doing, Shea? I'm awesome. Hanging out here in Melbourne town. Yes, keeping the fires burning back at home. So today we wanted to talk to you all about touch and sensuality, because it's a little known fact, I think, that Shea and I both, well before we became, in a game, teachers and seduction coaches, were massage therapists. So in my long line of strange jobs and incarnations that I've had, I was a professional massage therapist for five years, I think. And I actually met Shea back in the year 2000, the future, in an oriental massage class in Canberra, Australia. That's where we first met and started and hung out there working together, learning for two years. And then after that, both of us went on to become professional massage therapists and continue our study. So I went off to China, as many of you guys know, to study Kung Fu, but I was actually also studying body work, Chinese medicine, Chinese massage. And there I learned from monks, from old men in the park, from anyone I could, basically, to improve my skills. I also went on to do tantric massage training, and then throughout my practice, developed my own style and system. And so what was briefly your path after we left that class, Shea? I started doing the massage work before that class as well. So I started with remedial and Swedish massage, and then did that oriental massage coursework, which was great. And then, similar to you, I continued with moving into tantric understanding of body and massage, and then also worked with a lot of intentional kind of meditation and energetic systems that were very much geared towards connecting with people and deepening the connection of healing between people as well. So definitely covered a lot of territory in those years as well. And then you and I put together, basically, some essential massage courses early on in the days of the natural lifestyles, where we taught this hands-on with real-life girls and real-life students, and actually took them through this, which was really awesome. So what we want to talk about today is the importance of touch and some of the mindsets behind what it means to be a good, tactile, sensual lover, and how this is, in many ways, the game-changer. This can be the one thing that sets you apart from any other guy who's out there trying to pick up women. There's plenty of guys out there approaching girls and working on their conversation skills, and most men are aware of the fact that they should touch women, and it's talked about in terms of kino escalation or physical escalation. But I think, well, I know from teaching a lot of students that there's often a disconnect in terms of understanding what the mentality behind that should be, and the ability to become more consciously aware of your own physicality, and therefore the touch that you give to women. So how would you say, why would you say it's important that a man learns to be sensually aware or to become good with touch? I think it's a fundamental. We're talking about the basics of human interaction is physical interaction. So how we communicate with each other is primarily conveyed through things like our body language and our posture, and then, of course, by our touch and the way that we navigate the world with our touch. And I think we can convey a lot about ourselves and a lot about our intentions through touch. So massage and learning how to become a sensual massaging man is a very powerful tool to be able to lead women on journeys of sensual and sexual adventure, and you can really create all kinds of amazing experiences together just by opening the situations with touch a lot more. Definitely. And one thing I found was that as my competence grew, as I was working as a professional therapist and also approaching a lot of women and getting them into bed and becoming better and better as a lover, as my, if you could call it this, as my endgame improved, as I knew that I was physically competent, I knew that when I had a woman in the bedroom that I would be able to make her feel amazing pleasure, and I knew that I was able to just touch her casually in a way that was going to be pleasant, it meant that everything leading up to that became much simpler. You know, it's like when you know that you can give a woman amazing orgasms or you can make her feel physically amazing, then how to go up and say hello becomes pretty redundant in terms of the question. So I think it's one of those skills that where, you know, as you learn to become really physically competent with women, then that makes the whole ride much easier, would you say? Oh, absolutely. I mean, I think as you grow in confidence and skill levels, then your sense of value and what you've got to contribute to women in the world grows massively as well. So I think that, yeah, if a guy can learn these kinds of skills, it is an absolute game-changer. And he doesn't necessarily have to become a master of this kind of stuff. If he can just have some good principles and some good techniques in his toolbox that he can start to work with, then that can be the beginnings of basically being a romantic adventurer and starting to formulate ways of connecting with women that are just a little bit outside the box to what is typical in terms of what she's probably experiencing with a lot of guys out there. And that might mean the difference between a guy just seeming like another generic kind of mediocre guy that's coming to her world as opposed to being a guy that really stands out and has some real impact on her and she's wanting to spend more time with. Right. So in terms of these, at least the mindsets behind this, and you were talking about even just changing the way he's thinking about touch can have an effect, I've noticed that a lot of guys who are practicing seduction can often think about touch in very clinical terms. They think of it as something that they have to do. It's part of the seduction. You must escalate in order to arouse the woman or something. And so they kind of robotically go, all right, well, I'm talking to the girl, so I'll touch her on the arm every five seconds or I'll try and claw her or grab her or whatever I've been taught to do. And they then seem quite confused when that doesn't necessarily work because the girl doesn't respond very well to touch that's not calibrated. So what would you say is the primary mindset behind good touch? What is it that a guy should be holding in his consciousness as he's going about developing his touch abilities? Well, I think that what you talked about is a kind of result of putting the cart before the horse. Like a lot of guys are focused on all these mechanics and all the process of seduction and the process of what it means to be good with women, and they're using that as a kind of a, I guess, a way to look at the world and look at their interactions. But it becomes a kind of a very clunky thing if they don't understand that that whole experience of seduction and relating to women and getting better as a confident man is actually a subset of a bigger perspective and a bigger experience of himself as a journeyer in this life and learning to get into his body and learning to feel what it is to be a naturally inspired man. So I think the primary thing that a guy really needs to get connected with is the sense of getting him into his feeling, getting into his body, and learning to be open to the full spectrum of what he actually is to begin with. And then things like touch and seduction are going to more naturally flow from that place because it's very difficult to build a casual, confident sort of way of interacting with women if the fundamental underlying foundation of action is a sense of awkwardness or a sense of anxiety or a sense of difficulty in how to do that. So connecting with that deeper foundation of feeling and being okay in the body, and this comes back to the kind of stuff we teach in other aspects of our trainings, which is working on the inner game of really seeing yourself as a whole and complete person and working on the bigger picture of your vision and direction and then doing things like as we teach as well, like the meditation and the embodiment and learning to embrace and accommodate feelings rather than reject them and try and control them and things like that. And then what happens is the process of working with touch and the process of becoming a sensual and seductive man is going to be much more of a natural progression. Right. Definitely. Okay, so the takeaway from that is that essentially this journey into seduction shouldn't be about just trying to get women into your life or go through a series of steps in order to somehow unlock their desire, but this is a personal evolution and it's about learning to feel more and often men, I think, make a mistake of thinking that when they get into this that they actually should feel less, that they should become hard, that they should become they think being unreactive means not having any kind of emotional responses, that they always need to be the prize or they need to be dominant or these kinds of things, which is true, there's aspects of those things you need to be able to exhibit. But at the same time, being shut down internally, not being in touch with your own sensuality means that the woman can't, if she can't feel that you're feeling that, then she's not really able to then respond to it. And this is something that when I talk about the three levels of communication that we have, there's obviously the verbal level and then we have the physical and the intentional level that men need to understand when they're reaching out to touch a girl, it's not a linear tactical process that somehow if I touch her a certain number of times and she complies to my touch that I'm going to get to have sex with her, that essentially what you're doing is you're starting a conversation on a different level. So in conjunction with the verbal conversation, you are reaching out, becoming vulnerable in a sense, you are, because you are putting yourself out there, you're risking rejection or risking messing it up and you're showing her that yes, your intention is being projected. So your intention of desire or of connection or of intimacy is you're putting it out there and you're going, okay, here's my first question or here's my first statement in this conversation and then the ability to use the response rule to read it, her response, feel how she's gauging that, she can then actually respond to the fact that you've put forward an emotion through your physicality. And then in that way, you can start bouncing it off each other and that's when escalation happens very, very fast, not when you're trying to do it to somebody, would you say? Yeah, for sure. I think that another way to put that in a way is that if you're coming from a place inside yourself where the fundamental identity that you're operating from is in reaction to something. So, for example, a lot of guys are out there trying to learn how to be seductive or how to be successful with women because they feel inadequacy inside themselves or they feel a lack of confidence or they feel a lot of fear around their past or they feel like they've been broken hearted or hurt so they need to get some power back and control around sexuality in women, for example. And I think what that ends up creating is a very robotic, mechanical, almost sociopathic way of approaching seduction and interactions as opposed to what we teach, which is much more coming from a place of get back to the core of what you are and start to build a sense of wholeness and fullness of what you are and the value of who you are and then start to emerge out of that naturally. So then when you're creating your interactions from that place, then there's like a feeling of positive, generative, I guess, giving and genuine positive nature of wanting to connect and relate with women because women can instantly feel that. We instantly feel that. We can feel when someone genuinely wants to share something with us or if someone is trying to put something over us to get something that they feel that they need for some reason. And it is a little bit tricky and I understand that these things are the kinds of stuff we could have big conversations about, but I think if guys can just get the fundamental idea of moving back into a place of wholeness and building an identity of creating who they are with women from a place of positivity and fullness first, then that's going to change a whole lot of things as opposed to... basically having like a broken sense of self and then trying to put a kind of, trying to make up a shiny turd basically, trying to put a bunch of sparkly seductive tools over the top of it. That's a fundamental shift that guys need to understand. Totally. One of the things that I certainly learned by being a massage therapist was that coming from that position of giving somebody pleasure, because that's obviously what your job is. It's not to, and I'm sure you've had this experience where there'd be times where you're doing an hour and a half massage, and if your mentality was, I want to get through this, I'm watching the clock, then it's actually a really uncomfortable experience for you giving a massage and the person can feel it. Whereas if you're having a session where you really get into your body and you're in the presence and your intention there is to give, to please, to pleasure, to have therapeutic effect on somebody, then yeah, it really, really does have that profound effect and it's a very, very beautiful aspect of the exchange between human beings, that aspect of selfless giving or of being somebody who is actually there to please. And that's something that I certainly then carried through to all of my interactions, my seductions, as I got better and better at that, was that every time I placed my hand on a woman, my mentality was that I'm caressing her, that I am essentially massaging her in a sensual way, even when I'm placing my hand on her shoulder to running it down her arm. And then the woman can perceive that. She perceives that this man is not needy. He's not trying to prove himself to me or buy my attention, but it's that I have an abundance of pleasure to give people around me. I know I can do it. And therefore, when I'm focusing on you and I'm giving you my touch, it really is a gift. And she receives it as such. And of course, it's a pleasurable thing. And then when you give a gift to somebody and they receive it and they love it, and it's easy for them to give it back to you, well, then she's going to want to. And from there, things start to move very fast. Absolutely. Yeah, and I think you're right on with that. And I think, yeah, it's creating that permission inside yourself and coming from that place, it really allows a guy to lead women through seductive adventures and journeys that are completely different to what a girl is often used to. And it can be the kind of thing that really flips a girl into wanting to be with a guy on a much, much deeper level and maybe even fall in love with him as well. So if that's what a guy is looking for, which oftentimes our clients are, they want to find out the tools, like how do I really create the value in the tools where I can attract the kind of women that I really want and have them want to stay around for a long time, have them become my girlfriend, or have them become lovers over a long period of time. And I think these kinds of skills completely flip the script in a way. They give you so much more resourcefulness. And like you said before, a sense of confidence that you have something that is truly valuable, that keeps on giving. Totally, yeah, this is worth way more than having a shiny car or a fancy watch. The ability to make the people, make your lover feel amazing in her body, that's something that if you do that, even at a competent level, from a position of like I understand the basics of good touch and good massage and I'm coming from the right place internally, that's the sort of thing that makes a woman addicted to you. I've certainly had many lovers who've commented about that, that the way that I touch them is unique, that they don't get touched like this by anybody else. And that's something that, yeah, if you can touch a woman in a way that she's never been touched before and maybe never will be again, which is not a nice thought, but it's realistic, then of course she wants to come back to you. Of course she's gonna wanna stick around with you because that is actually something that's really, really valuable. So that's why I would consider this in my life to be one of the top three or five skills that I've ever learned, along with meditation and martial arts and I would say improvisation, that are the things that have totally changed my life and have given me amazing results in terms of seduction. There's been so many times when I've used massage very specifically in a seduction and it has been the thing that has been the deciding factor in the woman going to bed with me. Judging from the noises from your bedroom over the years, I'd say the same for you, right? Yeah, absolutely. If it wasn't for my massage and sensual seductive kind of skills that I've developed over the years, I don't think I would have had the kinds of relationships and connections that I've had for sure. I mean, it's helped me so many, so many times and also created many, many magic moments that still resonate in my heart and mind when I think about them. They're kinds of timeless moments that you can share with people. And yeah, it's the kind of stuff that, I know my lovers even years past, I still have women tell me that they received huge transformation from the time that we shared together and a lot of that was from the sensual and seductive sort of work that we did together. And I've opened women sexually and psychologically and in amazing ways through understanding these kinds of principles, so huge. Yes, I remember very distinctly back when we used to live in a shitty little share house in Melbourne, when Shay's girlfriend at the time, Shay and her would lock themselves into his room for many hours, like six to eight hours, they'd be in there and I'd hear all sorts of, there'd be sort of gong music of like Tibetan chanting and then you'd hear whips and claps and all sorts of interesting noises coming out of there. And I remember one night, I just heard this voice cry out throughout the house, my boyfriend is the best fuck in the world. And everyone else in the house would just went, well, we're gonna have to lift our game boys. Because I mean, I know you very well and I've seen you do this many times. I haven't actually been in the room and watching it because that'd be weird. But in terms of you setting up scenarios and really affecting a woman's senses completely, not just in terms of massage, but in terms of music, incense, food, sensuality, trance work, meditation, like when you give a woman an erotic massage from all of everything I've seen, it looks like a very, very unique experience. Do you wanna just talk a little bit about how you can take this much further than just learning how to rub someone's shoulders? Oh yeah, I mean, like I've taken those fundamental skills that I learned of massage and I just shifted my mind into the idea of, well, if I could really lead somebody, if I could really lead my lover on a deep sensual journey, what would I like to do? And yeah, through being able to create, I guess, situations and scenarios in the environment that we share together, yeah, I've been able to take women on all kinds of like powerful experiences of themselves. And it doesn't take much of a shift in your mind to really be able to do that. It's just about looking at the world in terms of sensuality and in terms of, I guess, deep engagement with the senses. And that is something that can be learned very quickly if you allow yourself to step into your feeling nature a lot more and start to put yourself in the shoes of what your partner would be feeling and where you'd like to take them as well. So it's kind of like a bit of a skill of developing some empathy and some foresight as well as having some felt sense skills in yourself and the ability to be able to like action that through things like massage and setting up those sorts of feedbacks of experience. Then before you know it, yeah, you can, yeah, take women through amazing journeys that like they're gonna be things that they fondly remember for months, maybe years. There might be things that they remember for a whole lifetime because it's just something that was so outside the box of what they expected. Definitely. Yeah, when you're involving tantric yoni massage as well as deep tissue trigger points, Chinese acupressure, a little bit of S and M and setting the room up like a temple, then who is gonna be able to compare with that? It doesn't matter how many shiny fucking Rolexes and fancy cars a guy's got. If you can give her explosive full body cosmic orgasms and send her into some trance where she's delirious, then you are the man. And that's something that you and I learned to do by firstly learning the practicalities of massage. So we should wrap this up because I know when you and I get started talking, things can, we can, it literally could go all night. But today we've got a really cool announcement. So as I mentioned earlier, Shay and I have done a lot of training in these areas and then gone and adapted this very specifically to the world of seduction. And we used to teach a live course, which we don't, which haven't taught for a while now because we're on other sides of the world. But Shay has very recently put together the methods that he and I worked on together to do a incredible video course, instructional course. So this massage course is going to be released very soon on the 10th of July, 2015. And if you are interested in learning one of the absolute top skills that you could ever learn as a seductive man, and just as a great skill in general, something that has helped me, I've used this to trade for food, for helping people move me houses, I made a living off it. And I've made, been able to give massages to my friends and family and make people feel good. It's just an exceptional skill to have. But what's different about this course is it's not just about learning how to rub someone's neck. It really is learning how to become fully embodied. So Shay, do you wanna just quickly talk a little bit more about the actual course that you put together? Yeah, sure. Well, the overarching intention that I really wanted was to create an easy to learn step-by-step package for guys to really take on the skills of embodiment, sensuality, and leading women through a massage. So the way I've done that is through creating basically a set of videos and text and some audio backup stuff as well, that teaches guys how to set the space, how to prepare that, like you said, that temple sort of area, that space where they can really take a woman into a deep exploration of herself. I cover all the theory about what makes for a good massage, tips for sensual touch, the best ways to become a master of touch as fast as possible as well. I cover the three major phases of massage in terms of making contact with clothes, then moving through to bare skin, and then with oil all the way up to full tantric style massage. And I've also provided the frameworks for a number of routines. So routines for the table, routines for a bed, routines for the seated, and other sorts of opportunities for giving massage as well. And I've also wanted to create a framework that basically gives guys the opportunity to build their own routines, to become intuitive and capable of developing their own techniques over time once they master these fundamental pieces of the puzzle. And I've also given a lot of suggestions for how this can be used in other scenarios. So having accessories to make it work, how to splice it into interactions, and obviously much more that's in between the lines as well. That's really important. I mean, all of that's important, but specifically the thing you said at the end, because I know I've used massage many times in a seduction, and it's important to know how to do that. So how do you go from, okay, I'm sitting with a girl on the couch, back at her place, to getting her naked and covered in oil? And so as part of the course, Shay demonstrates very specifically how to do that. Yeah, that's right. So there's some great opportunities for guys to see how those pieces fit together. All right. So if you guys are interested in this, you should be. If you wanna be good with women, this is one of the easiest ways to speed things up and to really, really enjoy being tactile and physical with somebody. Then click the link below, which will lead you to a VIP list, which if you put your email in, we will keep you up to date with the launch. We will also let you know about all the cool bonuses. So there is the massage course, but for the launch period, we are going to be providing a whole bunch of awesome extra bonuses that won't be available afterwards. So if you wanna know all about that, put your email down, click link below, or one of the annotations here that might be popping up with a speech bubble right now. I don't know the media guys will sort that out. And we will let you know what's gonna be happening with that. So over the next week or so, Shay and I are gonna be putting out some other cool videos, expanding on these ideas of touch. So stay tuned for that. And thank you very much, Shay. I look forward to hanging out with you in September on Eurotour. Thanks, man. Pleasure talking to you as always. And thank you, gentlemen, for watching. I hope you got some great value from watching this. And I look forward to seeing you guys in the future productions. All right, now in the meantime, everyone go out there and touch somebody. Touch somebody. Thank you very much. James Marshall, Natural Lifestyle."}
