Today's video is just a brief one to give you a little update about what's happening for the natural lifestyles. Now, if you've been watching our channel recently, you would have seen that we have been smashing the content, pumping out new videos every single day, which was for the launch of the Lifestyle Design Academy, which is now closed for enrollments and I'm teaching the course. As a result, my staff are very exhausted. I've been running them ragged, and so this week they're having a little break, so this will be the only video, which gives you a chance to catch up on any of the old ones if you might have missed them. But stay tuned for lots of new hot content coming out next week. Also, important to note that we are back on the road. The Natural Lifestyles is bouncing around the planet over the spring, summer, and autumn to deliver our world-class workshops in seduction, lifestyle design, sexuality, and in a game. So if you've ever wanted to join us and learn from me personally and the Natural Lifestyles coaches, you have the opportunity, and so I'm gonna give you a few dates, which I tried to remember, but I just couldn't, so I wrote them down on an old bit of paper. So coming up, the next workshops that are available, we've got a four-day mini-residential in Barcelona from the 4th until the 7th of May, which is led by Alex Leon. We also have a seven-day, but that's sold out. The next one is a seven-day workshop in New York City, which I'm excited because we haven't been to America for a couple of years for obvious reasons. And finally, we get to go back to the Big Apple and chase the sophisticated, sexy ladies of Manhattan. So that's happening from the 25th until the 31st of July, Manhattan, New York City. Then we've got a four-day residential in Barcelona, which will be led by myself. This is a rare opportunity to do one of the cheaper workshops and have it led by me. This is from the 23rd to the 26th of August. And then we have two more Barcelona workshops. So seven-day, 29th of August until the 4th of September, and then we have a four-day before that, 23rd to the 26th of August. I'm sure we'll put all those up on the screen so you don't have to remember them, and neither do I. But I will be there with bells on teaching, so I'm excited to hit the road again. I haven't coached live since late last year, and I'm ready to hit the streets. So feel free to click the link in the description. It has all the details about the workshops. You can contact our team for an obligation-free chat, get a little bit of coaching, talk to our guys about your options, and hopefully see you for one of the workshops. And that's, I believe, all I needed to say today. So love you all. Thank you for sticking around. Hope to see you for some of our live events this year, and we'll see you in the next video. Peace. Oh, one more thing. My primary editor, Adam, asked me to ask you guys this question. What would you like us to make videos about? So obviously, over the last couple of months, we've been focusing in on lifestyle design for the launch of the LDA, but you know that we cover a wide range of topics that fit within the broad scope of relationships and lifestyle design, inner game, sexuality, and a lot more. So if there's specific topics that you guys wanna hear more about, I know you like the infield videos. I know. We'll make more of those. We'll do it. This summer, we'll be out coaching, so we'll get plenty of those. But what else? What questions do you wanna answer? What themes would you like us to cover? Because you know me, put me in front of a theme, and I'll have a rant, have a go, and you guys hopefully will enjoy it. So yes, please leave comments below what you'd like to see from us content-wise in the next coming months, and we'll try to deliver. All right, that's it. I'm out. Peace. I'm out. Peace."}
