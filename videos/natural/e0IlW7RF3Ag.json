And in this way, we create really tight bonds with one person. And then some of those, if you do it well, can become lifelong collaborators. Doesn't mean you're in each other's pocket always, but you spend an intensity of time together investing in each other in order for you both to win. Keep that in mind. What are the types of collaborations that you can get involved in? Remembering that hangouts are basically very low or no investment collaborations where neither side has invested much. So neither side, both sides are willing to walk because there's nothing invested, right? It's the old Vegas technique, right? So the more you put in one of those fucking machines, the less likely you are to walk away from it because you've invested so much money throwing good money after bad. That's why people keep staying because they're like, I lost fucking a thousand and I lost my children's college fund and now I got to win it back by spending the other child's fund. So the more that you have invested in a relationship or in a project, the less likely you are to walk away from it. Now that can be, you need to be careful of that because sometimes you do just need to walk and cut your losses. The guy that's losing money in the poker machine is never gonna win it back. He's just gonna lose more. The guy that's in the relationship with a girl where they haven't had sex in six months, they've been together three and a half years, she belittles him in public, but the love was really strong and the love is still there. It's not as good as it was, but it's still better than being alone. And I've put so much into this and if I walk away now, then I lose the couch and half the dog. And what was the point of that last three years? I'll throw another three years down the drain just to see if that fix. In fact, maybe I'll throw a baby in there just to see if that fixes as well. So we must invest, we must risk, and we also need to be aware that there'll be times when it's just time to walk and lose your investment. So the different types of collaborations that I've listed here, I'll just run through them pretty quickly so you can have a think about them. The first one is partners or wingmen. And when I think back over my years as a lifestyle engineer, at almost all points, I had one major collaborator, one partner. And that person changed over time. Sometimes there was overlap. Sometimes I had like two partners that I was kind of collaborating on different things at the same time with, but generally there was kind of one main guy and it usually was a guy, but it has been a girl a couple of times as well. The original guy that I started The Natural with, Grant, known as Wolf in my book. Yeah, he and I were inseparable for about two years. We were just working together, playing together, picking up girls together, orgying together every day for a couple of years. Then, you know, that shifted and me and Grant had a big fight and he fucked off. And then Liam kind of moved into that position for me where, yeah, Liam was my right-hand man for the next 10 years and in many different areas. But at the same time, I then went off with Sasha for like two years where he and I, whilst Liam and I were still collaborating a lot, but he was in Australia at the time and then I was in Europe and so was Sasha. We started collaborating on teaching and going to the Amazon and all sorts of stuff. And so it was the Jamie and Sasha show, right? And then it was the short-lived James and Travel Bomb show, which was a good one, but it exploded early and so on. So, and like, I didn't necessarily plan this this way, but when I look around at all of the guys that I've seen who've been effective socially, they usually had a main wingman or a sidekick or a collaborator that they worked with for some period of time, and then maybe that shifted and changed. And, you know, I'm still friends with most of them. When I look back on the list, it's like my ex-girlfriends. I'm friends with most of them, not with Grant, not with TB, but the rest of them, I'm still very close with and will collaborate with all of them again, if I'm not right now, which I am right now with most of them anyway. So the point I want you to make, a point I want to make here is that you should start looking for your wingman, but understand that the first one might not be, it might be a test. When I was 26, I came out of a long relationship. I wanted to get into this pickup thing. I just heard rumors of it. All of my other male friends were in relationships. So I didn't know any single guys who wanted to go out and party and meet girls. I didn't know. So what I did was, I started kind of auditioning my next best friend. And I did that by going to lair meetings. That's what I did. So that's where we're expanding, experimenting. So whether that's through online communities or live meetup groups or through the LDA or the MMC group or wherever networks you're sourcing from. At the time, my only source of single males who want to meet girls was the Melbourne Lair, which was this dorky, nerdy little internet forum where once every month, 20 guys would meet and drink Coke and eat pizza. And we were all like, I was the least nerdy of them for sure. And I was a nerdy. A bunch of very nerdy dudes would meet in this private office of one guy who was a Forex trader and talk about mystery method. That's where it started. And so I just straight away, like was like, who wants to go and pick up girls? Cause like, and I didn't get that many responses cause lots of them wanted to talk about it. But I'm like, who wants to go out this Friday? And then one guy was like, yep. I met up with him. I'm like, okay, this is my new friend. Not exactly how I would have imagined my new friend, but fuck it. He's the only one who wants to do this. Fuck it, let's do it. Greg, his name was. He was a nice guy, but deeply, deeply paranoid conspiracy theorist and was using mystery method. And it didn't really work, but we went out like four or five times. And no, it did work in that we went out and we talked to girls, right? And then we had chats about stuff and we had some interesting conversations. We weren't going to be best friends, I could see that. But that was all right. That was like a test of like, okay, new guy, something. And then he faded off. And then I went and hung out with a bunch of other dudes until I met Grant. And then he and I went out and I was like, this motherfucker has got game. He's got balls. He's very different to me. Totally different to me. He was like a club guy from the suburbs. And I was, you know, inner city hipster. Sounds like one of those classic buddy movies. If only we were cops as well. And then we went out and then we started rolling together and then backing each other and getting each other laid. And then, you know, it was like a year or two before we even thought about doing business together. So initially this was my wingman. And then I was like, okay, this guy, yes, we've got a good working relationship. And then we stayed together then for the next, I don't know, whatever, four years, more or less. So if you don't have that guy already or guy or girl and a female version of that is often, well, it can be superior for sure. So a female partner in this sense can be more powerful because if she's attractive and fun, she doesn't have to be a supermodel. She needs to be, you know, friendly and like people find her an attractive person. And she can even be a big girl or like, I've collaborated with women that were not, you know, technically super beautiful, but were very beautiful humans and people loved being around them. And so, you know, their draw was the feminine energy despite whether or not anyone wanted to have sex with them. Sure, if she's a pretty girl or a super hot girl who's also a good social glue, then she's awesome. If she's a super hot girl, who's a bitch, she's a liability, right? So just beauty is not enough of a currency. Beauty mixed with something positive or something useful. Cool, that will be an amazing effect because yes, other girls are much more likely to come and hang around where there's other girls already. Guys wanna be part of it. Having one hot girl in your crew is awesome. Don't ruin it by having sex with her. Or do and then quickly become friends again. So you don't need to do it this way, but I've always found like going through periods where there's someone who's aligned with you and is really on that same vibe. And they don't have to be as skilled or they can be more skilled, but they need to balance in at least in attitude. It doesn't work so well when you have one person who's really, really good at something, someone who's really not good at the thing and also doesn't have a great attitude, right? So often when I'm hanging out with guys, that's not that often, but like there's been many times where I've been rolling with someone who was better or worse and usually worse at game than me, for example. Okay, a new wingman or a new coach, the game wasn't as good, but their attitude was awesome. And they didn't take themselves too seriously. So it meant that their mistakes, their social faux pas weren't liabilities. They were just like, okay, that's a dude who's like at ease with himself and he's not perfect. And then there's been other guys where I've hung out with them and I've taken them to an event. And then I've been like, nah, I can't do that again here. They're gonna, they're causing, they're damaging my rep. And give one example here of Sasha. Now, Sasha and I rolled together for years and in many situations, we were of benefit to each other socially. Many, many, but in some we were not because I remember one at one time, when we went to New York, Jess invited, she was like the queen of the New York nightlife of this one scene at the time. And she invited me and Sasha was there as well. And she said, okay, you guys can come to this very exclusive event, right? This is an event that costs $10,000 to get in, right? So we got a $10,000 ticket for free. And she said, come over to my place first, I gotta dress you up, wear black. And so we wore our blacks, we went over and she like did our hair, changed some stuff about our clothes, put a bit of black eyeliner on. You're like, what? Yeah, you wanna go to this party? You better dress right. And then she gave us a little pep talk. She was just like, okay, so this is a very queer scene, right? Like lots of gays and LGBTQ persons. So you can't be making any, and she's looking at Sasha, you can't be making any jokes about gay people, none. Like you just, and you know, Sasha has no out of bounds, right? He will make Jew jokes and he's a Jew. He stood in front of the Reichstag and Sieg heiled with two Jews, an Asian and a black guy. And I'm not defending that, but he did that and took a photo in front of it and posted online, right? So Sasha, nothing is out of bounds. And Jess knew that. So she's like, Sasha, no gay jokes. We just do, I just be chill. Just, you know, just don't make me look bad. We went to this pre-party where it was like people dressed up in like peacock feathers and like gothic vampires and like queer of some sort, right? What, I don't know, you know, what they're into, girls who like boys, who like boys, who like girls, who don't know if they're girls or they're boys who's a boy, that kind of shit. And so I just went in there and I was like being fabulous. I'm like, all right, fuck it. Okay, it's a bit of a queer thing. And I'll just go and say, oh, hi, I love your hat. And all the makeup looks wonderful and all that and whatever, you know, I can play the game. And then Sasha said something which I can't even remember because it was so cringy that I just blocked it out. It was just so a gay joke that didn't work. And I just saw Jess giving him dagger eyes. And we went to this 10 grand event and you know, we did the thing. And afterwards she just quietly said to me, Sasha can't come to that again. And I knew that Sasha didn't wanna go anyway cause it was too, cause he likes to be able to do whatever he wants. And he's like, nah, that thing was a bit something like, okay, well just don't come next time. He's like, nah, I don't wanna come. Like, good, you're not invited. All right, that didn't work. Let's forget that combination. So be aware that, okay, you have a wingman and it doesn't necessarily mean you're both gonna go to every single thing. You need to still be aware of our currencies, still be aware that sometimes I need to bail for the sake of my friend or vice versa. The partner dynamic is a bit different from the tribe dynamic. Although they can, they exist within the tribe. The partner gets really close. The partner, there's a lot more invested. Sometimes it's like the partnership kind of sticks out of the tribe and there's only you two, only you two know certain aspects of it or only you two are working on certain pieces of it. And the rest of the tribe is not involved in that part of it. Maybe you're working on something first as a duo and later on you might bring in your entourage or start blending social circles and so on. So it is a particularly close relationship which means it's more dangerous, right? It means that you will need to constantly negotiate your boundaries with this person, pretty much. I mean, sometimes you have people who are both very conciliatory or both agreeable or particularly the empaths. And so those are the guys that when the bill comes they're like, oh, and they're like, oh no, please allow me. No, I insist. I absolutely, and they start fighting over the bill. One rule on that. My rule is if anyone offers to pay for dinner unless I know they're much poorer than me I always just accept, right? This fighting over the bill nonsense, that's what is that in the wheel of exchange? Someone's trying to give and then you're trying to give, right? So we're both trying to give together and no one gets to receive. I don't get the pleasure of giving and seeing you appreciating my gift. And you don't get to receive a gift and feel like, oh, wow, someone's doing something for me. Don't fight over the bill. Someone says, oh, I'll grab it, let them do it. My exceptions are, yeah, I've got one friend, Robin who did my tattoos and one of my best oldest friends. He doesn't earn that much money. He earns 10 times less than me. And every time I see him, he's always like, we go to dinner, yum cha usually, and I have to watch him because he sneaks off to pay the bill, that motherfucker. And so I have to quickly run up and I go, Robin, sit down, you've bought me so many dinners in my life. You sit down and you eat that yum cha. So that's on the positive side of it. But what I'm saying is, and that isn't actually a negotiation, right? In that moment, that's me negotiating for him, not on his behalf, where I'm like, listen, you're such an empathetic, you are such a giving person and I see you give to everyone around you and you don't receive that often because you're the daddy like I am. Let me be your daddy today and buy you a lunch, Robin. You deserve it. So this will require constant negotiation. And when I look at all of my main partnerships with Sasha or Liam and Grant or whatever, we had many, many disagreements and occasionally we had some large fights. Not that often, I mean, with Grant, yes, but. Sasha and I, we've had one or two fights, and Liam and I have had one or two, but mostly they've been disagreements that have required sitting down and using intelligent confrontation to nut through it, and sometimes daily, because if you want a tight partnership, you've got to realize the risks, the more you invest in each other, the risks raise, because the fallout of you separating or breaking apart could be the end of a business, losing lots of money, the fracturing of a social circle, the loss and betrayal of feeling a great friend lost, it's a heavy price. So, and understand that that will happen. Betrayal will happen in some way or another, whether it's just feeling disappointed, let down, whether it's a real hardcore betrayal of someone going behind your back and stealing your woman or whatever. These things will happen, and we looked at this last week, and you will need to, you can't protect yourself completely, but I will give you a little list of some things that I've noticed in sociopaths or in people that I know are taking advantage. I know I talked about that last week as well. Understand, like I talked about the fact that I have sometimes a partnership that is rolling and I might have another one happening at the same time, right? And I do need to be aware sometimes that my oldest partner or my oldest collaborator can't come on this adventure, this one, right? So, like the Boat World adventures, for example, everyone that wasn't Liam and Alex couldn't come on those adventures with us, right? And we just have to make a clear line that the three of us are doing this thing. Why? Because it's really expensive, right? It's like you have to pay to get in, and most of my friends can't afford 15 or 10 grand entry tickets to anything. And it's absurd that I'm doing it as well, but you know, that's what you do when you make some cash. So, there was, and you had to have a level of game that was not normal game. There's a very different set of rules for seduction in the normal civilian world of meeting girls in the streets or in bars or cafes or whatever and gaming girls in a exclusive high ratio, you know, more girls than guys, high glamour, high beauty environment that requires a whole different set of game that requires a particularly kind of stone cold methodology, right? You can't be super vulnerable there, right? You can't be like, a lot of the things that we would say in normal game, being authentic, being direct, you know, not putting up any masks, getting to know the girl deeply and find out what makes a tick. In boat world, you do the opposite. And I can't, I mean, I will explain some of that in lecture eight, I think, when we look at me breaking the lid off some of the very higher level. And remember when I say high, it doesn't mean superior, right? It means levels above normal levels that in order to get into it requires a certain set of skills or resources that most people don't have. So they're just exclusive environments. I will give you guys some snapshots in how to break into those. I'll give you some autopsies on how we did it, how we continue to do it. But that's, you know, that is further down the track, if at all for many people, right? So for many of my wingmen and my friends, it's like, you guys can't come to this piece, you know, this adventure, we're doing it separately. And I had to tell some people, hey, I just need to let you know, I can't bring you to this thing. It costs 10 grand to get in. And so, you know, I would love you to be involved, but it's just not going to happen, right? So the people are not feeling particularly offended or like you're using one person and then moving to the next and moving to the next. I don't see it like that. Like eras where this was the Jamie and Sasha era when we were on the road together. Me and Sasha will have another era together for sure, you know, me and Keegan, me and Liam, me and John or whatever. And those things roll, change, and then, you know, you spend less time with that person because you're working, collaborating with someone else, and then you bounce back and you work with them again. And then maybe you can overlap them, bring them together as a crew, right? And in this way, we create really tight bonds with one person. And then some of those, if you do it well, can become lifelong collaborators. Doesn't mean you're in each other's pocket always, but you spend an intensity of time together investing in each other in order for you both to win. Keep that in mind, what I just said there. An intense period doesn't mean a lengthy period. I mean, we need some level of face time, but, you know, Sasha and I became tight fast within a week because we both threw in hardcore invested in each other. It was a risk we could have fucked each other over, could have been the wrong decision, but it wasn't. We threw in hard, and then I got him to work with me, and then he worked with me. Within a month, we'd already earned each other money, got each other laid, shared each other's darkest secrets, filmed collaborative videos for each other, cooked for each other, helped, you know, given a couch or a bed to sleep on, right? So we'd invested a whole bunch of currencies quickly, and then we didn't fuck each other over. We both won. We're like, cool, we are tight. And then we remained tight for the last 10 years. However, there was one instance where, I think, have I told this story about me and Sasha buying an apartment together? I think I have. In brief, my apartment in Budapest, Sasha and I were going to buy that together originally. I realized halfway through the deal that was a bad idea because we would end up killing each other. So I told him, and I bought him out, right? So, like, we were going to have a collaboration, and then I recognized that we're getting too close, right? If we're just basically getting a mortgage together, we might as well get married. What the fuck? So I knew that that level of closeness would divide us. And so that's when I said to him, hey, man, we need to not buy this together. I'm going to buy you out. I just gave him some money to, like, for the hassle of him whatever, just because I did. And then he was a bit pissed off, and then he said, ah, you dicked me around. I said, no, I didn't. Dicking you around would have been not telling you about it and then doing some weird thing. This is just me telling you and you being disappointed. So that's okay. Let's deal with that. And then we did, and then we've been friends ever since."}
