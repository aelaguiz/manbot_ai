Easy on, easy off. About this length of time. Quick pop. We're going to be playing with these two tools here, so we have, each of you have a wrist cuff, double wrist cuffs, and this is the attachment thing, so you probably, I mean handcuffs, everyone knows about, right? But the problem with handcuffs is two things, what are they, like real, yeah, they're painful, and if you get them, like if you lean on it and it clicks another too tight, you can really shred the wrist, yep, and what's the difference between these and that, no, much more, like as in they're connected always, so we can only do this, and only do this, kind of, and then we have to kind of take them off completely if we want to do some other thing and put them on completely, right? So this system where you have a very simple way to put on the loop and then these as your connecting pieces, means that you can take it on, take it off, she can be, she can have them on her wrists, like without any quips, we've been doing other stuff and then later I can reach the quip and do lots of fun stuff with it, right, so that's, that's why we use this kind of system as opposed to those old school handcuffs. We already know how to do this with silk ties, right, yep, has the same effect, front, behind, lashed, okay, and this, collar and lead, we also can do that with a silk tie, so question is why would we bother using these? If the other ones are actually easier to put on and, and feel nicer, why would we bother using these? What do you think? Aesthetics. Absolutely, aesthetics. I was going to say the feel of it too. Right, it has a very different tone, right, like if I put this, this is clearly a collar which has connotations of slavery, right, whereas the other one is like a silk tie that turns into things, you know, so this has like more of an inherent kind of dominance charge to it, these, these kinds of tools. So that's, like most of the time I use silk ties if I'm tying a girl up, but I definitely use these, I don't know, every now and then, and it's, it is a very different feel, right, because it's more about like, I'm about to ritually restrain you as opposed to the, the silk tie one, which could be that, but it's, it happens more in flow, so it comes on, comes off much more easily. What I'll do first is I'll just show you how to apply it without any intent at all, just to get the technicalities of these things, and then we'll show, and I'll show you how they, this would work in, let's say, ritualized terms. Okay, so, Nasty, come here, all right, so if I'm going to apply the collar, I can apply it from front or back, yeah, so we'll do it from front to start with. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to place it across her, you know, so that from the first touch, and as, as it's coming close, I don't, you know, I'm not just jamming it on, it's like I'm coming closely into her very intimate and vulnerable space, so it rests on there, all right, and so she'll feel the, the implication of the compression and the tie without it yet being on, okay. Now, turn around please, what's our problem here? Hair. Hair, so lift your hair up, easy, okay, now I'm going to place and apply, and I only want it, turn around, like this is about right, yeah, because right now there, I could fit a little finger or half a finger in between, so she can feel that it's like around her neck, because if I did it too loose, let's say, well, that's the last one actually, so okay, it was too loose and she's kind of jangling off and hanging off, doesn't have the feel of being owned or being, you know, like the slaved on kind of situation, and if I, I'll just put it on a little bit too tight for a second, okay, now that is a bit too tight, normally, okay, like this is now like there's no room around there, and it is okay right now, but when I start to pull her around or whatever, yeah, or she's like taking a big breath and her neck expands or something, right, like this will probably be too much, and after a time it can feel too constricting, right, so I'd be aware that, okay, I'll take it back one, till about, till about there, yeah, and look, you've got a regular part, and you can, sometimes a girl will really want a heavy compression on there, and so maybe she'll, you'll tighten it up, figure out what works for it, but to be on the safe side, this will, this will do the job, okay, so again, let's do it with Lara, who's got longer hair over here, so I'll do from the front now, all right, so functionally, without any intent to start with, lift your hair, place, and now, if, okay, if, let's say I can't see what I'm doing right now, then I'll use that as an opportunity to come in close, now the thing about applying these is, that speed is correct, I know what I'm doing, but even if I didn't know what I was doing, that would be an excellent speed to do this at, all right, because what I don't want is this situation, I'm all super dom and everything, lift up your hair, lift up your hair, still horny, hope so, all right, so any fumbling, of course, like, lets her know that I'm not confident about it, and stresses you out, right, and it doesn't, and even if I did do it super fast, and put it on like that, it doesn't have any profound effect, all right, so building the anticipation, and the kind of menace, and the sensuality with it, lift your hair up, that looks very pretty, okay, now that's an immersion moment there, all right, now you notice that I didn't bother to tuck it into its thing, don't need to, it's like, there's no need, takes more time than I have, so, and then it's much easier for me to just go like that, and it's off, also very important, this is, can be very dangerous, I don't go like this, you know, any flicking of this up, to try and, I can easily hit her in the nose, teeth, you know, not good, so when I'm applying the lead, I will take it by the end, make sure that you've taken it by the end, you got that, so we can have that on, off, right, but if I was to go, I could easily flick her, okay, so that's what we want to be aware of, maybe I don't, maybe I don't put on the lead at first, you know, often I'll just put that on, and then I can lead her by the ring, and I can get her to sit down, to stand up, come with me, all right, if I wanted to use this from behind, this would be harder to move around than the silk tie, so I need to kind of walk it around, because it will stick a little, all right, like so, work as well, okay, sometimes I'll go, get up, get up, come with me, okay, do you like that, yeah, it's very cute, doesn't it, okay, so I might keep, all right, so I might keep it here, while I then work on the wrist, all right, so I can have this kind of touch here, right, this is a very different feeling to, you know, that, right, as opposed to here, I'm with her, I'll take my time with it, one more, do I have the clip, someone hand me the clip, you're still horny, still horny, you know, that was all a dream, great, now she's mine, now I can add that in here, all right, and march around with our adding, I can start adding holds and locks, right, so we did the, these holds and locks without tools, now we can amplify them, all right, okay, come over here, okay, and then we can start to play as we would normally, all right, now let me show you a couple of things we can do on the bed as well, so Nasty, come with me, so what can we do from here, do we think, any ideas, yeah, so, okay, so we could, all right, so we could go, that would be hot, ah, awesome, can you get out of that, yes, cool, all right, so from here, this is cool, because now we can open the legs out, she's secure, I can intensify that, yeah, I can get her to rub herself, to spray herself, all right, I can intensify it here, where I'm locked in completely, all right, so lots of cool stuff, and so easy to get, take on and off without, you know that, turn around, up on your knees, in the middle, lie down, lie down, right, so distressed position, which we remember, I won't be staying here forever, but I can, you know, I can get it, I can hold her there, I can get her to grab her butt, all right, so fully restrained from that position as well, easy on, easy off, about this length of time, click off"}
