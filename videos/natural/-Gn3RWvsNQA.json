But as I worked with men over many years, it became very apparent to me and clear that the issues that men faced in this modern age were less to do with the technicalities of how do I go and talk to a girl or start a relationship, but more to do with deeper aspects of what it means to be a man. For most men in the world today, there is little connection to the ancient traditions of our previous generations, of initiations into manhood, of testing yourself against the wild, of going through ordeals, of being able to look deep inside yourself to understand your spiritual powers, to ignite the warrior, the king, the lover, the magician, these primal and timeless archetypes, which we carry with us somewhere in our DNA, somewhere in our collective memory, and these days those things are suppressed. We wear shoes all the time, we walk on flat surfaces, we sit in cars and offices, we don't combat against other men in a healthy way, we don't seek out elders and masters to teach us their wisdoms. And as a result, we are not the men that once existed. Yet there is a yearning inside every one of us, in every single man, to ignite this. Nobody's happy, really, living in a super safe, soft, comfortable bubble, because you know on the outside of that is a calling, a calling to the wild, the wildness inside you. And so, over the last number of years, I've been on my own personal journeys, travelling the world, seeking out different masters, spiritual teachers, martial arts, movement, dance, all sorts of different types of expression. And when I talk about masculinity, I'm not talking about it in a really simplistic sense of toughness and physical power, or power over people, or dominance, or climbing up hierarchies. I'm talking about something much more subtle, much more intuitive, much more expansive. The ability to dance and sing is just as much an important aspect of being a man as it is to fight and fuck. And so, I've put together, for the first time ever, this incredible new workshop called the Natural Warrior Training held at my property here in Portugal. I've invited a number of teachers, coaches, in different disciplines who are incredible specialists, whether it's in the physical body, in the spiritual world, in the primal, very wilding aspects. And together, we've created a modern initiation, a modern rite of passage, which draws from the ancients, draws from many different traditions that held up men, that helped them to grow from boy into man, into king. As well as cutting-edge sciences of understanding the mind, the body, and how these things interrelate. And as a result, we've created something truly unique. Welcome to Natropia, in Portugal, and this is the Natural Warrior Training. A modern initiation into manhood, into masculinity, a reconnection to our primal roots, and to our tribal connections in a really positive way with other men. This is where it stops, in terms of breaking the chains of immature, ignorant masculinity. And this is not the way to experience life. We have these precious, short moments on this planet, and it's a tragedy that many people don't really get to live it. Not actually making real decisions, not exploring themselves on a very deep level, not learning to open their hearts to truly love. And my work has been leading to this point. And each of these guys who left, they are now real warriors, and they will become kings. Welcome to Natropia, in Portugal, and this is the Natural Warrior Training. Welcome to Natropia, in Portugal, and this is the Natural Warrior Training. This was just a sensory experience to drop them into feeling this land before we begin this week-long ceremony. We've got a lot to cover this week. We've got a lot of territory to experience. And you've all come a very long way to be here, in many different ways. We're going to be exploring something very fascinating. And that something is this thing that we call life. This thing that we call yourself. And it's a big context. It's a big context. It's one of my lessons this week, has been really thinking about what is the context that you operate from. Context defines everything. And sometimes we forget the true context, because there's so much detail going on, so much fun stuff going on, there's so much interesting things that capture our attention. We need to be really aware of where we are and what we're doing, and how we're using our time. But at the same time, we need to give ourselves the freedom to be able to experience what we're experiencing properly, so that we're not missing out on what's actually happening. I'd like to introduce the Powerhouse Brotherhood team that we have with us. You know some of us more than others. And maybe it's a good opportunity for each of us to just speak a little bit about our intention this week, in terms of what we would like to bring to the space, and also what we kind of represent, if you will, in this particular context. As you probably know, my name is Shea. I'll be acting as kind of somewhat narrator and container builder. We all will be doing that to different degrees, but part of my job here is to kind of help to weave a lot of the story together for you. And that's something that will be sort of generated as we go, even though I have a lot of plans and designs for things to put in the mix. And this week I'll be exploring the idea of awakening with you, and we'll be putting that into actual practice, so it won't just be an idea, it'll be the reality of awakening. And we'll also be doing a lot of stuff around, let's say, frameworks and understandings of how to let your mind come to peace with this thing that you are, which is a tremendous, infinite man of awesomeness, revealing yourself to yourself. So my background is I've been doing self-development and spiritual research, let's say, spiritual development, for the best part of 20 years now, actually. So I had a sort of a big awakening when I was 18, and since then it's been an unravelling process that started with things like body work and Chinese medicine and various forms of meditation and Eastern health therapy, so I was very deeply into some Eastern thought around Chinese medicine, Taoism, Buddhism. And at the same time I also had a growing fascination with philosophy and science and sociology and communication. So as the time went on, I really researched and developed a lot of different skills from understanding energetics of the body all the way through to communication and neurolinguistic programming, hypnosis, coaching and healing technologies from various different traditions all the way up to very modern day understandings and interpretations of how to change the mind and help people to move their mind in a different sort of direction. I'm looking forward to getting stuck in and having a lot of fun with these guys because I know they're going to cover a lot of territory, and working in conjunction with these other trainers that we have around is going to be very, very powerful because each one of us is going to stack on top of each other and show a different angle of the diamond of this workshop and what we are as individuals as well in the process. My role here is I guess the tribe leader in terms of putting this whole thing together. I want to be looking at a lot of physical practices with fluidity, with grace, with deep relaxation. It's been my constant mission to try and get people to loosen the fuck up and that's what I can finally have a week to do with you guys. So I'm going to get people really loose, really fluid, really enjoying embodiment. I want you guys to really feel good inside your bodies and have much more expression. Grace and all sorts of new ways of experiencing this physical reality. My name is James Skalkos. I am many things. Most frequently I am an alchemist. I teach and facilitate nature immersions and wilderness survival. I created a human optimization system that involves different modules of movement and breath and nature connection and psychotherapy. It was designed in the context of preparing people for sacred medicine experiences. I have been serving sacred medicine for the past 11 years and just noticed that if people are prepared on a psychological level with insight and awareness of who they are and their ancestors and their kind of personal constellation, then they tend to navigate the journey with a bit more finesse and poise. So this week is going to be, the modules I'm going to be teaching are a sequence that are designed to gradually expand their sense of self, deepen their relationship with who they are and where they come from and learn to be compassionate with the parts of themselves that they maybe don't find so loving. I expect these guys to come out of this week long ceremony with a deep sense of love for themselves and the earth and their ancestors and a sense of destiny. I know that they will leave here with a deeper sense of purpose and how to live in reciprocity with this planet and life itself. Hey guys, it's Dom and just about to head into The Natural Warrior. I'm very, very excited to deliver in this amazing workshop for these 12 blokes and I'm going to be bringing over the next seven to eight days is really showing the guys how to drop into their bodies, using their bodies as a form of expression throughout the years going from different sales, being a sales trainer in career and business, also in movement and owning a gym. I have developed a way of really just stripping back all techniques and coming from a place of expression. So I'm really here to really just unpack and get to the core of what your individual expression is. So I'm going to be taking them through a few different physical movement practices, but also to show them that your physical practice isn't just something that is technology, something that has numbers and reps. It's also something where you engage and you get to feel into who you really are. You get to learn so much about yourself through the way that you move. You get to become curious and learn to play. This is what I hope I can truly impart from a place of my truth this week and really also to everything that is a construct, everything that is like work, to see. see it as a point of play, like go back to our childlike expression of wonder, of curiosity, and really just engage with that childlike, with that playdom, with that playing, with that freedom. I'm super excited, nervous as well to bring everything, but also coming from a place of complete trust and knowing that the universe will use me and also guide me. So, super excited, and let's see what this week brings. I'm a ritualist, a medicine man. My part here is to bring you special medicines and rituals connecting to the earth and to a landscape of the unseen world, as well as connecting to sources coming from cultures that haven't lost their touch with this landscape, with the earth. And I will be taking you through a very deep process of initially cleansing and realigning, and then of learning how to listen and to learn from the medicine and the guidance coming from the earth. And so in combination with all, everything everyone is going to bring, including yourself present here, into this space, create a very deep shift in your consciousness, in your body, in your being, on many, many levels. We don't have, once again, a huge amount of time, but I'd like to hear maybe one or two minutes from each of you, just your name, what you've come here for. Like, why are you here, basically? Finances and more women, more money, all external things don't seem to make me more happy. And yeah, I don't know, I've been living, like on the outside, sounds like a cool lifestyle, very like hedonistic, but I felt very empty inside. And I'm searching for more meaning. And my life and also for more confidence. For me, my big question is kind of like, what's the next step in life? Like I'm looking for my purpose and mission and also for more confidence and what it means to be a man. Because I've done a lot of self-development stuff, but I feel like the last year I've been stuck in a certain way. And yeah, my mindsets about things, about life are changing a lot. And I think this is the right type of workshop combining many things, meditation, masculinity, purpose, body movement. So that's why I'm here. I think I feel like I'm in a pretty big turning point in my life, right? I've come out of a long-term relationship and wanted to just reground myself and restart myself for a new journey. I haven't had much opportunity to actually explore the masculine, I think. A lot of my life has been focused on women, which has been great, but I've never actually done anything with a bunch of dudes before. So it was a chance to really get grounded and explore that area. The reason this course caught my eye, the big picture is I grew up without a father. I actually grew up in a world where women were the strong people in my life. You know, my mom was a super incredible woman. All my teachers at school were female. And I grew up with a very skewed vision of what being a man was, I think. In fact, I thought women were strong characters of this world and men were secondary. And I saw that in my uncles and the people in my life when I was a kid. And I had a stronger sense recently that that couldn't be correct, that men have a lot to offer. And even the whole big mainstream narrative we're going through now, where people are describing masculinity as toxic, I found it all really off-putting. So when James started talking about a workshop that explored what being a man was, I thought, wow, that's something that I could really learn a lot from. The reason that I'm here is because I want to explore the parts of myself that I know still need work, but there's something holding me back. And also, no doubt, I have a lot of blind spots that I still want to discover so I can grow in that sense as well. But mainly, I've always been a little bit of a lone wolf. And the older I get, the more that I realize that I lack a deeper connection, mainly with men. I have no trouble connecting with women, but I have trouble having a deep connection with men. So I want to experience the feeling of the tribe. That's why I'm here. Like many guys here, and probably also watching, my self-development was, started through a sense of, I want to be better with women. So seduction was the vessel I used to improve myself. And at this point in time, I have this feeling that part of myself I am happy with. The seduction part, I'm competent in the way that I at least feel that is sufficient. And I really wanted to find a way to take the inner game stuff out of the seduction frame and just make it a frame on its own or put it in a different one. So when I heard about this project, I was like, this is exactly what I've been after. There's a really powerful gift here. You know what the gift is? It's called life. And you're living it. You're alive, like alive. This is not virtual reality. This is not some simulated fucking thing like this. This is flesh and blood. So you're in it. So let's become it. Let's be it. Let's meet it. Let's allow it. Let's become alive. You're already alive, so let's become alive. Physically, mentally, emotionally, energetically. Because we're under a spell. We're under the spell of our own ideas of ourself. We're under the spells of our cultural expectations. We're under the spells of our fears and doubts and our insecurities. We're under a spell that we need to work it out. We need to find it. We need to look outside ourselves. We need to chase. We need to acquire. We need to succeed. We need to climb over the top of each other. But there's something else. And that something else is very, very important. And it's not some thing. It's not a thing. I can't give it to you. It's a way. It's a way of being. It's a way of knowing. And it starts right now. It's now. It's now. You're awakening. And that space inside yourself is not a system. It's not a method. What that means in practical terms is whatever you learn this week, whatever you think you are, whatever you are capturing inside yourself as the solution, realize it's another trap. But it might be a useful step in the process. It might be a useful frame to move you forward. So pick it up and use it, but remember, no way is way. What I wanna give you guys is hacks to hack the shit that controls you. And the biggest enemy to yourself is yourself. So you need to make friends with that enemy and turn it into your ally. That begins with understanding what's going on, sensing what's going on, tracking. Tracking reality. And this is something you're gonna see demonstrated this week through various forms. You're gonna start to experience being in a space of having essences living around you and through you and embodied in other people around you. And if you be humble to that and pay attention and you learn from it, you just might walk away with some skill to be able to hold some of these essences like love, like power, like wisdom, like being humble. And they're truths, they're amazing things. They give you substance. That's really the reward of the hero's journey. So the first session that I did was really about setting the container. It was about opening a conversation with everybody and getting everybody to introduce themselves about where they're at and what they would really like to get from being there to a degree, even though that was a bit of an unknown thing for everybody. And also to start to introduce this idea of the bigger picture of becoming, let's say, an integrated man or a whole man, a kind of multi-dimensional man. And part of that was I wanted to really get people into recognizing that they're coming from life, they're coming from being, they're coming from the context of their existence and their experience. Because when you're teaching something, you have to have somewhere to start. But how do you set up somewhere to start when what you're teaching is really big? So you need to start with a really big context. So the context was us, together as a group, introducing each other, setting some kind of expectations of what we're gonna do. Setting some kind of expectations of really sharing the space together as much as possible. And then talking about some of the ideas that we're gonna be producing, but also trying to get guys to realize that no matter what came to them, no matter what happened in the process, that was still not the thing. It's like the map is not the territory. The message is not necessarily the medium. So we need to separate those two together in the sense of there's lots of things being delivered, but at the same time, it's gonna happen in an interesting way that who knows what's gonna happen in between the lines, which is good too, because it opens up the possibility for change and mystery and things to happen that are not just like going to a class learning a skill, get the skill, move on to the next thing, which is oftentimes the way we think about learning, which I think can be limiting when you're really trying to move into a larger frame of understanding. \u266a Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah \u266a \u266a Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah \u266a Through these different exercises, I'm going to be showing you how to understand what is your vibration, how to connect to your vibration. So making it really, really simple and just going back to an energy source, okay? It's because a lot of us, we get mixed up in the emotions of what we're doing and we attach ourselves to anger and this and my personality is attached to this, certain element, certain emotion, whereas if we can separate that, we can then choose the path that we take. So instead of having it from a process up here, it becomes a process of actually listening. And so this whole method is living from a method of inside out versus outside in. Instead of searching for your mission, searching for your purpose, find out how you react. So we're going to start off with a breathing process. There's nothing like breath to bring you back to what you vibrate with. Whatever gives you energy is connecting to your vibrational core, is guiding you, literally guiding you in every moment, every interaction you have with everything, whether it be another human or what James took us through this morning, where interaction with every single leaf. We're going to now go through an exercise where it's all about expression. We're gonna go through four elements, earth, water, fire, and air. And it's going to be about expressing yourself within that energy. If you're trying to get shit done and you're in a state of earth, groundedness, it's not really going to happen. If you need to get shit done, you need to be in a state of fire, but you've also got to know how to express that on a physical scale, not just a thought scale of like, I need to get shit done, I need to get shit done, I really need to get it done. Just saying it over and over in your head."}
