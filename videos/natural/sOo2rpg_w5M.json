So I've got a question here from Tom. How do you create a fulfilling work-life balance? The business groups I'm part of, they're just hardcore hustle. But it seems like you successfully managed to create a fulfilling work-life balance for your dating, business, meditation, and doing other interests stuff, where you're not working and stressing out all the time, yet it's still successful. And you have time to do other stuff you like and meet women. Hustle grind. Eat, sleep, repeat. I'd rather hustle 24-7 than slave 9-5, bitch. Bilo. Sell high. Yeah, yeah. Hustle, hustle. Now, you've heard that advice before, and I guess that's exactly what we're going to be deconstructing in today's little adventure into the balance between the work and the life. So, firstly, how do you know that? How do you know that I've got a work-life balance that's excellent? Maybe I secretly just work 14 hours a day, and then once a month, we go out and meticulously film me doing some lifestyle things, and then put those in, and then just put that out to the world. How do you know that's not happening? I guess you know that because you've watched me for some years, and you've got a pretty good idea that I'm doing a whole lot of not working as well as working. Yes, it's true. Business up top, and Australian bogan pleasure down below. Now that you've seen my Ugg boots, you're not going to be able to respect me nearly as much, I think, but this is how I do things. I am business, and I am pleasure. You should see my cameraman. He's also business and pleasure right now. So this is an important question for a lot of guys out there in our audience because many of you guys, as well as wishing to unplug from the matrix of the dating world, are also interested in perhaps going it alone, starting your own business, or outsourcing, or working remotely, having a life that is not the traditional prescribed, go to university, get a job, a job, a nine to five job, and then do that for the rest of your life. Which there's nothing wrong with that if that's what you like. And if you like that, then that's awesome because there's way more of that going around than there is people who are successful businessmen. However, I am definitely an advocate of freedom of all types, of all types, and when it comes to career, and money, and the way that you work, this is something that has been important for me in my life and for many of my students, so it is certainly relevant. So what I hope to do today is to give you some basic tips in no particular order because you know I don't read off a script, I just riff, although I have thought about that one day writing a script and reading it, but it's just too much work, I'd much rather just riffing with my ideas. So I'll be giving you a bunch of things to take away in terms of looking at the distinction between work and lifestyle, and how to be more effective whilst also clawing back more time for yourself. Now before we get into the how to hustle in a way that's more relaxing, the first thing that you will need to consider when starting your own business, or if you are in one now, it would be a good time to look at this, is, is this business viable? Because there is a lot of information out there when it comes to starting your own entrepreneurship endeavour, which doesn't really take that into account, and there is a lot of bullshit out there with financial and business gurus, as with all gurus, where they don't have to have any kind of accreditation. Here in my garage, just bought this new Lamborghini here. And something to be aware of is that a lot of the guys out there that are selling the lifestyle design, the business lifestyle design dream, do they actually have any business experience outside of teaching people how to do, how to set up their own online businesses? Because if they don't, then really they have just learned how to do this one thing, which is sell you on the idea that you can have your own business. I would much prefer to be learning from a business mentor who has run various other types of businesses. When I first started out, I didn't have any mentors, I didn't really, I didn't know anyone who was in business, because all of my friends were broke artists. Now I know a lot of people who run their own businesses, and almost none of them, except for some of the coaches that I know, almost none of them have anything to do with teaching people how to start businesses. They sell things, services and products, and they scale them, and they're successful because of that. And so those are the people that I would be trying to learn from. So you do need to look at, does the world want your shit? If you're holding onto the idea, which is definitely sold by many gurus, that if you believe in something, if you have a passion, you love knitting, or you love skateboarding, or you're into something and it's your passion, that you will be able to turn that into a six figure plus business by grinding and hustling, and because you have passion, and if you keep going and don't give up, that you will succeed. I would say take that with a grain of salt, because if the audience is not interested in the thing that you are really interested in, then they're not going to buy it. If there's not enough of a market out there, then it doesn't matter how much passion you have, you won't be able to achieve your goals. Now of course, if you're a major corporation, Sony or something, and you decide that the world needs this new implanted chip thing that does something and presents it to the world and pumps millions of dollars behind it into the advertising and marketing, you may be able to create a new desire, but I presume you're not the CEO of Sony, you're a guy who wants to start his own thing, maybe alone, maybe with some partners, but if you're not coming with massive amounts of capital behind you, then trying to start some disruptive technology or something that has never been heard of or thought of before, well, if you do, create the new Uber or the new thing that people didn't know they wanted, then awesome, but for the most part we're going to be maneuvering within markets that already exist. And so it is really important to look at, is this market completely oversaturated? If you want to become a yoga teacher now, because that was a thing like some years ago in terms of being a lifestyle businessman, business person, non-gender specific by the way, people wanted to be yoga teachers or life coaches and there's just so many fucking life coaches and yoga teachers out there that how are you going to be able to stand out from the rest of the crowd? It is possible, it can be done, but if you're wading into a market where there's already a bunch of people that are well ahead of you and way more established than you and there's not an infinite market, then you're going to be competing against people that are going to beat you. If I had to start becoming a dating coach today, that would be a pretty rough thing I think. When I first started this company 12 years ago, there was only a handful of companies worldwide, the internet was young and new, there was only three infield videos online at the time and then we put the fourth one up. And so we were early movers, myself and then my collaborators were early movers and we carved out our nation and built our reputation over a long period of time and we still have a very small audience in the scheme of things. Look at our subscribers, we've got nearly 100,000, oh we're waiting for that silver play button, it's coming soon, 100,000 subs and I would say probably 5,000 to 10,000 real fans out there at any given time. And out of that, we niche ourselves and we market directly to you guys of a particular group that we have built a fan base over the many years, built our reputation, the trust, the proof of concept, the continual proof that what we do works and so we have a viable business within a small niche. But if I was to try and do that today, I don't know if that would actually work. So that's the first thing to keep in mind, do some proper research on your competitors, on the market, if that means loose little focus groups where you reach out to your networks and say would you guys be theoretically interested in purchasing this service or product if it existed and then get real feedback and do real research to see is there a market there. Now if there is a market, the next question I would be looking at is what are you hoping to earn over the next five years? Like if you were looking at yourself as the business owner or with partners or however the dynamic is that you're creating, what would you realistically like to earn? And if the answer is seven figures and you're a personal trainer, then I would be questioning that because I know a bunch of personal trainers who make six figures because they coach privately but then they have online group courses and then they eventually release a training program or a training product online and so I know some people who have managed to make six figures out of that which is awesome. Keeping in mind that six figures, only point something percent of the world's population is ever going to earn that. It's a lot of money and when you're moving into entrepreneurship, there's often this sense of like I want a 10x, I want to be a multi-multi-millionaire, okay, cool, I mean sure go for it. I don't want to crush anyone's dreams today. I do want to add a little bit of, just a little compression, just a little squashing of the dream just to make it more realistic and I don't want to sell people bullshit. I want you to, if you're going to do this, to have the best possible chance of success. So promising yourself or being promised by others that you can become a millionaire within a short amount of time just by following these ABC steps or whatever it is that they tell you to do, I don't think is realistic. If it's like, okay, well I would love to earn $50,000, whatever, pounds, dollars, euros, whatever currency you're thinking in, in the second year of my business, okay, maybe that's a realistic thing for a service provider or someone who's, yeah, let's say a service provider usually. Products, physical products, I don't know anything about, so I'm not a bricks and mortar guy. I don't import things from China and put them in warehouses and sell them, so I'm not really going to go into that because I don't, I don't know much about that. I do know about service provision. And so if you were to look at, okay, I would love to earn 50K for example, then you would need to look at what would that mean month by month or number of clients at X price. Am I doing clients one-on-one? Am I grouping them together in groups? Am I trying to automate that to some degree by having an online course, you know, something like the Lifestyle Design Academy, which I'll talk more about at the end, which is a live webinar based thing with a whole bunch of video resources involved in various accountability systems. So for me personally, the workload for that is there's a lot of work creating it and then the delivery for me is four or five hours per week over the course and then follow up another bunch of hours every month, right? So it's a reasonable workload, but it's not something where I have to work full time at it and it delivers a good return whilst providing a great service. So you would need to look at that and I would say do that in advance, sit down and work out, okay, I would need to, for me to make 50K, I would need to sell and then you work out what your thing is and then you may realize, wow, I would need to sell a thousand people a month in order to do that or a year to do that. Is that viable? Can you create an audience of a thousand buying customers who are going to pay X to create the income that you're after? And that may be a bit of a shock to look at and there may be a disconnect or it may be just the reality check where you're like, okay, that's not possible at that price point. And if I'm a personal trainer, let's say I'm doing, for example, I'm doing online Zoom coaching sessions. How much is someone willing to pay per hour to be trained by a trainer? Because if you go to a local gym, I know you can't do that now, but gym trainers charge depending on the country, 20 to 40 to 50, 60 bucks an hour maybe depending on what region you're in. And so if you were to work off that, you won't be able to become a millionaire doing hour coaching blocks, right? As a very specialized coach, I charge $500 an hour when I do one-on-one coaching, which I don't do much of anymore, but when I do, and so I can command a much higher price because there's very few me's on the planet. In fact, there is none other than this one. And the area of knowledge that I have is extremely specialized as opposed to that there are, I don't know how many, hundreds of thousands of excellent personal trainers on the planet who maybe all day who all have their own variations and different things they do. But at the end of the day, they're teaching people fitness and strength and flexibility and mobility. And so if they're good at it, there's many other people who are also good at it. So they probably can't charge 500 an hour or a thousand an hour or massive prices because there's lots of other people out there who could do it for less. So reality check your business first. Does the world want your shit? Is it willing to pay for it? How much is it willing to pay for it and how many people theoretically would be willing to pay for it? And does that then account amount to, add up to an income that is better than being the nine to five guy? Or is it going to be less? Did you just buy yourself a job as, as the old saying goes for a lot of small businesses, the unfortunate reality is a lot of the time a small business will earn you less than, than working for a wage. And you may end up spending way more hours working in it than you do, did nine to five. The old, I'd rather hustle 24 seven than work nine to five. Well, yeah, if you love what you're doing and it means that it scales and eventually you become very successful. But if it just means you're treading water and having diminishing returns or earning about the same as or less than you would have in your normal job, is that worth it? Though these are, these are big questions to consider. And again, I don't want to crush dreams, but I would prefer to save you the heartbreak of investing years of your life and all of your savings and all of your emotional energy and your expectation into a project that was going to fail from day one. So reality check your shit first. All right. So let's assume that your business idea is sound, that it is potentially could work. And now let's move into the idea of the work life balance. I'm not the greatest businessman on the planet. I'm not the. I have not made as much money as I could have, for sure. If I'd knuckled down really early on and I'd started putting out way more videos and blogs back when blogs was a thing and done the things that various marketing people told me in the early days when I was like, yeah, yeah, but I'd rather just do a bit and also go and get late all the time and sleep in and do other stuff that I like, then I would be worth more now. I don't regret that at all because I'm happy where I am financially, I'm not done but I'm certainly stable. And over the last 12 years of business, I have got to live my life throughout that whole period. So I never put aside five years where I just was like, okay, I'm going to put aside women and fun and exploring the world and all the things that I want to do. I'm just going to work and hustle and hustle and hustle until, you know, hustle, eat, pray, love. Oh no, that's a different one. Until I'm a millionaire and then people will love me and then I'll have some fun one day. So that wasn't the way I did things. And I guess that's what Tom's asking me about here because he wouldn't be asking me about the, how do you hustle all the time? He would have asked someone else. So the first thing that I want to look at with the work life balance is how effective is your hustle? I know when I, early on, I used to work a lot more hours, but when I look back on my lists of things that I was doing at the time, I was doing a lot of busy work, right? I was doing, I was doing a lot of things that felt like they were productive, um, and they're on the list so that they had to get done because they're on the list. And so I spent a lot of time doing stuff that wasn't really that effective. Um, over, over time, what I learned to do was to cut out stuff that was less necessary to 80, 20, that to look at, okay, what is it that actually creates income? And that's, that's a really important thing with a business early on is you can get lost in the design of the logo for six months or the, you know, making the website just so, or creating a Facebook group of people that are really fun and chatty and that you're having a good time with, or, uh, you know, creating spreadsheets. And there's all sorts of things that you can do that feel like work or feel like you're getting somewhere, uh, because you're ticking off your, your tasks for the day, but they're not actually building the business. And so it is, it's vitally important that whatever, if you're a service that you know what you, that you know how to do the thing that you are selling. And some, there's a lot, there's guys on the other side who don't do that at all, right? They only focus on the marketing and the sales, uh, and then whatever it is that they're selling is shit. I'm not an advocate of that. I'm sure, you know, there's ways that people can do that and essentially this is scamming people out of their money. So I don't suggest that, but what I'm, uh, on the, on the flip side of that is that you could spend years preparing yourself to go to market, getting, making everything perfect and getting the business card just exactly like the American psycho one and all that stuff. And we did a bunch of that early on. I've never used a business card, but we spent quite a bit of time designing a business card. I think there's a few kicking around here. I should find one. Uh, and then printed thousands of them and then never use them because what are you going to do? I'm walking down the street going, yeah, looking for chicks. And we did try once, we had some stripper friends and we gave them a bunch of the business cards and said, hand those out to the guys at the strip club thinking that would be a great idea. Turned out to be a really bad idea because you know what guys going to strip clubs don't want to be told is that they're shit with women by the stripper that they're kind of in love with and going, if you ever want to go like me, you should call these guys. That didn't work. So that was kind of a waste of money and effort and time cause it didn't yield any specific results. So it is really important to be looking at creating income as early as possible. And this is something that I learned from Liam and Sasha primarily was putting things out to market early and then getting feedback on it and adjusting it and making it better. So I'm a bit of a perfectionist, so I would often try and make something absolutely perfect before I presented it to the world. And over time with some help from guys like Sasha, we're like, cool, that's a great idea. Let's put it out. Let's put on a webinar about it, charge a cheap price and then do it and then see how people like it. The very first online product that I released, we'd been thinking about it and working on the ideas for the hugest, biggest product launch for years. And it never got it, never came to market. We got this marketing kid on early on, not early on, later on. And he was like, we can put a product out in two weeks. I'm like, no, we can't. That's there's a lot. And he's like, yes, we can. We do a webinar. It's going to cost $97. We're going to put a, what we did is we emailed out our list with a list of topics that we're like putting out a, like a, basically an online focus group saying, okay, which of these areas are the most important to you? A bunch of our fans sent back the form saying, this is what we're into. And that was the topic. And then out of that, we constructed a one or two hour one-off webinar that had a, you know, it was a one-off price. I think it was $97 and I made $20,000 in that one day. Right? So the product didn't exist. Two weeks later, it did exist. It was good quality. It was not the best, certainly not the best or most polished product I've ever put out. But we got the standard, what we now have one to 2% refund request, which is tiny. So if people didn't like it, they would have asked for refunds and they didn't. So they liked it. So that was, and from there we're like, ah, okay, right. Put it in a box, you know, build it, put it in a box, market it, sell it. And then, and then polish it up, you know, do and do another iteration of it later. Polish it. Take the feedback from the clients. If we'd ever had a product launch where, which totally tanked and everyone asked for refunds and gave bad reviews, which we never had, uh, then we would have scrapped that and then moved on to something else. But step-by-step we've, we've over the years released more expensive or bigger products, larger scale and more production and more complicated products based on that first one that was done with the idea of like, okay, we've got, let's get something out to market as soon as possible to get the feedback so that you, and that you are of course starting to earn income because, uh, when you're running a business, it's costing money all the time. Even if you're a very lean business, even if it's just in server costs and domains and there's just a lot of costs in running business. And uh, it's very important that we're at least breaking even and making profit in the first year. Uh, otherwise you won't survive, right? Like even if you have a lot of savings that you've put aside for this project, over some time you're going to come back, you're going to go down to zero. So it is vitally important that you're actually making profit. So that's the first thing, first thing to look at is, is the, is the work that you're doing actually effective or is it busy work? And there's a, there's a good book called Eat That Frog or Eat The Frog, I think it is, which is one of those, um, time management, getting tasks done kind of books, uh, which I read about six pages of to be honest, but I got the general gist of it. And that's the big idea on that one was whatever is the biggest, gnarliest, shittiest tar, like the hardest task, start, do that first, right? Because I know I'm guilty of that still to this day. It's like, I've got my list over here, my list. Someone screenshotted that and they were like, plumber, move the Zafus, go to the dentist. All right, well this isn't my business one, this is my personal one, so don't judge me. I need to go to the dentist. Uh, anyway, so I've got my list and I, on that one I would typically choose what's the fun, easiest one and the one that involves like calling a friend of mine and then I get the little dopamine hit of ticking it off the list and then there's the big one of like finish that product or finish writing your book or whatever the big tasks are and those ones tend to get moved over to the next and the next day. So it's a, it's a really good thing to do is that at the beginning of your work day, whatever that is, for me it's the crack of noon, then hit the first biggest task first. Okay, you may not be able to eat the whole frog in one go, but just take a bite off one of its legs and then that means that that task will actually get done as opposed to you moving through endless amounts of busy work that feels productive, but is actually, and feels like you're constantly hustling and grinding, but you're actually getting not much done and bringing nothing to market. The next very important point I want to make is that for any of you continuity sleuths out there, you may notice that in the previous shot over there was a Voltron and Star Wars Lego kit and now that has been replaced with a fancy looking clock. Why is that? Because we realized later, ah shit, we left the Lego in the shot and now we're going to have to replace it with a clock and then we're like, well then now we have to reshoot everything and I'm like, nah, I'll just make a joke about it. Anyway, that was 24 hours ago, so someone would have noticed my hair's different and I'm wearing a different colored pair of Ugg boots. Don't say I don't, I don't try and entertain you guys. All right, so anyway, back to the important shit. So next thing is, if we're looking at work life balance, is the discipline of being disciplined about your pleasure or about your personal time. Because when you run a business, it's never, it never ends. The tasks never end. You could, you could do stuff forever and this thing of I'd rather hustle 24 seven than slave nine to five. Yeah, maybe for some time, but if you're doing that all the time, then really you're just becoming a workaholic. Right? And that's, that's, that's a not glamorous way to say hustler. Someone who, whose work consumes every waking or hour of their life, um, is not someone who's living a well-rounded life. And I guess, I don't know because I've never had this, but if you work for someone else in an office and you clock off at X o'clock, then you get to go home and do your own thing. And so you have your own time and then you come in and you give your time to the man. And so there is a clear work life balance, whether or not it's perfect, it's there. When you are your own boss, then you have to do that for yourself. I've been, I've been guilty of both sides of that. So I've, I've certainly had long periods where I just keep doing stuff, keep doing tasks well in long into the night, uh, because I'm kind of addicted to it. And because I haven't, I, there's no off switch, there's no clear reason why to stop working in the short term. But the clear reason in the longer term is that, as I said before, like if you want to, if you want to become wealthy and successful, you have to work. But if that's going to take 10 years of only working, especially if it's something that's not that fun, uh, and you didn't get to live your life along the way, I don't know how much that's worth it. Right? I mean, for some people, they may just feel like, okay, I'm going to sacrifice 10 years of my life or X number of years of my life to eventually get the payoff. But who knows if we're ever going to get there. If you will eventually succeed or if you're even going to live that long because you might die tonight. So what I would say is that the way that I've tended to do things is to look at it this way. I will have periods of intense bursts of work, so I'll be kind of 100% on for some periods. So right now I'm preparing for the relaunch of the Lifestyle Design Academy and we're starting to ramp up the work. As it comes closer to the launch period, I will be working a huge amount and I won't be doing anything. There'll be no chicks, there'll be no olive trees, there'll be no shenanigans, uh, it'll just be grinding until the, until we get the launch out and then afterwards there'll be way less grinding. I can assure you there'll be 100% off times. And I think that's one, one cool way to do things that won't work for every business, but or every person, but allocating, okay, maybe I, if I'm someone who works really intensely in bursts, then do that, but then give yourself a certain amount of time, whether it's equal amount of time or 30% of the equivalent time to not touch the business or do the bare minimum that you have to do for maintenance. This is, this is a good way to get yourself out of the thing that you're always, always hustling, always in business mode. And that sometimes you're like, I'm always in pleasure mode or I'm always in self development or creative mode for a short period of time or a longer period of time. If you can claw that out, there's, um, the idea that, you know, you should be hustling 24 seven is, is also, I would say more to do with the early stages of the business, right? Like, so if you, okay, let's say you're in startup phase, you have a certain amount of runway capital to work with and you have to get something to market within a, within a certain amount of time, otherwise you're going to go broke. And so you have to just nail it and work. So you do need to work every waking hour for some period, uh, maybe a year or two or until you've got the thing sorted. But that's a like, I don't think, well, when I think of most of the businessmen that I know who are very successful, like guys who have made millions, uh, I do know some who only work, right? And it clearly is an addictive thing and they, and it's problematic. And they, they will, they will admit that. And they sometimes don't know what to do with themselves when they're not working. And so I'd say it's more of a pathology. It's not necessary, right? Like those guys could fire themselves from a whole bunch of jobs. They could certainly, certainly hand off a lot of tasks to other people, but they choose not to because they're workaholics. But the guys that I would say that have a really good life work-life balance who are extremely successful, yes, they kicked ass and work fucking hard when they first started for the startup phase. And once they started to create good income and they, and they were able to, uh, allocate and delegate tasks and, and hold departments to other people and in order to claw back time for themselves, then they didn't need to do that. And it would have been, and it's not the best strategy to be getting up and going, okay, I'm going to do 10 hours of grinding today. Which major CEO grinds for 10 hours on, in, in that capacity? No, their, their skill will be primarily as a leader, as a manager, as a, you know, kind of someone who seeks out new opportunities or makes contacts or does the big sales, um, you know, or works on the conceptualization of the, of the next big launch or product. Those are the important things for the manager to be working on. And the, the busy work, the hustle work, well, that should be done by employees, guys that are younger and have got way more energy and they're, and they're in that, that phase. And that's their job is to, to grind and get the grunt work done. I've, the best thing that I've done as a businessman over time is fire myself from as much of this business as is possible. Right? So I had to do a whole lot of it back then."}
