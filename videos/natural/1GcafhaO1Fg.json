James Marshall, dating coach and a goose farmer. Shush, shut up. I'm trying to film. Stop guarding. Stop guarding. I've had a lot of guys writing in about the Five Principles launch with two main questions. One is, I'm a student or I'm kind of broke or I don't have the money right now. Can I, is there any way you can squeeze me in? And so, what I've decided to do is to keep the enrollments open for one more day and I'm offering a part payment option. So, for guys that just didn't have the cash in time, there is now an option for the next day, next 24 hours for you to pay in three installments. So, you're welcome. And the other thing is that people are asking, well, what's inside? What actually happens in the online product? Which is a fair question. So, what I've decided to do was to put together a little walkthrough, a guided tour, if you will, of the inside of the Five Principles course, showing you how it works, what the content is and how the actual course structure works out. So, that's what this video is. Check it out. It's a little tour inside the course. So, you have 24 hours left to join and there is now part payment options for the students and anyone else who needs that. So, click the link in the description for full details and I'll see you because class is starting in 48 hours. I'll see you on the inside of this incredible, life-changing and final time ever, Five Principles of Natural Seduction Legacy Edition. Now, I'm going to get back to Farman McGee's. There is less than 24 hours left to join the Five Principles of Natural Seduction Legacy Edition. This is the final time that I will be running this course with all new updated material. And so, if you'd like to join me and a whole bunch of guys from around the world on this life-changing journey, then click the link in the description. Now, I've received a bunch of inquiries from guys asking for a bit more information about how the course works, what's on the inside. And so now, I'm going to take you for a little guided tour through the inside of the course and explain exactly how it works. The course runs over six weeks, where each week I'll be releasing new modules of information for you to watch through, to absorb, to think over, as well as, and most importantly, lots of practical drills for you to actually take this information out into the real world, meet real women and try to get on dates fast. This is not just a dump of information to sit and rot on your hard drive. This is an interactive course and I want to make sure that from day one, you are out there taking action, both on your internal development, through your awareness, through meditation, and very importantly, out in the real world, meeting women, starting interactions, trying to get them onto dates. So, let's look at how we're going to go about that. The foundation for the course lies in the five principles lectures. This is where I break down in depth what the principles are, so you can understand them intellectually, but more importantly, how to internalize them and then project them and utilize them in the real world. So, first principle is awareness. This is the bedrock, the foundation of all the other principles. If you are unable to become more aware of yourself, the way you think, your emotions, your physical body, then it's almost impossible to then project and utilize the rest of the principles. So, you'll learn the difference between internal and external awareness, how it applies to your internal state, being able to be relaxed, calm, out of your head and in the moment, and then how to project your awareness out into the external environment, to be able to read the vibe of the room, to be able to get in sync with the girl that you're working with, to be able to read her subtle cues and signals, so that you're not just blundering through, but you're actually having a subtle and nuanced interaction that is unique with every single girl. Second principle, intent. This is where you move from the essentially neutral space of awareness and then charge this with a masculine direction. Intent is the thing that drives a seduction forward. This is what women perceive as leadership, as a man who knows what he wants, as a man who can take her on a journey, as a man who has sexual desire, isn't afraid to show it, but also understands how to calibrate and not make it creepy or sleazy. Principle three, emotional impact. Seduction is not just a logical linear intellectual process. In fact, it's really not that at all. It is essentially two people meeting and having feelings. So if you are emotionally stilted or if you're not able to elicit and amplify emotions in a woman, then she's not really going to feel anything. Therefore, she's not going to be attracted to you. So in this module, we look at how to dig deep into the emotional space of a woman as well as being able to transmit and express your own emotions so that you can have a powerful, real and authentic connection. Principle four, pressure and release. This is essentially the engine of seduction. Social pressure is inherent in almost every interaction, but most men, when they come in contact with it, withdraw from it or try to make things pleasant and comfortable and nice. And so they come across as nice guys and they don't elicit sexual tension. They don't make a woman feel excited. They don't create anticipation and the positive pressure that needs to be there to draw a woman into you. So this is vitally important that you learn how to become at ease, sitting in pressure, projecting it and receiving it. This is the thing that rapidly speeds up a seductive process. And finally, principle five, decisiveness. The ability to pull the trigger, to be able to step out into the unknown, to go for what you want, even and especially when you're not sure if it's actually going to work. Women rate this consistently as one of the most attractive qualities a man can have. The ability to go for what he wants, to take what he wants, to be able to make a move without necessarily seeking permission or being sure that everything is going to go his way. This shows bravery. It shows assertiveness. It shows leadership. And this is not something that you only do when you ask a girl out for a coffee or invite her upstairs. This is essentially a way of living. In this principle module, I'll be talking to you about how to instill trigger-pulling decisiveness as a habit that you were doing all the time. So it means that when you reach those situations in an interaction or a seduction where it's necessary for you to step out into the abyss, to make a move, to make something happen, it will be part of your reflex. As a special addition to the Legacy Edition version of the five principles, what I've done is provided you with a completely updated version of the original lecture series. So in the original lectures, I'm showing you how the principles work, what they mean, how to apply them in a very practical way, specifically in your interactions, meeting a girl anywhere, anytime, starting something, getting on a date and getting into a sexual relationship. However, over the last 10 plus years of coaching, I've had countless hours out in field with students, retesting, trialing, tweaking all of the elements of the five principles in action. And my own personal journey has led me to much deeper understandings over time. So what I've done is sat down and recorded a brand new series of lectures, six brand new lectures on the five principles, where I take these things out to a much more meta level, understanding how the principles relate to your personal journey as a man, your lifetime seductive journey. So not just meeting girls and getting them into a sexual relationship, but how do you maintain a relationship? How do you keep an amazing woman? How do you maintain and grow your sense of masculinity and manhood? How is it that you can use these principles in all areas of communication with yourself, so that you're at ease with yourself, you feel calm, confident, and out in the world with all the people that you meet? So this is an incredible new update that has never been before seen and is available now and only with the Legacy Edition five principles course. As I said earlier, the five principles is not just a big bunch of videos for you to sit down and watch in the comfort of your own home. If you watch the material and don't take action, then literally nothing much will happen except you will have a better intellectual understanding of the dating process. It's very important to me that you go out and take real-world action and are getting results. So that's why this course is so interactive. A big part of this is the weekly missions and drills. I've broken down a series of missions for you that increase incrementally in difficulty and complexity so that you can take each of the principles individually, go out and apply them, test them, see how they work for you, and then over time understand how they all blend together. Because the reality is the five principles are not five separate things that you do. They are essentially five expressions of the same thing, of your core masculine desire presence and the overall elemental or natural laws that are happening between men and women. So week by week, I will guide you through this series of internal drills through meditation, posture, awareness. So getting inside yourself, understanding yourself more so that you can become more at ease, so that you can cut out the white noise that's happening in your mind and get in the present moment. And then to be able to take that out and to deliver that you that is present to the women that you're going to meet. Week by week, these missions will gradually build upon each other as you get a comprehensive skill set. As part of the legacy update for the five principles, I've included seven huge bonus modules. This massive library of auxiliary material helps you to understand the principles from a wide range of angles. Drawing in different experts in the dating field, interviews with women, breakdowns of infield videos with careful analysis, meditation systems and a whole lot more. Bonus one is a series of in-depth interviews with seduction experts that I know, trust and respect. These are guys who are experts in their field and what I do is talk to them in depth about the principles from their own perspectives showing that men that are natural with women, inherently understand these principles, although the way that they express them and utilize them may be very different person by person. Bonus two is a series of infield videos where you get to see me and my coaches out in action, meeting women in the real world as well as in-depth analysis breakdowns of each of these interactions. I explain in detail how the principles are being applied so you can see that this is not just intellectual entertainment, this is not just theory, but this is highly applicable in the real world. Bonus three is my sexual escalation masterclass. In this extra three-hour module, I explain how the principles are applied in terms of escalation, getting physical and sexual with a girl and then I demonstrate it with a real model so you can see how they apply in real life. Bonus four is six detailed interviews with sexy, beautiful young women talking to them about their inner secrets when it comes to sexuality, dating and dealing with men. This is an invaluable resource as you're getting to hear directly from the target audience that you're going to be interacting with what it feels like to have the principles applied on them and with them, what it feels like to be with a guy who gets it and to be interacting with men who simply do not and repel them. This resource will teach you more about the woman's mind, how she wants to be interacted with so that when you're out in the field, you're able to empathize and get real results. Bonus five is my complete awareness meditation system. As I said, awareness is the foundational principle from which all the others spring. Without having a clear way to navigate with awareness, they're just disassociated threads that don't really make any sense. The idea of being present, being in the now sounds nice, but if it's just an intellectual idea, then it's not actual meditation. So what I've done from my many years of traveling the globe, learning from different spiritual teachers, different meditation masters, is I've chosen the techniques that are the simplest to learn and yet have the most powerful and profound effects. I take you through these meditation techniques step by step so that you can apply them daily, meaning that you are more relaxed, more calm, out of your head, being in the present moment in a way that is a felt-sense experience as opposed to just an idea. This leads you to be spontaneous in flow and to be able to have natural connections with the people that you meet. For bonus six, I've provided you with 10 video recordings of live webinars that I held with the original students from the first two intakes of the Five Principles course. Over 15 hours, the students on the course hammered me with challenging, hard-hitting questions, and I do not hold anything back. This is where I get to explain in depth all of the nuances and the details regarding the course, regarding the challenges and experiences that the guys had, and answering a whole range of questions on everything to do with sexuality, seduction, dating, lifestyle design, in a game, you name it. This massive library is an invaluable resource as you get to see the progress of previous students, the challenges they went through, the experiences they had out in field, and to start thinking about seduction, lifestyle design, and personal change in a much broader context, not just based on your own experience, but those of the many guys that have already been through this course. In bonus seven, this is your chance to get on live calls with me to be mentored through the process of the course. Over five in-depth live webinars, you get to ask me any questions on the course material, on your experiences and challenges as you take the content and missions out in field, and to receive motivation and accountability to make sure that this course leads you to direct action. Week by week, you can come back, get further feedback as you gradually improve your skills and your efficacy and results with women. This huge library of bonus material is available free of charge when you join the Five Principles of Natural Seduction Legacy Edition. You'll also get access to a private Facebook group where members of the previous classes as well as this current group can interact with me daily, asking questions, getting advice, as well as meeting up with other guys in their cities, in their countries to wing with and go out and practice in field. This is the worldwide TNL Brotherhood. It's a place of non-judgment, of support, where men can come and discuss the areas that they are struggling with, their challenges, their triumphs, and get a huge amount of motivation and a sense of belonging to this historical movement, a men's movement for actual... deep personal change. So there you have it, a brief tour inside the five principles of natural seduction, my legacy edition, the final time I'll be running this course. It's available to join right now, but only for the next 24 hours. After that, I'll be closing the doors and moving on to mentoring the guys that have signed up for the course. So if you'd like to join me and a group of men from around the world on this massive journey to take you to seductive excellence and personal success, click the link below. I'll see you in a couple of days as the course starts."}
