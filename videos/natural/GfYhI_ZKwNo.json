So what I'm using is I'm using my middle finger and my thumb. Okay so there's the divide so you can feel and I find the divide. I'm going to place the middle finger right between the two eyelets of the bra, press into the body a little bit and then I use the thumb to just like so flick it off. Then I run my hands up to the straps, take them off and then the bra just drops. It's all in one motion, it goes quick, drop like so, comes off very easily. So if you find yourself in a situation where you've got a girl wearing a corset or something with multiple eyelets, it's the same as the bra, we just start at the top and we just start bunching them off like that."}
