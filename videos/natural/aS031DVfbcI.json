But yeah, it's a fucking boring place. And if you live there, I suggest you get out. Because anyone I know that was interested left. However, at that time I was there and I was studying Chinese medicine. I was doing a diploma course where I was studying acupressure, herbs, anatomy, spirituality, meditation, a whole bunch of stuff that I was really interested in. And at the same time, that was the point when I was most dedicated to my martial arts practice. I was doing Shaolin Kung Fu, as many of you would know from knowing my story. And that was really my obsession at the time, was Eastern healing arts, spirituality, and Eastern martial arts. So as part of this course, we got to go to China. And to go to the north of China, to Liaoning province, and do an internship in a hospital, which was a fascinating experience. Seeing a hospital where they use acupuncture needles just as much as they use drugs. I saw some wild shit, like people sticking needles right through people's wrists. And a guy who'd been paralyzed and become blind from being electrocuted, like he was an electrician, he'd been badly electrocuted and was blind, they healed him by sticking needles into his eyeballs, which was pretty fucking intense. Anyway, this internship was about four weeks, I think, in the Chinese hospital. And then we had to come back and go straight back into our coursework for the course. Now, I had been studying and obsessed with Shaolin Kung Fu for, at that time, six-ish years. Five, six years. This was my path. I was going to become a monk. I spent many hours every week, two, three hours at least a day, training this martial arts. I was obsessed at this time. And so I had a chance to go to China. And I was about a ten-hour train ride in the north from Shaolin Temple. And what I decided to do was to finish the internship, and on the last day, say to my teachers, Hey, I'm really sorry, but I'm going to go somewhere else today. I'm not coming home to Australia. And I'm going to be probably a couple of weeks, three, four weeks late to come back into the course. And they said, well, you can't do that. I said, yeah, I know, I probably can't do that. But I'm going to do it anyway, because I have to go and do something that's really important to me. And I will find a way to make up the coursework. Please don't kick me out of the course. I'll do double shifts. I'll do extra exams or whatever it needs to do to catch up. But I'm going to have to go. And I got on a train. I traveled ten hours-ish down south to Hunan province. Caught another bus. Went out to Shaolin Temple, where I didn't know anyone. I didn't have an invitation letter. And it's to go and train with the real monks in Shaolin. I doubt there are any real monks in Shaolin Temple now. Because at that time, it was the last generation of real monks. The Chinese government was coming in and putting in their own puppet monks. And turning it into basically a theme park. But at that time, I knew that there were some of the last lineage of real monks there. But you can't just rock up and go, hey, to the abbot. You know, this essentially enlightened master. Hey, I'm a white dude and I just want to come here and do some Kung Fu. It doesn't work like that. You need a letter of invitation. And you need to go through a process of vetting to come in and do this. However, I just decided I was that close to the place that I was most intensely drawn to. That I had to just go. Fucking the consequences. And so I turned up at the small village near the temple. And by a series of amazing karmic or random chance events. I got to meet a guy who introduced me to another guy. Who introduced me to one of the monks that I'd heard about. That was real lineage. Who introduced me to the abbot. And I was given an opportunity to study there and to train there. That's a whole other story. And an interesting story which you can read about in my book, Natural History. Or if you've seen my 21 Convention Studios talk. I talk about this at length. But the point is that I took a major risk. And I did the opposite of what I was supposed to do. So I was supposed to, if I was following the general pathway. Which is what people tell you in the civilized western world. Or many places around the world. Where if you're an intelligent person. That's trying to become educated. And trying to succeed in life. But there are certain steps that you must follow. And if you do follow them. They will lead you to a successful life. And if you deviate from them. In any major way. You are risking failure. You are absolutely likely to end up in poverty. In deep regret. And to fuck up your life. That's the narrative that so many of us are taught. We're taught that. If you're not from a disgustingly rich family. You're from a middle class family. Or working class. You're just someone who has to make their own life for them. It's not going to be handed to you. Then you're told. If you're going to do that. Then you must get really good grades at school. Go immediately into university. Preferably a college. And do something. Not necessarily something that you're interested in. But something that should get you a real job. And then. As soon as you finish that job. You should try and find an internship. Or get straight into another thing. And then lock yourself into that career path. For the next 40 years of your life. And your leisure time. Or your personal exploratory time. Needs to be limited to your weekends. And to the 4 weeks. A year that your workplace. Grants you of your own personal free time. And you're supposed to continue doing that. And along the way. You're definitely supposed to very quickly. Find a woman that's your own age. Your same demographic. Marry her. Have children with her. And then purchase an expensive debt. Which is your house. Because you can't. Who the fuck can afford to buy a house outright. I did it. And that was because I did things exactly the opposite of what everyone told me to. Everyone else I know back in Australia. Who followed this pathway. They didn't buy a house. They bought 40 years of debt. And Australia particularly is in this huge housing bubble. Where to buy a simple house. Anywhere inside a metropolitan city. Is going to cost you a million bucks. Whereas my parents here. They bought our house in the centre of Canberra. For $40,000. And that's in 1 or 2 generations. That massive change. Anyway I digress. And then work until around 65. And then you can retire. On your 401k in America. Or your superannuation in Australia. Or whatever it is in the UK. And in Europe. And then you can come to Scotland. Then you can go walking around Scotland. And do the things that you want to do. And then you die. So that's your prescription for a successful life. I'm not going to say that is necessarily the worst thing to do. Of course that is a legitimate way to do things. For some people. For our parents generation. Baby boomer generation. Particularly in places like the US. And Australia. Where there was massive employment. Where there was huge economic growth. Based around the fact that. The second war had destroyed most of the wealth. And destroyed so much infrastructure. And destroyed so many humans. That there was a need. There was so much need for labour. There was so many opportunities. Because the planet had been gutted. And it was kind of starting again. It was a unique time in history. That created a unique. Time of prosperity. For the working and middle classes. And it is important. I think when you are getting into self help. When you are getting into entrepreneurship. When you are getting into positive thinking. It's important to have delusionally positive beliefs. But it's also important to look at. Where do I exist in the timeline of history. Because the country that you are living in. The economy that's happening around you. The zeitgeist. As in the spirit of the time. The things that are working. The things that are not. Shifts generation to generation. Back in our parents time. When things were stable and growing. Going to university and doing almost anything. Studying almost anything. Would mean that you could go into a job. And that you could buy a house. Early in life. And pay it off reasonably easily. A working class man. Could support an entire family. And buy a new car every few years. That American dream. Or the Australian dream of that period of time. Was a possibility for the average person. As long as they did work hard. And study hard. And didn't become gamblers. And do something really reckless. That they could succeed in that way. That era is over. That time doesn't exist anymore. And a lot of your parents. Who are telling you. That you've got to do this something. Don't have no idea what the fuck they're talking about. In terms of the modern era. They are living in a mentality. Of a generation or two ago. That worked. A generation or two ago. And now mostly doesn't work. There are some fields where. Engineering or medicine. Or law. Like traditionally kind of white collar jobs. There's still a clear need for it. And if you follow a certain path through. It's reasonably likely that you'll be able to get somewhere. But in this day and age. The way that I did things. Which to many people. Looks like insanely risky. I've recognized now. As I've gone getting through my career. And getting through my life. That I accidentally. Did a very outwardly risky path. That is actually far more safe and intelligent. Than most people of my generation. When I look at my friends. Back in Australia. The choices that they made. That were based around security, safety. And following the rules. Have in many cases led them to. Prisons of their own creation. In the sense that they got. They had children very young. With a woman that wasn't the right woman for them. Or a man that wasn't the right man for them. Because they hadn't formed their personalities yet. Because they hadn't actually truly explored themselves. And so they hooked up with someone. Who also hadn't fully explored themselves. And over 3, 4, 5 years. They changed massively. And were no longer compatible. Unfortunately by that time. They had inseminated. One or the other of them. Created a new creature. That they now had to deal with together. Whether or not they fucking hated each other. For the next 20 years minimum. And others of them. Saddled themselves with insane debt. To buy a fucking house in the suburbs. In some Australian city. Which is not particularly interesting. And then they have to then stay in their job forever. To pay this fucking thing off. Or to pay off the car. Or to pay off their university debts. By me following. Actually following my passions. And deciding that I was going to. Not go home and do that exam. I was just going to go to Shaolin Temple instead. Was one of the first major steps. That led me on these pathways. To bouncing around the world. From success to success. As well as crushing failure. In between the successes. I've certainly gotten smashed back by reality. And by circumstances. And by bad business deals. And plenty of other things. But overall I've been managing to increase my success. And my satisfaction in life. In a way that most people don't. I don't know where I heard this saying. But it's a good one. It's better to beg for forgiveness. Than ask for permission. And that's not always true. Of course because sometimes. If you commit a crime. It's not really better to beg for forgiveness. Than to ask for permission. You just shouldn't have done the crime. But in terms of making decisions. About how you want to live your life. And things that you want to do. In the case of me going to China. For example. I'd made my decision. I'm going to do this. Out of courtesy I just told my teachers. And then what did happen in the end? I came back from spending a month in Shaolin Temple. Where I got to train. With the last great masters of this system. That are still alive. Most of them are not alive now. And I got to. Deepen my spiritual pursuit. I got massive clarity. About what I wanted to do with my life at that time. Which is very different from what I'm doing now. But at that time. It locked me in. This is clear to me now. That I'm on the right path. That I'm doing something that's really spectacular to me. And I'm growing and I'm changing. And I'm becoming a really powerful young man. From a guy that was like a nerdy, shy. Socially awkward. Brutalized, bullied. Child from a poor family. That played flute. And just got punched at school. To a guy at 22. Who was powerful. I didn't have worldly power. I didn't have money or influence. I had a deeper insight into my own psyche. Than most people ever do. Because I'd been meditating with the Shaolin monks. And going deeper and deeper into my core. The benefits of that month. Have ricocheted throughout my life. And have intensified. As they bounce from. Other amazing opportunity. To other amazing teacher. And to a continual thirst. And quest for knowledge. And experience. Not just book knowledge. Definitely lots of book knowledge. But personal lived experiences. I went back. And the teachers were like. You're fucking late aren't you? Sure are a month late. Sorry about that. I know that's caused you some inconvenience. How can we fix this? What do I need to do to finish this course? You're going to have to do some extra work. I'll do some extra work. Might cost you a little bit of extra money. Because you have to do an extra thing over the summer. Okay let's do that. So I just figured it out and caught up. And everyone else that went back. They had no advantage over me. Except that I just had to have a few more sleepless nights. To finish a few exams. And I got to have that experience. Most of the men that I deal with. We now have a pretty clear demographic. Of guys that we teach. And that evolve over time. I've taught every single type of person. I've literally taught royalties. I've taught male models, I've taught millionaire CEOs, I've taught the best poker players in the world. But those kind of like really interesting out there guys are the outliers. I've also taught plenty of guys who are very just broke students or guys just starting out in the workforce who managed to do exactly what I'm talking about. They went and took a bank loan out or they worked three jobs or they spent that inheritance that granny gave them and they sold that fucking car which is just dragging them down in order to come and do a course with me. So they really pushed well beyond what seemed sensible in order to come and train with me because they understood that this is a vitally important life-changing experience and I think they were also conscious of the fact that the time is now. If I hadn't have gone to Shaolin Temple then, if I'd gone, well I'll finish that course and then I'll save up some money and I'll open my Chinese medicine clinic and I'll get established and then I'll go to Shaolin Temple, I would have been sorely disappointed because I would have rocked up five years later and the abbot would be dead because he died a couple of years after I went there. Yeah, two years after I went there. The teacher that I ended up learning with wasn't in the temple. When I went back four years later, he'd gone. I don't know where he went. He just vanished as the Buddhist monks sometimes do. So when I first went in 2002 to the second time I went in 2004, that temple was totally different, radically different. They tripled the size of it. They turned it into this huge Chinese government. They turned it into this huge kind of Kung Fu theme park and by that time, even just two years after I first went, there was only one of the teachers left in the temple that I knew was the real deal. And then I'm sure a couple of years later, it would have been empty and now I am absolutely certain that that temple is just an empty shell of what it once was, even though it's big and grand and got guys swinging swords around. They're not monks. They're acrobats who go out and chain smoke and have sex with chicks and party afterwards, and no judgment on them for that, but that's not what I went there for. There are certain times in your own lifetime where things exist and then a few years later, they just don't exist. And it's important for you to understand that you're aging. I'm really starting to sense that now as a 37-year-old guy. I can feel my body shift and change and I recognize that I need to maintain my discipline in my health and I need to grab moments away from the endless stream of shit that you should do that pulls time off you. Right now, I'm standing on a beach on the Isle of Arran in Scotland and for the last five days, myself, my girlfriend, my brother and his wife have been walking around this spectacularly beautiful, peaceful, glorious island. I shouldn't be here because I'm the CEO of now quite a complicated company. Four days ago, I was in Budapest with a list like three pages long. I can show it to you if you'd like of shit that I have to do. My company is going through a really, really complicated phase at the moment because we've had a big shift in the team, like a reorganization of not the coaching team, but the back-end team, the marketing and the website design and all that kind of stuff. I had to shuffle people around, reassign roles, fire some people. At the same time, we are trying to move the company as a structure away from Australia and move it offshore because that's the smart thing to do in terms of taxation and the fact that we're a global company now. As well as that, I'm organizing a relaunch of a product. We're just about to hit the intense coaching season where we coach all around Europe and USA. I'm constantly working on material like this and there's just a million other, without hyperbole, I'd say that there is a hundred at least tasks that I have to do every week as the company head. What I've learned about being in business is that you never ever finish. I think there's this idea, especially with the kind of life hacker entrepreneur, or our work week kind of thing, that there's this fantasy that you just set up some turnkey business and then you press go and that's it. You're the CEO and you just collect the cash and you check in once a week to just check on something and go, yep, everything's perfect, excellent. And then you go back to reading The Way of the Superior Man on your yacht, something like that. I've had those fantasies and I recognize now, after now being in business for nearly 10 years, that there is never an end to the duties of a boss. There are certainly better, more effective ways to be a manager and I'm always fighting my own desire to be a micromanager, to try and step back, delegate things, to recognize that the 80-20 rule is really important to have in place. Quite a long time ago, I stopped teaching cheap workshops. I stopped dealing with private clients who wanted to do an hour of coaching. Because I realized, I was told this but I had to go through the period of having my time wasted by people, is that the people who want the cheap stuff are the people that cause you the most trouble. Because they're looking for bargains, they're not looking for quality coaching. Whereas the guys that see me and go, yep, that guy's got the goods, they pay and they just fucking rock up because they know that it's quality and they know that it's not going to last forever and they don't waste your time. So learning how to 80-20 things to recognize that 20% of your clients are going to create 80% of your income and a lot of the other guys are going to fucking waste your time. So shifting those kinds of things is a constant juggle to figure out, alright, am I putting too much time into something that someone else could do or is just not worth doing? But still, no matter how much of that you do, how effective you become as a manager, there is endless, endless tasks. This game is never won. Last year I had the most successful year of my life. I made way more money than I've ever made, hit all sorts of goals and exploded them in terms of all the metrics of what I wanted to achieve. Not just in my business life but in terms of my relationship life. I have an amazing girlfriend who is also bisexual. We went around and had sex with heaps of girls together, did all sorts of amazing stuff. But what I recognized was that last year I just worked. And I got the fruits of that labor. But I saw that I could just keep doing that in this business, maybe for another 20 years. And there's never an off time. It's like I could keep working until 3 in the morning, and often I do, every single day. And this year I recognized that, okay, I'm starting to lose some of the lifestyle that I'm famous for. Some of the lifestyle that I've constructed this life around. Because other stuff and other people will just take it all from you if you let them. And this is where the idea of waiting until you're 65 to enjoy your life is such an insidious and dangerous idea. Because when you're 65 your body's not that great anymore. Your cock's not as hard as it used to be. And young beautiful women probably don't want to fuck you as much as they do when you're 20 to 40. So many of the things that were really relevant to you. Maybe when you were 25 or 30 you had a dream to be a musician. Or to go riding your bicycle around France. Or to start a non-for-profit organization. Or go and volunteer somewhere. Or climb fucking Mount Everest. Or something that was really challenging and really important to you. And then you wait 10 years and it's no longer relevant. Because now you've got fucking kids. Or now you've got that knee injury from that time when you got hit by a motorcycle. Or any of the many other things that can happen and will happen in your life that will start taking away your freedom. Particularly when you're a young single man. That's the time to go and do the stuff. Not when you've got fucking children. Because I've seen what happens to my friends. Those things take a lot of time. They take all the time. You have to look at them all the time. You have to keep an eye on the little fucker all the time. Otherwise it falls off a cliff. You just have to be there with it all the time. And they're often really boring. They just say the same thing over and over again. I'm just looking at my fake child here in the bramble. It's like, you're really annoying me. You're just spending five years just asking me questions why. I'm not ready for that clearly. But I've seen my friends deal with it. And of course you get whatever you get back from having a child. I'm not convinced that it's worth the price. But you certainly lose your freedom and autonomy. Unless you're disgustingly rich and can outsource that to a nanny. In which case the kids are going to have all these issues. Because then you weren't there for it anyway. So how do you win? I don't know. Another issue for another time. But the point is, now is the fucking time to do the things. So that's why when my brother contacted me. He's like, hey do you want to go for a long walk around Scotland? And my brother is a specialist at choosing amazing, simple experiences that enrich your life. Over ambition and money and chasing the rat race dream. He is one of the most, probably the best I've ever seen. At living a really, really amazing life on next to no cash. And I was like, ah shit, I really can't do that. That's a bad time of my year. Because I'm just about to start the coaching season. And then I'm like, no I definitely need to do that. I absolutely need to unwind. And of course I want to go and see this awesome place. And I love nature and I want to bring more of that into my life this year. And so I said, yep, let's do that. I blocked out multiple periods during this year. In August, I'm going to go and spend all of August in China. I'm going back for the first time in 10 years. To do a very, very intense Kung Fu course with an amazing teacher that I found. Not the original teachers that I was with. But a new teacher who's spectacularly good. Again, like a CEO of a 7 figure business. Just like uprooting and disappearing for a month. Because I won't be contactable to go and learn Kung Fu when he's 37 years old. Isn't that insane and childish? No, that's why I started this whole thing. And I know, I recognize that I have an amazing luxury. Because I can. I don't have to, like I'm the boss. So I can say to myself, alright, I'm going to take a month off. And I'm not going to get fired. Many people don't have that luxury. I understand that there's, of course, realistic concerns that you have to work around. The fact that some people, many people just need to work in a job. And work their asses off for certain periods of time. But if you don't have any other plan. It's like, get a good job and stay there forever. To me, that's such a waste of this rare time in history where there are other possibilities. There are other ways of living. And I'm not saying it's as easy as just set up an online business. Because that's kind of a dream that is sold to you by Tim Ferrissey types. And a lot of it's just marketing stuff as well. It's like, okay, it's not that it's impossible. I know many people who run those kinds of businesses. But they're not as simple as just like Google searching something that people are buying. And then sourcing it from China. And then setting up a little online shop. And then you're done. There's more complexity to it than that. But there are certainly now infinite possibilities of lifestyles. And ways to earn money. And ways to leverage money. And location. That did not exist before the internet. That did not exist before very cheap airline travel. That did not exist before most borders in the world were open to people who are lucky enough to have a decent passport. And if you're not going to take advantage of that. And in this age where social media is just in your face about all these possibilities of lifestyle and chicks. And living remotely. And guys living in Eastern Europe or in Thailand or in South America. For a quarter of the price of what it costs back in London or Sydney or New York. Which are cities that are vibrant and cool in many ways. But they're also exorbitantly expensive. And really, really brutal to try and make it in. I live in Central Europe. For many reasons. But partially because the cost of it is a quarter of what Sydney is. I like Sydney. I like going there for a month a year. But it drains my bank account just being there for a month. Living in Central Europe and yet getting paid in hard currencies from the West. Means that I get to live five, ten times the level of lifestyle. Than someone earning the same amount of me as me living in London. Right? It's just fucking smart to do that kind of thing. Many people would have thought, That guy is just uprooting and moving to Budapest with a handful of cash. That's what I did a few years ago. Uprooted, moved over to Europe with not much money. Set up and then told Liam, Dude, you have to come over here. And he's like, what? I don't want to live in Australia. I'm like, no, we all have to move over here. Because the worst case is you just go back to what was going on in Australia. But the best case is we now have access to the European market and the US market. Whereas previously we're in the arse end of the world. In this tiny island, huge island with a tiny population. We can't grow there. Australia is limited by its environment. Doesn't matter how much positive thinking or how much for envisioning. Or how much using the secret or how much hustle that we do. That environment is limited. We need to be in a richer environment. It was a series of really great decisions to take what appear to be obscene risks. But are actually far less risky than staying still. Trying to stay still and put your head under a blanket and go, Alright, this was fine 40 years ago here. So I'm going to stay here. Is not a viable option for most types of work that involves, That allows you to have an amazing lifestyle as well. So where am I going with all this? How is this relevant to you? The way, on very practical terms, What my recommendation is, Is that every year, and we can start now. I know that we're halfway through the year, but you can start now. You don't have to wait till New Year's Day, When you're like hung over and going, I promise I'll never do it again. Just start now. Is to look at your year and figure out, How much time can you claw back from your obligations? Sometimes that means, For the guys that I've taught, often they've just gone, You know what, fuck it, I'm just going to quit. And I think quitting is a virtuous action in many ways. Quitting things that you hate, Or that are not soul enriching for you, Or that you're doing for somebody else, Is a really bad thing."}
