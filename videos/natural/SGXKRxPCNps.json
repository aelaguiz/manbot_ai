When you're under pressure, and you're not feeling comfortable Mirrors Well this question Suggests to me that you think that in order to be yourself you need to be cool. You need to be relaxed you need to Be at your best That's not true Right now. I'm being myself. I'm not perfectly in state. It feels a bit weird I'm walking down the streets here every single person that I walk past is staring at me But I'm still absolutely being myself The point is to be yourself is to be comfortable with the many aspects of yourself All right, so of course there is there is our ideal version of ourself Which is the one where we're super cool and confident and relaxed in every single situation But the reality being that in multiple aspects and multiple points in your life. You're not going to be that thing however That is still being yourself The truth is that if you're talking about this in terms of seduction women are not looking for a man who is perfect They do not expect when you go up and speak to them that every single thing that you that comes out of your mouth is Going to be on point smooth And and perfectly timed in any way In fact if a guy does do that if a guy comes up in is too smooth and everything seems to be You know it's it's a little bit suspect because she perceives that this is a guy who has a script This is a guy who does this all the time? There's something kind of a little bit dodgy about a guy who is too smooth I'm not saying you should pretend to you should deliberately try and fuck up your interactions but you should just generally go with what is the state that you're feeling what is your desire and Accept the fact that you're not going to be perfect because women will Right a lot of men that I teach are in analytical fields where? Pretty much you have to get things a hundred percent right for them to be right at all If you're an engineer, and you're working on building a building it can't just be more or less, okay Can't just be you know the Australian. She'll be right. Yeah, be right. It's not alright buildings fall over if they're not correctly made seduction is not like Engineering it is not an exact science It does not require you to do everything perfectly and women simply do not expect that the fact is that single women are looking for guys to hook up with they're looking for people who are fallible who are human who have their own idiosyncrasies and strengths and weaknesses and The truth is that the actual actually confident men are men who are able to be more or less okay with the fact that they're not Perfect right so in answer to your question How do you how do you get to be yourself in a high-pressure situation is that you accept that under high pressure You are going to not necessarily be in peak performance and you are going to feel nervous and one of the simplest ways that we help men to get through their social anxiety or the nerves that they have around approaching women is To simply call it out all right So you can do this simply you're if you're chatting to a girl, and you're freezing up And you're feeling uncomfortable and and the words are not coming out of your mouth you can tell her that You can say listen. I you're so crazy beautiful that I really don't know what to say right now or This is kind of unusual for me Makes me kind of nervous to speak to you, and so just give me a second I've done things like where I've gone in and totally fucked up an opener and been all Locked up, and then I say all right listen Do you mind if I just come back in and do that again, and I just come back and go all right here? I am again. How you doing my name is James That kind of stuff is endearing because it shows so that you're okay with not being perfect And the truth is that awkwardness is two or more people Pretending that something is not awkward Right so it's like that's that's the situation where you're at a dinner party And you have to sit next to somebody that you have nothing in common with except the fact that you know the host and you Run out of things to say in 25 seconds, and then you're sitting there going clear, so uh How do you know Gerald? Oh, you know through work excellent? And then you sit there trying to act like you're not awkward which intensifies this negative pressure If you were to simply say you know what buddy I know this is kind of weird, but um we clearly don't have anything in common And this is all awkward do you mind if we just text on my phone because it's gonna be simpler that would actually be fine right or you're in a situation where you're chatting to a girl and You're like so what do you do? And she's like I'm a student and then like five seconds later you kind of lose it, and you go So anyway, what is it you're doing? She said yeah? I'm a student, and you've asked the same question twice, and this is a really awkward situation Don't grin and bear it and go yeah, so anyway. What's it like to be a student just go I just had a brain fight That's retarded. I just asked you the same question twice alright. You asked me a question alright So calling out of these kinds of situations will relieve the pressure from them So that's I mean that's a technical way that you can deal with it, but the underlying essentially the mindset underlying this is that To be cool and relaxed and calm Means that you also need to be able to step into many situations where you're not that All right The reason that I'm generally overall confident is that I have failed in far more social situations than you've even tried to step into Right, that's that's the serious. That's the serious You know revelation you should really be taking is that the master has failed more times than the beginner has even tried Yeah, I have been humiliated and embarrassed and put in all sorts of awkward situations because I want to become socially proficient and During that journey I've had to accept that that loser nerdy Uncalibrated part of me is also me as well as the sometimes I got it totally smooth and cool and relaxed and yeah, don't I feel like a boss part of me is me The greatest seduces are the ones who are able to be both those things to live in that paradox of loser hero to be to live in that paradox of smooth and stilted and Understanding that people will accept that they will happily accept that especially when you own it yeah, people don't like people who are arrogant and arrogance is is manifest by Trying too hard to be perfect by trying to put forward the position that you are always in control You always not know what you're doing. You always know what you're talking about and people find that To be very very unattractive Whereas the confident man is the man who knows more or less who he is what he knows and he also knows what he doesn't he's also okay with the fact that he's not perfect in all situations and That he's going to trip up and make a fool of himself sometimes and then he's going to get up and it's going to be Cool. All right, so there's me answer. There's me answer to you, mate Learn to be okay with the aspects of yourself Which you're afraid of revealing because seduction is always about revealing yourself You cannot become a great seducer unless you reveal yourself many men try to hide themselves behind game, right? So they only they they try to put on a false front of bravado Try and seduce the woman without revealing anything about themselves particularly at all That's one of the common problems. I have when teaching guys is they fairly quickly learn how to draw investment and information out of women But they're typically very bad at speaking about themselves revealing. They're good and bad. They're weak and strong personality traits Women want to know you and as part of that is they're going to also need to and want to know The aspects of you which are not perfect because that makes you human if you're okay with not being perfect Then other people can be okay with not being perfect with themselves around you And that's very very relaxing for a girl to step into a situation where she can be a fool She can be playful. She can be silly. She can make mistakes and she can feel accepted and Learn to enjoy those aspects of being a fallible human being so that's it for me James Marshall signing out from Union Square, New York City. See you guys next time The most common question that men ask me is actually not specifically about dating and seduction It goes something along the lines of this James How is it that you are able to stay so calm relaxed and centered even under high pressurized social situations? Now I guess a lot of men presume that that's just my nature I'm just a chilled out relaxed Aussie surfer kind of dude The reality being that I grew up being somebody that was highly stressed Angry and cynical and I went through a long process of self-discovery to be able to bring myself to the calm Centered position that I am in today. How did I do that in one word? It's through meditation I went on a long journey both internal and real around the world seeking out masters from ashrams in India Shaolin temple in China and seeking out a whole bunch of different modern and traditional teachers of Awareness mindfulness and very specific and powerful meditation techniques For the last eight years I've been coaching men live in my programs around the world in these techniques Because it's my opinion that if you want to get good with women socially You know and improve your confidence, then it's vital that you look inwards not just projecting out into the world I take guys through heavy and deep inner transformation During my live programs where I teach in these techniques that I've distilled from all these masters around the world Unfortunately, I'm only able to teach around 50 to 80 guys live per year and so many men from around the world constantly contact me Asking okay, what's the best meditation technique? I know that it's something that is going to be useful for me But I don't want to have to go and travel to the ends of the earth to find the right techniques I don't want to get conned by charlatans And I don't want to necessarily have to sit in a meditation retreat center for days on end to try and figure out what works for me So what I've done over the last year is I've distilled and boiled down all of the most powerful Effective and quite simple to learn techniques that any man can take and Utilize for say 20 to 30 minutes per day to have a vast and powerful effect on his internal state his confidence and his ability To be focused clean and clear in his interactions I call this the martial meditation method and I will be releasing this breakthrough product Which is a six-week course on the 2nd of December 2016 if you'd like to stay up-to-date with the launch as well as receive behind-the-scenes bonus material Then all you need to do is click the link below put your email in and I'll be contacting you immediately The first thing that I will send you is an exclusive powerful meditation technique Which I originally learned from my master in Shaolin Temple many years ago at the time I was learning this technique to develop powerful martial arts applications But over time I realized that it had a lot of applications for the man that was trying to develop himself socially and sexually In particular it allows you to focus your attention and your energy in a way That is clean and clear rather than getting lost up in your head or giving in to anxieties and fears It means that you can get focused clear in your body and transmit the message that you want to to the women Another very powerful benefit is that allows you to gain control over your sexual sexual arousal state It's a very common problem that men don't last as long as they would like to or as long as their partners would like them To in bed this happens because you don't have control over your physiology Your body gets too excited and nervous and therefore you lose it With this technique you will literally be able to last for as long as you would like to So if you'd like to receive this technique as well as a whole bunch of bonus material That's going to be coming out in the next month put your email in and I'll be contacting you very soon"}
