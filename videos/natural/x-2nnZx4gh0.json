And I know for myself, growing up with a single mother and feeling very protective towards women and looking at the male-female dynamic as adversarial and in conflict, that I built up these beliefs over time that it wasn't respectful to try and have sex with women. It wasn't the right thing to do to escalate, to compliment a woman, to objectify her in a good way or any of that sort of stuff. And I know for myself, when I worked on these issues and looked at, well, why do I believe this and is this actually true? And that stuff started dissolving and changing over time. It meant that I then became a man who was, in women's eyes, who was the type of guy that she could go and feel safe with to express her sexuality. And so one of the major benefits of developing money in a game and working through any of these beliefs and issues was that women recognized that that's a guy I can have sex with on a casual basis or one night or long-term or whatever. And he's not going to become super reactive, needy, jealous. I can express my sexuality with him. We can do kinky, wild stuff and whatever because he can hold space for that. So I think that's another big area for guys is that most men have been brought up with some level \u2013 you often refer to this as guilt, shame and fear around their sexuality, particularly in societies where the sexual dynamic is blurred and we're told that we can't do what men used to do because that's disrespectful. So where do you see this in terms of your work, in terms of helping guys to look at sexuality differently? Yeah. Very good question. So just to kind of reiterate some of the things that you're saying, I think one of the problems that we see in our society is that there's not really very much of a choice in the range of different archetypes that men can take on unless they understand what an archetype is and how they can develop that inside themselves. So basically what I'm saying, an archetype is almost like a stereotypical kind of personality program or construct that we pick up in our lives as we're growing up. And in our culture, in our society in the West here, it's often times we get taught that to be a nice guy is to do a lot of nice things and come from the heart and all these things, but the penis isn't really part of the equation. Sexuality isn't really part of the equation. So a lot of guys especially go to these sort of Hollywood nice guy movies that it's like the lovable loser that gets the girl because he just does all the right nice guy things and it seems to just fall into place and then there's this happy ever after ending that has to happen. And she realizes that the jock is an idiot and she wants to be with a nice guy. That's right. But in reality, women obviously find that compassionate connected conscious part of a man incredibly attractive, but if he doesn't have the ability to connect with his sexuality and connect with his ability to lead and to guide the woman sexually, then that's a huge hole in the interaction. And I think a lot of women are disappointed in a man that can't do that. So often times then they will seek their fulfillment or their desires elsewhere. And the other end of the spectrum is that there's this kind of bad boy image as well which is like it seems to romanticize the idea that you just take what you want and you just have sex with lots of women and you just do whatever you want and be much more in command. And that often is detached from the compassionate heart side of things as well. So that's too much base. That's too much penis basically and not enough heart or head. So really with the work that I do, I like to try and give guys a bigger perspective and a bigger range of archetypal choices so that they can be a guy that has a heart and he's intelligent in mind and he has a penis and he can use it as well. So he's working on all levels. So you can integrate that bad boy and that nice guy to become something else. What I like to call a romantic adventurer slash spiritual warrior. So it's like integrating the spiritual warrior side is about having the courage to face your fears, go through the work that you need to do to be an independent, empowered man. And the romantic adventurer is having the strength and skills to go out there into the world and approach, attract, and have great interactions with the women that you desire. Not necessarily from a place of either wanting to get all the time to feel okay about yourself but really just from a place of fulfillment and sharing and wanting to explore the field of human experience with the feminine and have great interactions together. And that's a distinction that I think is really good to get here is that one of the fundamental things that often gets missed is a lot of guys doing the inner game as well to try and get something, to try and get sex, try and get a relationship, try and get a girlfriend to feel okay about themselves. And at the end of the day, it's coming from a place of lack and that lack is coming from a place of fear. And the fear shines through in subtle ways. And even though guys can be quite successful doing that to some degree, until he tends to that really subtle sense of fear and really takes care of himself as an independent, powerful man, he's always going to be at the whims of his fear and he's always going to be looking for something outside of himself and never be fulfilled. And that's probably one of the most tragic and terrible things that we can experience as human beings, especially as men. So I think freeing yourself from that trap is epic, really, really big. So in terms of affecting these kinds of changes, because this is deep level stuff and this is stuff that I guess Western psychology has been looking at for a hundred years and Eastern spirituality for many, many more. So how is it that you go about helping guys to move through these blockages and patterns and to reinstall better ones? Yeah, really good question. So it depends on what a guy needs and where a guy's at. So basically what I'll do when I'm working with people is work out where they're at, where they want to get to, and what are the most appropriate tools and techniques and ideas that can help them get there. Because different guys are at different stages of evolution and they want different things. Ultimately, I like to try and guide guys towards their highest self-actualized possibilities and potentials and resources. So I have a whole range of different things that I can use within that. Say, for example, someone might have some emotional stuff. So they would like to move forward in their everyday life, but they have emotional blockages about that, or they have something strong emotionally showing up. It's holding them back from doing the thing they would like to do. And in that case, then, part of my job is almost to be like a bit of a hunter and go in and stalk, what's that pattern, where's it coming from, and trace it back to some past experiences. And then using techniques like, say, for example, might be EFT or it might be something else, Easter or trance work or timeline work or something along those lines, we can go back into the past and clear up what are the false distinctions and identifications that have happened. What are the bad stories, basically, that they're running in an unconscious level that are creating this stuff in their life presently? So I guess, for example, a guy has bad experiences with women in his childhood. So the cool chick is nasty to him or whatever. Sure. And he learns at an early age that if you put yourself out there, girls will humiliate you. Sure. And then that's the thing that's stopping him from, every time he sees that beautiful woman, he wants to speak to her, just that primal childish fear comes up. So how would you, in that case, you're looking at, okay, going back and investigating the way that he placed meaning upon those situations? Well, there's a number of ways that I might track onto that. So one level is to just look at, well, how is it presenting in his life? So if he's got an emotional thing going on at the moment, then how is that affecting his life presently? And then it's also looking at, well, what's underneath that? Because most of, more often than not, and people don't often recognize this, is that they have things showing up in their lives and they think the things that are showing up in their lives are the problem. When the reality is the things showing up in their lives are really just like, they're like the warning light on the dash in your motorcar. It's not the warning light that's the problem. It's what's going on underneath the bonnet. So you've got to track on a deeper level going back to, well, what are some of the, you know, what are the core strategies that are going on here? What sorts of thoughts and emotions are creating this pattern? And then where do they come from? Or how can you create a new way of looking at those thoughts and feelings or let go of those thoughts and feelings so that there's not going to be that pattern anymore? And like you said, like, you know, that might be a common one, for example, like, you know, a man might have some negative experiences with women as he's growing up. And a lot of that stuff doesn't even have to be direct. You know what I mean? It doesn't even have to be that, you know, he asked a girl out and she slapped him in the face, for example. A lot of that stuff just comes directly from assumption or almost downloading information from the world around you. So a child, for example, might pick up bad ideas about relationships and women or even more masculinity in men and sexuality, for example, from his parents, you know, or from TV and from all these things. Because as children, we're just like these sponges that take all this stuff in. And until we develop the capacity and the level of consciousness where we can go back and look at some of these programs and change them, they'll just keep running in our lives. And basically, that's one of the most important things within a game is that if you don't take the time to go and upgrade your operating system, you're basically going to be just continually creating from that same level of operating system. So it's like having Windows 95 forever, basically. And even though you're trying to run, like, modern software in it, it just gets glitchy and things crash and things don't work and you can't do the things you would like to do. Which is where you see the experience of guys who've, you know, learnt the lines and the tools and going out and go, okay, I've got all this stuff. And they're just not quite working. The girl's just like thinking there's something weird going on here. And the guy's feeling incongruent, feeling that murky feeling of like, no, this isn't really me, which we see tends to lead guys to burn out. Guys will get into seduction, they'll learn a bunch of tricks, whether it's natural or unnatural or whatever, it doesn't matter. They're just learning external expressions. And after a while, they just lose the initial momentum. Doesn't seem to be quite working. Girls, you know, feel like there's just something not right. And then you see these guys kind of leaving. So, yeah, and that's something we've seen as we've integrated more and more internal change work into our workshops, that that's the stuff that will give the guy the bedrock to continue through the highs and lows of going out there and meeting girls. Yeah, big time. And I think a really big thing about that as well is like, going out in the field and doing training is really important. I mean, that has to happen. It has to be a real world integration and action happening. I mean, you can... Because you can have that on the flip side where people would just stay at home doing any game work. Totally. Yeah, exactly. So, you want to find a balance between those two worlds for sure. And oftentimes, I think the healthiest balance is going out, doing some things, having some experiences, getting some references, finding where you're at, and then doing some self-introspection and some clearing and some journaling and some goal setting and then going back out and then just referencing. And what you'll find happens then is there's, you know, it might be a little bit of a roller coaster, but it's an upward curve of growth. And another thing is to recognize that part of this journey of transformation is to understand vulnerability and courage in the face of transition. So, because what we find as well, you know, is, you know, in our work is that a lot of guys, they come into this with a desire to get to a higher level of being, but then they don't want to spend the time or the energy to use the consciousness to really transform what's going on. Or they're facing a bunch of fears that they don't know how to clear, so they just keep falling back into the fear. And it takes, you know, it takes a commitment and a decision to really make these changes in your life. So, that's one thing that, you know, that's really important with this work is when you're wanting to transform your life on any level, whether it be dating or relating or sexuality or whatever, you make a really solid commitment as to why you want to do that and you keep showing up until those transformations happen. Because, you know, we don't see it very often, but sometimes we have guys come in to do trainings, but because they're not committed on their end, we can't do much for them if they don't want to show up and do their own work. So, and that's sad too because, you know, our pride and joy is to really give guys the good tools and to support them as much as possible to get to where they want to go. So, yeah, it's really important that people pull their own weight on that end as well. So, it's not, it's very different to, I don't know, going to a liner couch and talk about your issues or something. You're not going to be fixed when you come to a life coach or a game coach. Ideally, you're going there to learn the tools to be able to update yourself. Sure. Well, I think miracles can happen, but at the same time, we want to be aware that the work is really coming from a place of internal change in the individual. So, the power of a coach is that a coach has a larger world view and a bigger reference experience and a whole toolbox of tools that can give the client an experience of moving outside of their comfort zone, their limitations, their paradigm, if you will, much more faster and to almost get them quantum leaps and shift. But at the same time, the people who are showing up to be the clients are the ones that still need to make the shift. Yeah. Yeah. That's the same with seduction, isn't it? Like, many guys are looking kind of for a magic pill, a rejection-free, 100% strike rate method, which they can basically hide behind. And as they see with us when we go and feel, that doesn't exist. And even if it did, I'm not interested in teaching it because it's by going through that process of, okay, you've learned the tools, you have a mentor, you have someone supporting you, but then stepping out into the abyss, the unknown, trying it out. And then in that moment where you succeed or fail or whatever it is, being able to be okay with that and being able to go, all right, well, here I am and that girl just spilled a drink on me and everyone laughed at me and I'm still okay with myself. And that's, you can't have that feeling by learning some trick. Totally. That comes through developing internal resources and resilience and, you know, more of a balanced and kind of relaxed view of life and all that kind of stuff. Totally. Well, I think, you know, that's about moving from a position of being a dependent individual. So oftentimes, you know, a lot of guys will come looking for something outside themselves to be okay. You know, if I just learn this seduction technique, I'll be fine. Or if I just have the world's best dating coach, then I'll transform. Or, you know, if I just learn the special winning game technique that will transform everything, I'll be fine. And what that does is it's still a state of dependence on something outside themselves. They're not realizing their own internal strength. And it's not easy to instantly get that change. But the aim, in my opinion, is to move to a state of independence where... You do have access to your resources and your confidence to be able to move through the journey of life. Because the truth is, unfortunately, as much as we would like to be wrapped up in cotton wool and have everything safe all the time, life is a rollercoaster of all kinds of experiences. And the more that we show up with the capacity to deal with that, the more exciting and the more fun life can be as well. And I think so much pain happens in people's lives because they're seeking to have comfort and safety constantly, and they're not really giving themselves permission to experience the full range of what life is. So a lot of energy and time gets wasted on trying to resist against that which is true, basically. And you can't win that game. It's like trying to jump in a river and swim upstream constantly. As much as you might be able to do it for a little while, eventually, you're going to go downstream. And I guess even if people are successful in the sense that they create safe bubbles, then they essentially create prisons. That's very true. And it comes back to what I was saying before, is that you can create... People might create a fortress to protect themselves at a certain stage, and that might be great because it's comfortable and safe. But then in the later stages, they realize their fortress has become a prison. And then they need to move beyond that and create a different space for themselves. Definitely. Awesome. So in terms of if people want to step out of their fortresses and prisons and take it to the next level, what are some of the specific areas that you help clients with and that you have available in terms of your coaching? Sure. So maybe if you want to talk a bit about your coaching services and what you do. Yeah, for sure. Well, I've worked with such a broad range of different things. I guess the major things that I like to focus on typically is helping guys improve their confidence and helping guys get a bigger direction and purpose in terms of an identity that I would like to fill in their lives. So oftentimes, my work is really focused on clearing up limited identities. So like I said, the old operating systems that are no longer helping and they're actually hindering. So looking at how can we move that forward. So sometimes guys aren't really clear about what the next steps are. So they need to do some work on clarifying what would they like to create the next step. Some guys are clear on what the next steps are, but they're not sure about how to make those next steps or they feel blocked to make those next steps. And that's the case. We can clear up some of that stuff as well. And some guys have things going pretty well and they know where they're going and they're moving towards it, but they have something that's still holding on from the path they'd like to clear as well. So we can look at clearing that stuff. So basically, in a way, my tools are pretty big because I can work with such a broad range of things. Because we're working with neurological change and emotional work, it really opens the floor to a lot of different things. We can, because, you know, studying and operating and things like that, you can break things down into structure and look at what's going on. So it's not like I just focus on anxiety, for example. I can work on a whole range of different things. And it sort of depends on what people are prepared to work on and where they want to go. And then we can sort of work from there and develop that. Okay, in terms of what workshops it is that you offer, do a bit of a plug about your services? Yeah, sure. I know for myself, I've done countless hours of work with Shad. I know that a significant part of my confidence and my ability to be much more flexible, and as you know, when we first met, I was pretty rigid in terms of, I was a very hardcore martial artist and spiritual seeker, just good stuff, but at the same time, I wasn't that flexible with just chilling out and being okay with what was going on around me. And lots of work that we did over the years had profound effects and, you know, still continues to. So, yeah, I mean, there's my testimony on Shad being a kick-ass coach. So, yeah, what services have you got? And if you guys are interested in, you know, finding out and hopefully doing some coaching. Yeah, nice. Okay, so, well, I do a range of different things. I do one-on-one coaching. So that's where if someone wants to get some real one-on-one focused work, I do... And that's available worldwide through Skype? Yeah, I can do that through Skype worldwide. I have a website, innergamecoaching.com, so you can check that out. And also, I do live training. So if you're in a local area in Melbourne, I'm happy to do, you know, one-on-one coaching or we can do live Skype sessions, that's fine. The other thing is I do a training called The Way of the Black Dragon. So The Way of the Black Dragon is a comprehensive men's development training. It's about 40 hours of training. At the moment, it's held in Melbourne, but we're moving to do more national stuff in Australia and perhaps internationally if there's enough people interested in different locations and we can make it work. But that's a really powerful training at looking at some of those things we were talking about earlier about archetypes, how to develop a much faster range of archetypes. So you can have basically like a palette of masculinity to work with in lots of different areas of your life. So you can learn to be strong and directed and powerful like a warrior. So you can be, you know, flexible and compassionate and connected like a lover. So you can be, you know, grounded and effective and a leader like a king. And so you can be transformational and magical like a magician. So and there's a lot of different layers to that that we look at. We do some embodiment work and sexuality, you know, cultivation work. We do, you know, a whole range looking at relationships and life direction and purpose and the whole cool thing there. So you can check out wayoftheblackdragon.com if you're interested in men's development stuff. And the other thing that I do is Masterclass Revolution. So Masterclass Revolution is something we developed together and yeah, really powerful overall men's lifestyle and self-development package that focuses predominantly on dating but at the same time has a hell of a lot of transformational content within it in terms of changing people's lives and we get, you know, really good results with that. And that's a seven-week course that we hold in Melbourne as well. So yeah, that's coming up soon. If you're interested in that, let us know and we can let you know. Check out masterclassrevolution.com. Yeah, masterclassrevolution.com. You got it. Awesome. All right, so I absolutely encourage everyone out there to check out more of Shay's stuff. I'm going to try and feature him much more in the future. Now we've kind of got our, you know, YouTube stuff sort and our tech, you know, savviness happening. And I'll be catching up with you, I think in South America or in Europe or back in Australia, God knows where. Yeah, the adventures continue. So thanks Steve for appearing on the show. Thank you, man. Thank you. It's a pleasure. And thank you, gentlemen. It's been a pleasure. Peace out."}
