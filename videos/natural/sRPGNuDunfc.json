You look pretty cool. I don't think we're actually each other's type. I don't speak English. Yeah, I know, but I just thought I'd experiment with something. I'm James. Maria. Maria. Where are you going now? I don't speak English. Can we go on a date where we just look at each other and then touch, but we don't speak? Can I get your phone number? Alright, name? Maria. Maria. I just met a girl named Maria. And suddenly that name will never be the same to me. Sing it loud and there's music playing. Sing it softly and it sounds like praying. Maria. I'll never stop saying Maria. Maria. So I've discovered the best thing you can do to improve your seduction skills is go to the middle of the African savannah for 10 days where you don't see a woman. And then get unleashed onto the streets of Prague. That's what you should do, gentlemen. I am hungry. Excuse me, madam. Excuse me. How are you? Excuse me. Sorry I didn't mean to make you crash. Be careful because there's a bus behind you. Yeah, I don't usually run after people on bicycles, but you look so lovely that I just wanted to come and say hi. Hi. What's your name? I'm James. I'm Pamela. Nice to meet you. Pamela? Pabla. Pabla. Okay, that's nice. Nice to meet you. You look like you should be in an ad for, I don't know, lovely girls on bicycles. Where are you going right now? I'm going home right now. Excellent. And can you tell me a little about you? Like, what's your story? My story? In a very short, very short thing. Like, what are you doing? I don't know. Well, I'll give you my story. I'm probably a pretty boring person. Oh, no, you shouldn't say that. I think what makes someone boring is if they're not interested in things. Like, someone who just doesn't care about finding out, that's what I find boring. I think as long as you have some curiosity in life. Do you have some? Curiosity? Actually, I study religious studies in Judaism, so Hebrew. Oh, wow. Yeah, it's pretty interesting for someone. Yeah, right. So, you're, like, for an intellectual reason or because you have a Jewish background? No, no, no, I just like to study. So, like, at first I studied Christianity, so I'm a little bit of a satirist, and then I started studying Judaism. Yeah, right. It's a pretty, like, niche area of study, right? Yeah. Yeah. Right. So, but, like, there must have been something that drew you to the Judaic studies as opposed to, I don't know, Buddhism or some other thing? Yeah, I'm not really interested, I just like it. I just like all kinds of philosophy things. And the historical progression, that kind of stuff? Yes. Especially Judaism, because it's the beginning. It's old. Yes. It was the start, right? Yeah. Yeah. Have you ever read the book, God is Not Great? Hmm? By Christopher Hitchens? No. It's quite interesting. He's, like, a hardcore atheist, but he's very, very well studied on, like, the history of religion. He's kind of a very interesting angle on, like, the history. The name is interesting because I read too much. Yeah, yeah. So, the name I know, but I don't remember. He's, like, an arrogant British man who drinks a lot and just, like, shreds religion very intelligently. But, yeah, quite an interesting perspective, like, from, obviously, from someone who doesn't believe but has studied carefully. So, it's cool. Anyway, if you're bored sometime and you don't have a thousand things to read, check it out. So, do you have a boyfriend? I do. Ah, well, that's all right. I'm sorry. No, no, don't be sorry. It's, like, you know. But it was really nice. Yes, you too. Well, you take it easy. Yes. Hope to see you riding by sometime. You're living in Prague? I live in Budapest, but I come here quite a lot. Oh, cool. So, into Prague and into Budapest. Budapest is beautiful. Yeah. It's, like, bigger Prague. Yeah, this is, like, this is prettier. Like, Budapest is the dirty brother of Prague. So, yeah. All right. Well, if I see you riding by again in a year, I'll come talk to you. Okay. Bye-bye. All right. See you. Nice to meet you. Excuse me. Hi. Hi. You look awesome. Thanks. I'm not selling anything. I just want to meet you, if that's cool. Well, yes. All right. I'm James. Tamara, nice to meet you. Tamara, you're a ex-Yugoslavian, aren't you? Yes. How did you know? Handshake. Really? Eye contact. No nonsense. I know what Balkan girls do. Where are you from? Australia. Oh, really? Yeah. Far from home. Yes, I'm far from home. What are you doing here? I live in Budapest. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. So, are you a, let me see, I'm trying to work out which one you are. I don't know. Are you a Serbian? Yeah. Yes? Unbelievable. Am I right? How did you know? I can, like, Serbians have a power about them. They have a very specific way of being. How many Serbians do you know? Lots. I go to Belgrade a lot. I have an office in Belgrade. Really? What do you do? I'm a life coach. Serbian. I know. I know. I am a life coach. Life coach? Yeah. Hmm. Interesting. So, I help people with their lives. Yeah. And you? What are you doing? I'm an architect. Oh, yeah? Nice. Totally opposite to your stuff. I also help people. You're creative. Creative, yeah. No, it's real stuff. Real things that exist. Yes. Not things in your mind. Yeah. Well, things in your mind become... Making people believe in something. Yes, but then everything that was built, architecture, was in someone's mind first, right? True. What are you doing here? I'm here for holidays. Yeah. By yourself? No, with my mom. It's a surprise trip for my mom. Oh, lovely. Excellent. And you? What are you doing? I'm running a workshop, so I start working tomorrow. For, like, seven days I'll be teaching a workshop and chilling out. It's, like, one of my favorite cities. Really? Mine too. Barcelona and... Yeah, yeah. They're good places. Tamara, right? Tamara. And you? James. James. Yeah, yeah. And so, are we going to hang out sometime or what? Well, I'm here for, like, four days. Yeah. And I have some friends here also, so I have to meet them. So, maybe when you're in Belgrade... Yeah. You can do that. Yeah, I can get your number. WhatsApp or something. Sure. Why not? Yeah. James from Australia. Yes. You can write your number there. I'll text you. Do you know which Tamara? I don't know if I have any other Tamaras. Maybe write something else. Caribbean. Yeah. Beautiful. Alright. Lovely to meet you. Take care. I'll see you later. Strong handshake. Bye."}
