There's a limited amount of work that you can do separate to, if you're talking about women and socializing, that you can do separate to. Yes, you can meditate, you can improve yourself, you can go on a journey, and you can do that for 10 years and become a way better version of yourself, and then start meeting girls, and you will have wasted 10 years of your life, which you can't get back. So it's like, you get ready by doing this. How did I learn how to get good at pick up? It was by going up and going, and then her going, and then me like, that wasn't right, and then making it a bit better next time. Thank you very much. You're welcome. I brought a girl home, a Swedish girl, I live in Sweden, but for this particular girl, I had this feeling that I used her a little bit, and it happens a lot in my success. Maybe because I'm not that genuinely attracted to her, or I don't know, or it's just an idea I have. So, well, what's the question? Yeah, so how do you deal with it? Because I do that for growth, to get to the emotion, so yeah, I still want to do that, but maybe sometimes I'm not that into the girl, I still do it. How to do it well? Okay, well look, this is part of the reality of being a guy dating, is that you'll have one night stands sometimes, and you don't want to see the person again. And it is also part of the reality that when you're first starting out, you will sleep with women that you don't find to be your perfect tens, because you need to get some experience. So, what you're doing is not bad, it's that, like people just do this to each other all the time. Men or women sleep with partners, and then decide they don't want to see them again. I've had women decide they never want to see me again, and after they fuck me, it's just like part of the thing. People do use each other in the sense that like, when you're two random strangers and you're hooking up, you are using each other in various ways. I mean, you're seeking validation or pleasure or growth or whatever it is, and she has her own agendas. Sometimes, you don't know what her situation is, she might just see you as a random dick that she wants to use. And if you're going to get into fast escalating sexual relationships, one night stands or whatever, that's part of it. It just happens. So, I don't think there's any... The shit thing to do is to take a girl on six dates and start trying to plan your future together, and then fuck her three times, and then vanish. That's fucked, because that's you promising or suggesting something else is going to happen. If I meet a girl and we're drunk, we bang, and then I wake up the next morning, I'm like, hmm, nah, I'm not going to do that again. I politely take her and get her in a taxi and say, that was awesome, and I hope you have a great time. She's like, oh, we see each other again? I will... It's pretty rare for a girl to ask if she'll see you again. It's usually, they'll just be like, leave the door open. Personally, I like to shut the door on... Yeah, sometimes I sleep with a girl and it's just like, I don't text again or whatever it happens. But usually, I will try to just be clear about it and say, hey, it was really fun last night. In my life right now, and then make some pleasant excuse. Rather than just like, you're not hot enough, I don't want to tell her that. But it's just like, right now, with the madness... I sometimes say that I've got too many things going on in my sexual life, which I do. So then I can just say, look, it's all a bit complicated, so I won't be able to see you again. Or something like that. Just to give the person some form of closure. Yeah, you tell her. Yeah, but sometimes you don't. Sometimes it's just like, okay, you sleep with someone, and then it's a bit messy, and you're like, nah, we shouldn't have probably done that. And that is part of it. That is part of it. It's like, I don't think you're causing any major damage. As long as you're not promising any bullshit, and you're treating the girl well from beginning to end. It's just part of being a single people. It's just part of being a single people."}
