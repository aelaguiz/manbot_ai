License. You have a license for the bicycle? Hi, excuse me. How are you? You look amazing in that dress. So I just wanted to say hi. What's your name? Emilia. Emilia. How do you do? I'm James. Thank you. Yes, and you are? Anais. Anais. You are French people. French. Yes. Where are you from? Here in the accent. I'm an Australian. Ah, okay. Yeah. What do you think of... There is a lot of Australians here. Yeah, there is. Yeah. On the beach we met... already met some Australians. It's kind of similar to Australia, so we feel comfortable here because Spain is lazy and relaxed and good weather and people are nice, so that's quite like Australians. Yeah. And what do you guys do? Are you dressed up just for fun? No, we just visit the town. You're just here wandering around looking for fun. Yeah, exactly. Excellent. And are you recently here? It's been five days. Do you have a hangover yet or are you still okay? Five days of partying or relaxing? No, no, no. Today we are going to stay at home because we were out five... You got smashed five nights in a row. Yes. I can tell both of you are a little bit like... Thank you. No, it's like in a dreamy kind of sleepy way. And how long are you here for? We leave Thursday. No, Tuesday. Tuesday. All right. Well, that's enough time for us to grab a coffee sometime. Why not? Why not? All right. Excellent. Do you have a WhatsApp or something? Yes. Okay, I'll get it. Sorry, your name again? Emilia. Emilia. Like this? Yes, exactly. Okay, you can put your WhatsApp down. You remember? Yes. Cool. Where in France are you from? Paris. But you seem quite friendly people. What? You seem quite friendly. Ah, thank you. You know, the Parisians sometimes can be quite harsh. It's a cliche. Is it based in reality or not? It depends. Sometimes, yes. You're like, no, never. Everyone, not based in any reality? Sometimes. But not for you guys. You break the cliche. Okay, cool. Well, lovely to meet you. Lovely to meet you. Bye. Have fun at the beach. See you soon. Bye. Hi. How are you doing? What? What is that you look sexy and I want to introduce myself. Ah, sorry. Excuse me, ladies. I just need to see your license. License. You have a license for the bicycle? You want to ride it? No, no, no. You have the license. You need a special license to ride this? No, no, no. You don't have that? Only the document and money. Aha. Right. No, I'm actually joking. There's nothing. So, I just thought you're really sexy. You. And so, I wanted to say hi. Hi. What's your name? Silvia. Silvia. Hey, I'm James. What's up? Hey, what's your name? Denise. Denise. She's like, let's get out of here. Well, you can. You'll be faster than me, right? When you're in your bicycle. Yeah, there's no, you're in no danger because you can go much faster than I can in this machine. She's like, oh yeah, I agree with that. And where are you guys from? Italy. Aha. Nice. You? I'm an Australian. Yeah. Not Austria. Australia. Australia. Cool. And you're having fun? Yes. And how long are you here for? How long? Yeah. One week. That's enough time for some good trouble. You only here? I live here at the moment. And you come back to Australia? Not really. Like, I go there in the winter time just to see family and friends, but I live in Europe now. Yeah, I like it here. It's a cool lifestyle. Okay. Bye-bye. Okay, bye. Do you want to go on a date sometime? No, thanks. Why not? You have a boyfriend? Yes. No, she doesn't. She's like, yes. You don't have to have a boyfriend to say no. All right. See you. Have fun. Hi. How are you? Hi. I'm James. Hi, I'm Eunica. Eunica. You just look cute, so... I'm Marie. You're not. You're walking, like, very slowly. See ya. Excuse me. Hi. Hi. Hi. I just saw you. You looked wonderful and lovely, so I'm here to meet you. Thank you. Yeah, what's your name? Anna. Anna. Are you Australian? No. Are you Australian? Yeah, because you look like a bit of a... like an Australian. Now you sound German now. Yeah, I'm German, but I learned English in America. That's part of it. It's more German now. I got it. So what are you doing? I'm going to meet with my friend over there. Are you doing lying down or are you doing acro yoga or taking LSD or what? Drinking and eating. That's a good mix. What are you doing? You mean in general? Yes. Teaching some workshops and enjoying the summer. How long are you here? About a month. Like, you still have a month or you've been here a month or in total? It's very German questions. A month total. I've been here two weeks or like 15 days. Now I have another, I don't know, two weeks or something. But, I mean, I come here quite a lot because I live in Budapest most of the time. I'm more or less a European now. And what are you doing? You kind of look like you live here. Yes. Because of my bike probably. You look all chilled and tanned and like you belong here. I live here but I'm leaving in one week. Back to Germany? No. Newcastle in England. Newcastle up on Tyne. There's a Newcastle in Australia as well. There is. It's a really bad town. Same in England. It's like a coal mining town. I think in both places. Why are you going to the coal mining towns? To study, to get a master's degree. Well, you won't have too many distractions from your studies then, will you? No, I won't. It's your dislike. I know. No, just people with smashed teeth. I heard they filmed it there. They filmed Jersey Shore in Newcastle. That's what they told me. Really? It doesn't sound right. I thought Jersey Shore was in New Jersey. Maybe they have a British version of it for the chat. Yeah, that's what I mean. The British version. All right. Have a nice day. Yes, I will. Do you want to get a coffee or something someday? Because I live in one week. I'm not interested in brief romances. All right, good. Well, I'm glad I could fly to you. Enjoy your eating and drinking and relaxing. You too. Bye. Hi there. How are you? I've caught you at weird peach time. Is that a beetroot or a peach? I don't know. You don't know anymore. I just thought you were cute, so I'm coming to chat you up. How do you feel about that? You want to stop and have a chat? I'm on my way home. I'm sorry. I'm in a hurry. You're not actually. You're walking very slowly, but you're not interested, so see you later. Excuse me, ladies. Hi. Hi. I'm not selling anything. I'm not a promoter or anything. You just look sexy. I want to take you on a date. How do you feel about that? I would like to take you on a date sometime. Oh, no. Sorry. All right. Okay. See you. Yes. And you are pretty. Thank you very much. Yes. What's your name? I'm James. Nuria. Is it? Nuria. Nuria? Nuria. It's from here. Nuria. With an N? Yes, with an N. I'm James with a J. Where are you from? Australia. Wow. Cool. Wow. Do you know Australians? Yes. Well, no. Am I your first Australian? Yes, you look Australian. Okay. You look very Spanish. I want to go to Australia. I think you'll like it. It's pretty relaxed, and people are nice. Yes, and the beaches. Yes, the beaches are even better than here. Yes, I know. And the people are lazy, a little bit like Spanish, you know. I'm not lazy. No? But today I am done. Why? What have you been doing? You had a crazy week? I've been working. Yes. You have a friend. Yes. What? All weekend? Yes. I work here in a cafe. And today I've been working 10 hours a night. 10 hours. Holy shit. That's why you're sitting down now to relax and to get your feet. Yeah, wow. Were people nice to you? Is it like a nice environment to work? Yes, yes, yes. I like it. Yeah. You're not a stressful boss or anything like that? No. Well, in the morning sometimes because there's a lot of people who order sandwiches and I have to do them. But... Yeah. Cool. And what are you doing? Are you studying as well or this is like... Yeah, I'm studying. I am studying advertising and public relations. But I want to specialize on design. And I want to do my master in Australia. Oh, really? Is that because there's a course there or you just like the city? No, because I've always wanted to go to Australia and one friend of mine who is bigger than... He's older than me. Bigger than you. He's bigger. Here we say, mas grande. Right, okay. It makes sense. Yes, he did his master there and he loved it. Yeah. I want to go there. All right, cool. If you need a reference, I'll just write it for you and say you're a respectable young lady. And what are you doing here in Barcelona? At the moment I'm here for a couple of months and I'm teaching some workshops. So I teach like meditation and life coaching. Wow. Yeah, so... Where? Different places like in a studio, in the park, private classes too. So I usually come here every summer for a month or two. I love it here. You like Barcelona? It's one of the top five best cities in the world in my opinion. Oh. So yeah. Yeah, it's just... It has an amazing vibe. I think that's the main thing. The people here are really passionate and... Yeah. But also quite down to earth, you know, like not fake people, which I like. No, no. Yeah, I like Barcelona too. Yeah. Are you originally from Barcelona? Yes, but I don't live here. I live 20 minutes from Barcelona, in front of the beach. Oh, nice. Yeah, yeah. It's like more relaxing than the city. So it's a little surf town or something, like beach town. Yes, it's very small. It's called Cabamar. You know Castelldefels? No, I haven't been there. Well, it's like in the coast. Right. Yeah. Cool. So you just come in here to work in the days and then you go back home in the evenings? Yes, every day. That's a big change in like pace, right? Yes. But I like it because when I arrive home, I disconnect. Yeah. That's pretty ideal, being able to have a cool city and then be able to retreat into nature. And it's near. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, nice. Cool. Alright, well, what else? Anything else you want to tell me? I don't know. I am... You are wiped out now, right? Yes. Okay. Well, I'm going to keep walking down the beach, but I know we don't know each other. You seem really lovely. Would you like to get a juice someday when you're not so tired? Perfect. Alright, I'll get your number. Nuria, right? Yes, Nuria. Okay. Is it mine? Yeah. Sorry, I can't stand up. No, no, I understand. You're finished for the day. Is it like this? Nuria, very good. Okay, just WhatsApp or something here? Yes. Are you very short? No. Well, a bit. That's a nice size. It's like good hugging size. Compared to you, I am short, yeah. Okay, well, I didn't know because you could be anything. Yeah, right. Spanish people. Alright, that's right? Uh-huh. No. No? Then the last number? Okay. That? That's okay. Okay, cool. Perfect. Alright, I'll send you a message later. And then in the week, so you work in the daytime? Yeah, I work sometimes. Not every day, but like five days a week. Okay. Alright, well, I'll text you. Maybe we can meet in the next couple of days. Okay. Alright, well, you have a lovely relaxing evening. I want to go to a workshop. Okay, yeah. We can have a private one. Perfect. Alright, see you. Bye. Well, I hope you enjoyed that flashback to my lazy Barcelona summer. And one of the things that I hope you take away from this video is that it doesn't need to be complicated or flashy when you're going up and meeting girls on the street. All of these interactions are pretty simple, and I get some good results, and also I get some rejections, and they're also not a big deal. So if you'd like to learn how to simplify your game down to the core fundamentals that really work, as well as having the right mindsets and the right methodology to deal with the inevitable rejections that you're going to get whilst going out there and meeting girls, then I highly recommend you check out my upcoming product, which is called the Dating Accelerator. I've designed this specifically for guys who are still in the beginner phases of dating. their journey, who are dabbling, learning different techniques and doing lots of research so that you guys can go out there and take step-by-step action to actually get real-world results. So if you'd like to find out more about this program, all you need to do is put your email in the VIP list. So you just click the link in the description, it'll take you to a page, put your email in and you'll receive VIP updates as well as all the information about the launch which is happening very soon. James Marshall back in cold Budapest, see you later."}
