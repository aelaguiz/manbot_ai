James Marshall here reporting live from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Now today, nothing raunchy, nothing risque, no spanking, no hot chicks, no high production. It's just me with my camera. Don't even have anyone filming. And today, I just wanted to have a chat to you guys about what's been happening for the natural lifestyles and what's going to be happening in the future. So if you're an old school TNL fan, you will have noticed that around two months ago, our content online shifted from day game, lifestyle design, in a game, and some sex to 100% about sex. Now, obviously, this was in order to promote the master lover method, which has now closed for enrollments. And we have 350 guys thoroughly enjoying the course. And that's what I'm focusing in on at the moment is coaching those guys. Now I know for some of the old school viewers, they like checked in and they were like, whoa, what the hell happened to James? What's going on here? And I know that there's a lot of new viewers, quite a lot of new viewers as a result of all our raunchy content. So if you guys, you may be confused about what's going to happen now. So I just want to let you know that firstly, we're having a little bit of a break because I'm not actually a YouTuber. This company is not a YouTube production company. We are a coaching company. My job is to coach men on seduction, lifestyle design, in a game and sexuality. And my part time job is to produce lots of content for you guys, because our business model is based around that we have never made a cent on YouTube advertising. And we never will, because we're obviously not very ad friendly. And we make all of our income by selling online courses and live courses as well. And whenever we shift into a product launch, so for example, back in the day, when I was doing the Lifestyle Design Academy, all of the content is about lifestyle design for that period of time, for obvious reasons. And then it shifts back into our broad spread of topics. So the first thing you need to know is that my team is totally exhausted. I have been grinding them into the ground. My video editors, my cameraman, my copywriters, my back end people have all been working seven days a week, 10 plus hours a day to produce this incredible course, which we've produced. It's the biggest in terms of content and in terms of production. So they work their asses off. And they've all told me, James, you can fuck off for a week, in no uncertain terms, because they need a break. And fair enough. So the first thing you need to know is that there probably won't be videos for a little while. And we're going to be drip feeding out videos as we start producing different types of content. Don't worry, we're not going anywhere. We're staying here. But yeah, we're not going to be pumping out the level of production that we have been recently. As I said, we are a coaching company, not really a YouTube company, although we have a massive YouTube presence. So you can expect that pretty soon we'll be putting out our regular types of content. You know, I'll be going and filming some day game and we'll be answering seduction questions and talking about lifestyle and personal change and intergame and all the broad topics that we cover at TNL. So stay tuned for lots more interesting, juicy content of all types coming up very soon. And coming into the spring and summer seasons, myself and the coaching team will be yet again hitting the road all around the world to teach our live seduction workshops. So for guys that have been waiting for that and thinking, do you guys do that anymore? Yeah, we do. Absolutely we do. So we have workshops coming up in Barcelona. In April, we have a four day from the 6th until the 9th of April. And then we have a seven day seduction workshop coming up from the, what's them dates? 22nd to the 28th of May. Barcelona is my favorite city in the world to teach in. It's full of amazing ladies from all around the world. It's got a great party atmosphere. It's a very walkable city. So it's a very easy to find sets to approach. And I'm looking forward to getting back out in field with my students. I haven't done that since, you know, last year, since the last, end of last season. So I'm looking forward to getting away from sitting in front of a camera. Honestly, it's not, it's not my favorite thing to do. My favorite thing to do is to do what I'm really, really good at, which is coach men. So I'll be hitting a road with the boys, with Alex Leon, with Shay Matthews, with Virag and some guest coaches thrown in as well. So if you're interested in inquiring about our workshops, you can click the link in the description, get on a free call with us and we'll talk to you about all of that. So that's pretty much all I had to say today. I just wanted to let you know what's happening, why we've, you know, went from like putting out shit loads of intense videos to putting out none. This is why team needs a break. We're a small company, you know, people can only be pushed so far. And I'm going to focus on coaching the guys in the Master Lover Method course and as well have a little bit of a break myself so I can enjoy Rio. And as a side note, I'm now no longer worried about being cancelled, right? We've clearly pushed the boundaries of what's possible on YouTube. Turns out if you don't show nipples and you don't show genitals and it's all instructional and educational, which it obviously was, pretty much anything goes. So I was quite amazed by that. Glad it worked. Course was a raging success and the guys who signed up are getting incredible results. Like it's blowing my mind. And an interesting thing is that for the first time ever, really, I've got guys who are not single doing the course. So I've got all these married guys and guys with girlfriends who signed up for the Master Lover Method because it's highly applicable to them and they're reporting back instantly of having amazing upgrades in the bedroom with their ladies. So I'm very, very happy about that. I'm glad that it worked for me and for them. And now it's time to get back to the other thing that we do best, hitting the streets, picking up girls, and teaching guys how to do that. So that's all I have for you today. Much love. Stay tuned for yet another weird and wonderful direction that the Natural Lifestyles goes in and I'll see you in the next video. Peace out."}
