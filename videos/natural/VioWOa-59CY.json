This is never, ever a good idea. Doesn't matter if you're a millionaire, you shouldn't be doing that. Because what does it say? It says, I am trying to impress you with things that are external to me. So the first thing that I would say is, if you're living in a country which is reasonably economically stable, where you and the girl that you're going on a date with are roughly the same age and of roughly the same earning power, then it would be unreasonable for her to expect that you are going to pay for everything forever. And the thing is that the girls themselves have very different attitudes about this. Some women absolutely do not want a man to pay for them because they perceive, and rightly so, that the man then feels like he has some hold over her. Because she has accepted gifts, financial gifts through food and coffee and so on from him, that now she is beholden to his desires, right? And so if a guy takes a girl out and tries to buy her affection essentially by spending lots of money on a fancy dinner date and a bottle of wine that was put in a bottle decades ago or something, with that implication that he's like, okay, I'm giving you all this stuff so I kind of earned the sex tonight, how does that make her feel? Well, it makes her feel like a prostitute essentially, and not a very expensive prostitute either. Even if you spent like 150 bucks or something on a dinner, hookers cost more than that. Good hookers cost hundreds if not a thousand a night. She's like, what? I'm worth way more than that. So if the guy is really trying to impress the girl with the resources that he has and he's being a bit pushy about it and putting them in a formal situation where she doesn't really feel comfortable, a lot of girls won't like that. On the other side, certainly there are women out there who use men for free food. Absolutely. And I used to use rich women for free food too when I was broke, so I have no judgment about this. It's like, okay, if you're a hot young gold digger chick and you're dating much older guys and, okay, cool, you're swapping resources, I think that's fine to do. But for a man who's dating a woman like that, you need to be aware of the fact that certain women are involving themselves with men not just because of their emotional or physical attraction to them, but also because of the resources that that man has. Is this again necessarily a terrible thing? No. It's just that you need to be aware of that. I've certainly in my time gone out with girls, particularly in poorer countries who have, I know, partially come out with me because the experience that I can give them, even if that's just simply taking them to a simple lunch or to a movie or a show or something, it's something that she wouldn't really be able to do commonly, so it's part of the attraction and part of the appeal. I don't take that as a personal affront, I just accept that, okay, cool, women are using their resources, beauty, charm, sexiness, in order to attract men, and men are often using their resources, which may be financial or status or connections, in order to draw women in. So this is part of the seductive economy that I often talk about in terms of the way that men and women, or people in general, trade physical, financial, and non-financial currencies amongst each other to do deals essentially. So how does this relate to you? All right, so let's say you're a university student or you're a guy who's starting out in life and you're earning a basic wage or just enough to pay the bills, pay your rent, and try and just get by, and you're dating girls in a similar situation to that, then no, it would be outrageous for the girl to be expecting you to take her to fancy dinners which are going to hurt you financially, right? So if the case is like you feel expected or you are expected to take a girl to experiences that mean that you have to live on lentils for the rest of the week, or you have to go into credit card debt, or this is like a really painful decision for you to make, then absolutely no, you shouldn't be doing it, right? So in general, the easiest way to deal with this who pays for things is to keep dates cheap and cheerful, right? So many of the dates I've gone on throughout my life when I was a totally broke musician through to now when I'm a successful businessman cost almost nothing. Many of my dates, even still today, I'll meet a girl, we'll grab a juice, and yeah, I usually pay for the juice, and then we'll go for a walk, all right? We'll go and sit in a park and go for a bike ride, go and play Frisbee, go up to that castle up there. There's all sorts of things that you can do in this. Go wandering around the thrift shops or the weird bookshops or galleries that are open for free, or break into the neighbor's complex and jump in the pool. There's so many dates that you can have that don't cost anything or cost 5, 10, 20 maximum dollars, and they can be far more fulfilling and enjoyable than going out and spending hundreds of dollars or more on some expensive dinner that you don't feel comfortable being in, right? So the lesson for men is it's never a good idea to try and impress a girl with a date, all right? Even if I do something, like, who's seen that movie Hitch, which is an awful representation of a dating coach and awful advice, and I watched it years ago, but I remember Will Smith, like, to get the girl, does all this really impressive shit, like, takes her on jet ski out to an island to show her great-grandfather who turned out to be a rapist or something that didn't quite work out, and, you know, guys do this. They find out what is exactly her favorite food or they take her on some ornate adventure and they buy her bunches of roses and all of this extravagant expressions of affection or of grandiose stuff, you know? It's like, I'm trying to impress you. I'm trying to show you how much I care, I'm interested in you, and how much I'm willing to do for you. This is never, ever a good idea. Doesn't matter if you're a millionaire, you shouldn't be doing that, because what does it say? It says, I am trying to impress you with things that are external to me, right? All the bells and whistles and shiny things are the things that I'm trying to draw your attention with, and in a way, I'm trying to draw your attention away from the fact that I'm just this guy underneath all the bling, all the bucks. I'm just me, and I don't feel like that's good enough. I don't feel like that's good enough. It's kind of funny when you talk like that. I like it. Oh boy, I'm never going to get laid. So you're showing the girl, okay, I'm trying to impress you, therefore she decides, am I being impressed or not? And yeah, I mean, maybe if you do some amazingly spectacular thing, she'll be like, wow, okay, you put a lot of thought into that. That's kind of impressive, but that doesn't really arouse attraction in the same way as a guy who says, hey, let's just climb over that fence and go into that garden. She's like, what, what? Are you crazy? I'm like, fuck it. Let's just do that. That's what bad boys do. They just climb over fences and take girls on the back of their motorcycles, or in my case, the back of my push bike. I used to do that. A lot of my dates was get on the back of my shitty bicycle and we'll go for a ride somewhere. The cool stuff that takes a little bit of imagination, okay, that's more impressive actually. That's impressing her with the like, oh, this is how I am. This is the kind of personality I have. This is the kind of risks I'm willing to take. These are the kind of interesting things that I like to do. She's saying that, okay, hanging out with this guy, even if he happens to be broke right now, he's going to be fun. I've dated a lot of women and I've talked to them a lot about their experiences with other men. I'm always, I'm always interviewing women about their experiences and many women have told me about excruciating dates, which were very expensive, but not fun at all because the man was tense because the man was trying to control the situation because the man was trying to impress her with his cash and therefore he wasn't able to relax and be himself. He didn't have anything else to offer other than the external representations of his wealth and status. Okay. So it's not that having heaps of money or having being able to do extravagant things with people that you like is a bad thing. I certainly do that. Now that I have money, I do splash it around more than I used to. And this is something to take into account. I live in this area and I own first world money and I own really good money these days. So if I want to eat out or I want to go skiing or I want to do something interesting or anything other than just going to a student cafeteria, really, then it would be unreasonable, outrageous for me to expect my girl to try and afford that, right? Because what is it, what is the equivalent for me of five minutes of Skype coaching call for her could be literally weeks of wages. And so you do need to be aware of that, that if you're an older guy dating younger women or a guy who's much more economically stable than the girl that you're dating, then yeah, it's rude and weird to expect her to pay for stuff. And the thing is, a lot of girls who are in those situations will be quite proud. And I found that especially in Serbia and some of the Balkans and Eastern European countries where girls are aware that the idea is that those women, women from these countries are gold diggers, right? There's actually, there's a kind of meme that thinks that, okay, all women from this part of the world are trying to marry the first Westerner that comes by and run off to the West. This is absolutely not true. And in fact, my experience has been that girls in places like New York and Melbourne and Sydney were far more likely to be sitting there at the end of the coffee without reaching for their purse. Far more likely than the girls in the more economically disadvantaged countries who didn't want to be seen that way, right? They would be the ones that would be trying to spend their meager money and I would have to force them to say, hey, listen, how about I just grab this first one. You can, you can grab me an ice cream next time we see each other. So be aware of that. Yeah. If you're an older, more rich guy, then okay, pay for the fucking coffee. Don't be a stingy prick about it. It's not about a power play where everything needs to be divided down the middle. What it is about is showing the girl that, okay, I'm just doing this. I'm doing this out of my generosity and I'm not expecting anything in return. I am a generous person. I don't just buy lunches and coffees for girls. I do it for other people around me because I'm better off than most of the people around me and I like doing that and I don't expect anything back. I don't even expect appreciation back, right? I take that for a moment. If I buy someone a coffee and they're a cunt about it, right, and they, I don't know how you could exactly be a cunt about it, but they don't even say thanks or whatever. I'm not going to be resentful in that moment, however, I won't do it again, right? So I will be aware that, okay, I gave something and I didn't expect anything in return. What usually happens is that someone shows a basic appreciation and I see that there's a reciprocal respect here. So I'm more likely to start a relationship of some sort with this person, whereas other people who take things for granted, who are used to using people, very entitled, attractive women who are used to using men, if I notice that they don't even say thanks for something, I'll be like, okay, cool. I won't extend that offer to that person again because I know that person is taking advantage of me in a small way and I won't let them take advantage of me in a larger way. So you need to be aware of this stuff as you're starting to navigate the dating world. What's up gentlemen? So one of the biggest reasons why men end up in these traps and problems of who pays for what and trying to ingratiate themselves with women with their material goods is because of scarcity, just simply not having enough options and therefore being beholden to the one that they have.
