So what I thought I'd do today is take you guys through a walkthrough inside the product to show you what the components are, how I've structured it in terms of reaching your learning outcomes of having accountability and building on your skills week by week. So let's dive straight into the product, Martial Meditation Method 2.0 and have a look what's inside. MMM is broken into six weeks worth of modules. You will get access to these modules week by week and each of them build on the previous week's material. Rather than just dumping a whole bunch of information on you that's just going to sit rotting on your hard drive, I want this to be an interactive process where your discovery of the meditation techniques and of course the effects that it has on you works incrementally week by week. So week one is all about awareness. This is my foundational principle when it comes to seduction and basically it's my foundational principle in life. If you're someone who is not able to be consciously aware of what's happening to you internally through your emotions, your mind and your body and you're therefore unable to be particularly aware of your surroundings, this is going to have massively detrimental effects on your life. You will be stressed out. You will be stuck in your head. You will not read people's body language and cues very well. You will not be especially calibrated when it comes to interacting with women. So it's vitally important that you have a powerful and solid foundation of awareness and that's what we cover in week one. The way that I've broken up the course in order to instruct you is to first give you an introduction, explain to you how the technique works, what it's for, why you need to do it and this is the part where we use our minds. I want you to get your head around what the technique is and why it's useful so that you're not having an internal battle and arguing with yourself about whether this is useful or not. But this is a small part of this course. I want to keep all intellectual thought processes out of this as much as possible. You just need to get the concept and then you need to get into the actual practical application of the meditation. So in the second video, I then go into the lesson structure. This is where I explain step by step in real time how to do the meditation practice. To do this, I don't want you sitting there and watching me and listening. This is where it's interactive. So you as a student stand, set your posture, work with me in real time on the meditation. This is where you learn the process. You learn how the technique works, the nuances of it, any of the issues that might come up and then you're able to go ahead and apply it yourself. The final video for each of these modules is then a guided meditation session. So you can download the audio or you can watch the video at the same time as going through the meditation process with me. This means that you don't need to set yourself accountable. You can just put the video on. I will instruct you, make sure that you get through the session and I've designed this in such a way that within this amount of time, you will have a real experience of meditation. From there, over time, as you start to master the techniques yourself, you can stop listening to my voice and turn the sound down and watch along or just do it in your own time. Then you have the skill, it's yours, lock it in and now you can use it in everyday life. Also in module one, I go into a lot of depth and detail about posture and alignment. So most people think meditation is a static thing. You're sitting there or you're standing there or lying there and you're doing something internally. Yes, this is true. However, we're not separated from our body and a lot of people are very unconscious of their body, hold themselves in very ineffective and painful postures, particularly when it comes to holding tension in the shoulders, stretching the neck forward, rolling of the shoulders, tension in the lower back from rolling your hip back. So a lot of people are carrying around a lot of excess, unnecessary pain and tension and they're not using their body in the most effective and pleasant way. I've always been deeply into understanding the body movement posture through my martial arts, through movement practices, through yoga, through dance, all sorts of things. And I've gotten amazing benefits from that. Being able to be more graceful, peaceful, at ease, being able to express myself in fun and unique ways and to be able to have clear and powerful presence. Somebody who has shitty posture, it's very difficult to be charismatic and sexy when you're holding heaps of tension or you're slumped forward. So I am a bit of a Nazi when it comes to posture and I go into a lot of detail on how to set good posture, how to understand how to make micro adjustments internally. So rather than trying to look at someone who is alpha and go, okay, that guy's got this posture, how do I be like him? Which comes across as pretty contrived, as not natural. I show you how to go inside and work through the different joint areas, your knee joints, your hips, your spine, your shoulders, and how to use your internal awareness, your internal precision awareness to be able to adjust your posture so that you are most upright, relaxed and in flow. I also go into a lot of detail about seated posture. If you're signing up for this course, you want to learn how to meditate and the most common way to do that is seated. If you are unable to maintain an upright and comfortable posture while seated, then it's very difficult, if not impossible to go into inside and start to meditate properly. So I show you the best way for a guy that's not a Yogi, right? I'm not a guy who can do full Lotus or stick my feet over my head or anything like that. For a guy who's just got average flexibility to be able to sit in a comfortable and upright posture for the minimum amount of time, which is 10, 20, 30 minutes if you want to immerse yourself into meditation. The sooner you're able to reach physical stillness and physical comfortability in your sessions, the sooner your mind will start to settle and you'll be able to go deeply inside and start to do the work. Week 2, Module 2 is all about movement and embodiment. Now the common conception on meditation is that it's something that you do with your legs crossed and your eyes closed, and that's true. This is certainly the way that you will most deeply immerse yourself into the inner workings of what's going on for you, whether it's standing or seating or lying, but you're in a static posture with your eyes closed. However, you can certainly meditate with your eyes open and you can meditate while you're doing things. This is what I call embodiment or practical awareness. This is the ability to be able to go about your day and to be constantly bringing yourself back to a sense of presence. Rather than being locked up in your head, thinking, worrying, fantasizing, running endless mental loops, most of the time you don't need to do that except when you need to solve a problem. So instead of that, instead of wiring yourself up into anxious states or worried states or getting really, really solipsistic, only seeing the world through your little viewpoint, you can learn how to become more embodied. What that means is to redirect your focus throughout your body and to be able to allow grace and flexibility to drive your movement. In this week, what I'm working on is initially a stretching routine. This is a very, very simple 10-minute routine that takes you from the top of your head down to the soles of your feet, completely stretches all major muscle groups and works on flexibility, ease of motion, grace, joint rotations. This is a very intelligent way to move through your body in a very short amount of time, plugs in really well to any of your other exercise regimes. If you're doing weights or yoga or whatever, this is a really good warm-up. It's the thing that even in times when I have been slack with my meditation or I've been super busy, I always do this. This is the thing that gets me going in the morning, that reminds me I'm alive, that stops me becoming an old man who's stiff in my body. I'm able to stay relaxed, present, loose in my movement, and this is through my daily practice of stretching. I also introduce you to some of the foundation movements of the swimming dragon system. This is a type of internal martial art that I learned in China, similar in some ways to Tai Chi, so slow, smooth movements, but it works a lot with rotation of joints, with working on different planes of movement. Instead of just being upright all the time and only moving like an action figure, you're able to move on different planes, have flexibility in your spine, in your knees, in your hips, and this means that you will have more grace. When you walk, you'll look sexy. When you fuck, you'll be able to isolate your hips and do all sorts of crazy angles and moves that most guys who are super stiff in the hips can't do. They just sort of pump from the ... They're just like that. That's their move. That's their move, being able to have Latin hips where you can wiggle and jiggle and get into some interesting places you wouldn't get to otherwise. This system of martial arts, in the martial meditation method, I'm giving you three of the warm-up movements from the swimming dragon system, so I've added a couple of new ones from the original launch and adding them to this 2.0 version. When you learn to master rolling the ball and holding the glass balls, these exercises, these are the ones that I will take with me in my old age. These are the things that will keep you flexible, keep you from having issues in your spine and your knee joints, and mean that you will be able to be young and loose in your body for many years to come. In week three, module three, the main emphasis is on the art of abdominal breathing. The original meditation system that I teach you in weeks one is about awareness. It's about being objective, allowing things to move through you without being reactive. Awareness is a vitally important skill to being able to shift your personality and your behaviors and your thought processes over time. Seeing the way that you operate from an objective position and then allowing yourself to, instead of reacting in ways that you used to, to let these reactions pass and dissolve and so therefore you take power out of them. So, example, if you're someone who gets easily frustrated or angry, you feel that impulse come up inside you and you want to express it by shouting or smashing something and instead you use your awareness meditation to observe it, to see how it shifts and changes, and then to pinpoint the exact point where you usually would react and instead relax and allow and then you start to undo these patterns. Now in this week, what I'm looking at is a different style of meditation. This is one that is focused, where there is a very specific thing that you're attempting to control and adjust, as opposed to just observing and letting things be as they are. So in this case, we're working with the breath. There's lots of meditation systems that use breath. Yoga has all sorts of crazy breathing. A lot of the meditation systems work with observation of the breath, so you might bring your mind to your nostrils and just observe the sensation of the air coming in and out. So these are great, but they have a different effect. In this case, the abdominal breathing is about learning how to use your diaphragm, so the membranous muscle at the base of your lungs, and your abdominal muscles to draw your center of gravity lower. Most people, as they get older and get more stressed, their center of gravity raises, their breathing gets more shallow, so they're only filling up the top third of their lungs, for example. So that means their heart rate's faster, their breathing's faster, they tend to get out of emotional control quicker, because you're on the edge of being flustered anyway. And this can lead to issues in the bedroom, of ejaculating too fast or losing yourself to social anxiety very quickly. The abdominal breathing method is the one that I've found to be the most effective to take nervous energy and turn it into focus and power. Because what we're doing is we're directing attention to the abdominals, we're using the muscular tension that we keep at a certain level constantly, and at the same time you're bringing your mind out of here and down into your center. So below your belly button, bringing your mind into that space and meditating from that position. So this breathing technique can take some time to lock in, but once it does, that becomes your default breathing. I don't have to practice this anymore, I do it. I had to retrain my breathing for many months when I first started doing this, but now it has the effect of deepening my voice, because I'm pushing from the diaphragm, because if I speak from my throat, which is where I used to speak from, I'd sound like this, and then you probably wouldn't trust me. And I don't know how I did that, because it was painful. So it makes my voice deeper, I have better projection, I have greater control over my arousal state, particularly important in the bedroom. And it means that when I come under stress, which I do like everyone else, that instead of it exhibiting by jiggling and erratic movements or racing thoughts, I can draw my attention down into my center, lock that in, and use that tension to generate focus and power. This is one of the most powerful techniques that I've ever learned in my life. It has changed so many aspects, and so this is the focus of week three. By the end of this, you will have a very clear idea of how to do it and how to utilize it in your private meditation, and just as importantly, how to use it when you're out in the real world dealing with the inevitable stresses you come across. In module four, I teach you a self-massage routine. Not that kind of massage. This is clean. You're not going to give yourself any happy endings. What this is, is it's a Japanese system, which I learned many years ago, and I've used pretty much daily ever since. If not the whole routine, I certainly do pieces of this routine very, very commonly. What this does, is it takes you through a whole series of acupressure massage techniques that you can do on yourself, and in the same way that the stretching routine works from head to toe, so does this. You get to stimulate and massage all of the important Chinese medical points, as well as dealing with all the major muscle groups, and all of your joints. This means in around 15 minutes, you can take yourself from being sluggish and stiff to feeling a flow inside your body, to relieving tension that perhaps can't be relieved just by adjusting your posture, because if you have chronic tension in your neck, you adjust the posture and that will solve things over the long term, but in the short term, we need to get some thumbs in there to release the tension. This is a really powerful method to take yourself from one state to a very, very different relaxed state in a short amount of time. It also has the benefit of teaching you certain massage techniques which you can use with women. I cannot say the number of times that I have been laid partially or almost completely because of my massage skills, but it has been a vitally important skill. When you learn what it feels like to be touched, so you're doing it on yourself, well then it's easy to see, okay, that feels really awesome or that was too much pressure or not enough and then you can translate that into your partners. So learning the self-massage on your arm and hands, for example, easily translates to you sitting in a club with a girl and you take her by the hand and you start to give her a bit of a hand massage and then you see her eyes roll back and you say, oh, you want me to give you a little massage? And before you know, you are physically seducing her in the club. So this is a wonderful way for you to bring pleasure to yourself and looseness and relaxation to yourself and to others. In week five, I start to instruct you on the ancient Chinese art of Qigong. Now this roughly translates to energy cultivation and this is a style of moving meditation and breath control and focus direction that has been developed in many different systems in China, some of them for martial use, some for medical use, some for sexual use and the specific one I'm looking at here is for the use of meditation. This takes the abdominal breathing, which you learned in the previous week and plugs it into a physical system. So in these Qigong exercises, so I give you the foundational lifting the small pillar exercise and in this 2.0 version, I've added two new more advanced Qigong exercises so you can continue this practice. The amazing thing that I find about Qigong is that it allows you to align all of your states. So what that means is if I'm only meditating in a static posture, I'm working mainly on my breathing or my focus. When I'm doing Qigong, what I'm doing is I am aligning the breath, the posture, the movement and the focus all at the same time so that the movement becomes a physical representation of the breath. You synchronize your entire being and this helps you to sink into a trance-like immersive state into your meditation very easily. Sometimes it can be quite hard to stay focused and not fidget when you're trying to stay still, which is something you should practice. But for a lot of people, especially when you're first learning meditation, being able to move in a controlled way to make this a full body experience makes it much easier to immerse yourself and not get so distracted. It also has the effect of creating alignment in your body, in your experience, which means that as I'm going about my day and I'm going to go and talk to a girl, for example, I'm not having a battle with my body. I'm not trying to tame my mind and trying to real focus back all the time as I'm getting super distracted or anxious or fidgety. Instead, as I'm learning to align my states of consciousness, I can start to deliver very, very clear messages. My communication becomes super clear because as I speak, I move. As I breathe, I relax. And so I'm meditating as I'm communicating. Everything that I do, my gestures, my eye contact, that all becomes a part of my presence. And the effect that has on you is awesome. You feel super relaxed and you feel good in your body. You feel like it feels right to be you in this space instead of that feeling, you know, you have that sometimes where you just don't feel comfortable in your own skin, particularly when you're under stressful situations. These techniques allow you in real time to adjust your state. Okay, you feel yourself starting to get a bit flustered. You bring your awareness down to your breathing. As you breathe, you allow your body to move a little bit and you get into this nice trance-like state and then you're there with a person. The effect it has on them is that they see you as charismatic, as focused, as someone who's listening, as someone who's engaging. And in that way, you're much more likely to have the effect that they want to get to know you or they feel like you're getting to know them instead of asking random questions and zoning off. This is one of the key elements of charisma, of influence, of seduction. It's the ability to be aligned in the moment and project very, very clear messages with all of your communication tools. In week five, I'm also including an hour-long video where I go into a lot of detail showing you how to translate your meditation skills into the bedroom. Now, originally, I learned most of these skills in ashrams, in retreat centers, where there was no sexual contact, there was no talking, there was no fraternizing, it was you doing your meditation with your master or in a group. However, over the years, as I started to study different systems such as Tantra, Taoist sexuality, and I started to experiment, I saw that these techniques which I'd learned for spiritual or personal development reasons actually had very, very profound effects in the bedroom. What makes a good lover as a man is not so much about his technical skills. Sure, you need to know where a clitoris is and you need to understand the mechanics of a female body, but if I approach her like that, as some kind of machine to get off by pushing certain buttons, it's gonna be quite robotic and she's going to feel that. Even if your technique is textbook perfect, if you're up in your head and you're like, okay, I'm doing my job and this is the things that I do because I'm a good sex guy, she's gonna feel that as you disconnect it or as it being robotic. Girls can sense and see when you're doing something that you've done before and this is the thing you think you do. A great lover is a man who is spontaneous and sensitive, who, yes, is able to take command, go for what he wants, project his desire, but you need to be able to do that in reference to the partner you're with. How do we communicate that? Of course, verbally. It's very good to communicate verbally in the bedroom about what you do and don't want and what you like and what you want more of. I encourage that. But at the same time, you can read so much information when you're out of your head. If I'm in my head thinking about what next three positions I'm gonna do, I'm trying to distract myself from coming too quickly, yeah, this is not an immersive sexual experience. Whereas if I'm able to use my awareness meditation to bring my focus throughout my body, it means I'm seeing through my fingertips. As I'm touching her skin, my body is adjusting and flowing and following the shape of her body because I'm loose and relaxed in my body and I'm hyper aware of what's going on. So I can feel the subtle changes. I can feel when something feels good for her or when our body's locked together or when we're a bit out of synchronization and I need to adjust something. Also, when I utilize the abdominal breathing, this allows me to last much, much longer in bed. It also develops your sexual energy. And in this video, I'll start to show you how to transmute this raw, unrefined, masculine energy that you have that wants to blurt out the end of your dick and to be able to start to filter it through your body using focus and breathing exercises that means that you can eventually become multi-orgasmic. Now, a lot of men would be like, what? That's not, only women can do that, right? And some men would be like, women can do that? Yes, women can do that sometimes. And men can too, once they learn to separate ejaculation and orgasm, because they're not the same thing, they just usually happen at the same time. When I become more and more subtly aware of my body, I can feel these differences. I can feel when I'm reaching points of no return and then I can use the abdominal breathing and the microcosmic orbit or scooping a loop, as they say, to draw this hot energy up my spine and then let it filter throughout my body. So in this way, you can have full body orgasmic experiences without ejaculating. And that's a big advantage if you wanna make love all night or if you want to explore some of the subtler possibilities that you can have in the bedroom. So this is really exciting stuff. I've studied this a lot over the years and I've seen how these meditation techniques can be plugged into your physical life with women. And these are the things that will assist you to become a phenomenal lover. In week six, we put it all together. So over the previous five weeks, I've taught you a range of different focus exercises, meditation, breathing, embodiment, movement. And the idea is that it's gonna take some time over the first few weeks to learn the system, troubleshoot them, understand what you're doing. And then once you've got it, you wanna be able to put it into your daily schedule in a way that is effective, that doesn't take too much time and gets results. So what I've done is grouped together different batches of the exercises for different purposes. And then you have explanations and then you have demonstration videos, which you can watch and then just run through the routine with me in the morning and the evening. So for about 20 to 40 minutes, you can hit all the major areas that we're working on in the course. I grouped the ones in the morning so that this leads to you being stretched, relaxed and alert. So being able to walk out the door, feeling good in your body and feeling clear in your mind so that then when you're facing the day, not from place of fogginess or worry, but that you're at ease and in flow when you go out and face the day. This has massive effects straight away and then compounding effects long-term. Can you imagine how different your life would be if every day you have a predictable, proven way to take yourself from whatever shitty state you're in when you wake up, I know I am, I'm a very grumpy morning person, to be able to then 20 minutes later, feel awesome. This is really, really valuable stuff. The evening routine is designed to help you to wind down, to chill out, to go deeper inside yourself, which assists you to fall asleep. This is something I struggle with sometimes because I'm a very busy person and my timetable is all over the place. So I need these abilities to shut the system down, to turn my mind off, to come back to a point of peace, introspection and presence at the end of the day, because this is going to allow me to hit the day from both angles and process whatever I need to process without dragging my issues day to day and issues compounding. In this module, I also look at how to integrate MMM into your daily life. Now it's awesome if you're practicing in the morning and the evening, but if you then walk out the door and then spend the rest of your day getting back up in your head and feeling stressed and pissed off at things, then you're gonna be neutralizing the positive effects of your meditation. That's just the facts of it. You meditate and then you operate in the opposite way. It's an overall, you're just gonna be playing this game of fighting against, okay, I'm chill, now I'm not chilled, and it's not gonna have long-term effect. So it's important that you learn how to integrate meditation into your daily life so that, ideally, your life becomes an expression of your meditation. What I mean by that is that, ideally, you wanna spend more time present than you are not. Most people spend the vast majority of their waking life not really experiencing life. It's an unfortunate tragedy, really, to go through life half dead. Some people perceive that that's the only way they can deal with life, but if you're somebody who wants to get the best out of life, then you have to be there for it. So what I do is I introduce a whole bunch of what I call micro-meditations. And these are condensed versions of the larger techniques that you've learned, but they're ones that can be applied in just a few seconds or a few breaths, and you can do these multiple times. Personally, I do these kind of micro-meditations dozens of times a day. I find myself running around after a student and I'm thinking about something, getting in my head. I note that, I bring my attention back to my feet, and I feel 10 steps as I walk along. Just those 10 steps, I'm focused on bringing myself back to the presence, and then, okay, cool, I'm here again. And I can do that with all of the techniques. So learning how to utilize a few abdominal breaths just to re-center yourself. Learning how to do micro-aspects of the stretching. This is particularly important if you're sitting, working at a desk all day, or driving, to be able to take a couple of minutes however many times a day you need to make yourself feel physically comfortable again is gonna totally change the quality of your life. So I introduced a whole range of these different micro-meditations that allow you to go around and do your normal stuff, go to work, study, whatever you gotta do, but without really taking any time out except a few seconds here or there, a minute here or there, you're able to keep yourself at a relatively even level of relaxation. You will be able to deal with stresses as they come faster, you might still get stressed by something but instead of it being something that takes you over and you lose control of your emotional state, you'll notice it and you'll say, okay, I've come a bit out of my equilibrium, I'm gonna use a micro-meditation, I'm gonna do four sweeps up and down and then settle back into my space. Even just those little things done regularly throughout the day have massive effects. And over the longer term, over months and years, this will alter your character completely. You will not be the kind of guy who does what you used to do, who had a short fuse, who gave up easily, who fell into depression easily, who was very scattered and distracted. All of these things are just symptoms of an untrained mind. It's not that you're built that way, it's not that you're a worse human being than somebody who's positive and able to be focused, it's just that you haven't trained your mind in the correct way. This methodology allows you day by day, moment by moment, to train your mind to be able to be directed where you want it to be. And then to be able to have real-world effects on your own state, your posture, your physicality, the way you communicate, and then that reflects out in terms of how people respond and treat you, because what you put out is what you're gonna be getting back. I've experienced what it's like to be somebody who's depressed, who's cynical, who's negative. And the world reflects that back at you. You're filtering and sourcing negative things and people, and you find them, and then you lock in, and then you reinforce this, and it's a downward spiral. The shift to turning that into an upward spiral starts with these simple steps. It's not necessarily that we need to change our job or move to India or have drastic changes in our life. Sometimes you do. But if I can make these small changes which are consistently leading me into the direction of positivity, of flow, of relaxation, of embodiment, of feeling good in my own skin, of being able to be fascinated and curious about people and life, to be able to communicate on a very real level, you start putting these pieces in, and they're just like little fireworks start going off in your life and starting to alter the trajectory of where you're going to go and the person that you are going to be. These techniques are not just to help you be a bit chilled. Really, these are powerful life-altering techniques. You can use them on one level to just relax the surface level of your mind, and you'll feel better than you did previously, sure. But you can use these methods to dig deep into the core of your personality, of your behaviors, of your fears, to understand actually how do you really work? Because you know,"}
