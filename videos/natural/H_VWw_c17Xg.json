So if I wanted to get her to sit down to give me a blowjob, for example, and I'm standing a few feet away from the bed, what I'm going to do is I'm going to hold her in behind and then I'm going to do this step that I'll show you in a moment, kind of a tango step forward till I got it to the edge of the bed. All right. Now, then I place my hands on her hips like we were holding when we were turning her. And what I'm going to aim to do is to push down at this 45 degree angle, right? So I'm going to basically place her down. What I'm not doing is like a shove, right? So whether she's going to get this jerk to her body, think of it like a shunt or a place. It's like I put my hands on the hips and I put it down. Okay. So I could take it from here, walk to the back, held her at the edge of the bed, down like so. So you see, it's just this simple shunt, no aggressive movement, very easy to place it down. And then when I get up, same thing. I get this stretch up, sit down, cool. From there, I could also put a hand on the chest and go lie down, but it's a guide. Any of these times where I'm pushing the woman, uh, she, she's leading it and I'm guiding it in a way. Well, I'm guiding it, then she's doing the action and I'm following through with the guide, right? Cause if I like shove her in the chest, it's going to not feel nice, right? But if I guide her down, right? So I'll do one bad one from here where it's like, it doesn't feel good, right? Okay. So that's where I went flick at the end with the wrist, right? So you need to be really aware. And that's the common tendency to go and then get this little punch at the end. That's not what I want. Think of it like I'm placing her down, placing her down, right? So from here, you can see it's this, down, okay? So I walk her back to where her ankles are at the bed height, hand on the hip, hand on the hip, and then down. Now I do the rough bad version. So I'm just stepping on her feet, getting her back. That's what it feels like when you do it wrong, serious. Now, we can also throw the woman on the bed from the shoulders. And this one is actually where I'm launching her off the ground, right? So with the hips, I'm pushing down on the 45 and just placing her down. When I go into the shoulders and I want to like throw her onto the bed, the angle now, if I do it like that, the same angle as the hip, then I'll just smash her head into the pillow, into the mattress. So the angle of this needs to now go from 45 to more like up here, whatever degrees that is. So I'm pointing towards the pillows at the end of the bed, basically, because that's where I want to send her her body. Now, this one doesn't really work in slow motion. I mean, I'll kind of show you how the movement works, but it only works with momentum. So same thing as I'll walk her back, so she's at the edge of the bed, have my hands here, and I'll do it slow motion. So what I'm going to do, the same thing is it's this place, but it has to, I mean, it's going to have a bit more momentum, but it still doesn't have this jerky flick at the end of it because you could throw her, you know, too far, right? So if we look at it in slow motion, it's going to be here. So you see the angle where I am here. There's my angle, as opposed to when I was here and the angle was there to put her on the bed. Now at speed. I've never tried this. You've never had that before? Is it good? Yes. Surprising? Yes. All right. All right. So as you can see, for the uninitiated, it's a shocking, interesting, pleasant surprise. All right. So if we come back here and I'm doing it kind of at speed. Get down. So you can see from this position, I've thrown her down for me to now join her. If I launch myself, I'm going to land on her knees, right? So I come up, open, open, crawl up. And I can lay myself down smoothly and then we can move into all those breast touches or whatever else it is that we're doing from here. I can also throw her onto the bed face down. It works the same way. So I can be walking her in here. Well, you know, maybe I've got her into a restraint hold now because this is a great one where I can throw down on the bed and maybe I do the under the bed restraints or I'm just going to get straight into the action. So from there, okay, so maybe we're going to come around and put our cuffs on, but plenty we can do if we just threw her down on the bed. Open the legs out. From here, I can come up and touch the pussy. You know, I can get in on top of her here. So very easy for me to get straight on top of her from that position. One thing that's important to be aware of is what's going on with your bed. Now, if you look down here, I have very deliberately padded the areas of the bed. So if you bump into it, it doesn't hurt. Custom built for these purposes. But a lot of beds will have like a hard kind of wooden sharp edges there. So we do need to be aware of that, right? Because if I'm here with her and we come up close, and if I don't do it with enough power, right? So if I kind of half do it, sorry about this, she can easily like end up going knock here and then fall like that, right? So it doesn't matter on this bed. But if it's got a hard surface, you're going to bang the shin before you throw it down. So if we do this at speed, what you'll see is that she gets launched like that. So ideally, her ankle and feet lift and go over the bed. So there's no knocking of the ankle, all right? Today's video was a tiny little snippet taken from the inside of the Master Lover Toolkit.
