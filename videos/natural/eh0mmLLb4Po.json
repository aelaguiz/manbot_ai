Well, three things actually. Work on your internal state, develop your internal confidence, your mindsets, you're in the game. But externally, the two things are to master approach skills particularly in a day because that's most relevant to most people. And secondly, to be able to pull together a group of men and women if you can, that's even better, a social circle that works together because you blend cold approach with good social circle. And good social circle doesn't just mean cool people, it means people who are actually working together for each other's vested interests. Then you have the ultimate combination. And so that's the way that the TNL crew and our extended groups of male friends and wing girls and people we know work is that if Liam or whoever brings a girl home or to a social event, all of us immediately start shifting the way that our roles work. Tony brings a girl into the group, immediately he's the alpha and all of us move to make him look good, to support him. There's no jostling, there's no one-upmanship, there's no trying to prove that we're cool. If you know, we meet his new girl and we are polite and friendly and charming and silly, but we are certainly not flirtatious, we're certainly not trying to make him like make ourselves look cool or in any way trying to be the alpha dog. We immediately shift our roles to adjust to assist the person that needs the assistance. How long have you been in?"}
