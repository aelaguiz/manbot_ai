We're still physical. I'm touching her body. It's, you know, it feels nice. And then pretty soon I found myself usually able to get it up and then to proceed because I didn't have to. Hello, gents. James Marshall in the rain talking about erectile dysfunction, as usual, just to give you some tips on how to like little things that might help. Well, when I had erection issues, when I was first, you know, first few years of me being sexually active, uh, it was awful. It was humiliating. And each time it happened, uh, you know, I'd beat myself up. There's something wrong with me. I'm just not the kind of guy who can have sex with random people. I can only do it in a loving relationship, uh, blah, blah, blah. Um, one of the big things that helped fix that and took all that nonsense out of my head was communicating with the woman. So once I started saying these words and it would happen like this, it's imagine this it's 1999. There's a not that hot hippie chick with a hairy pussy kissing down your torso about to try and give you a blow job, which is going to be very bad because high-speed porn is not ubiquitous yet. And she hasn't seen good blow jobs. And she thinks a blow job includes teeth and going like this. You with me? 1999. You there? All right. She's going down. She's going down and I've lost, I'm losing it. And I know that when she gets down there and starts sucking on it, like limp celery, that that's going to make it worse. And so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to like, sort of stay here like this. And she's going to suck on my limp dick for a bit and then look up and go, you all right? And then I'm going to go, yeah. She's like, is anything wrong? This is Australia in the nineties, by the way. No. And then she's going to stop, feel awkward and weird. And then, and then we're going to hate each other. All right. That's what I used to do. Then one day I started doing this. Uh, she starts going down to give me the erotic treat of the Australian nineties blow job. And I say, Hey, uh, stop. Uh, yeah, look, sometimes when I'm with a new partner, I don't always get it up straight away. It's better if we, uh, I don't know. I think it's just like the kind of stress of it. Or so I think it's better if we just like have a cuddle. Right. So that's what I started doing. Telling the girl sometimes this is, doesn't work for me just because it's, it's, uh, you know, it's because of the pressure, which takes all the pressure off her thinking, Oh, it's because she's fat or I'm gay or what's wrong with this dude. It also gives a woman a little insight into the fact that we're not machines, right? That erections don't work by slot. You know, you just put a penny in and then you get an erection, uh, we're human beings and our arousal state is influenced by a whole bunch of other factors. And every time I said that the girls were really on my side, they were like, Oh, that's all right. You know, can I help or something? And then I would change from doing something from trying to be sexual to doing something intimate, but non-penetrative. So that meant we'd have a cuddle. We have a bath. Some, I give her a massage. She gives me a massage. We, you know, watch something on a laptop, naked cuddling, something where it was like, okay, the pressure that I have to perform and be a sex machine right now is gone. Now I can relax into being with this girl. We're still physical. I'm touching her body. It's, you know, it feels nice. And then, uh, pretty soon I found myself usually able to get it up and then to proceed because I didn't have to, right? So just that small action of like, just speaking this, not making a big deal out of it, not, not being rude, not blaming her or not being apologetic, just going, here's the thing. And here's a, here's a simple solution. That, that was something that's that, that was the biggest thing that started to crack it. And then from there, I, I started seeing that there was these correlating things like, oh, okay. When I'm in, when I'm getting in bed with a girl and like, we're making out and we're making out and making out for fucking 50 minutes on the couch. And, you know, I'm, you know, doing that teenage thing where you're sort of like trying to sort of pull a t-shirt up and like sneak your hand up and like squeeze the tits under the bra and then like trying to tug a thing off. And then we're dry humping with, with jeans on jeans for like 40 minutes whilst your balls are getting minced in your, in your pants. Uh, I stopped doing that. Right. Cause that's not, that's what you do in high school when you're dry humping at a party. And if you missed that, don't worry. It wasn't that great. Just forget about it. Um, so instead, what I started to do was like, you know, make out with a girl a bit on the couch and then like stand up, take her by the hand, lead her into the bedroom. So lift your arms, take her clothes off quickly. And so that we're down to underwear at least, and then jump in bed. And so now we're making out with skin on skin contact. And then it's easy once we're aroused to like get panties off and get it on. Right. So even, even a simple thing like that, which, which ties in with the leadership, right? If, if I'm, if I'm taking leadership in the bedroom, uh, then that it suddenly creates a context for the woman to go, Oh, okay. He's leading. Like he puts his hand out. I mean, she can say no, of course, but like hand out. Okay. I'll take the man's hand and follow him. He gives me a clear command, lift your arms. Suddenly my clothes are off. That feels nice. And then I'm, and then as the woman she's settling into, uh, following the man's lead, then it creates that beautiful masculine feminine dynamic. I'm not saying that has to be like that all the time. If a woman wants to take the man by the hand, that's fucking sexy too. And within a sexual dynamic, although I'm, you know, for me, I'm, I'm a dominant, but there'll be times where a girl will then switch into being more dominant or, you know, get on top or tie me up or whatever. Like that's fine as well. Uh, but then I need to shift into a role where, okay, she's leading me for some time. It creates a narrative and a context, a flow. And then the, the sexual energy bounces between the two of you and it builds and builds. And then, you know, it creates its own natural momentum, right? So that's another thing that I found like just, just that alone, getting the girls clothes off quickly and taking leadership was something that, that, uh, helped as well. Another thing was that some girls who are not super experienced or not very good in bed or, or she's feeling a bit tense, uh, you know, if her body is tense, if she's like, uh, holding, you know, her legs too close together, or she's not arching her back properly, or she's, or maybe she's pushing back too much and like trying to do the male job whilst you're trying to do it. You know, when two people are trying to fuck, it doesn't really work unless your rhythm is perfect. Uh, so that kind of thing. And again, being able to take command where I just like learning to put my hand on girls hips and go tilt your hips like this, or open your legs and open your legs up or, uh, relax your legs. Let me take control of them. Things where it was like, okay, I need to, I need to take more command of the woman in the bedroom so that it works better for us, that we fit together better. So she feels more relaxed so she can open up. Right? So, and these are, these are skills that happen through experience, but they, they don't just happen through experience. I could fuck a thousand women the same way badly and not learn anything. Uh, or I can take the feedback and grow and learn from them each time. So these are, uh, these are areas of just like speaking without shame about the fact that, uh, you know, you don't say, oh, I can't get an erection. I'm a loser. It's just like, uh, sometimes it doesn't work in this situation or, or I'm a bit, you know, I'm a bit drunk tonight. So let's just, let's just like chill for a bit and, uh, take the pressure off or whatever the issue is. And my experience and with the many clients I've worked with in these issues, it was that I can remember one or two, there was two situations where a woman was cruel to a guy that I'd heard of because he couldn't get up. And that woman's just a c**t. Uh, everyone else was fine. Like the, the, once it was out, uh, then she could be, then she could be on your side."}
