Like if you had a guy who was, let's say, very vanilla, never spanked you, only does three positions, you know, he might be doing it well, and he might be able to make you calm and know your body well, but let's say he doesn't feel like he's allowed to or doesn't really know why, doesn't understand the dominance thing, so without that, you think it wouldn't work long-term. Sometimes it's a thing that can be fixed with time. If I really like the guy as a person, yeah, sometimes it takes time, and I feel like I can help the guy get this energy, masculine energy, out of him while sex. If he's not too confident, it also just comes with time to get trust."}
