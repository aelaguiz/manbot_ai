Many women have had an experience, a guy had sex with her and afterwards he acted completely different than before. Alright, he's just, he's an arsehole about it or he's cold or aloof or something that's not pleasant and therefore she knows that men switch once they ejaculate into something else and she doesn't know what that's going to be. It might be that you're, you know, very intimate and nice with her or it might be like, yeah cool, there's the door. So, which you shouldn't do that. So, how do we inoculate against that? So, you come up with situations where girls either put up a physical resistance or a verbal resistance. Now, of course, that resistance might simply just be that she doesn't want to go any further. And that's something of course we're going to respect. We're not trying to force past anyone's body's boundaries. All we're trying to do is help them to see where is their real boundary. Because is their boundary... If the boundaries are based around I don't want to do this right now, awesome. But if the boundary is based around I don't think I should because somebody else might judge me or society at large might judge me or you, the guy, might think I'm a slut or something. This is an unnatural barrier that we shouldn't have in any way. So, how do I help her to move past that? It's that when the expectation of sex is removed then she can feel more comfortable to experience her desire. So, a classic thing to do if a girl puts on the brakes is don't get reactive, angry, try and argue, convince or anything like that because now she's like, she realizes she's being sold or the guy's trying to hustle her. So, don't do that. One thing you can do, yes, is release the pressure and do something else that is still intimate but not sexual. So, I'm making out and she says, oh no, no, and puts up her objection. So, that's cool, let's just, whatever, cuddle. Watch something on YouTube where they're wrapped up together. Have a bath. Massage each other. Have a cup of tea but be sitting with your legs entwined. So, something where we're still ideally physically involved but don't push that either. Don't think, all right, I must now have physical touch that's of a non-sexual nature because that's the technique. No, that's something that's more likely to make her feel comfortable, right? A woman's boundaries can move and slide super fast. So, I've had it in the past where a girl's like, no, no, James, what's your last name? Marshall? Okay. What? All right, so the boundary was, if you get me pregnant, I don't even know how to Google you. She needs to verbalize like as a token kind of statement. Just so you know, I'm not that kind of girl. I said that thing and I say, of course, I understand that. Or, yeah, like the way that I've dealt with that kind of phrase is many, many ways but it's essentially, yes, I understand you're a good person but my judgment of you as good or bad has nothing to do with whether you decide to fuck me or not, right? So, she's like, you know, I'm a good girl. I said, yeah, I can see you're a good person but what you do with your body is up to you, right? Or, you know, she's like, I'm not going to sleep with you tonight and sometimes I said, hey, listen, if that's because you don't want to, of course, that's fine. If that's because you're a bit worried about like what I'll think of you or something, you don't need to worry about that. I'm not that guy. I understand what it's like out there. You know, pretend to be a princess all the time but I'm an animal. I'm a human. Nothing goes beyond these walls. It's that kind of thing, right? I mean, I'm not laying all that out and doing a big convincing speech. I just might throw one of these statements out. Just be aware that you find yourself in these situations. She's not putting up resistance because she's trying to be a bitch or fuck with you. Very rarely, I have had situations where a girl after, you know, two dates, we go to whatever, this base and then the third date, she like backs it back to won't even kiss me, right? And then she's playing hot and cold and it's clear she's playing games in order to try to, what, get me to chase more or get more of my attention or to like exert power. It's very rare but I have had in those cases when I've recognized that, I've said, I'm going because I don't want to play those type of games. I'm happy to play the overall game. It is theatre, right? Two strangers meet, starting a love story. You know, we're not putting all our cards on the table right away, are we? We're like, okay, just full disclosure, I'm miked right now, paying a professional to teach me how to do this. You're my seventh approach for the day and I consider you about a 7.3 out of 10, so this is my warm-up. I'm James. Okay, that's honest and on her side, it might be, oh, hey, there's about 49 men who want my pussy right now. I'm going to put you on the list. To be honest, you're really far down and I'm mainly going to use you for validation if I ever need to. I might use you to create some jealousy with a guy I like more. I'm Sarah. All right, so text says, hi, Violetta. Change that name. Hi, Neoletta. It was great to meet you in this crazy city. What a coincidence. Let's continue our chat later. I finish at 8 p.m. Let's meet at 8.30 p.m. Okay, what's wrong with that? Jumping too quickly? To logistics, yeah. Yeah. It's gone straight from remember me to this time. And I said that yesterday or whenever we talked about text. Usually I'm going to take three texts backwards and forwards to get to the, three or four to get to the confirming the date. Because, again, it's like I'm going from total stranger to let's do this thing. It's happening. And she's like, oh, that's a big jump as opposed to that one where it's like, okay, that was a crazy coincidence. That was fun, cool New York moment. Wasn't expecting to meet someone like you, this kind of thing. And then let's continue soon. Let's catch up soon. To be continued. Looking forward to hanging out soon, right? That's the opening one that tends to get the most common responses. Then she writes back as she did. And then now we move into, hey, I'm hanging out with some friends today, but I'll be free around nine-ish. Want to meet up? Still, I'm still not. I'm just giving the general time-ish. Then she says, yes, no, I can't, I can't. If she says, yeah, maybe, yeah, yes, that sounds fine. Then I go, cool. Why don't we meet out the front of whatever at 930? Yeah, because then it's, I'm just grading it in. I'm going, okay, remember me? And you like that, right? She's like, yeah, that was cool. All right, cool. Remember we talked about doing that again? How about we do that sometime? I guess we could. All right, let's do it at this time and this place. It eases it into for her. So that I'm sure will make a difference. When I give the guys a foundation of awareness and meditation, what it does is it gives them very practical tools to be able to deal with the process of going through this. And in practical terms, that may mean feeling yourself frozen in conversation. And anything where it's like a fight or flight response, where your body gets activated and your mind kind of shuts down and you're very agitated is not a great creative place, not a great place to connect from. So ideally, you want to be as relaxed as possible. Giving these kinds of sweeping or inside awareness meditation allows you to feel when tension rises or feel when reactions are rising. And instead of blindly responding to them like probably did in the past, to be able to see that there's a choice point. There's a choice to react or to just allow. And it's easier to do nothing than something, but it's a special type of nothing. The ability to let something pass through you with grace. So a sensation or emotion or a fear for it to come through and not to respond with tension or reactivity or anger or fear. Because that's the choice point. So what we're ideally looking at is to give guys a tool that when they reach those intense periods, which inevitably you do, that they're able to allow it to rise inside themselves, not get flustered, not bail, and understand that like everything, it reaches a peak and then it changes into something else. So yeah, these are not like airy-fairy hippie tools of just like, well, let's have crystals and feel good. These are really like street-level survival techniques for seduction. And we use them all day. Guys are going in and out of sets and they're coming out in various states of frazzledness. And often we pull them aside for a little street meditation and then we give them micro-meditation techniques so that they can check in and continue to bring their general state to a level of balance. Start with me. We're all going to take just a big-ish, normal kind of breath in and then sigh. So it's like this. All right, breathe in and sigh. Wave breath. Normal. Try to not move the chest. It's just out. So you can come this way and then that way. You can expand the belly as you breathe out. I was just showing you the hands. You don't need to move the hands. That's how the belly should push. Please try to let her know something about you because she can't really fuck you anonymously. She needs to know something. And have a think. And you can work this with your coaches as well. And you can tell them, like I want to just work on my, if you're walking along looking for girls, work on my pitch. Who am I? Yeah, I'm James. I'm 39 and I have a business. Yeah. I'm James. Originally Australian, but I've been a gypsy nomad for a long, long time. Very confused about who and what I am, but I'm really enjoying the ride. Even though that's ambiguous, it tells you more about me than I'm James. I'm 39. I have a business. The girl asks you that one question. Why are you here? Tourist. No. Yeah, I'm here exploring this crazy place, soaking up the atmosphere. It's so something. It does this to me. I feel this way here. I feel different here. I do. Every time I land here, I'm going, whoa, fucking New York. I better do instant upgrade to keep up. Makes me feel alive. Because it's just like every, you know, way more than any other place I've been to, the people are conscious. Like they're there. They're there. They're experiencing. And self-expression is mandatory. Over there, there's 14 girls in little white dresses doing very sexy dancing. Class dismissed. No, what? Yeah. Okay. It is, actually. Sorry, I just saw you walking by, and I think you look pretty elegant. What's your name? Mimi. Which one? Mimi, what's your name? Mimi? Nice to meet you. You have a lovely day. Sorry, what? You have a lovely day. Hi there. I saw you walking the street. I'll let you go. Alonso, what are you up to? I'm meeting up with my boyfriend. Your boyfriend? Okay, he's a lucky guy for sure. I was walking by, and I think you're very beautiful. Just want to ask what's your name? Sorry. Alright. You're missing your cell phone, I will let you go. I just saw you walking the street. I think you're very beautiful. I'll let you go. Alonso, what are you up to? I'm meeting up with my boyfriend. Your boyfriend? I was walking the street. I think you're very beautiful. I was walking the street. What, we're friends? I'm not worried. I wanted to my friends. How's your boyfriend? You could say this to me. I don't know. It's hard to be with a guy from a away from my girlfriend. You should be with a guy from the other house. What else can I say? Let him go. Alonso? I'm here. What, is there something you want to talk to me? No. Okay, I see you. Fine. Then just tell me a little bit. You told me that you were single so, why don't you tell me now? Well, I'm single too. But now everyone... becomes single in a matter of days. Hey, Francisco. Are we still just friends? I hope I'm not wrong. Just because we fucked, doesn't mean you spend your money on some girl? What do you mean? I ask for forgiveness. What the hell do you want for forgiveness? You need to tell me nothing but what I need to know. Okay. And since you're single just tell me, ...it it's true? It's true. Hi there. Uh, I don't recognize you, sorry. No? Alonso. Alonso? What's your name? Ariana. Ariana? Yeah. Nice to meeting you. Oh, okay. I don't think you don't know me. Okay, no. I'm just walking around the street and just seeing the vibe. What are you up to? I'm going somewhere, to meet somebody. To meet someone? Okay. Is it just ...to do work? Work? What kind of work do you do? Uh, I'm a freelancer. I'm a freelancer. Ah, okay. So you're a freelancer? Yeah. And what do you do? Uh, well, he's going to design my website. So... He's designing your website? Yeah. Oh, so you have like your own business? Uh, no, no, no. Nothing like that. No? Just for writing. Writing? Oh, so you're a writer? Uh, journalist. Journalist? Wow. What kind of stories are you looking for? Uh, well, I already, I'm employed, so I have, uh, a B. I heard this. Is it true that they already have the story and then you just have to make it happen? Like they already have the filter. I cover the news, so... You cover the news, so you pretty much are free to write as whatever you want? Or as the news happens, I don't make things up. Okay. That's fair. Do you have, like, uh, the space to be critique? on that area. Oh wow, see it looks like you're pretty high on the range that's cool so I'm just walking around again I came here to New York I'm doing this intense training it's a meditation so it helps you to like to connect to your body and then relax I used to be a very anxious guy but now I'm working on it and what a best test to meet a friendly girl and say hi okay look I don't want to take too much of your
