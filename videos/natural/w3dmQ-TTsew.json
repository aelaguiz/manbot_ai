So she's just doing this for me, but why would she do that if I don't want to do, you know, you can see the confusion. So we usually just get the girls to explain, what does it feel like to be spanked? And then they say. What I've seen is that when I've taught these courses live, sometimes when we very first start applying impact, spanking a girl, there's confusion about why we're doing this, right? And this is where a shame trigger might come up for a guy where he's like, I don't want to hurt women. I'm a nice person. I like women. I don't want to be abusive. I don't want to hurt them in any way. You know, that's not me, which I totally get, right? I understand that. And I'm also that, right? I've investigated myself a lot and I don't have sadistic tendencies, right? Like I don't actually get pleasure from giving pain to somebody. I'm not like, yeah, getting off on the power over her and forcing her or making her do things that I like to do. There are some kinds of dominants who are that. And there are also women or let's say, reciprocal partners to that. There are sadists and there are masochists, right? So there can be a polarity where someone really gets off in causing pain and someone really gets off on receiving pain. Okay, that's a different dynamic. That's probably, I mean, you may never enter into that dynamic. And I've only ever done that a handful of times just as a single play session where the girl really wanted me to go super rough on her. She really wanted to experience the pain. Okay, I can play that. It's not my thing, but I'll take it to whatever limits I feel comfortable with. But the in general kind of confusion or questioning about like, why would I do this? I don't wanna do this because I don't wanna hurt her is understandable, but it's mistaken, right? It's a mistaken understanding of what the experience is like for the woman to be spanked properly. Cause I had, you know, one client at a live class recently asked, he said, is this like hitting stuff? Is this, are we doing this because we wanna do it and the woman kind of just puts up with it or what, right? So he was just confused. He's like, like, I don't really think this would be that fun for me and I wouldn't be fun for her cause I'm hurting her. So she's just doing this for me, but why would she do that if I don't wanna do it? You know, you can see the confusion. So we usually just get the girls to explain what does it feel like to be spanked? And then they say. So it's a cool warm up to be for sex. It's like all the feelings are 10 times better. And yeah, it just, everything is just better with spanking. Lara, any thoughts on being spanked? You like it? You like it hard? Yes. Why do you like it harder than most women? I don't know, it's meant to be funny. Like it physically turns your pussy on? Yes. And so when we're moving into the more of the dominant stuff, choking, spanking, hair pulling, putting girls in distress positions or like in kind of headlocks and arm locks and these kinds of things, try to keep this in mind. Like I encourage you to talk to women about this as you start to play and experience and ask her, well, what was that like? You know, does that feel pleasurable physically or is that just a psychological thing? Like I asked all these questions many times over to really get an understanding of what was going on for women, why they like this kind of thing. And then you get to see, it's like, it's not abusive because she wants it, right? It's not painful when done well. Bad spanking is extremely painful, right? If I have a rigid hand and I hit her, it's like hitting her with a block of wood. It doesn't have any psychological effect. It feels awful and it would be way better to not do it at all, right? So keep in mind whenever I'm talking about this kinds of things I'm saying, if done correctly, it will have this effect. So spanking done correctly sends shock waves through the pelvis into all the nerves of the vagina, right? So it actually stimulates. And I have had girls who can come from spanking, not all girls, but it certainly intensifies their arousal. So if I'm having sex with her from behind and I'm spanking her rhythmically whilst having sex with her, this is going to continually amplify and intensify the physical sensations, as well as it has the psychological impact of having a guy hitting her, but it not really hurting, right? Cause if I do it with correct technique, the impact disperses across the butt cheek. It sounds impressive, you know, it has a shocking noise and a shocking kind of feel cause it literally will send shock waves through the pelvis, but it's not a stinging pain, right? It's not something which actually hurts. So try to keep this in mind that as we're applying force to a girl, we're not doing it to hurt her. We're doing it to make her feel better, right? So the same thing with choking, if you've never been choked out, you know, MMA class or something before, then maybe you won't know, but I have had someone put a sleeper hole on me before. And once you let go, it feels quite nice. You just kind of feel all woozy and then they can knock you out. Now, I'm not suggesting that you knock girls out when you're choking them, don't go that far, but by compressing the throat and starting to minimize the blood that gets to the brain, this feels like you're on drugs, right? It starts to make you feel high. It stops you from thinking so much. You're just in this woozy kind of present state. And if you have that with the feeling of a strong man's hand around your throat, with him looking at you intensely, holding you down and fucking you at the same time, that if the woman's into that, which most women are, is gonna be a massively intensified experience well beyond if he'd just been having missionary sex with her, right? So understand this, that we're not doing these things to hurt women. This is, if you have any internal sense of hatred or bitterness towards women, then I'd be really careful about how you implement these tools in the bedroom, right? Like I really ask you to be honest with yourself and to look at that and to think, okay, do I actually wanna hurt her? If that's the case, then I would suggest don't use these techniques, right? Because then it's coming from a negative place. Then it's coming from a position where you're trying to take power off the woman and to domineer and to overpower her, that you are trying to use her solely for your pleasure or for your ego, and you don't care what the effect is on the woman. That's not a good lover. That's not a good dominant, right? That's not a well-integrated modern man, right? Now, again, I don't wanna shame you for what may have been implanted in you by someone else decades ago. I had bitterness of some sort to women at some point in my life. I had a sense that like there were good girls and sluts, and I had to investigate that and realize that's my stuff I'm carrying around. And if I'm shaming women and causing them damage by making them feel bad about their sexual decisions or because they chose to do this as opposed to that, then I'm a shit seducer. I'm a bad lover. I'm actually making things, I'm pissing in the pool, right? I'm making things generally worse for men and women by passing on that kind of shame and judgment. As opposed to the guy that dominates in order to please, right, so uses all sorts of domination techniques, sensual dominance, authoritarian dominance, subtle, tantric, you know, more kinky, more heavy impact, less impact, like all sorts of variations within this, then women really enjoy this. And it can be hard for us to understand, especially if you're a completely straight kind of dominant male, right, which is what I am. I, like I've been with a couple of girls where I let them tie me up and one girl who was a professional dominatrix to see what it's like. And it was interesting, but it didn't turn me on at all. Right, so I let the girl dominate me and I was like, cool, okay, she can do it. Slap me around and tie me up and stuff. Ride me like a pony. And I'm glad I did it, because it was like, cool, like I'm experienced what it's like to let go and it wasn't unpleasant, but it didn't turn me on. It was clear to me that, okay, I am more of a dominant, like that is in my nature. And therefore it's really hard for me to empathize or really understand what it might be like to be a woman with a submissive sexual nature to whom being constricted, restrained, and spanked and choked whilst being fucked really hard and, you know, let's add to it, being spat in the mouth whilst called a dirty whore, as an extreme example, is amazing, right? And if you were like, if you were tied up and held down by a big woman and, you know, being choked and told you're a dirty whore, maybe you wouldn't like that. I don't think I would. Don't think it would really register much pleasure for me. But women in general, and in general, big like asterisks on that, which is you need to find out about each woman, but very common patterns that women like to have sensual dominance, force applied upon them, restraint applied to them, man leading, man ravenous and ravaging her, not because she's doing it out of tolerance or like just to please you because I guess that's what men want. Nah, because it feels awesome for her for whatever reason, for whatever reciprocal of our sexuality that I can't really empathize or understand, I just have to accept. She's into this, she's really into this. And cool, I can do this, I can give her that. And it's fun because spanking a girl, you see the shockwaves and it looks awesome and you get into that wild like, okay, I'm a bit of a predator, I'm taking command. I can be a bit aggressive, she's mine. Those are all awesome states to be in. That's not negative domination, that's positive domination. If it slips over into, yeah, I'm using this bitch and I'm gonna take her, I'm gonna make her feel pain or whatever, you gotta check yourself on that. That's the point where I'm like, okay, you're now no longer following my teachings at all and I highly recommend that you, if it need be, talk to a therapist about it or talk to your partner about it or really do some psychedelics and investigate it or whatever you need to to see, why do I have an underlying hatred to women? Or why do I want them to experience pain? Why do I not wanna give them pleasure? Or why do I think that if I get pleasure, that if they get pleasure, I don't get pleasure? Right, so you gotta look at your underlying beliefs that are generating these attitudes and then into behaviors. Because again, you won't get the best out of a woman. You can end up becoming some form of abuser or causing damage to a woman when you absolutely didn't need to and when you could have caused repair and healing to it.
