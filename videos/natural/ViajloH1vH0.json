It's the Shaman here for the Natural Lifestyles coming at you from this beautiful autumn slash winter day in Budapest as you can see. Very nice weather I'm getting even though it's been freezing cold. So today I want to talk to you about some tips and tricks from my Enneagram repertoire. They're going to be really good for helping you move through habit change. So this is all about Enneagram strategies to help you really change your habits in effective ways. Because as we know change is not always as simple as we would like it to be. Now there's a lot of ideas out there about how to change and some of those ideas are more effective than others. And I want to do my best to break down a kind of a frame I guess and some psychology like an overview of what I think is a good way to really look at this and get a real handle on what's going on. Now first of all I think when you look at change inside of yourself and inside your life you have to realize that you're dealing with something that has many dimensions. And that means that it's not always going to be a simple linear process even though you want to try to do your best to make it a linear process just for your own means of being able to get where you want to go. But first of all start to accept that there's going to be a bit of learning along the way and maybe moving and shifting and changing strategies. Now the next thing to realize is that as you are coming to terms with yourself as a multi-dimensional thing and as your life as a multi-dimensional thing then you want to start to look at like what is it you really want to change and why do you really want to change it. And it's something that I think is a really useful idea. Something that I came across I think Jordan Peterson was talking about it recently but there's been other people that have the similar kind of idea. Looking at yourself as if you were kind of like a vulnerable animal or a child maybe and just saying like well if I really do want to change what do I want to change and what's important about that for me. So getting into contact with this idea that you are your own kind of carekeeper. You are your own parent if you will. You're your own caretaker and you need to take responsibility for yourself. You need to take responsibility for kind of taking care of your own inner child if you will. Your childish self or your animal self. And that begins with starting to define like what is it that you really want to change. Now in this domain that I work in as a lifestyle and dating social kind of coach with the natural lifestyles we deal with a lot to do with change around social skills. Change around lifestyle design. Change around internal attitudes that are going to build a better kind of way of living your life and being the kind of guy that's going to be much more fulfilling to your to your visions your values. Now in that sense we want to look at well what can we get connected to that's valuable in the process of developing your lifestyle. Developing your social skills. And in my opinion it's really important to get in contact with something that gives you a strong emotional trigger. A strong juice. And if the first thing that gets you moving is the idea you're going to go out there and you're going to meet some girls and you're going to get yourself a nice hot lover or a nice hot girlfriend that's great. As long as that gets you moving that is a very inspiring and powerful thing to get into contact with that can help you move forward in your life. Sometimes you might have a bigger thing than that too though. For example one thing that drove me for years and years in this whole process and search for you know learning about life was always this idea of what is it to be the complete package. What is it to be my version of a renaissance man. And that drove me to look into many different subjects over the years. You know from physical health and well-being and you know things like martial arts and weightlifting and supplementation to spiritual development. Buddhism, Taoism, all kinds of different Eastern thought, Western thought, magic, shamanism. And then also looking into things like what is it to be a psychologically well put together person with a balanced psyche. So that led me into things like neurolinguistics and positive psychology and energetic psychology and putting all these pieces together. And of course I've always been very driven by the desire to have a wonderful romantic adventurous love life which has led me on many great adventures with with women and relationships and deep inside the journey of sexuality and Tantra and BDSM and a whole world of stuff that is very interesting to you know me as a human being. Now I didn't learn all that at once so that's an important thing to realize. I had to start somewhere and the first thing I had to get into contact with is what's important to me now. What do I really want to work on right now. So what's important is really one of the biggest drivers in our lives because that's what defines where we're going to put our focus. What are we going to align our resources towards? What are you going to put your energy and mental focus and emotions and actions into? So think about what's the overarching story that you would love to create for yourself? Who do you want to become? What kind of human being would you like to be? What kinds of experiences would you like to create for yourself? What's your real vision that inspires you? And yes you can take from the world around you. It's good to look at mentors and people that you admire or movie characters or anything really that connects you to your imagination that can help you to start to create a kind of a sense of what that would be. But I would also warn in some senses that it's important for you to define what's important for you as well. So don't just follow blindly what other people tell you to do or what you what you feel is the good thing to do because you want to impress other people. Take the time to really think about like what's going to really satisfy you in the long run. Because one of the big key things that you're going to start to realize as you get better and better at creating the kinds of things that you want in life is when you really commit to something and it becomes real then that's something you're going to have to deal with. So the question you've got to ask yourself is the decisions that you make today might well be and probably will be the life that you wake up in in six months or a year or two or three years. So be clear about what you really want and why that's really important to you. So that's the first thing to do. The next thing that's kind of obvious but it's also very important is to start to raise your energy levels in any way that you can. Now why do we do this? Well because energy is fuel. Energy is your the substance if you will. It's the it's the power that you can use to be able to do everything. If you don't have very much energy it makes it very difficult to do you know goals or actions or anything. So listen to good music that gets you pumped up. Move your body. Get fit. Start to do some high-intensity exercise or dance or anything that gets you moving. Stretch. Feel good inside your body and also start to learn about things like optimal health and supplementation. Now you can get away with this when you're young for a little while like usually when you're in your 20s it's not such a big deal to treat your body like crap or poison yourself in some ways or party too hard and you know I get it I've been through that phase I know what it's like but I can also say that really getting your nutrition and your supplements right can make a huge difference in in what's possible for you and also can set you up for much much much more health and well-being into your future that's going to really change everything basically. So it's one of those defining factors is learning to raise your energy and manage your energy in an effective kind of way. Now I'm going to go into some more specifics and I want to really talk about how we can break this process down into some really key steps. So the next thing I want you guys to bring to mind is that you can only really make change here and now. Now the mind has an amazing ability to get caught up in the future and the past and it's actually one of our greatest human skills. You could say that one of the things that really defines a human beings as opposed to you know animals and other species is that we have the ability to zoom off into the future and create things, to think about plans and ideas and things that we want but also things that we don't want. We tend to like to worry about the future a lot and we also go back into the past and we worry about the past a lot too, thinking about things that have happened and then using that as information and references to move forward into the future. Now that's a pretty cool skill but it can be a very limiting thing if it tends to hold us back from believing in ourselves or from being able to actually make changes where we need to. So recognize that change is going to happen here and now. So to do that we need to break out of the trance, we need to get out of our habit patterns of living in the past and the future and this is really a massive key and it's something that like overarchingly is something that you do a lot of when it comes to becoming a more powerful and effective person because our tendency to go into trance actually happens all the time. We're going in and out of trances hundreds if not thousands of times a day and our ability to stay neutrally balanced in an aware state where we have choice and also in our ability to use positive trances as opposed to not so resourceful trances is a big key to living a happy life as opposed to a limiting life. So get back into your body and this is one of the biggest things that I teach guys a lot. It's one of the things that we have as a major theme on all of our workshops is getting back into your body because embodiment is also where you operate from. Like here and now in your body is what you've got to work with. This is your vehicle, your mind, your perception, your body, your physicality, your presence, your awareness. This is what you've got to work with. So get back here and start to relax into the body, start to breathe, start to feel what it's like to be embodied. Some people will more naturally be able to do this especially if you do a lot of physical things but if you're not used to this then recognize it's going to take a bit of time to get comfortable in doing that and set that as one of your goals because it will really help you a lot to be much more effective at all kinds of transformations inside your life. Because the real place the change happens obviously is inside the body but it happens because we can feel ourselves, we can sense what's going on. So the more clearly you can sense what's happening within the vehicle of your body, within the instrument of your perception, your artistry of life if you will, the more accurately you can sense what's going on, like what you're thinking, what you're feeling, how it's relating to you, then the more clearly you can start to navigate and create what you want at more of an unconscious and then obviously physical level on a conscious level. So massive key to work with right there. Next important point is to take responsibility for yourself. Now that's a big thing in some ways too because what is yourself? That's a whole rabbit hole that you can really get into and something that I recommend you do look at. Do some self-inquiry, start to work out who are you, what is this thing called a self? But even just on a basic level, recognize that your thoughts, your decisions, your feelings, your actions are predominantly under the domain of your control. And the reason it's good to believe that is because when you do believe that, then it gives you more freedom and more power to be able to actually do something in your life, to create the things you really want. So internalize responsibility into yourself as much as possible when it comes to being able to create changes and choices. This can help to counteract a tendency that a lot of people have which is more of a victim mentality or more of a kind of just going with the flow and allowing life to happen to them kind of mentality. And if you want to be more of a creator, then it's very important to counteract that, to have more of this understanding of that it's you, you are a co-creator, your heart has power, your choice, your will has power. And we're going to unpack that further as we go, but that's a really big key piece is to learn to have responsibility over yourself and a part of that is to build trust in yourself. How that practically works in terms of like things like seduction and building the lifestyle that you want is that you have to learn to work with what you've got and you have to learn to believe that what you've got is good enough. And that's the truth because I mean you some things you can change and some things you can't change. You can't really change your physical body that much for example, like you can't change your face, but one thing is you work with what you've got and you start to develop from that place and you can make the most out of it. So sometimes you can turn things that are limitations or issues into features and strengths or you can turn parts of your life that are not exactly the way you want them to be into projects, things that you're working on to develop, to grow, to become what it is that you would really love them to be. So take responsibility, work with what you got and that also comes down to a very kind of side principle, an important side principle which is be honest with yourself. So I see this a lot with guys when we go out and we practice approaching and we're teaching guys in field is that they need to get honest with themselves about believing in themselves and also get honest with themselves about what they really want so they don't have a lot of conflict and I'm going to talk about how you can clear that up as well as we go to the next level. But the next point that I also want to lead on from the self-responsibility is to recognize that you have the ability to program yourself. Now this is also something that is a big world to explore. Self-programming, understanding the mind, understanding beliefs, understanding how do you create the trance of yourself and the experience and the actions that you take in your life on a daily basis. Now this idea of being able to influence yourself, to be able to create the changes that you wish inside yourself from an internal level is a massive key to things like in a game, it's a massive key to success in general. It's also a massive key to how to manipulate and influence other people. This is how we end up buying things. This is how we end up getting influenced by society and people around us because there is influence happening to our unconscious, influence happening to our awareness. So how do you take control of that? Well, start to realize you have this amazing thing called an imagination. And imagination is often associated with something that kids do and it doesn't have value. But the truth is that you can use your imagination to re-imagine your life, to re-imagine experiences, to change the meanings on things, to change the way that you relate to yourself and others. And the more that you actively practice building reference experiences inside your imagination that relate to your life in a positive way, the more that you'll start to create a life that is in alignment with those kinds of references. Now what does that mean in other terms? Well, it means visualize. It means sense. It means practice with your imagination what you wish to become. See yourself as that. Feel yourself as that. Practice it on a consistent basis. And the more that you do that, the more that you will tend to show up as that. Also, there is a very magical thing that starts to happen as well because as you believe yourself to be something, as you practice being it and operating in the world as that, people will start to treat you as that. So if you want to be more confident, if you want to have more influence, if you want to trust yourself more, if you want to be able to create the things that you really want to create in your life, well, start right now. Start to believe it. Start to practice it. Start to imagine it. Start to use as many little tools and experiences and opportunities as you can to reinforce that. And I will guarantee you that you will look back in months, you know, probably not even that much, maybe even weeks and realize that momentum has really started to pick up as your imagination and as your sense of self starts to align. And what we could say is coagulate or identify with that kind of change inside your life. Now, this is the positive power of having a mind that can create trances. This is the positive side of being able to identify. So if you're going to identify with something, if you're going to let your mind create something, make it something quality. Make it about the future and the experience and the kind of world that you would love to live in. And I would also recommend on that note, as you are taking responsibility for yourself and learning to use your imagination to create the things that you want, that you align those things with the benefit of others around you. Now, why do we do this? Because if you want to get things from the world, the most effective way to do it is to help other people get what they need along the way and to do it in a way that makes you feel good so that other people feel good as well. So it's like a win-win situation. And in my opinion, it's the ultimate currency. It's certainly a remedy for getting out of this kind of more competitive, struggling, negative mindset that the world is often caught up in. And a lot of people get very stuck in in their lifestyle. So definitely seek to break away from that. Be somebody that's a contributor, a creator, somebody that is giving something to the world that has meaning, that has service, that is useful as best as you can. And if you can't do that straight away, totally okay. Just work out what you could do in future and look for opportunities where you can do that. So there's your next two really powerful pieces is make sure you take responsibility for yourself and make sure that you're able to govern your own imagination to direct what it is that you're doing. Now, I go into a lot of depth about this in things like in my sessions, when I do coaching with people and trainings, when people come and do workshops with me and the natural lifestyles. We very much have a big focus on how much the internal attitude and internal perception of yourself creates the whole relationship that is going on from this point into the future. So I want to leave you with that for this particular video. There's going to be more of these coming soon. And in the meantime, remember what I've told you, practice taking responsibility for yourself, being present in your body, trusting yourself and learning to come from a place of connecting with what you really desire for the right reasons, for the benefit of others around you, for the benefit of the real vision that you want to create for yourself, because what else are we here for?
