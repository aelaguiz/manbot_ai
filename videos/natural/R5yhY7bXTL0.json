It's like an online business. Oh, okay. Yeah, my father is into that. Well, that does encompass many things, right? Like online business could be pornography, it could be selling Hello Kitty dolls. Could be almost anything. It could be selling murder for hire. Like, there's a lot of things you can do on the internet. So, definitely not murder for hire. Hi, how you going? You good? Yeah, sure. Yeah, I'm very good actually. Great. Yeah, what's the plan? I'm going to a company right now. To a company? Yeah, I don't know. Actually, that's kind of dumb. But I'm not really sure. You're not really sure? It's my first time. You're not really sure what you're doing? What do you mean your first time here? My first time there. It sounds like a conspiracy. You're like, I'm going to a company. Oh, which company? Exactly, which company. For what reason? Yeah. Yeah, okay. Do you know why you're going there? Or did someone just like, put a note under your door? No. A job interview. Oh, a job interview or something. Yeah. Okay, can I walk with you for a minute? Sure, if you want so. Do you have maybe a lighter? Yeah, no I don't actually. But they do. Let's ask them. Excuse me. Can I have your lighter for one second? I had a COVID test. I'm very safe. Thank you. Nice. Thank you. Yeah. So what do you do here actually? It's a long story. I do live here, sort of. I live here in Portugal and other places. But right now, because the country is locked, I'm here. Oh, yeah. And I have like an online business and I actually have an olive farm in Portugal. What kind of business? It's like an online business. Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah, my father is into that. Well, that does encompass many things, right? Like online business could be pornography. It could be selling Hello Kitty dolls. It could be almost anything. It could be selling murder for hire. Like there's a lot of things you can do on the internet. And you? Definitely not murder for hire. Definitely not sex trafficking. Of course not. Absolutely not. I would never. Why would I do that? Why would I do that? Not very profitable. Yeah. I'm like a life coach. Oh, that's great. What kind of? Just a general? No, specifically for like high profile men who are very successful in business but really shit with people. Oh, yeah. Especially with shitty people, right? Shit with shitty people? Well, I don't know. I kind of have an attitude that I don't think humans are inherently good, but they have the capacity for all things. And I tend to think that people reflect back what you put out or not always. They are malicious people. I try to treat the world like it's my living room and then people tend to treat me very well. That's great actually. Yeah. So in here what do you do? I'm on a break. I'm chilling for the moment. I've got a lot of friends here. Like there's a bunch of us Australians and expats that we kind of have a crew here. And right now we're just sort of killing time and working on some new projects. You mean you? My multiple personalities. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's like Fight Club where I talk to myself. Oh, cool. Yeah. I love that. I watched it again for the first time in 20 years because I watched it back in 1998 or whatever when it came out. And I just watched it the other night. It still stands up. It's still good. Yeah, so and now where do you go exactly? You mean right now? Yeah. You just have time and... Yeah, I saw you look interesting. I mean I was going home. I live down... I live here close. So now I'm just walking to you for a minute. Whereabouts are you going to go? Oh, it's pretty close now. I have to go to the right. Yeah. In the next seconds you'll explode to the right. Are you prepared? Are you ready? Do you have your game face? Yeah. What if they say, where do you see yourself in five years? What? I mean it's an interview of some sort. Oh, not exactly. It's for a statistic in films. What? Sorry, what do you mean? In movies. Hang on, just stop for a second. Because I don't want to keep running. What do you mean a statistic in what? In movies. You know, extras and so on. Oh, yes, I understand. Very right. So that kind of thing. That's just a... I don't know. Casting call or something like this. Yeah, but I actually have to be there. Okay, cool. Do you want to hang out sometime? Do you want to hang out sometime? Oh, sure. Just get your... What's your name? Evelyn. Evelyn, I'm James. Oh, nice to meet you. Yeah, you too. All right, WhatsApp. Is that a thing? You use that? All right, you put it in quick. Hurry up, Evelyn, you're late. Plus three six. Yeah. Oops. Okay. You sure? All right, I'm James. Remember me. Good luck. See you. So the thing to notice with that interaction was I didn't open her. I didn't go over and say, hey, I saw you. I pre-framed. I do an open or whatever, like I might do on some other times. I just started talking. I think I just said, hey, what's going on? How are you? And she's like, fine. And then I said, what's the plan? It was like we already knew each other. Hi. How you going? You good? Yeah, I'm very good, actually. Yeah. Yeah. What's the plan? And as a result, we just, because my frame was so like, this is normal to do. This is chill. And she was a chill girl. She was like a cool girl. We just rolled into a conversation. And you notice that we never exchanged names until actually I'd already asked her out. Do you want to hang out sometime? Oh, sure. Just get you in. What's your name? Evelyn. Evelyn, I'm James. Because it just felt so seamless and natural. And we are actually, I was, you can probably see on the camera that there was a little bit of touch there. We were bumping into each other. So there was like nice attraction straight away because it felt so easy. And she was pretty confident and chill. And she was just like, all right, this dude's confident and chill. So it rolled on pretty naturally. So that's all. Keep it in mind. Hi. How are you? Good, thank you. Excellent. Excellent. You're so adorable. You have such a nice groove. You must be listening to something funky. Kind of. I don't know. Pretty Boy Floyd. Okay. Of what, I don't know that. Of what genre is that? Kind of rock, modern, I think, I guess. Okay. What the hell is this one? You just coming from university or something? Oh, high school. High school, well, I'm going to my dorm to get some stuff done. Does that mean you're from another city and you lived here? No, I'm from another country. Oh, you're from another country. All right. Well, so am I. I didn't notice. Oh, really? Well, let's have one guess each. Oh, you're good. Australian. You're like Swedish? No. No. All right. Well, I fail. Tell me. Serbia. Oh, of course. That's why you're confident. I fucking love Serbs. Yes. I mean, not all aspects of Serbia, but I used to spend a lot of time there. Yes. Like, where are you going right now? Can we stop for a minute? We can talk for a second. Name? Borislava. What's up? I'm James. Nice to meet you. Yeah, I fucking love Belgrade. I spent a lot of time there. It's so nuts. Because it's that beautiful mix of like, Serbs are kind of, well, I'll tell you, but you tell me what you think. Like, extremely confident and fun-loving. Like, kind of a mixture of Russians and Italians. Yeah, I think that's a good spot. Yeah, because the Russians are all hard and the Italians are too emotional. Yeah, so loud. Yes, and the Serbs are just this cool blend. Yeah, I guess we are somewhere between the Mediterranean and... The Slavs. Yeah. Yeah, nice. True Slavic. And what are you like, though? What are you like as a person? Would you describe yourself as? I don't know. I really don't. I guess somewhere in between. Yeah, but I just mean in general. Like, are you, I don't know, like, what do you like doing? Do you read? Do you party? Do you... I'm very young, I guess. You don't? I'm autistic, so... Oh, good. Me too, yeah. Okay, I like that. I would say me too. Drawing, painting, photography, music and stuff. Excellent. What do you like? All those things, yeah. I was a musician for a long time and... What did you play? Trumpet, flute, and I was a singer. Yeah, back in the day I had a band in Australia for quite a long time. And, yeah, I write, I read, I travel a lot to learn from different teachers. So, like, for example, I'll go to Argentina to learn tango or to Amazon jungle to learn shamanism. So, listen, I'm much older than you. Yeah, I know. Yes. But I still think you're really attractive. Do you like older men like me? Of course, I have a boyfriend. Oh, you do? Yeah. Awesome. Okay, good. Well, you've been lovely to talk to, so see you later. And you're in luck. I am 18. I do look very angry. Oh, okay. Well, in that case, can I get your Instagram in case one day we... Sure. You know, who knows what's going to happen. Oh, 18 is fine. Maybe you add me because mine's private. Sure. That's right. So, are you the first one? That's me. Let me just add you. Cool, and I'll add you. Okay, gotcha. All right, well, I hope to see you again one day. Bye. Excuse me. Hi. How are you doing? I nearly got run over because of you. Wow. Yeah, walk with me for a minute. Yes, I just saw you and I thought you look so sexy today. And then someone nearly hit me. So, yeah. Ta-da. What's your name? Tunda. Tunda. I'm James. And what's the plan? What are you doing today? Are you in your own dream world? Yeah. Is that because you've been partying or you're just like someone in your own space? Which one? Do you not understand me? Only a little bit. Okay, I'm not going to follow you anywhere. I'm just walking to the end of the street. Okay. Is that cool? All right, nice. What are you listening to? Rihanna. Rihanna? New Rihanna or old Rihanna? Old. Oh, the classics. Lovely. And are you a shy person? No. No. Okay, good. I see. I see in your eyes. You're a little bit cheeky. Well, I'm from Australia and currently I live here because of the lockdown and I have lots of free time and so I'm just enjoying myself. Do you like older men? Yes, I can see you do. Good. Would you like to hang out sometime? Because I have to go now. I know I'm a complete stranger, but we could get a cup of tea in public and then see if we like each other. What do you think? Swap Instagrams and see what happens? Okay? Twinder. Relax. Because this is a common name, right? In Hungary. Yeah. Okay, add me later, okay? Okay. All right. See you. Hi, how are you? Oh, sorry. I'm talking with my mum. Oh, say hi, mum. How are you? Can you call her back? No, I can't. All right. Bye. Just tell her the truth. Mum blocked. Excuse me. Excuse me. Hi. How are you? I'm just going to talk to you while you walk down the stairs. It's getting more awkward for me. Now I'm just a man talking to empty stairs. That's the kind of thing I do. And this is how you can imagine me like in six years from now. I owe you going out there. Oh, I know that's why. The government did it. It's all a conspiracy. Hello? Are you okay? Oh. It's all right. Don't worry. It'll be over in ten years. Excuse me. Hello. Are you okay? Yeah. Oh, cool. Do you mind if I sit with you for a second? Yeah, of course. Okay, cool. You were just frowning, so I wasn't sure if you were having a bad day or not. No, I'm okay. I'm waiting for my friends. Okay. Nice. Nice. And what's your name? Nora. Say it again without the look. Nora. That's better. You're like, Nora. Well, I'm James. I'm just a nice Australian stranger. Oh. Are you serious? No. I live here. You can't really be a tourist right now. You're not allowed to come in. Yeah. Although I have friends from America who came in through Serbia. So they flew in to Belgrade, then went to Vienna, then caught the train from Budapest and then bribed the border guards. So it is possible if you really want to come here. Yeah. And what are you? I'm living here. I'm studying. I'm working. No, thank you. I have already. But you're not from here? No. I'm coming from the countryside. From Liron village, yeah. But... A few years ago I moved here. So... Do you feel like you're more of a country person or a city person? Both. Mixed. Yeah. Me too. I prefer the countryside sometimes. Yeah. Yeah, my life is pretty crazy. I travel a lot and always in big cities. But last year I bought a farm in Portugal. And so now I spend a lot of time out there gardening and growing olives. And I have peacocks. And what are you working here? I have an online business so I can work wherever I want. And why Budapest? Originally I came here 8 years ago. My grandmother was Hungarian. I wanted to check it out. I like it. It's central. It's not too big, not too small. Like to be honest... Yeah, to be honest the Hungarians are a little bit... In general a bit closed, grumpy people I find. No offense. I understand why. But they're also... Once you get below the surface they're pretty honest and funny. I like it here. I don't want to stay here all the time. But I like being here. And do you like knowing people? Just going around in the back and sitting everywhere? Not everywhere. I used to be really shy actually, believe it or not. And some time ago... You're like, no you didn't. I did. I just decided that shyness is a disease. And it stops you from connecting to people. And now I have the attitude that the world is my garden. And so I like to just... If I feel like it. Sometimes I'm really in my own space. But if I feel like it and I see someone I want to talk to then I will. Do you do that? I never did. Because you're worried they might be mean to you? Yeah. Sometimes they are mean but it's worth it. Because sometimes they're not. Usually when you come in with a nice image it's hard for people to reject it. I've seen that. Because it's like people become a mirror to you. I mean not always. Sometimes they tell you to get the fuck out of here. You have a really cool style actually. It's minimal but it's a bit New York minimal. I like your shoes. Yeah I just got them and they're already dirty. You can never keep white shoes clean can you? One day and it's already there. And what are you doing? How do you spend your time? You said you're studying and working. You must be quite busy. When I have time for example. Reading. All the time. Going everywhere. Running. So you're a wholesome... Do you know this word? Wholesome? It means healthy in mind and body in some ways. Yeah. Not necessarily all about sport. I'm not a fanatic one. I'm just doing it because I enjoy it. Not because I want to lose weight. I just enjoy it. That means you will always do it actually. I think when people do something because they force themselves. They always give up. And it becomes part of their personality. My story is that I lost a lot of weight. Years ago you never imagined how I was before. So I transformed. I have a transformation. Oh wow. That must be interesting. Because I always have been exactly the same size my entire life. No matter what I do. I mean I do exercise. But if I eat or not. This is my story and I work really hard for this. But now I'm happy. Before you were unhealthy because you were unhappy. Yeah. And habits. I was happy. I was just totally on different thinking. I was totally unhappy before that. Totally unhappy? Yeah. Sorry I have to read these messages. Because I'm waiting for these friends. Okay sure. Well I'll let you go. Would you like to go for a tea sometime? You seem very lovely. I know I'm a stranger. But you can tell I'm not dangerous right? Do you have some Instagram? Yes I have everything. What's the best way to talk to you? Maybe Instagram. Really? I mean I will. But you will reply or you're just going to look at my photos? No. Life is quite weird when you look at my Instagram. It is very weird. Add me because I'm on private. Sorry your name again was? Nori. Did we say names? I can't remember. I'm James. I'll add you. Do you live in town? No. Not exactly. In the centre. I'm like near the bridge. It's nice. Yeah it's very nice. Are you private or not? No. You're an open book. No. I think the private life is a happy life. So I'm just careful about this. You will see. I like it because I like to create. I like taking good pictures. Yes I see. It's very nicely put together. And I like to travel. Me too. I dare you to try and figure out who the hell I am from that. You'll be very confused. Because it's lots of different messages. Nori. Really nice to meet you. Me too. I'll explain everything over coffee. See you soon. Alright so that was two hours in the field. We probably gave you most of the interactions. Today I was on fire. Let's be honest. I've been hitting some new levels lately. I'm not exactly sure why. But I think the main takeaway from this video should be whatever I said in those interactions some of them were smart and fun things and some cool stuff that I said but for the most part the reason why I was going from success to success I didn't get blown out a single time here. Maybe that last one who didn't look at me. There were girls who didn't want to talk or had to go or on the phone to their mom or something but I never got a sense of any of those harsh blowouts with the girl telling you to go away or wincing and cringing. Because my energy today and in general at the moment is really giving. It's really inclusive. Hello madam. How are you? You're so cute. She smiled. Even the doggy likes me. I'm really coming from this space of there's no separation between me and the outside world. Of course there is but it's minimized. These armors that we put up between ourselves. This sense of difference from everyone else from your environment. This fucking skull thinking and overthinking is never going to be conducive to connecting to people. What is conducive is holding space looking them in their eyes, seeing them as a human emptying yourself and allowing your ego to get buffeted around and slapped around and have fun with it. And as I said to that girl earlier to treat the world like it's your garden or it's your lounge room because then the world starts to reflect that back to you and girls want to spend time with a guy that feels at ease with himself. They don't want to spend time with a guy that spits mad game that says all the best things or has all the most ornate or complicated strategies. That's not what seduces a woman. What seduces her is that she feels good in your presence. If we have to boil it down to anything not just pleasant, not just nice but she feels a flush of good feelings she feels comfortable with you. She feels that you know her in some way that you see her, that you're not a threat but you're also not some pushover. These are the nuances, these are the subtleties that you learn over time as you really start to investigate natural seduction. It's not, hey I saw you from over there I wanted to come over here and say that you're beautiful. It's just a thing that sometimes comes out and makes logical sense but it's the delivery it's the person that's projecting that. It's the way you're responding and reading her signals that actually makes it work. If you want to learn this come and join me in this city Budapest in a few weeks time. I'm doing one more workshop. I've only done one this year because fucking you know why and I'm in the middle of it now. When this video comes out it'll be over but it's been awesome. The streets are alive. People are just going around living their lives and the girls are horny actually because there's no tourists here trying to pick them up. So we're doing one more workshop. I can't remember the dates. It's soon. That's all I'll be doing for the year and then I'm going off on some adventures because even though the world thinks that it's locked down there are ways to move around in cracks and I'm not going to stop being James Marshall just because the world stopped being the world. I'm going to keep adventuring but for soon I'll be here teaching a select group, small group of men for seven full days around the bloody clock, well not really eight hours a day in a game lots of infield, role playing classes learning how to touch, how to flirt how to get this vibe, how to project intent how to build a lifestyle how to be kick ass in bed and all the other amazing shit that you don't see on YouTube you only get when you come to us live Click the link below for more info and I'm going to go and start texting girls because I've got a whole bunch of dates to learn. Alright, see ya Outro Music"}
