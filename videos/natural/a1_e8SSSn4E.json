Who's feeling powerful? Who's feeling sexy? Who's got a sense, a niggling sense of self-doubt? Yeah! Who at the back of their mind thinks this weekend has been fucking great? Yeah? But when I go home, I'll be alone, and then maybe it won't work for me. Maybe there's a mixture of all those things. Is that also happening? Yeah, which can be kind of confusing, right? You're like, fuck yeah, I don't know. I got this, I don't got this. It would be understandable to assume that people who are successful, people who are confident, people who've made it, people who are bosses, always feel certain, or for the majority of the time, that they have a deep sense of certainty, of destiny, right? There's this pathway that's almost laid out for them by the stars, or by the gods, or by fate, that is driving them towards the inevitable goal, the inevitable actualization, their inevitable triumph. And I think when you... I know for myself, when I was a young dude looking at people who had made it, that was the assumption that I made, OK? They look the part, OK? They seem to be presenting themselves from complete confidence, complete understanding of their role, that everything is going to work, and even if they had to go through difficult trials and tribulations, even if they had to collect skills and resources and build themselves up, that they always had a sense that this was going to work. Has anyone ever thought that kind of thing? Yeah? Well, I'm here to tell you that in my experience, from my own personal journey of being a person that was not successful, to being one that is now a scientist of successfulness, and I'm somebody who studies the art and the processes of success to institute into my life primarily, because this is the one I got and so I may as well make it good, and then to present that out to the world and help people to do this, that that was not the case. For me and for every person that I know that has now achieved greatness or is living an exceptional life, that they never had this sense of like, I got this, right from the beginning. It's all good. No matter what comes my way, yeah, I can deal with a bit of that or a bit of that, I can deal with this battle or this woman or this government agency or whatever it is that I need to move through, I got this. This was not the case in my life or the people that I know that have had exceptional lives. In fact, quite the opposite. Having a deep sense of doubt about yourself, I think is more closely aligned in characteristics to people that actually achieve greatness. That has been the thing that has been the shadow side of my entire journey has been that other self, that voice. In the background or at the forefront, depending on what was going on, how well I was riding the situation, that was saying things like, you can't do this. I'm not enough. And like the most terrifying one, I don't know what to do. I don't know how to do this. I can't do this. That's been with me the whole time. And when I look back over the major points in my life where things jumped up a level, where I had a breakthrough, just preceding that was the most intense times of doubt. The first time that I got my little band together in Canberra, ACT. Who's the other guy that's from the ACT here? Woo! Generally, we like to keep that quiet. The first time I got up on stage and played the flute to an audience at the Gypsy bar it was in 1998, I was terrified. Fucking terrified. I had no idea if I'd be able to remember the songs and get through the thing. And it was a bit of a schmuzzle and the saxophone player missed his cue and we had this huge Hammond organ, like a 1960-something Hammond organ that we dragged down. These things weigh hundreds of kilos. Dragged it down the stairs of this bar and then we just couldn't get it up on the stage, so we just had to leave it. So it just got halfway down and then just stayed there. And so the music was missing bits where the Hammond was supposed to be playing and then there was just the drum kit going. And John was on bass at that time actually and he wasn't a great bass player. He's a great ukulele player, not such a great bass player in 1998. And it was a bit of a schmuzzle, but I got through it and I was like, fuck, being on stage, that's a thing, that was cool. And a couple of the chicks looked at me as well, so maybe you'll work on that. Maybe you'll get laid out of this eventually. I'll talk a bit about how being a musician doesn't get you laid as much as you would think later. Moving through to my first adventures overseas. When I was 18 and I finished school, myself and again John went on another adventure where instead of going to university like we were supposed to do, we decided to take some time off and travel around Asia. And he and I went out to the desert of Australia where they had irrigated a portion of the desert and grown an orange farm, which was a really bizarre scene. You've just got this red dust and then an orange orchard and then dust. So we went out there with the salt of the earth, these old fruit pickers who are just running from the law, running from their ex-misses or whatever out there, picking their life away, and picked fruit to try and save up money to go on this obscene adventure, like at 18 years old, to try and go to India. And this was well before the internet, we didn't really know anything about it, we had a little guidebook. And I remember us arriving at the airport in Delhi and just stepping out into the heat and the insanity of India and just feeling this absolute terror, like, fuck, this is insane. No one can save us here. I don't know what I'm doing and instantly hordes of guys start coming up and ripping you off in very creative ways with a big smile on their face. And we just got shredded through India in all sorts of fantastical journeys. I ended up getting kidnapped by Rajasthani jewel smugglers and that was so good that I didn't even know that I was kidnapped until the end. That's a whole other story. But what they did is, I can't tell you the whole story, it's a cool story, but no, it's just not that relevant. Everyone's like, tell us. I'm like, yeah, but you won't learn anything. You'll just be like, and he told us that thing and then he got kidnapped. What they did do is they called my father and said, Mr. Marshall, we have your son. We would like 50,000 US dollars deposited into this account or you'll never see him again. Have a nice day. Yeah, he did that. He didn't tell me about that for years. Anyway, the breakthroughs that I had whilst travelling in India were ones that totally blew me open. It crushed me, ripped me apart, that country at that time, being so unprepared, so naive, but being thrown out into the midst of that, not knowing what to do each day, how to navigate this bizarre country, was something that gave me a resilience. When I came back to Australia, I was like, this is pretty easy here, isn't it? I can get through this. And with women, oh, with women. I'm a great seducer. I'm really good at this. And I was really shit at this back in the day. And the day was long, the back in the day bit. That was a long bit. I didn't get good by preparing, by sitting in my room and studying and practising the lines and visualising me in front of the girl and getting a VR simulation and getting things perfectly right before I went out there and met the girl. Although that will be the case pretty soon. Maybe I'll be irrelevant soon, because you can just download the VR version of me. Oh no, that's a terrible thought. What will I do next? I have no idea what I would do next. Anyway, at the time, the big progress that I went through involved so many points where I stepped in front of a woman that I had no idea how to handle that situation. When I look back over my seduction career or the points where I made the breakthroughs, it was not the ones, as I was saying yesterday or weeks ago, whenever that was when we were here. Time has distorted strangely, hasn't it? How many days have we been in this room? It was not the seductions that went perfectly and smoothly where I clicked everything into place and said the right thing at the right time and touched her just so, and she went, and I was like, yep, that's my move. Those were not the times when I learnt very much. One of the great breakthrough seductions that I had was when I met Irina, the Russian, when I was totally broke, feeling awful about myself. I didn't know what I was doing in my life. I don't think I'd showered that day. I just sort of rocked up, because you had to go into the unemployment office every two weeks and present your case of why they continue to give you free money. Thank you, Australia. What you'd do is just open the phone book and write down a number of pizza shops that you said you'd applied for jobs for, which you definitely didn't, and then go in and stand in line like a loser and just like to know, you're like, yep, this is the price for this free cash is to just go, all right, I sure am a loser right now in my life, and then get to the front of the queue and give the form and the lady just goes, fucking scum, get the fuck out of here. That was the scenario and the feeling and my real experience at that time. In terms of value, everyone's very concerned about what their value is. Am I high value or low value? I need to communicate my value to the girl. In societal terms and in my self-esteem, I had more or less no value at that time. Who's had situations or maybe feels like that now or recently where they feel like I'm not valuable enough, I don't have a high enough value on the value scale? Go on, everyone, come on. Nobody feels like they're the most valuable man on the planet. They're like, it's all mine. The world is mine. I'm Scarface. Before everything started going bad. It's funny how rappers love that movie and the whole gangster culture. Remember what happened at the end with Scarface? It didn't work so well. My big breakthrough with that kind of thing, because I have been battling with that all my life as well, trying to understand what it means to be valuable, to have right value, to see where I exist in a hierarchy, is to gradually, over time, come to understand that I am a valuable human being. I have inherent value. And that's not from just standing here and going, okay, I do nothing for my life and I'm awesome. Of course, that's a progression. And I'll be talking about this later in this speech when we start looking at the first pillar of seductive success, which is inner gain. It's a development. It's a process. But at some point, or multiple points, in varying degrees, you need to come to terms with the fact that you're a valuable human. And at some point, you're going to have to accept the cold, hard truth that some women will like you. I know. I know. It's not an easy thing to even get your head around sometimes. But at some point, you're going to have to accept that. Especially when she's giving her phone number. Especially when she's kissing you. And especially when she's sucking your dick. You're just going to have to accept it. That she wants to be there. And so many of us battle against that. Even in the face of great evidence to the contrary. We do have inherent value. Of course, we can develop that and we can develop things that make us more valuable in the eyes of the world. We can put on all sorts of shiny costumes and get cool cars and get accolades in the external world that make people think that we're awesome. And that stuff's not bad to do, I don't think. It's an interesting thing to investigate the planet and see what effect you can have on it. See how you can move from will, intent, and project that out into the world and manifest stuff. That's amazing that we can do that. But of course, so many people get lost in that. That just what I can manifest, all the shiny things I can manifest, is my value. At that point, when I saw Irina, she never told me her last name, ever, walk out of that unemployment office and I went, that's the most devastatingly beautiful woman I've ever seen in my life. I fucking got it. And I just started on the seduction thing, I'd been cold approaching for a little bit, a few months maybe at that point. And I was just there thinking to myself, fuck, I can't, she's too, wait, wait, I'm not ready for that. And look at me, look at me. I was wearing this Afghan coat that I bought in Kashmir. And it was this ragged kind of wizard's gown that when I bought it in India, I thought it made me look kind of spiritual and cool. And then when I got back to Australia and started wearing it around and people like sort of threw coins at me and stuff, I realized that it wasn't actually that appropriate in this environment. But that was my coat, and I had my kung fu shoes on, my ripped jeans and a stained T-shirt, and just feeling shit. And then I just went, are you a fucking bullshit artist, or are you a pick-up artist? Because back then being a pick-up artist was what I wanted to be. And I went, I'm a pick-up artist. Funny boy. And then I ran down the street and I jumped in front of her badly. I didn't do the right stop, I got sort of half, and went, hey, I saw you back there, and I know that's bad, that's bad. But anyway, and she's just going, just reeling in horror and just giving all of the Russian looks of absolute disgust. But she didn't walk away, she just gave me all the looks. Anyway, look, can I... And I even took a deep breath, and I'll just meditate. And she's still going, what the fuck? Can I walk with you for a minute? I'm busy. I'm at university. Yes. Yes. I know. I can see you're busy. Can I walk with you for a minute, please? Okay. And so we began. For the next several years, that was the greatest seduction that I ever did. And it did take me. It was a complicated seduction. It's written all about in my book. I learned a huge degree from that girl and that situation and that time period when I was living in a sense of unworthiness. When I was a young guy trying to figure my shit out, which is a time when you just don't know what that shit is. It's just the curse and the amazingness of being a young guy trying to figure your life out. And it takes us much longer typically than women to figure out what your purpose is. And our peak is different. I used to think, oh, your peak is because I was like rock stars die at 27. So that means your peak is like the year before that. That's and you know, in 21 is like when you're the hottest and youngest or whatever. Like I thought that was the peak for a man. And as I was reaching that, and then I got past that, I'm like, fuck, I'm done. It's all downhill from here. Yeah. I'm 20. And as I turned 28, I'm just like, all right, I'm an old man now. Now I recognize and I understand that the peak is way later and can go on for a long, long time. That beautiful sunset can stretch for decades if you do it right. And I'm in it now. Now it's definitely peaking. But those all of those formative years, all of that struggle and doubt and trying to figure shit out. That was what led me to this point here. And all along the way was that shadow self going, no, no, no. Don't do that. Don't do it. Yeah. All right. And well, okay, you did that one. But the next one, that's certainly not going to work either. So I want you guys to be aware that because this is not this, this, I don't think this is the experience for everybody. I do think that there are plenty of people who don't live without who live without too much doubt in what they're doing and in themselves. Typically those people are not living exceptional lives. This is a time in history where you can more or less retreat from the world. You can create a fairly safe capsule or a small series of places that you maneuver through. Even in an insanely huge metropolis, you can live in a little toy town village if you want to. There were many times in history where you couldn't do that. You walked outside of your mud hut and it was on, right? It was raw. You had to put that doubt, you know, the doubt, the fear was not just like, am I good enough? It's like, am I going to survive this day? Am I going to be able to make enough food or gruel that I can dig out of the earth? Is the Lord going to come down and lop off my head? Do I have to get sent to war? You know, am I going to starve? Are the elements going to destroy me? Is that huge animal going to come and rip a piece out of me? We don't have to deal with that. We've removed ourselves from the food chain. We currently live in a very long extended period of global peace. There's wars popping off all over the place, but it's not like most periods in history where there's been some level of total war or great civilizations clashing against each other the whole fucking time. This is a second grand long bell epoch, which we are right in the middle of. Is it going to last? Any conspiracy theorists here? Sasha. Sasha's always here. You know Sasha's one of my best friends, right? I'm allowed to make jokes about him because I love him so much. So any spies here, go back and report that to Sasha. So what was I talking about? Remind me. Right, okay. Okay, we don't have to worry about getting killed today, probably. Probably not going to happen. And so the choice is that we can remove ourselves from the doubt and existential fear or the fear of like actual destruction, and we can choose, make a series of choices that mean that our life is relatively safe and predictable. And the vast majority of people on this planet who have any choice at all, and many of them don't have much choice, but the ones who do often choose the safe thing, and that's perfectly understandable. Again, throughout history, people who have succeeded and passed on their genes have been the fearful and the super brave. The super brave are the ones that might get heaps of cool stuff, but are also more likely to die young. And then the ones who are fearful and timid and play things safe and, you know, keep switching allegiances with whoever's in power and skirting around the corners, okay, that's also a perfectly legitimate strategy for survival. But we, I mean, what is the purpose of life if we don't necessarily believe in some afterlife? Some of you may, I don't. So we have to look at what is the meaning of this thing that we're doing right now in this strange sack of bones. On a biological imperative level, it is to replicate our genes, try and stick around long enough for that child to maybe outlive us, and then wait around to die. That's it. And right now, I'm doing an awful job of fulfilling my biological imperative. I'm a complete failure in that. And I have a whole bunch of friends who are doing exceptionally well in this area and fucking hate their lives. They don't hate the children. They have that thing of like, well, you know, it's like, I mean, I love the child, but it did fuck my life up, but, you know, yeah, this is it. It's all there, you little shit. I love you. I don't even know how to hold children. I'm like, no, you don't hold them around the neck, do you? But of course, that's not really enough, is it? If that wasn't enough, then people would just all move towards having children, and they'd feel perfectly satisfied in that situation. But we have a search for meaning. We have a search for significance in our lives, a reason to be, and a mission to move along, a progression to move through. And so those people who choose not to take that progression at all, they don't necessarily have like a deep sense of like, can I make it? Is it going to happen? Am I good enough for this? You know, will that next thing eventuate? You know, will I be able to release my fucking amazing Aussie rap album, or to, you know, get the girl of my dreams, or to build my company, or to live in another country, to learn, you know, to learn their customs and their ways, to, you know, lead a group of men on some adventure? They don't necessarily have that. They have some other dark stuff, though. They have a lot of other shadow things. What are those shadows? The person who chooses complacency, safety, mediocrity, oh, regret. I would say that's probably the one that's going to dog them, although people are pretty good at deluding themselves. Like people are pretty good at finding ways to justify their situation and, you know, rationalize it. So they and we, all of us do this to greater and lesser degrees, do all sorts of things to distract ourselves. And that's where we get ourselves embroiled in drugs and alcohol and gambling and TV and masturbation and gossip and, you know, all of the other things that we do in order to distract ourselves from the fact that we're not really living in alignment with what our potential could be. But it creeps in, of course, in through the corners, and that's where people have that sense of regret, yeah, or of I'm really not doing what I, I'm really not living as much as I could be. To live, I mean, we all, we're all living organisms, but there's a massive spectrum of what it means to really be alive. And so much of that comes down to how aware you are of what you're doing right now. People who live up in their heads and their imaginations and their fears, their worries, their past, the projected future. And all of us do that, of course, that's part of the function of our mind, it does that. And partially that is also an important thing to be able to do, because sometimes we need to zone out from the intensity of life or the pain of life, but it's only one function of our mind. And if we get lost in that, then we're losing moments and minutes and weeks and months. And suddenly, has anyone had a scenario where they've kind of woken up one morning and going, what the fuck did I do for the last month? Yeah. Maybe you've had that, where you've felt that about a year, 20 years, okay, all right, but not from today, right? Okay, excellent, yep. This happens, right? Life passes quickly, especially when you're living in complacency, especially when the prison that you're in is kind of soft and, you know, padded, can be easy to sit in it. And you're encouraged to sit in it by the system, by society, man, by the Illuminati, by whoever it is. And I don't think there is a grand global conspiracies of like, you know, puppeteers just going, yes, yes, yes, it's so fun being evil, isn't it? And I've hung out with one percenters. I've actually hung out with some royals, and we, and it was with me and Sasha, me and Sasha were together, we met some European royals, and we were hanging out, and Sasha just couldn't help it. He was just like, all right, man, tell me, are you a lizard? Now I know you're supposed to say no, but like, seriously, just fucking tell me, come on. I was like, if I hold you and we just go and peel, will it come off and there'll be a lizard under there? And he was pretty convincing in telling us that no, he was more or less a humanoid, and he didn't have a lot of emotions, but, you know, to hang out, I've hung out with a huge spectrum of people, and we have access to some of these, you know, top echelon people, and they're still just people. I don't think that there's grand global conspiracies. There are certainly dozens and dozens or hundreds of micro conspiracies. There are certainly the ways that societies shape their populations in order to keep shit moving, right? Germany, very efficient Germany, just let me just say that word. How is that just a joke in itself? You guys get shit done, yes, very efficiently. That's why our camera team is Austrians. They're the cool Germans, yeah? They're like the surfers of the German-speaking world, all right? Isn't that right, Dom? Look at him, all chilled up the back there, but right now I know he's multitasking efficiently, getting six different things done. Whenever I'm stressed out and I go to Dom or Alex, I'm like, guys, okay, there's this big thing, right? We've already fixed it. Here's the system, you just follow it, and your doors are told, yes, sir, I will, yeah? All right, I didn't do anything. And not surprisingly, probably around 50% of our clients are Germans, all right? Because yeah, it is that. It's like Germans, North Europeans, and then Americans, Australians, and finally, way down the list is Brits, actually. Interestingly, we're very close, we're similar, we have an affinity, Australia and England, and we get very few British clients, and I think that's because there's a sense of cynicism in the British psyche, like, oh, that'll never work. Don't believe that, no, whereas Americans are like, mentors are great, you should model people and then reach for the stars. If he can do it, I can do it too. Not always, but it's a good attitude to have, yeah? And then the Germans are somewhere in between where they're more meticulous about things. It basically follows a process, and perhaps we will get to that. But that's the thing is, I mean, why do Germans come to us? Because they have, usually, I mean, all the guys I work with are successful, heaps of engineers, how many engineers in the room? Yep, that's a disproportionate number of engineers for any room on the planet. There should not be 50% of engineers in any room, but there is, all right? Because, okay, you follow the rules, you did things like you were told to, you've got a good job, you're making decent money, you've got the car, schaffen, schaffen, heuschen bauern, is that right? All right. Okay, that's enough. It was Michael at the back, he's like, more German shocks, please, and I'm like, all right, that's for you, that'll do. But there's a sense of, okay, following the rules that you're given, that makes the society at large work, and it makes the units of, you know, couples and work, but it doesn't necessarily lead to individual happiness, individual satisfaction, all right? So in my mind, you can choose to hear the call of your own personal hero's journey, or you can definitely choose to ignore it, and I don't really believe that there is manifest destiny. I don't think some people are born, or everyone is born with, like, a mission that they will absolutely fulfil, because the evidence seems to suggest that that's not the case, and that is the myth that is somehow sold, that is the American dream, or the Australian dream, like that idea of, like, okay, you're born, you do a bit of work and you head in the direction and you will inevitably succeed, and I don't really think that is the case, and proof is all around. Plenty of people don't succeed on any metric, even if they're surviving and they're creating the children and they have a roof over their heads, they're not happy with themselves, they're not satisfied, they don't have a sense of being actualised, of having stepped into power, stepped into their potential, and brought it forth into the world and in through themselves, and there are also many people who have achieved incredible things on the outside and still are broken on the inside, so I don't think it's like you're destined for anything, really, but you can step on to a path where you model, where you create a line or a narrative that will lead you to some kind of destiny. And this is talked about in most cultures, there's a story arc, the hero's journey, everyone is familiar with this as a concept, but it's useful to look at it, for us to kind of talk through it and see where do you fit into it. It's important for all of you to presume that you are on your own hero's journey. Some of you may have came..."}
