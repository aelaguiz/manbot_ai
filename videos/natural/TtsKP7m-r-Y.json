I told Taylor to fetch a decent price Christian this is way too much. Did you just roll your eyes at me? I can see where this is going, right? So there was a whole bunch of movie there Nobody cares but it looks like Christian went ahead and and was being such a boss that he bought her a new car and got rid of her Old car and she didn't like that because she's an independent woman and she wants to take command of her life But she still is pretty attracted to this billionaire after all Then she rolls her eyes at him and he says did you just roll your eyes at me? So this is basically Him setting up a scene where there's going to be an infraction right where she broke the rules or she disobeyed him in some kind of way and If it's done in a playful way Between you know between a sub and a dom that can be really fun thing, right? so if I tell a girl go over there and get something and then She does but I go up that's much too slowly you need to improve your pace come over here I just created an infraction, right? It doesn't really matter what it was It matters that she like broke a rule or didn't do something that I asked her to do in order for me to Use a punishment as we would call it in kink play. So that is fun punishment not like actual punishment We're not actually trying to hurt the person or to cause fear in them. It's part of the game Do you know why I'm doing this? Because I rolled my eyes. And is that polite? No Excuse me No, sir. This is pretty good. All right, so he's thrown her over his knee and he's asking her She knows why she's here and she gets it right. It's part of the game She says I rolled my eyes at you and that's why he has to punish her But even though she's being submissive in movement, she's not being submissive in attitude, right? So she's like being bratty and like well, it's because I did the naughty thing and then he says excuse me Right, which is that you must submit not with not just with your bending over my knee But with your attitude as well, and then she corrects that I'm sorry, sir, or whatever it was that she said Okay, and now he's gonna have to punish her so that she learns her lesson. Not bad. Not bad Incorrect This sucks, all right, he's gone to the trouble of like setting it up the slow reveal pulling the panties down and I've watched the scene before so basically he gives her three hard slaps on the ass and then on the ass As we say in Australia and then sends her on her way Why this is not a punishment session that he's just done. He's just Done cold slaps, right? So no warm-up at all. Just gone for a heavy hit three times and then he leaves it at that But that's problematic. But the actual issue here is his technique now no offense Anastasia but you are more on the bony side of of butts and If we look now in slow motion about at this strike Bang All right. Look at the impact point. He has spanked her directly over the ischial tuberosity Otherwise known as the bum bone So if she had a fatter juicier ass, it probably wouldn't matter right you could just you just spank the general Center of mass and it'll probably work but with a more slender svelte girl And if you want to be technically correct You need to be aware of where you're spanking the two places to spank a woman when she's bent over is the pocket of the jeans Right where the actual pocket would be and underneath the butt, right? So the cheek that's hanging underneath so we can do an upward stroke on that and a downward stroke on the pocket But he's gone between those and hit her directly over the butt bone, which is incorrect placement bad form Christian And then what are you doing, man? You should be giving her a little some warm-ups like you could be giving her a little bit of floppy warm-up to bring blood To the skin and to prepare the surface as you are having that sexy dialogue. So you've been a naughty mistress, haven't you? Yes, I have what did you do wrong? I wrote my eyes at you and you're still rolling your eyes at me I'm sorry, sir. Yes, and now you should be punished That's how I prefer to seem to it that he could have been doing warm-up strokes grasping gripping to get a prepped and build anticipation So that when he does hit her with these with these heavier strikes that the surface area is ready And she's it's going to be arousing as a pole opposed to what it is here, which is just harsh and painful Look some people will be into this kind of thing. There are different dolmen sub combinations some people like harsh authoritarian Dominance, but the vast majority of women won't they want sensual dominance, right? So dominance they includes Elements of restraint or impact but but is done in such a way that is much more on the pleasure side of things than pain You had me going I was enjoying this scene and now I'm not There's the one spank Okay Two or more She doesn't say yes or no Okay, so he's done a couple of spanks and then he's checked in with her Do you want more which is good like especially for someone who hasn't been spanked hard before? She doesn't answer so she didn't give a yes or no, and then he just spanks her again Which means that he's broken his own rules why ask for consent if you're not actually going to wait for the answer Welcome to my world And finishes with welcome to my world really Do you remember what was in the red room the first that first we came in and there was hundreds of different floggers and crops and canes and dozens of different restraints and cages and spanking benches and whatever and Now the welcome to my world is that he gave her three cold incorrect spanks and that's gonna suddenly change her perspective on life Is it? So restrained that's all he wanted now he just puts her back in place And she's come out of this like this was some earth-shattering experience. She got spanked hard a few times It would have actually been like ow ow ow What was all that about? Oh What are you doing? The few things at the office that require my attention. I have some business tending to that I must be attending to Right, so he goes to all the trouble of setting up this dynamic where she breaks a rule there's an infraction so which then gives him the right and the Juicy sexy scene to punish her and instead of turning that into some erotic hot roleplay Which took her into some peak subspace? He gives her a few stoic spanks Does four seconds of aftercare gives her a little kiss and then decide tell us that he has to go after the office This is not good Dominance and submission. This is not good BDSM. But what it is good is good manipulation And that's what he's doing, right? Whether he's conscious of it or not is he's getting a girl amped up in some kind of way and then withdrawing his affection because he has mummy issues and And Deep psychological issues that she's going to gradually iron out of it over him over the next six hours of boring as fuck movies until she Totally neuters him and domesticates him at the end. I presume I will never know because I'll never watch the end of this shit Okay I just thought that I enjoyed tonight. He enjoyed tonight. Nothing happened You spanked her three times now you're going to the office. You're a workaholic Christian. You need to you need to reappraise your priorities I know I did say that see I look do you want to be a billionaire or do you want to be this cushy lover? Who's spending all the time with some? nondescript librarian You ready are you getting bored guys? I'm I'm I'm trying to keep this interesting and I'm trying to stay focused This movie is so not erotic. Like I I have not had an erection the whole time. I'm telling you the truth I've been sitting here floppy as limp celery Okay, now he's taking it back into the red room. All right, finally the good stuff What's it? Where are we gonna go now? This is the third time she's had sex by the way So like is he gonna do any warm-up or by now? She's used to just being stabbed Don't bite people on the lips. It's my pet peeve. I fucking hate lip biting Nice down take off your shoes arms above your head You have a beautiful body Anastasia I Want you unashamed of your nakedness to understand yes, sir, you're biting your lip, you know what that does to me turn around When I tell you to come into this room, this is how you'll be you'll wait for me kneeling by the door Do it now. This scene is decent. Okay, so he's setting up a situation where he is praising the submissive Telling her that in her nakedness that she should be unashamed that she is beautiful Okay, so this is a good things do as a dominant you're not there to make the person feel like they're your slave or that they are less than you or subordinate in any like human sense even though you may have control over them physically and it's an important part of dominance is to Understand you have responsibility for the sub and that includes her emotions that includes how she feels about herself So a good Dom will actually raise the self-esteem of the sub as opposed to breaking it down He's also giving pretty clear instructions about what he wants in terms of submissive posture Ways for her to present herself to him and he's micromanaging the way that her hair is because he's particular about this Whatever, that's fine. So yeah, okay. This is this is a decent kind of intro to a humiliation scene Hands flat on your thighs giving her clear instructions of what he wants to do. That's good And now he's gonna leave it there All right, now we go, all right, so he's just got not not more wrist stuff I Come on, you've already tied her up by the wrists with you with you. You're Italian tie twice in this movie and now of all the things that we have to play with you're gonna pull out a pair of Wrist cuffs, which is the same thing Come on, you use all the cool shit the writing crop This is a pretty serious tool right to use this on somebody who has never had an impact before I wouldn't recommend it. I don't recommend it. I don't recommend it On somebody who has never had an impact before I wouldn't be recommending that if I did it to be a little It'll be a little love tap Let's see if he's gonna do that or he's gonna go for heavy impact Will there be any warm-up or is he just gonna go straight into a strike? Oh Not bad that was actually a backhand strike which is a much more difficult strike to do than the forehand not bad Okay, he's checking in that's good she likes it she's got this now she has two expressions actually She has scared and horny and I can't believe I'm doing this horn and horny I What did he just do then he just hit her on her ribcage Let's double check it. All right, please This is annoying. What is he doing? Just Smith's gonna stick in the leather on her face, and I think he's really Overdoing the anticipation of how much this is going to affect someone like this It's like yeah, okay. All right Settle down. I don't think that's gonna happen. But that's that's alright. She's allowed to have a reaction But the problem is here. Let's go back to this again Bang he hits her not on her breast look you wouldn't be hitting a woman with tiny little b-cups With a riding crop on her tits. You might use a pussy flogger for that No, and he missed and he hit her directly on the bone on his skinny ribcage fail and Look as a dom you're gonna make mistakes certainly I've accidentally hit the girl on the butt bone or flogged her in a way where the tassels have wrapped around and stung a little bit on a Around the front of her body. For example, if you make mistakes as a dom, it's fine You need to apologize and you need to correct them. Does he do that? No, she just thinks she likes being hit on the ribcage On the stomach No, no, no, no, no, absolutely not The only place you use this is on the inner thighs and on the ass Basically, you don't hit over organs with any kind of striking tool. What am I gonna spank her on the belly? All right, you don't flog don't crop don't spank bellies under ribcages under armpits or any other bizarre place He thinks might be sexy All right some rope tying action going on it's again the wrist just a different way to tie up the wrists He's sure they're both really into the wrists aren't they? You could tie her ankles up. You could tie around the neck If you know how to do all this crazy rope stuff, it's just the wrists again He's running his hand up a leg, is he gonna touch your pussy? What? No, I cut to it Okay, this is a montage of different things right now that this is where the actions happen doing everything hair pulling Hair pulling suck there He took her from the end of the ponytail and he wrapped the ponytail up which means that you're putting the hair under tension away From the scalp, which means it's gonna be uncomfortable when you're holding a woman by the hair you hold in close to the scalp as possible I Sorry, I forgot I missed again, you know, this is the fourth time she's had sex How does he penetrate her for the fourth time stabs it in without any preparation? Okay, raw raw Christian raw, that's what they call him dry and raw. That's how he likes it And the only way he likes to fuck is Just those rapey kind of pumping which is like a cool stroke to do right like it's theatrical But that's like you you're stabbing against the back of the cervix there. It's not necessarily the most pleasurable It's my probably won't get a woman off. It's good psychologically. I like doing that sometimes like But like not the whole time you need to get some undulation get some hip game going and there so she can actually feel something. And now we're all done. Right so theoretically I guess because it was montage-y this is where he's taken her in on her first you know session deeply into BDSM. And look as a progression in this film if each of those scenes have been done a bit better then this would be fine right like in terms of okay obviously if you're a dom and you're with somebody who doesn't know much about this you don't want to take her into the red room and do everything all at once probably. And so introducing you know tying up the things and putting blindfolds and using bit of ice like that's all good it's just that he also then stabs her in the pussy without any preparation. But now what we're seeing here is what we would call aftercare. So if you've taken a sub into what is known as subspace it's it can be a really delicate vulnerable trance like position for somebody to be in. And so afterwards you need to take care of her right or whoever it is that's submitting to you. And that means as he's done wrapping her in a towel, caressing her, giving words of affirmation, drinking some water you know having some fruits get some energy up, being looked after, being put in the shower if need be. Right so it's it's your responsibility as the dom to take her through to create the context for the play to take her through the narrative and then to seal it off at the end to conclude it so that there's not any residual issues right. Because let's say you were doing something really nasty and aggressive in the play if we don't at the end make it clear that that was just play right it was just theater it was for both of our fun and it's not bleeding out into the rest of our relationship doesn't mean I disrespect you or I think anything particular about you outside of the bedroom and I care for you I look after you and so you can transition from that intense trance state back into your normal state of consciousness then whatever he's doing here is nice. Yeah let's go I've got a feeling that I want to get through the rest of this very quickly there's some more story we don't care do they do they love each other do they not will he overcome his childhood issues that caused him to be such a weird pervert that's not why people are kinksters it's fun and will she tame him yeah rich guy stuff you know what turns me on rich guys yay yeah okay come on this has got to be the last sex scene for movie one sorry guys I'm not gonna do movies two and three I thought I was but I cannot I can't stomach it I want you to be in the playroom in 15 minutes okay he wants her in the playroom in 15 minutes I guess this is the penultimate final intense scene of the movie and what's he doing pulling out more wrist things all right so yes you always have to restrain her wrists no you don't you could restrain her ankles you could tie her knees up to the loops that you've got there so that she's spread eagle there's so many other things you can do and when she's always tied with a wrist then there's not a lot that we can do and not a lot that she can do yeah it's cool to tie girls from the wrist sometimes but you've done it in every bloody scene oh you better remember those safe words you're gonna need them okay now he's tying her by all four limbs at this point right so she's got ankles and wrists tied I almost never do this firstly most women don't feel comfortable even if they trust you being tied up by all extremities because it means they are completely trapped it's better in general to just do the ankles or just do the wrists in my opinion and if you're tying a woman to a bed with all four limbs tied down there's not so much that you can do I mean it's quite not functional to have sex from this position she can't wrap her legs around you she can't touch you so it's you're just dealing with it's you're creating your own starfish which is the thing that people don't usually want let's see if you can do something creative with it okay so he's blindfolded her and he's using a peacock feather which is a very regal thing of course if you're a billionaire you're gonna use a peacock feather not just a feather duster that's nice okay so he's building all sorts of anticipation he's finally pulling out the flogger draping it don't put her over her face don't put her over her face oh good he didn't put her over the face don't ever do that don't dangle things in women's faces doesn't feel nice yeah this is cool way to use an impact tool as a sensual tool as well and there we go he goes and he flogs her with absolutely awful form right he's doing an arc which is not what you want to do with a flogger using a flogger is one of the more complicated tools to use it's actually very advanced because most people think you do it like a whip and what that does is it comes down and then the tassels wrap around and create a sting so it's incorrect form and he's whipping her on her stomach absolute no no you do not hit people over their organs bad form Christian suck at this and he's on the front of her body so he's hitting her over the chest I mean you can't hit it hit a woman in the breast but I wouldn't be using a heavy flogger like that I'm using a light flogger and as you can see it's not particularly functional oh finally she gets oral sex after the fourth or fifth time that they've had sex and that's it and that's it that's it that's the penultimate BDSM scene in this movie is there another one can I can I stomach it oh god there's a bunch of emotions and then the movie ends thank fuck all right well thanks for suffering through that with me terrible movie badly acted unrealistic and very importantly extremely bad representation of what a good dominant could be this is a man that technically doesn't know his stuff that is kind of boring and predictable with what he does and doesn't actually respect the boundaries of the woman he's any and the other thing is there's no fun in this does he ever smile does he ever actually really show that he's properly enjoying things no it's all this stoic authoritarian stern no fun dominance look that's a thing and there'll be elements of that in play that can be fun to play with with being stern and authoritarian but sex is supposed to be fun and BDSM is supposed to be even more fun because we have all these toys and costumes and theatrical elements to play with and so it shouldn't be so serious and weird and full of Freudian bizarreness it's just supposed to be people expressing the their interest in each other through intensity through polarity through power dynamics and most importantly through having fun together and remember to touch a woman on the pussy before you put your cock in that's really important because you could learn some really bad techniques from this movie so that's it I hope you enjoyed the video today now if you'd like to learn how to do BDSM properly in a healthy and positive and safe way that brings pleasure to both you and your partner then you should stay tuned for the master lover method coming out on the 4th of March where I explain and demonstrate and show you how to do way
