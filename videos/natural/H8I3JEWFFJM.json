So I just arrived in a brand new city, I won't use any connections, I won't use any social circle, and I wanna see, can I end up on a date with a girl in the next two days? So now it is, let's see what time is it, it is 1527, and it is the 30th of May. So by the 1st of June, 1527, I gotta be on a date. So, let's see if I can do it. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Hello. Hello. You speak English? Yes. I like your dress, it's very elegant. What's your name? Alex. It's not a Spanish name, right? No, I'm from Ukraine. Oh, did you leave because of the war? Or you live here for a long time? I leave because of the first one. Oh shit, like eight years ago, right? Are you in a rush? Or you can chat for a few minutes? How many minutes do we have? Four. Four, all right. I'll give you my introduction. Who are you speaking to? My name is Alex, I'm from Austria. I remember your name, you said it just now. And actually, I also lived in Ukraine, but I travel a lot, so. Where do you live in Ukraine? In Kiev, yeah, next to Shevchenko University. Okay. Yes. How is life here compared to Ukraine? It's hotter. Ukraine is cooler. And other than that? It's fine. I don't know, because I'm from Crimea. Wow. It's really similar, the nature. Right. So you really had to leave because of that. Wow, that's a crazy story. Eight. All right. I think that's it. You're in a rush, I see. No, because I have four minutes. Or 11. Wait for the train, I have to go. How old are you? I'm 22 years old. When are you back to Barcelona? When I'm back to Barcelona? Yeah. Tomorrow. Okay. I go to Girona. You and your buddies? Your friends? What? Who goes to Girona? You and your friends? I go to see my boyfriend. Oh, your boyfriend. That's cool. Is he Spanish? No, he's Ukrainian. I understand. You are very friendly, and I just arrived literally like 10 minutes ago. Oh, I just arrived? Yeah, yeah. Where do you live? I'm gonna have an Airbnb in, I don't know, some streets. Not far from here, it's like 20 minutes walk. But I think I'm gonna take a taxi. Here in Poblenou. Okay, I understand. You're very friendly. I just also made a new Instagram profile, because I didn't use it before. If you wanna be friends, I know you have a boyfriend. If you want to share it, I don't know how it works. Should I type it in? I'm not gonna steal your phone, don't worry. No, I don't know, it's a truth. You don't know, I'm just a total stranger. I run very fast. I think you're faster than me without luggage. Yay, you're gonna be my second follower. Oh, okay. I just made it in the train. Okay, but you have a lot of photos. Yeah, I posted the ones I saved. Have fun with your boyfriend. Thank you. You guys know I always talk about social media in my videos and how important it is when you do day game to stay in touch with girls. My Instagram obviously is pretty good, right? I worked on it a couple of years, I have a bunch of followers, show a lot of status on there, which can help you with hotter girls. So I decided to make it a little bit even harder on myself. I'll make a new Instagram. So my friend and me went in today and we created a new Instagram. And as you can see, it literally has two followers and 14 posts. So I only have two followers, right? Because guys are like, ah, but Alex, you got a cool Instagram, so it's easy for you. And I created an Instagram without all the crazy other life I'm living. It's just me, some friends, me in nature, me snowboarding. So nothing that you couldn't do. So there's no more excuses. So I'm gonna use this Instagram for this challenge and for infills that I'm gonna film in Barcelona to talk to girls after I meet them. Of course, if the conversation goes really well, I'm also gonna chat with them on WhatsApp. So I haven't done infill for a while and I've been working. I've been in Cape Town. Not a lot of girls were there. And what I'm gonna do now is basically walk home with my suitcase and on the way, do some warmups. It's what we tell the guys to do when they feel a bit stuck, when they don't feel like approaching. You just be more open, make eye contact with people, say hi, don't have like a kind of being, not being attached to an outcome, just to warm myself up a little bit. So my Airbnb is like 15 minute walk away. So I'm gonna use that walk to just be friendly, be open. Hi, you looked very cute before. You speak English? No. Okay. I try in Spanish, okay? When I made a video there, you looked very cute. Beautiful. Yes, thank you. What's your name? Alex. How old are you? 18. 18. Can I sit down for two minutes to talk to you? And you're from Spain, right? Me? No, I'm from Brazil. I like meeting people from Brazil. They're very nice, very kind. Your dad is from Brazil? No, my dad is Italian. My mom is Brazilian. Good. I already saw your necklace, and I have this. That's weird, right? That's cool, that's cool. You have to do the same. I have this since I was three years old. Three years, wow. I have this for more than a year, a year and a half. I did it with this too, on the same day. Love and death. Love and death. And what do you do in life? I study nursing. Nursing, which is like medicine? Yes. Here, here is a university, here in Central. And how is it? Good. Do you like it? Yes. Do you live here? No, but I'm going to spend a while here. That's cool. I live here for a month, two months. Let's see, I work online, so I can... Be here. Yes, yes, yes. I love Brazil more. I love it too. I love it too. It's not my first time. Brazil has my heart. What do you like more than here? The people or the parties? I don't know. I think the city itself, I mean, everything. I don't know, I don't have a specific thing. Do you want... Now you have a university, right? Yes, now I have a university. Do you want to drink something in the afternoon? I'm going to my Airbnb now. Yes. Do you want to drink something in the afternoon, talk? Today I'm going to the hospital. I have practice, but tomorrow maybe. Okay, I'd love to. Do you have WhatsApp? Yes. And me? No problem. My name is... Barcelona... 18? No. 18. No, I'm kidding. You're young, yes. My Spanish was better. No, it's good. It's shit. It's Arex. Tomorrow, maybe after 6? Okay. Okay. Enjoy your day. Bye. Bye, see you. Bye. Enjoy, bye bye. Yo, real quick. Obviously, we had to cut down this interaction a bit shorter. First of all, to keep it entertaining. And second of all, to not be taken down by YouTube. Because YouTube is not a big fan of infill videos. But I did analyze the whole interaction in another video that is hidden on my portal that you can get access to right now for free. All you need to do is click the link below and you can watch the whole thing. So if you're a guy who's not watching those videos purely out of entertainment, but you actually want to learn how to approach, how to have interactions that lead to dates, that lead to sexual experiences and so on, click below and get access now. Back to the video. We're off to a pretty good start. The first girl I approached inside the train station was super cute. She was pretty young. Her half Brazilian, half Italian. And she's lovely. She agreed to go on a date tomorrow. Ma\u00f1ana, tal vez despu\u00e9s de las seis. Which is great. So in theory, the challenge is over, but it's not at all. Because girls say a lot of things. They agree, but then plans change. We all know that. People flake, they change their mind. So it's off to a good start, but we see what happens. Obviously, I keep talking to more girls to really get leads, enough leads to for sure end up on a date in the next 48 hours. I wish I could have approached her. She's very young. My name is Alex. Hi. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. You just finished a shift or what? Yeah, I just finished. With my sister, she should be here. Okay, so you're busy, huh? Yeah, I'm busy. Oh, cool. Why did you get into the hotel industry? Yeah, because I like to study it, but now, I don't know if I'm going to do work or not. You don't know? You changed your mind, maybe? Maybe I'll go to work, something else. Don't know what yet, but let's see. Okay. First, I have to finish this and then, yeah. Yeah, it's a crazy world. We can change things all the time now. Anyway, I'll let you go, because you're like- Thank you very much. Yeah, I don't know. Do you want to be friends on Instagram? I just arrived. I want to make friends. Add me. I made a profile in the train coming here, so you'll be like my second follower or something. Why don't you have Instagram? I had, of course, but I realized it fucks up my focus for a while. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can imagine. And I was just in super work mode. It's Alex, Leon. Hi. Hi, what's up? This is my sister. Wow, more beautiful eye pairs. You all have beautiful eyes. I said that to her. Yeah, you told me that I had beautiful eyes. All right. Nice to meet you. Enjoy. We text. Bye bye, have a good day. So, I'm slowly making my way home to my Airbnb. Usually I would take a taxi, by the way. You know, I'm not that cheap to walk all the way through the city with a suitcase, but I thought it's fun. It's a fun shot, to be honest. So I'm approaching girls along the way. I'm warming up with other people. I'm saying hi to other people. Hello. And it feels good. You know, I'm warming up. I'm becoming more social. As you see, I'm meeting girls with boyfriends. I'm meeting girls who are kind of in a rush. Their sister arrives. It doesn't matter. I'm just like, hey, you're friendly. Hey, let's be friends on Instagram, you know? With the other girl in the train station, which was way more intense, I was sitting down. I had eye contact. We connected over my tattoo. I got the WhatsApp because I want to like lock her in and texting that way. So yeah, I'm going to go home. And then maybe in an hour or two, text the girls who follow me on Instagram and see if I can set up a date that way. Okay, quick update. It is now 16.13. I don't know if you see it. And so we're like, what, 45 minutes in. We talked to a bunch of girls. One girl agreed to go on a date. So let's see what's going to happen with that. I'm waiting here for my Airbnb host. I think I'm right. Hello. Then I'm going to drop this thing, which is going to make it way easier for me to run after girls. For this to work, obviously I want to be in a highly populated area. You know, so Barcelona is the perfect place. If you don't need to get a date in 48 hours in your hometown, which isn't so packed, then you don't have to go to fully packed areas. But that's what I'm going to do to hopefully get a result as fast as possible. Let's see if my host shows up, so we don't waste any time. So we're here in the Airbnb. Nice little backyard, three bedrooms. I'm actually here with my videographer girl and photographer girl, which is very helpful to get a good picture like those onto my new Instagram. That's actually a part of my social media dating guide. You can click down there for more information on creating a three-part series that's for free for you to watch. How to create an Instagram from scratch that you can use to look better online, have a profile online, to make girls kind of feel, oh yeah, it's a cool guy, I want to see him. Anyway, checking in on my Instagram, I got three followers now. One girl, we have to blur it out, her name, but friendly-ly liked all my photos, so that's cool. So I got three followers now. For this to work, I thought I need volume. So I think I'm going to make sure that by the end of today, I'm going to have at least 20 contacts, no matter how long it takes, you know? If it maybe takes two hours, maybe it takes five hours, my camera team has enough batteries that last for the whole day. But obviously, for this to work, we need volume. You know, I often see guys talk to me like, oh, I tried it, it didn't work, and I'm asking them maybe on the call, you know, when I sign them up for a workshop, how many approaches have you done? Ah, you know, like maybe six, or like maybe eight. I'm like, yeah, of course it didn't work, bro. Like, you're barely getting started. For me to get to the level where I am, I had to do a lot of approaches, thousands even, you know? Now, to be honest, my life changed. I'm more in social circle now, I'm trying to build my business, I'm trying to build other things, other structures that also get me a cool lifestyle and even hotter girls. But the foundation is day game, the foundation is approaching, and the foundation is being able to talk to people on the street, even to fuel all those other social circle things. You cannot really skip that, and maybe I might be a bit rusty, but warming up exercises on the way here were really useful for me. Let's go to a populated area now and get at least 20 contacts, I think. Out of 20, it should be possible to close someone for a date. What's your name? My name is Marjorie. Hi, yours? Hi, Alex. Alex, nice to meet you. Nice tattoos also. Thank you. This one looks almost like a stamp, like so good done. Yeah, I need a skipper for my guest car. Yes, I know. What are you doing here? I'm going home after checking for something in a shop. I live very nearby. Okay, so you're not a tourist? I'm a married woman that lives here. Wow, how is your marriage going? Perfect. That's nice. Great. Do you believe in marriage forever? Till death do you part? I believe. You live in marriage for how long there is love and it goes well, and you never know. It can be forever, it can be one year, it can be ten. How long have you been married for? One month. Oh wow, congratulations, that's exciting. Thank you. Okay, enjoy your day. Thank you, you too, nice to meet you. Okay, she had a husband, which is fine, you know. Part of all of this is just going with the flow, not having a plan. Because if you have a plan in approaching women on the street, you're going to get thrown off for sure, because it's never going to go according to your plan. So have kind of an open mind of what she's going to say next, really listen to her, what she's saying, and then react to that. Don't react to what you were hoping that's going to happen with her. She has a husband. I was actually curious, like, how is marriage? I'm a married woman that lives here. Wow, how is your marriage going? I don't know, you know. How does she relate to marriage? Does she believe in internal things? Which is kind of another part why this works for me, because I am generally curious about things. And when I want to know something, I will ask. And then I wish her a good day. You know, there's no point in, like, not really a point trying to get her contact. In this case, I'm not going to be in Barcelona for that long. I don't really need a female friend here right now. If you do, and she's maybe in your niche, okay, cool. But for me, it's just fine to let her go, wish her a good day, good vibes, finish. Hello. Sorry. I see you're enjoying your... Is it frappuccino? Yeah. You look very wonderful in that background and that dress. You look a bit touristy, so I thought I'd say hi. Because I just arrived in Barcelona. Oh, really? What's your name? Hi, Alex. Do you mind if I sit two minutes? I'm just having a stroll. Is that you? No, it's a bird. I just arrived. Yeah? It's not my first time here, and I'm going to stay a while. But it's cool, though, taking that energy of the city. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I'm having a good day off today, so I can stay at home, but I can go out as well. So you do work here? Yeah, internship, I mean. Where are you from? Netherlands. Okay. Austria. Basically, I work online with marketing and YouTube and stuff like this. So it enables me to kind of work where I want to. And I always had good memories with Barcelona. And it's a good place to be. It's a bit crowded. Maybe I will explore other parts of Spain a bit while I'm here. But maybe one month here, two months here. And then moving on. That's right. What are you internshiping for? It's at Hotel Arts. I study hotel management there. Do you like that? You have to deal with different people, right? Yeah, especially long shifts. Long shifts, right. But today I'm off, so... Okay. What's the best and worst part about that industry? Because I don't know anything about it. I think the best for me is I really like to work with people. I'm kind of the energy you get from it. It's also the down part, it's hard work. I mean, I make shifts like 12 hours, 5 days a week. What? So you basically get up, shower, get ready, work, go to bed and do it again 5 times in a row, right? Yeah, pretty much. Cool. I'm going to head out and lead you to music. You are very friendly. I just made a new Instagram profile. Do you want to be friends on Instagram? Yeah, sure. Okay, what was your name? Alex. Nice to meet you. Have a good day. Enjoy your day off. Bye. Good talking to you. Alex. Hi. I know you're shy. Do you want to chat if you're not busy? I'm actually still here tomorrow, so... You're leaving tomorrow? Yeah, I'm coming back on Wednesday, so... Ah, it was a short vacation. Yeah, a short vacation. Okay. You can add me on Instagram. Yeah. Because I just made a profile and I want followers. Why did you just make a profile? Because I took a year off Instagram. Because it's very distracting. But now I'm traveling more. Yeah. And... It's just... A lot of people want Instagram and stuff. Yeah. It's just not that cool to not have it. Everyone has it nowadays. Exactly. And I like it anyway, but... It's also... My internet is a bit weak. Okay, you can... I'll just take a screenshot. If you're not afraid of me, you can add me later. Okay. Tell me how the museum was. Yeah, I will. Okay, have fun. Hello. Sorry. I was just walking that way. You really stand out of everyone else. You have a very cool look. Ah, thank you. You're welcome. You look critical. You look suspicious. I don't know. It's strange that a guy gives you a compliment like this. No, it's nothing. Okay, what's your name? Alex, nice to meet you. Where are you heading? You're going somewhere? Yeah. Okay. Me not. I just arrived. I'm having a stroll in the city. I'm here every year. So I'm just seeking up the energy. Where are you from? Originally Austria. I live in Ukraine. Sometimes. I work online. I'm kind of homeless. Why? Homeless of choice. I'm living with where I want. I'm able to stay here two months, go somewhere else. I've just spent two months in Cape Town before. Now I'm going to be six weeks here. You? I live here. Forever? Already since you were born here? Yeah. Where are your parents from? Senegal. They moved here? Yeah. Obviously. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you also. Where are you heading? I have to go... Shop something. You're cute. Thank you. Do you... When you're free... I know you don't know me well enough to be like, let's go on a coffee. But we can chat maybe on Instagram. Okay. Can you add me? I just made a new one. Right before coming here at the airport. What do you do in life? Work. Very enthusiastic. Is your life exciting? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah! That's more enthusiastic. Right now I'm tired. That's why I'm like... I understand. And now I'm like blah, blah, blah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. If we chat on Instagram, maybe we can meet for a drink one time. But no rush. Yeah. Now you're tired. Now you're tired, so... No rush. Enjoy. Bye. The black girl I just talked to, she was lovely. She was very chill. She was a bit suspicious of my compliment and I called that out straight away. You look critical. Thank you. You look suspicious. You know, I'm not just flowing with, okay, I said a thing and now she needs to deal with it. I'm checking in with her. I'm checking in with her. I made a mistake there, and now she needs to deal with it. I'm checking in with her. Like, is that a bit weird, what I just said? Is it strange to you? You know, did it not arrive well? And I'm staying very calm as I do this, you know. I'm kind of like nervous with her, even though I'm settled and confident in my domain, I'm still not gonna overrule her with that. I want to come to her energy. And even if as she moves away, if you like look back at the video, she was slowly moving away from me and I'm just standing there, which kind of shows her, like, hey, don't worry, I'm not chasing you. I'm not following you. Yes, I ask you questions, you know. Yes, it's kind of weird. But hey, you're ready to go. A mistake some guys maybe make, they're like, you know, they move with her straight away. And that can sub-communicate, like, oh, I need you here. I want you here, you know. And it's not so cool. Yeah, let's keep going. Why did you move to Barcelona? I just moved because of the weather. Like, there is no special reason. Okay. But the weather is good, that's for sure. Yeah, so I need to go because also my battery is consumed. Okay. I don't want to hold you up. You're very sexy and friendly. I thought I'd say hi. I just arrived. I'm going to be here a couple of months, enjoying the weather as well. Same reason, kind of. You too. Do you want to be friends on Instagram? Not. You have a boyfriend? Yes. Damn, why? No, I'm just kidding. Yeah, already five years. Of course you have a boyfriend. Beautiful girls always have boyfriends. But you're cool. Actually, no, not always. No? They never have boyfriends? There's hope for me? No, that's not true. They have. You can search this name. Alex Lillian. Do you have internet or no? It should work. Should I search you? You're never going to have me, to be honest. No, I have you here now. I know how it works. You're probably modeling, right? Yeah. Of course. How is it going? Market going up or down? Now better. Before it was completely shit. Yeah, I heard. Especially after COVID. Nobody has money to spend on models or photographers, right? Because also everything was closed. And I'm not only modeling for fashion. I'm also like working for events, like big... Like organizing or hostess? Hostess. Hostess or modeling, image modeling or translator. Right. Anything related to this. Whatever makes you some money. Yes, because it's like the same money finally as if I would work in office or in some very special job. To me it's better to have a lot of small jobs than to sit every day in the same place, which I hate. They will fuck all my brain. I will be completely tired and they will pay shit. That's such a Russian expression, fuck my brain. You can also say, my ex, he fucked my brain. Brain. Brain. Alright, cool. See you. Keep in touch. Yes. Have a good day. Bye, good talking to you. Alright, hot Ukrainian model here. Has a boyfriend for many years. Not surprised, you know. Hot girls have boyfriends, like I said. I'm still chill. And I liked her in the end. She was like, let's stay in touch or something. See you. Keep in touch. Yes. So I just arrived in the city. We're now two and a half hours into the challenge. And I made some friends, for the least. I know some models here. I'm here in Barcelona and I know some models who at least said, let's stay in touch. So it was pretty cool. Thanks for watching. I hope you enjoyed the first part of the 48 hour challenge. As promised, I have a gift for you. I took three of the, I would say, most important interactions I had during those two days. Watched them full length, prepared them and analyzed the whole interaction. All prepared for you on my portal, because YouTube wouldn't really accept that type of content. All you need to do to get access to that free content right now is click below. You come to a page and you get access straight away. So if you do watch those videos, because you want to get better at game approaching, seduction, you want to get more dates, this is perfect for you. Because I'm analyzing what I'm doing and why the girls respond to me positively. So you can learn from it. See you in the next video. Thanks for watching. Thank you. See you. Thank you. Have fun. Bye bye. Bye. Thank you. Bye."}
