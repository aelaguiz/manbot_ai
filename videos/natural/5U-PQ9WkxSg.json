I've been in and out of the pick-up, out of pick-up since 8 years, when I was, I was like since you're 8 years old? I'm like hang on a minute, surely we can't be teaching 8 year olds. No, since you were 17. I feel I've been in for a long time, so you're now what, 3 plus 25. What is the best strategy out? What's the exit from this? I want to outgrow this. When I find out, I shall let you know. Well, I mean you have been in it for, okay so I guess what you mean is that at the age of 17 you found the idea of seduction and you've been trying to practice that and doing that on and off and to whatever degree of success you have. You've been in it for a long time, but what does that mean exactly? Because there's being an obsessed PUA guy, a seduction guy, which I have been for a long time and much more intensely at other points in my life, where it got to be something where yeah it was something I needed to outgrow in the sense I was obsessed with it and I was doing it all the time at the detriment of other things and it just filled my mind all the time. Now I think that's okay for a guy to do for a couple of years. You can intensely focus in on this for a couple of years and that means it's the kind of main priority outside of figuring out how to feed yourself and house yourself. That's alright because it does get a bit addictive when you get good at it and it does require quite a bit of intense work to reach a point where you can get the kinds of women that you want regularly and build the type of sexual life that you want. Okay, it's totally cool to have a break, to just be like cool I'm just not going to bother or worry about picking up chicks for a month or two months or something, especially when you've been doing it for a decent amount of time. I warn guys against coming into, especially if they're coming to a workshop, they put all this money and time and effort and then a month later they check in and they're like I decided I really need a break to figure out my life and it's like, I'm like dude what? No. You just came out of a workshop, I know you and you told me over and over again what you wanted and now you've decided that now you need to monk out for three months? I don't think so. I think that's just an excuse to escape the pain and the difficulty of mastering this, which it is. It's difficult and it's painful depending on how we interpret it. It requires us to have our ego battered around and for girls to go nyeh and all that other stuff that most men won't, will not stomach facing and as a result they get what's handed to them or what's in the vicinity or what their sexual market value buys them on the local market, whereas the guys that step out of the matrix and choose their own path get to live extraordinary dating lives. Extraordinary compared to what they would have had and maybe extraordinary to what anyone would have had, but that's less important than that I'm moving from my mediocrity to my extraordinary. Please keep that in mind with all this, with lifestyle design in general, right? It's like you came from whatever your version of mediocre was or grey or average or okay or shit, right? And you're moving into an extraordinary to you experience of your personal life, whether that's from the simple subtle things of smelling the flowers and eating the food and being immersed in being alive in a more high definition way and of course then into the social realm and the seductive realm and the business realm and the other metrics that you personally wanted to improve when you joined this course, right? So I would more be looking at like, okay, what is the thing that you want to outgrow? Is it the obsession of continually trying to pick up new girls all the time and become an expert at that? Fair enough, right? Okay, that's not necessary in order to have a fulfilling dating life. What is necessary? That's what you would be looking at. If I want to outgrow it, do I have the skill set and the mindset to be able to, as a single guy, if I'm single, find A or X number of great lovers and I can do that within a short enough time frame that it's not meaning that I'm alone for 6-12 months and just jerking off and feeling sad. Yes, it's totally cool to take chosen points of celibacy in your life. Involuntary sucks, but voluntary celibacy where, as I do in short blocks and have done throughout my life, I go into retreats, I take time off, I go to the farm, after a breakup sometimes I'm just like, that's it, fuck women, that's it, no more, okay, I'm back. And yeah, cool, I can listen to the rhythms of my life, oh yeah, 90s dance reference anyone? Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah. Listen to the rhythm of your life, for sure, because you are the ultimate source of your internal wisdom about what you need. You are much more intelligent intuitively than maybe you even notice or know. And okay, if it's detrimental or it's just an obsession or it's just an addiction or it's just for the validation or it's like, oh, just keep on, what is there, just keep picking up, just fuck girl, pick up, fuck girls, pick up, sure, there's other ways to branch out of that, using the skill set and maintaining the skill set for some other style of life. Good day, gentlemen, I've just made it back to Kiev, which is a bit of a shock coming from the farm where I've been for three weeks and I just walk out my apartment and immediately every girl is hot, every girl is hot. So yeah, I'm just about to start teaching our final Kiev workshop, so if you want to join that, too bad, too late, starts tomorrow. However, the very final infield seduction workshop for TNL for 2021 is happening in Barcelona from the 3rd until the 10th of October. Very excited about this one, I haven't been to Barcelona in a couple of years, we always had a great time, incredible girls from all around the world, still good weather at that time of year, so if you want to get this shit sorted and have the problem that this guy had where he's just like sick of picking up girls, perhaps you have the opposite problem at this point, then come and join me and the TNL team, your last chance for 2021, link below, get on a call with one of our boys and I'll see you in the next video, peace!"}
