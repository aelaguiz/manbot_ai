She's not fucking them all or making out with them all, but she's engaging with them in a seductive game of some sort. She becomes good at this. And then there's the male equivalent. There's the guy that worked in a bar, played in a band, just was kind of social, had girls around him. He too learns over time. He didn't have to go out and do his 100 approaches in a week or in a month and grind it out, trying to catch up and get enough impressions that the average guy that comes and works with me does. He did it over his social life. Okay, we weren't like that, or you weren't like that, or those circumstances didn't happen to you, or you didn't happen to those circumstances."}
