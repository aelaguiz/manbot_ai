I'm matching? That's, you did that on purpose. No, it's not matching, it's different things. It's, what do you mean? It's not that I went and matched at all. So it's an actual coincidence that your hair, your top, your tights and your shoes are all of the same colour? I don't believe it. And the bag? No, it wasn't matching. I don't believe it. Well, it's an amazing coincidence. Okay. So where are you from? Can you, can you guess? I'll tell you first that I don't look like I'm from the place that I'm from. Okay. Not England or Ireland? No, much, much further away. Oh, close. Australia? Antarctica. No, yes, Australia. And what are you doing here? In the park. Yeah, I mean here. Um. What brought you here? Just travelling. Yeah. And where have you been so far? In Belgrade or in Europe? I've been, I started in France, went to Spain, Czech Republic, Hungary, yeah. So what are you doing today? Um. I really didn't sleep so well last night. Neither did I. Can I have a look at your eyes? You look like you had more sleep than me. Really? Okay. And I thought, okay, I have to really get some air, because usually you don't get this kind of air. No. You've been here for how many days? Two. Okay. It wasn't that bad. Just get, it gets really hot in here. Today it's so ideal. Um. That's usually very humid here. Yeah, I don't like it that much. And I thought, oh, it's so, I feel like childhood or something. It's so far away. And I actually shot this film in the, in the house by this amazing artist in Germany, and she was married to Karl-Heinz Stockhausen, you know? No, I don't know. The composer. He's so, he's actually probably the most famous German composer of the second half of the 20th century. And he, he, he was, he's very well known for his tonal music, you know, like first. Atonal music? Yeah. Yeah. And, and, and, um, did all his first electronic works, and, uh. And this house is totally incredible. And I'm not, I'm not watching this film that I shot there. But I, I don't, I can't do it today. Yeah, I can see that you're having a hard time. So I want to write the name of this composer down. I should check it out. He did a lot of, a lot, a lot of theory. Can you, can you write his name? I don't even know what your name is. Katerina. Katerina, I'm James. You too. I think that's the best way to meet people. You talk to them for a long time and then you, and you forget that you didn't know their name. It means that you're having a good conversation. Do you think this girl, it's accident that she's got pink and pink? She meant to do that. No, she meant to do that. Deliberately. It was a pure accident. Yeah, but she has been adapted. Oh, what? You don't like, you like lycra, pink and pink? Yeah, it's this thing, like not a lot of girls that look like prostitutes. Yeah, it's amazing in Ukraine you see these women that look like they should be catwalk models with these hideous men. Absolutely revolting. Oh, yeah. It's, that's, that's, yeah, it's weird, right? Mm-hmm. In Russia also. How did that happen? Vodka. Vodka. Not fast food compared to me. But then why are the women so attractive? They don't drink or eat sausages? No, no, really good medical. Really? How old are you? 28. I don't know. I'm not 35 yet. I say like seven years. What happens when you're 35? I don't know. No, no. My parents are not, I mean you see it. Well, here also women, they get over 50. Like Russians. Babushka. But my parents are slim. Your parents what? They're slim, they're not me. Mm-hmm. So it's, I don't know, it's true. Mm-hmm. Well, whatever it is, it's good. And you've been out at night? Yeah, we went last night. No, it was fun. Really? Yeah, of course. Well, it's like, I think whenever I'm traveling I'll go to clubs I would never go to back home. So, you know, in Budapest we went to these ridiculous clubs. You know, it's fun. I just like to throw myself into things and not be too judgmental. Just experience whatever there is for what it is. But yeah, we had a lot of fun actually. The one boat we went to had like gypsy music, really good music. We went to this, I don't know, campus. Beer festival or something? No, no, no, no. It's in a village outside and all these gypsies playing. What is it called? Is it a festival? Yeah, yeah, it was like two weeks ago. Okay, next year. Oh yeah, it's kind of crazy. And a lot of foreigners, they're kind of jamming together. I know, it's like our commodity, you know. You have to be a good ambassador if you don't remember. Bad Serbian. I'm such a bad ambassador. Maybe think of something else and then it will come to you. These women, these guys. Of course they do. Don't be shy. Thank you so much. Are you ashamed? Yeah. Okay, can you write it down for me? All right, next year I'm going. I think, yeah, you'd probably like to be playing. I mean, it's comfort and food is perfect. And all these bands are there. All these gypsies are all there. They're all playing together. A lot of foreigners. Awesome. Maybe we can walk. I don't know. What are you going to do? I would love to, but I should probably get back to my friends. But they're here. No, they're wandering around. But I have to, because I'm kind of the guide. Really? Why? Well, because I've been here before. They haven't been here. They're just everywhere. They're like my children. I like them together. Yeah, maybe we can meet later tonight if you're not busy. What if I don't fall asleep? Well, if you fall asleep, you fall asleep. Yeah, so what's with your, how do you stay in contact? Do you have a local phone? Do you have a number? Really? Wow. It's quite easy. Really? You can call and say, can I have a SIM card? Yeah, yeah, cool. Because I know that you're not going to call an Australian number, so that would be... No, I can, yeah, it's not a problem. I can give you my, I can give you money to ring me. Good thinking. Katarina. Katarina. You don't spell it like the Russians, do you? With A, yeah. They say it with E, but it's with A instead of E. At the end? No, in the... K-E. K-A-T-A. Oh, okay. And your number? So it's plus three at one. I don't need that, it's local. Yeah, okay, that's right. 064. You don't live here anymore, do you? Yeah. 064. Yep. 63. I can call you now, just so you have my number. Right? Have I got the name? Yes, it's Jax. Yeah, okay. I, I, like, I would expect people should forgive me for not remembering their names here, because they have six syllables and sound very strange, but mine's very simple. It is. Yes, it's Jax. Cool, which way are you going? Yonder. Yonder. All right, I think my friend's somewhere. Yeah. Well, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. See you later. Yeah, definitely. Enjoy the rest of your cruise. Yeah, you too. When we see each other, maybe we'll be more like humans. Yeah, well, we are humans now. Sort of. Ciao. See ya."}
