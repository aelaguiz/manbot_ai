We had the Christmas lunch and as soon as it finished, I went, guys, I'm going to bed. I love you all. And I left Christmas dinner. So as an introvert, you should know that, yeah, okay, you need to go and make powerful impacts with people and then bail. Yeah, it's like you will need to commit time and you will need to make sure that if you want to bring someone into your social world or go into their social world that you make regular proper contact. So that comes down to, it doesn't matter how much time you spend with somebody, it matters the intensity of the time you spend with them. And that goes for girls as well. Going on four dates with a girl where you sit and talk and talk and talk and talk is way worse than going on two short dates with her and then pulling her home and fucking her. All right? Because if I just spend lots of not great quality time with her, the time that's not exciting or erotic, then the extra time doesn't help. Whereas if I spend a short amount of time with somebody and we have, sometimes I've sat with someone for 30 minutes and they've left a dent on me or me on them that you know is just like, they're like, whoa, oh yeah. And it was 30 minutes, but it was 30 good minutes. So for the introvert, what you want to think of is I used to go to parties and I would only go for one hour. When I was out cold approaching at night, now there was a period where I would just went out all night, every night, but then, but other times when I just didn't, I wasn't feeling sociable, I would just go out at 11 peak time, roll up, do two sets, go home. Half an hour in the club or half an hour, or, you know, someone invited me to a picnic and I'm like, ah, people, I don't want to deal with people. Just fucking slap your face, go and smile, say hi to people, play one game of Frisbee and then go home. And you're allowed to, when it was awesome, once I started realizing you could send girls home or you could go home whenever you wanted from anything, anything. I did it at Christmas, had a headache cause I was jet lagged, had a headache, felt shit. The fires were burning in Australia and there was smoke everywhere. We had the Christmas lunch and as soon as it finished, I went, guys, I'm going to bed. I love you all. And I left Christmas dinner because I can. So as an introvert, you should know that, yeah, okay, you need to go and make powerful impacts with people and then bail. That's totally fine. But you need to cycle. You can't take three, six months of just being your introverted self in your bedroom and then come out for a week and expect it to happen. No. Whatever it is that introverts have to do to just fucking pick themselves up and go, come on, I'm a human. I am a human. Those are humans. They interact usually. I can do this. Roll over and go, hey, how you doing? I'm going to stick around for 10 minutes at this party. Yep. I'm very agitated and now I'm going to leave. That's fine. But you just do that regularly and then take people away one-on-one if that's where you better operate. Shay does that all the time. Shay and I have been friends for 20 years and we've been in every social scenario together. Every social scenario, including BDSM dungeons and Iwashka in the Amazon and cool parties and whatever. Shay's an introvert. Shay doesn't like crowds. Shay doesn't, he's not like super outgoing and vivacious in a social sense, but what Shay loves to do and he's great at is to talk to a person. I've seen this so many times at a party or something. Maybe I'm playing in the band or I'm being a bit more outgoing and Shay's usually in a corner talking to one girl or one dude or a couple of people and you see him just floating around the event. He's not hiding. He's just like not in the middle of everything, but he goes and he meets people, he engages with them and then you can see, you look over and you're like, they've been locked in a full-on Shay ranty chant for 20 minutes over at that party because the guy's just like, his beer's gone flat and he's like, it's all lies. That's a different way of connecting with somebody and it's equally as valid and in some ways more powerful or some circumstances more powerful than the Gareth Jones who's very outgoing and go and chats and goes and chats with everybody. If you're an introvert like me and you need your alone time, but you're also sometimes interested in spending time with creatures of the human female species, then perhaps you should consider joining us for our iconic live workshops held throughout Europe next year coming soon, 2021, wow, that's really going to be a thing as me and the crew hit the road again and teach guys who really want to make the change and go out there and meet people, be effective with it, get dates, get lovers, and then also be able to go and spend time just chilling by yourself, then check out the link below. Workshops coming 2021, peace."}
