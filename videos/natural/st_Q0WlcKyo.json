This is absolute gold. So practice this. Do it. It's going to help you a lot. So here we are. You're in the moment. You're experiencing what you are. First thing is, can you accept that you are what you are? You are who you are. And that doesn't mean that you're limited in that. That doesn't mean you don't change from that. That doesn't mean that nothing's possible from that place. But what that does mean is that you can start from where you are. That's a good place to start. Because imagine you're trying to play a video game and you're already disappointed that you're not at the end of the game. You're not going to be able to play the game. You have to start where you are. You have to be the player in the moment. You have to pick up the controls. And you have to start to realize, okay, this is where I am. What's the next thing? What's the next thing? What's the next thing? So we start with where we are and then we start moving. So what are you moving towards? Well, I'm guessing, as most guys are, you're moving towards trying to feel more confident. You're moving towards trying to feel more powerful. You're moving towards trying to have more success inside your life, whatever that is for you. Maybe you want to be more artistic. Maybe you want to be more financially successful. Maybe you want to be more sexually abundant. Maybe you want to feel like you're more of a boss in your life. That's all desires that are arising out of wanting to improve yourself, wanting to be more of what it is you want. And if you pay attention, all of those desires, all of those things that you're wanting are based on being resourceful, feeling resourceful, and then being able to take resourceful actions. Being able to walk up to a woman and say, hi, I've seen you and I just wanted to come and say whatever, or excuse me, you are whatever, takes resources. You have to come from a place of resourcefulness. So if that's what we want in practical terms, confidence, expression, ability to be ourselves, okay, then we have to start with part of the new context is realizing there's a short game and there's a long game. The short game of where you are is what are you doing in this moment that you can help yourself to be able to change, to help yourself to be able to feel fulfilled, to help yourself to be able to feel alive. Now, what I can do in the moment, for example, is I can start to appreciate things. I can start to pay attention to what's actually happening. Because for example, right now I'm walking around the park. I could be in like hunter mode of like, oh, I've got to go and find hot chicks. I've got to go and get something. I'm going to, you know, get somewhere so that I can be satisfied. Or even if maybe I want to go and do a workout or something. And I'm like, I want to go and do the workout so that I can get strong. So I can be the guy who has the body or be the guy who has the power. So then I'm creating this kind of like image in my head of where I should be, which takes me away from what is. I'm not appreciating the trees. I'm not appreciating the air. I'm not appreciating the cute little dogs across the river. I'm not appreciating being present even here with my cameraman, for example. So I miss all this rich reality that's going on because I'm somewhere else trying to be something else. And that's based on, you know, who I think I should be yet again, which is often based on the conditioning that I've received, the hypnosis that affects me, the things that are coming into my mind. So the first thing is I want to get present with what is. I want to start to appreciate what is, appreciate my senses, appreciate the way that I feel, appreciate the incoming experience, not based on good and bad that comes from my ideology, but just based on raw experience. Then what can start to happen is I can start to feel more comfortable inside myself because I choose to. I can start to feel more comfortable inside myself because I'm training myself to be more comfortable. So in the short term of this work, let's say of actualization of liberation, you can do lots of little things like I can be aware. Where is my focus right now? Am I focused on not positive things or positive things? Right now my focus is on my chest, feeling open, feeling relaxed. My focus is on transmitting information to you so that you can receive the best possible change from what I'm trying to express here. And that comes with feeling. So I'm feeling what do I need to feel inside my body to be able to express that to you so that you can have as much as possible a genuine interaction with me, even though we're having a sort of digital experience. So that starts to create yet again, a context of me feeling like, cool, I have a purpose, I have a goal. And that's ultimately coming from what is. Because what is, is this amazing big vast moment, which is a mystery. I don't know what that is. It's just happening. It's beautiful. It's a mystery. It's unfolding. But within that large mystery is the small details of like, okay, I've got to make sure I put my feet in front of each other. I'm going to make sure that I keep saying the words and paying attention and being relaxed. And so I'm paying attention to what needs to happen next. So this is the same thing for you guys out in the field. What do you need to pay attention to, to make yourself more effective? Do you pay attention to feeling relaxed in your body? Or do you pay attention to feeling anxious in your body? Do you pay attention to how you could create an amazing boy meets girl moment that blows her away and makes her feel good? Or you focus on, she's going to reject you and you're not going to know what to say. And it's going to be awkward. And this is going to remember, it's going to remind you of all the uncomfortable feelings that you don't want to feel. Are you able to create a sense of an outcome that is meaningful to you? Or are you aimlessly just walking around trying to replicate something that you've seen somebody else do, but you don't even know why you're really doing it. These are all things to be very aware of. In the moment, you can change things. So set yourself a positive outcome. For example, notice how to feel relaxed in the body. Start to create a context where it's possible to be able to do the things you want to do. I'm giving you gold here, gentlemen. This is absolute gold. So practice this. Do it. It's going to help you a lot. Now there's a lot more details to that, but what I've given you is already enough to start to work with. The next thing, after you have started to work with the moment, is recognizing that you're also working with a larger process. This is a process. Transformation is a process. Changing your personality is a process. Becoming a whole, powerful, masterful man is a process. You were not born a mature man. And guess what? Many men are not mature as well. There's plenty of old men that are basically little boys in an old man's body because they're not mature. They never developed maturity. They never developed a mature mindset or a mature understanding of things. And in the past, and I shouldn't even say in the past, because it's not just in the past, but there are teachings that are available that begin with recognizing that the world is basically a good place. Everything's basically good. Everything's full of richness and possibility. And we can start to acknowledge and appreciate. We can acknowledge and appreciate the world around us, the air, the water, the sun, the earth, the different experiences that are going on, the people, the music. Everything around us is having an influence. It's helping us. And if we choose to be part of that, to appreciate that, then we can start to become part of that larger process, which brings me to the important point that in the process, it's the long game. So the short game is you being here now, focusing on what you can focus on to create something different from the context of what's really going on. The long game is recognizing you're part of a larger cycle of experience, of unfolding creation, and it's doing something amazing. And you can be part of that larger whole. And yet again, this is a very big, amazing thing to start to think about. This can open your mind to a completely different context, a completely different set of feelings and language and understanding and realities that are right in front of your eyes, but you often don't pay attention to, because we're so often stuck in what we think we should be doing and how society tells us to live. So it's a huge thing that one of your biggest enemies, in my opinion, is the neurotic mind. It's not to say that your mind is the enemy. It's not to say that you don't need a mind, but having a mind that is constantly pulling things apart and analyzing and constantly trying to work things out stops you from having a direct experience with what is. You're part of a larger cycle of experience, of unfolding creation, and it's doing something amazing to start to think about. And yet again, this is a very big, amazing thing to start to think about. And yet again, this is a very big, amazing thing to start to think about."}
