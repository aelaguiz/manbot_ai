I'm teaching you how to gaslight people so that you can... Oh, I'm so good at it! Oh, you are? I'll be watching you. Have you gaslit me already and I didn't notice? Yes, of course. You already believe me. You've already... You're already questioning my obscenity. Yeah, but... Oh, I did that years ago. I gave up questioning. I'm like, definitely insane. Okay, then I can gaslight you pretty easily. Oh, no. Sometimes maniacs are very good at, like, reading the social media. Hi, how are you? I'm fine, thank you. Good. Are you in a rush somewhere? Yeah, I'm going to meet my boyfriend in, like, two seconds. Two minutes. Two seconds? Two minutes? Yeah. Okay, cool. I'm actually going to a bar with him. It's kind of nice. You're going to a bar now? Mm-hmm. Are you starting early? Well, I finished all my exams, so I have literally nothing to do. All right. Well, then you can celebrate. Thank you. Have a nice day. See ya. Excuse me. Hello. Hello. Hi. How are you? I'm fine, thank you. Good. Are you in a rush somewhere? Yeah. How are you? I'm fine, thank you. You look wonderful. You have very nice eyes. Are you a bit shy? I thought so. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. All right. Let's go. Hi. Hi. Hi. You're in your zone, obviously. Yeah, yeah, so much. I'm looking at wedding photos. Who's getting married? Where's my sister? Oh, show me one. Oh, okay. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Are you ready? Yes, I am ready. I'm ready. Oh, show me one. Oh, okay. You went to the wedding, obviously. Of course I was like a maid of honor, you know. Ah, congratulations sister. Let me show you. It was like a Hungarian village-y type of wedding or no? Yes, it was at Lake Balaton. Ah, lovely. So this is a really great picture. Which one's you? Hang on. Zoom it. That's me. That's me. Wow, she's got hot friends and family. Yes, right. Nice. What's your name? Hi, I'm James. Hi. Are you going to a sport thing? Or no, you're just... I'm going to the gym, yeah. Okay. Yeah. What are you going to do there? Workout. Yeah, I know. But like, are you like a powerlifter or do you do Pilates? No, I'm a bodybuilder. Awesome. What do you do? I'm an olive farmer and a life coach. Wow, nice. Yeah. I live here sometimes and sometimes in Portugal. Portugal? Yeah. Nice. I'd love to visit Portugal sometimes. It's gorgeous. It's Mediterranean. It's beautiful all year round. People are chill. Not grumpy. And the wine is good, right? The wine is all good and really cheap. Like, it's hard to get one that's not good. It's hard to get one that's not good. Yeah. Like, it's hard to get one that costs more than 5 euros. They're all very good. Yeah, but Hungarian wines are good. A bit sweet for my liking. Really? You like the sweet wines better? Yeah, actually. And dry. Sweet and dry? Sweet and dry. Well, that covers all of them. Yeah, it's like me. I'm sweet and dry. Sweet and dry. Like a dry sense of humor? Kind of, yeah. Right, like a bit reserved sometimes? No, I'm really outgoing. Okay. Yeah, that's why I'm talking to you right now. Yeah, it's not common for Hungarians to talk to strangers. No, especially Hungarian girls. Yeah. Yeah. Why? They can be reserved, or they don't speak English. Yeah, okay. But why do you think they're reserved? What's the cause? Well, they don't like strangers. Right. Foreigners, especially. I mean, it's no offense, but it's the truth. I don't take it personally. They just don't like all the rest of the planet. Exactly, yeah. Only their girlfriends, that's all. That kind of limits you a little, right? I know, but I don't like to be limited, so I'm different. Yeah. Awesome. I'm not like the Hungarian girls. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I was like, look out. I saved your life very slowly. Because eventually that car will move. Yeah, I believe you. But you might be gone by then. And that one as well. Thank you so much, thank you. You're welcome. My job is to save people the things that might happen in the future, if they stay here. Yeah, you're like, did you see Twilight? Like Edward Cullen, when he stopped the car? Oh, right. Well not as cool as that, but... Yeah but almost. We can imagine. I like that you have an imagination. Alright, so it's a sun and a moon and a... No, it's a triple moon. So it's the faces of the moon. It looks like a weapon that I used to train with in China. It's called a monk's spade. Yeah, they have these crescent blades. And then you have a stick down the middle and another blade there. Everybody says it looks like a candy. Like a candy. But everybody knows... People see what they want to see. Yeah, that's true. Yeah, I saw a Chinese weapon and you're like, nah man. No, I don't know that one. It's a rose. I know, but... Well, it's my favourite flower, so... It's a bit clich\u00e9, but I love it. I had it made when I was 18, so I was a bit reckless and impulsive. I've seen way worse reckless 18-year-olds. I know, I know, like... Very regrettable ones. Especially the... Yeah, yeah, yeah. The tramp stamp. Tramp stamp, yeah. Which is a great name, really. It's like... Yeah. It really does kind of describe it. A yin-yang in the tramp stamp spot. Yeah, or like, you know, the forever sign. Yeah, someone's name. For a horse. No bad idea. No, no way. Very bad idea. I would never. But I actually have a friend tattoo, like, with my friends, which is also risky, but I love them to death, so... Oh, you let them experiment on you? Actually, yeah. My friend made this one, this one, and this one as well, so... That's pretty good, like, for an experiment. I know, right? Like, the line work. And it's hard to do. Is it an actual circle? Yeah, it is, but it's just my biceps that... It's just so big that they distort the circle. Yeah, it distorts it. But it's actually a stick and poke, so... Oh, really? It'll take a long time. Okay, that's... Like, for a stick and poke, that's... Very good. They'd do well in prison. They'd be popular in prison. I know, I know, but it wasn't meant for prison, trust me. Okay, right. So you'd... Yeah, right. I figured you'd probably... No, I've never been to prison. Someday. We can hope. Yeah, no. No, I've also never been to prison. I'm good at lying, so... Are you? They won't catch me. Right. So is everything you've told me a lie or a truth? Maybe. Maybe half and half? You can never know. You can never know. Well, I don't think you lied to me about anything important, except maybe you weren't at that wedding at all. Exactly. Maybe I was the bride. Maybe you're one of those weirdos who just, like, looks at other people's weddings and thinks, I was there. Oh my god, this is so creepy. It's a bit creepy. I don't know. Maybe I haven't been in prison. Maybe it's crazy. It's an elegant prison tattoo. Yeah. The other one that, yeah, you definitely don't want is barbed wire. That was big in, like, early 2000s, like, having a barbed wire. In Australia, a lot of people had that. Yes, I know, but no, no, no. No. I'm not that bad. No, none of those are too cringe. But I didn't regret any of my tattoos. I mean, haven't yet. What's the point? In fact, or, actually, it's good to, like, later in life, think back on regretting your tattoos and it's, like, the story of your life. Yeah, exactly. Even if, like, I get bored of it, it's like a memory, you know? So it has a value, definitely. Yeah. It's a time stamp. Exactly. And because they're small, you know, I don't mind them. Yeah, you can cover up if you need to go to church or whatever. Yeah, like at the wedding, you know? Oh, yeah, right, right, right. Yeah, I actually have one, very large one, but it's on my back and I forget that I have it often. But it's there. It's there. You don't like it? No, no, no. I thought about it for years and I'm only, like, I'm one of those rare people who literally only got one tattoo. Yeah. And is happy with it. But it's weird because what happened to me is that I got one and I got off the rails and I want more and more. You didn't get too off the rails. You don't have any tears, like, tattooed to your face. Yeah, true. But I do want more. Like, new ones as well. Where? That's the good question. That's the thing I don't know. Let me see your shoulder blades. My shoulder blades. Okay, yeah, because that's, like, you've got nice, muscular shoulders, so that's why. Yeah, I would love that there, but my problem is that I wouldn't see it. Or even on my neck or something, but I can see it. Yeah. I'm kind of glad of that because I forget and then sometimes I catch myself in the mirror and I'm like, oh yeah, I'm one of those tattoo guys. Cool. And I don't want to cover up my muscles because, you know, I do fitness competitions and on the stage, if they don't see my muscles well, that's a disadvantage. Right, well, that's the whole point, isn't it? For them to see. That's right. So I cannot cover it up with tattoos because it's not beneficial. So are you, do you do competitions where you have to, like, shred yourself down unhealthily? Yes, that's right. Right. But I'm not in that phase right now. Right, you can eat at the moment. Yes. That's why I'm not shredded to the bone. Right. And you know that, oh, there's a guy just throwing a sink around. You have to save my life again. Oh, look out, there's a guy throwing a sink. Oh, thanks. Just stay there and don't, like, jump in front of it. That's kind of an odd sink. Like, it doesn't make much sense, but I like it. Even the kitchen sink was thrown in. Do you know that saying? No, what does it mean? It's such a dorky dad saying. What is it? It's like, and the kitchen sink. It's like you're, like, throwing everything in and the kitchen sink. Right. But, like, in a conversation or? What would be the, no, no, it's not, it's a metaphor. So I'm just trying to think of a context where I would say it. Well, I kind of have a grasp of it, but I couldn't explain. Yeah, it's like, okay, this person, like this, let's say we were having a fight and I brought up all the things you did wrong. That's right. All of them. And even that one. Remember that thing you did with the. Even threw in the kitchen sink. Right, and threw in the kitchen sink. Right. Something like that. I haven't used it in so long that I think I might be teaching it to you wrong. No, no, no, because I can imagine, because I know quite many idioms in English, but this one I've never heard. What's another one you know? Oh, my God, I know so many, like once in a blue moon. Oh, that's a good one. Once in a blue moon. Have you ever seen a blue moon? Yeah, or like curious to kill the cat. Yes, that's true. Like the ones with cats I love. All right. I have a very curious cat. Really? Yeah, yeah, she lives with me on the farm. I never liked cats and she just turned up one day. Like literally just turned up and was like, I'm not leaving her yet. And then one day, because she like climbs on top of the roof, she's a badass. And then she just fell off one day and landed on a rock and broke her ribs. Oh, no. And almost punctured her lung like that close and would have killed her. But then she's got like eight more lives. She has nine lives. Yeah, she's fine. So basically she had to be locked in a really flat space for three weeks so she didn't jump on shit. She was bored. But then you got to make up for her, right? And now she's back tougher than ever. Well, I had a lot of visitors and I looked after her because I was away. And now she's fine. She's a badass. What kind of farm do you have? Well, it's kind of like a hobby farm, which is like, I'm not trying to make, you know, live off it. But it's like, I have lots of olives. And so I make nice olive oil. And I have gardens and I have goats and chickens and geese. And I plant a lot of trees. And I use it as a retreat space as well. So people come and do meditation type of stuff. So when are you there and when are you in Budapest? Well, on and off, kind of like. I come here to do work and I've got friends here. And I lived here on and off for eight years. And then I go to the farm whenever I can. So I'm going tomorrow. I'll go for a couple of weeks. I'll be back here in a couple of weeks. Oh, that's so nice. You're going for the summer. Going what? For the summer. In and out, like, yeah. I mean, I'm a European now. So I left Australia a long time ago. Right. And so now I belong here. You were born there. Yeah, I was in Australia most of my life. But I moved to Europe, like, I don't know, ten years ago. And you have a farm in Portugal, right? Yeah, yeah. Okay, so I got every information. Oh, you got, like, hang on. I'm sorry, I just had an exam, so my brain is pretty slow. And my cognitive functions. It's pretty fast. And the fact that you know how to say cognitive functions means that it's doing very well, actually. It's true. It's just because, like, English is my second mother language to me. I mean, your word choice tells me that you're more fluent than the average Australian is in there. Really? Yes. Wow. They don't know how to say cognitive function. Cognitive is fucking brain smart. That's how they say it. Yeah, you see? And I even know idioms. Yeah, the fact that you know what an idiom is, and you can come up with one simply. But it's because I teach English, actually, to, like, students and kids. So, in that way, I also teach myself. Yeah, that's the best way to learn is to teach. I know. Well, first you have to learn a bit. The pinnacle of learning. First you imitate, and then you say it out loud, you practice it, and then when you teach it, you really know. Totally. So that's why I do it. You have multiple facets. That's very true. I'm a multivalent person, if there is a word like that. What did you say? Multi-what? Multivalent. Like, ambivalent, but, like, multivalent. Because ambivalent is, like, two... I think you made up a word, multivalent. Yeah, I know, but... Which is cool. Let's put it in the Urban Dictionary. But I'm not ambivalent because I don't only have two... How do you say that? Like, two sides. As in you're not, like, an introvert or an extrovert, or analytical or rational. Yeah, but I have multiple facets, like you said. Yeah. I also have multiple personalities. I mean, facets. And which one am I meeting right now? They're, like, chill, having a hot chocolate, walking around, waiting for a friend. It's hot chocolate in this weather. Well, yes. Yes. Was that the best idea? I don't know. But it's you. Well, it's just, like, I like hot chocolates, and I didn't consider the weather. And I'm okay with it. But you can have cold chocolates. I know. Like, cold. I know, I know. Oh, this bee. Come on, dude. Get out of the way. Get out of the way. You're saving everyone's life. Yeah, well, what can I do to save him? Just stay there until you figure it out. Yeah, you're a savior. I like certain types of insects, and bees are very important. That's true. Extremely important. I mean, they can sting you. Yeah, but without them, we're all dead. Yeah, you're right, actually. We're all dead. Of course. Like, in about a year or two, we're dead. I got three types of bees on my farm. Yeah, I thought so. Normal bees, bumblebees, and black bumblebees, which are really rare. Like, big, fat, black bees, they're cool. So you have also that, like, outfit. I do, but I haven't learned how to beekeep yet. So I got the suit, so I looked the part. But you have to learn now when you're going. Yeah, like, it is time to set up the beehive, because there's lots of old villagers who will teach me the ways, because there's ways of bees. So your farm is, like, in the countryside, right? Oh, yeah. It's like, I mean, it's maybe 30 minutes from the nearest big city, but it feels like you're in the middle now, which is good for me, because I have a very, very crazy city life, and so I need to go back there to decompress. I can understand that. I would need a farm, too. Yeah, with my life, for sure. But in Budapest, it's not, like, such a huge metropolitan city. No, and it's easy. It's a green city. It is really, like, especially now, it's, like, not very nice. Where do you live? Near to Ferenciaktere. Oh, so you're close. Yeah, yeah. And you? I live in the 13th district. Is that on this side or the other side? It's on this side. It's not so far from here. Like, past Blaha, that's, like, another direction. Yeah, I mean, it's the other way. It's, like, almost on the riverbank. You know, Jaslein Square, Jasleinoy Square. Yeah. And the Margaret Bridge, Market Island, near that. Oh, that's a nice area, for sure. Are you, like, original Budapestian? Actually, no. No, I'm from, like, a smaller town, but I've moved here, like, seven years ago. Shake my hand again. Oh, yeah, that's a country handshake. I know. It's firm. It's good. And determined. Firm and determined. Yeah. Firm and determined. I recently figured out the handshake of the Portuguese villagers, right? Because they do it like this. They go like this, and they don't look you in the eye until they trust you, right? Oh, wow. Because I went in all, like, Australian, like, yeah, mate, with an eye contact. Yeah, mate. And they're like, oh, no, we don't trust this guy. And so I figured out you've got to go like that. It's just, it's soft, but it, like, there's a lot of subtlety in it. Right. I mean, it takes a while, and you're just one. And then I noticed after about five of those, they would start to glance up at me, and that's when we know that maybe they think it's all right. And now they give me a little glance, and now we're okay. But, like, you do it with, like, you're too mad. Hang on, now, let me feel it. Yeah, you're too mad, but it's like, no, you're doing it like... No, it's like, it's low, it's kind of like loose and, yeah, but you're too stressed, you've got to relax the arm. There's so much nuance to it. All right, one more time. Bon dia, to the bank, let it drop, let it drop, yeah. It's just like, it's like a lazy drop on the moon. It's not easy, right? Because I'm very firm, and actually, like, in Hungarian traditions, you have to have a firm handshake and look straight into the eye, because that's when they know that you're, like, trustworthy. Yeah, it's the same in Australia. It's like, hey, mate, fucking... Oh, hang on, you go, bang, there you go, that's not what you got. Yeah, fucking, how you going? So that, how you going? How you going? How you going? How you going? Going, yeah. It's really not English. How you going, mate? Mate, you know mate, right? Yeah, mate, I know. So it's, how you going, mate? How you going, mate? But the T is, like, almost implied. Yeah, right. How you going, mate? Wow. So we just massacre the language until it's unrecognizable. Exactly, but yours is understandable. I had to learn English when I moved to Europe. So that people understand. Yeah, I very much enunciate my words here in a way that I wouldn't in Australia, because they would think I was a bit too, you know, fucking being to university or something. Have you, mate? Fucking chill out. Yeah, it's a different kind of, it's not dialect. And do you speak Hungarian? Oh, God, no. I, no. When I first moved here, I attempted for a bit, and then I went, this is impossible and useless, no offence. So I started learning Portuguese instead. Portuguese is nice. Okay, I mean, I'm no. I'm functionally basic kindergarten level of... That's good. I can get by. Yeah, I can't do idioms, that's for sure. Oh, no, I've got one idiom. One idiom, which my farmer, like, the guy who's my gardener, he says, N\u00e3o trabalho, n\u00e3o comido, which is no work, no food. Oh, that's nice, you know everything. And I'm like, cool, all right. So that's an idiom, right? That counts? Oh, nice. Like, I really only know, like, one idiom for you. To the boing, which is like, how you going. To the boing. And it depends if you're in Brazil or in Portugal, they say it differently. Yeah, yeah, I know. To the boing. I was in Brazil recently, and I learned way more there because they speak slow and cool. Nice. So you're, like, a global citizen, right? I'm very global. Like, no, I'm traveling a lot for work and play and learning. But, like, you do this live coaching online, or? Online and live. So I do live workshops in different countries, here, Barcelona, New York, Australia, and then online stuff. And then, look, I only work maybe, I don't know, six, five, six months a year, and then I do whatever other things I want to do. You've got to figure it out. Finally, yes. Nice. I would love to be a live coach one day as well, but, like, who would believe a 24-year-old girl who just graduated university? It depends, because you've got, like, you have, what did you say? Firmness and certainty or something? Determination. People believe people that sound like they have authority and have enough life experience to be able to, you know, impart something. There is actually an expression to that, but I can only tell you in Hungarian. Try to do a direct translation that sounds funny. It's like, um, um, I don't know. It's like, well, you only believe people who have authority. Like, you believe something, like, more to a doctor. Yes. If they say you have an illness than if your sister says you have an illness. Right, so, yes. People believe qualified people? That's right. Is that the same? Even if they... Even if they don't. Right, right, and even if they're talking about something that they're not actually qualified in. So, they're a doctor, but they give you advice on buying crypto or whatever. Um, it's... It sounds more eloquent in Hungarian, right? Yeah, this word is on my tongue, but I... On the tip of your tongue? On the tip of my tongue, yeah. It's the colonel effect. Oh, the colonel effect? Yeah. Okay, right, so if someone's a colonel in the army, you're like, yes, sir, I believe you. Exactly. Which crypto, which altcoin should I buy? Even if they have no knowledge. But that's the same with, like, economists, which I am, that people believe us. It doesn't make any sense. What advice do they ask you for? Like, you know, what to invest in, or how to do accounting for their companies. And even if, like, I don't know shit about it, because economists are like that, that they don't know anything about. Because they're too theoretical. And we actually... We understand everything, but at the same time, nothing. Because we don't get deep into anything. Like the philosophers of the financial world. Yes, and we can talk about it for hours, but it doesn't make any sense. It doesn't help you make money. But we can believe that it makes sense. Well, the advice you can give them is this. Buy low, sell high. Yeah, if it's possible. They'll never... That's good advice. That is good advice. And our favorite expression is, it depends. It definitely depends. Should I do this? It's going to depend on all sorts of things, which... Yeah, yeah, yeah. This or that. Yeah, so... You'll be an okay lifeguard. Or you could be, like, a fortune teller, because they do this or that, or... It's very likely, but it could be something else. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's also philosophical activity. You're definitely going to meet a man called Istvan at some point, when you live in Budapest. Wow. That will definitely happen. I promise that a lot. If it hasn't already, right? It has happened, haven't you? You've met an Istvan? No, but not in Budapest. Yeah, but I also did say... I think I said close to, or in the region. No, no, no, you said in Budapest. Oh, I'm sure I certainly said that. I remember. Don't gaslight me, please. I'm teaching you how to gaslight people, so that you can... Oh, I'm so good at it. Oh, you are? I'll be watching you. Have you gaslit me already and I didn't notice? Yes, of course, you already believe me, so... You've already... You're already questioning your sanity. Oh, I did that years ago. I gave up questioning. I'm, like, definitely insane. Okay, then I can gaslight you pretty easily. Oh, no. Sometimes maniacs are very good at, like, reading the social matrix. I know. What flavour is that? It's, uh, lemonade. Mmm. It's kind of... It's weird. Yeah. But I like it. Yeah, of course you do, because it's packed full of nicotine, and now... And nicotine is the most addictive drug on the planet. Yeah, I'm addicted to it. Everyone now. Especially with these lolly... Well, candy vapes, we would say. Yes, yes, yes. But I could give up anytime. Oh, sure you could. Well, then how about you just don't smoke it for a whole day, but leave it right on your desk? Okay. I mean, no. Challenge accepted. Alright, so you'll get it... But you have to put it on the desk in 24 hours. Okay. And then you'll know if you are actually addicted or not. Okay. But you seem pretty disciplined. Yes, I am. And maybe the fact that there's now, like, a challenge will make it that you do do it. Is that right? Yes. Are you goal-orientated in, like, completing goals? Yes, because I'm very competitive. And if there's a challenge, I am determined to do it anyhow. And I... Maybe just have one more before you start. One more puff? No, no, no. I can start. I can go cold turkey anytime. Alright, nice. Respect for that. If I want to. Only if I want to. Or if I'm able to. Yeah, well, you'll find out in the next 24 hours. After 24 hours, you're going, Fuck that guy. Just grab one off someone on the street. Maybe you would never know, so... I'll... No, I won't. Even if you ask me in, like, 24 hours or call me or whatever, I would say, no, no, I haven't done it. Is that you lying? I mean, that was an obvious lie, so try and do it more convincingly. Because, like, it's got to sound, like, casual. Intentionally. Alright, alright. So, your name again was? So, did you smoke a vape in the last 24 hours? No, we haven't. Oh, that one there. That one there. Easy giveaway. Really? Yeah. Okay. It's got to be, like, you're kind of surprised that I'm even asking, but, like, not... No, that's too much. Just be like... Well, obviously, it's just... Oh, no, that one was a bit... No, you can't do that. Okay. Alright, so did you smoke a vape in the last 24 hours? No, I haven't. That's better. I might believe that. Really? Well... Less is more with a lie, for sure. Hey, alright. Is this all like, oh... But at the same time... You know this idiom? It's a Shakespearean one. Oh, right, yeah. Yeah, I've heard about it. Yeah. So, it's like when someone says, did you do the thing? Oh, absolutely did not. Oh, that's too much protesting. It's a telling sign, yeah. But at the same time, I also practice it in a way that you have to say a lot of details, because, you know, if someone suspects you're lying, they would be like, oh, you wouldn't know the details or wouldn't know some answers to the questions. Yeah, you do need the details. Yeah. So, I'm like, where did you put it? I put it on my writing desk. Like, whatever it is. Oh, you don't know what it's called? Hmm, that's very suspicious. Yeah, I know. Alright, so you left it there. Yeah. And were you tempted at any point? No, because I love the house. Oh, of course you would have been tempted. See, that's a lie. You had to fight temptation. Yeah, but I know myself that if I have to fight it, I leave the house. Oh, okay, alright. And I'm used to saying, oh, I love the house all day. Alright, so you left the house all day. So, I go around everything. And then when you came back, but like, was it in your mind a little bit when you were heading back? Yeah, because I saw it from a corner of my eye, but I was like, I gotta keep myself to it. Only two hours left. Right. Okay, that's, there you go. Those details work. That's believable. Yes. I have to be fast. Yeah, I mean, I'm watching. I know, I know. But if we're lying, you have to react really, really quickly. Right, yeah, you can't have a think about it and go... No, no, because if you think about it... No, it's gotta be, because it's like, you don't need to think about it, because you know it. Because it's the truth. Yeah, well, allegedly. Allegedly. Allegedly, oh, that's a good choice of word. Alright, excellent. But your real name is... It is. It is. Really? Hungarians gave someone a name... Well, it's Hungarian, but... It's better. I like it better, actually. Both are actually really pretty. I know, I know. I love it. But when I introduce myself to a foreigner, I would say just... Because then I can, you know, legitimately use it, because if I introduce myself to a Hungarian, I won't say... That's like... Oh, they think that you're being too snobby, or like you're trying too hard or something. Yeah, yeah, so that's... Right, so you use the opportunity to... Yeah, so I always tell them, don't call me... Alright. So call me... I will call you... Absolutely. Nice. Well, I gotta leave for the gym. Yes, yes. I have a time constraint. You have a time constraint. Yeah. Another nice choice of word. Alright, well, would you like to hang out when I'm back? Sure. Alright, do you have a WhatsApp or something? Yes, I do. Alright. I'm gonna give you my phone number. And you do remember my name, right? James. Nice one. I mean, it's pretty easy to remember, right? Yeah, I know. JJ. JJ. Yeah, the two of us, yeah. We have that on our tree. My memory is pretty good, so... Is it? Yes. Mine's... I just demonstrated it to you. You did? Yours is not good because you didn't remember. No, no, it's not that good. I have a lot to remember, alright, in life in general. Plus three six, right? Yes. Now you have to actually see if it's the right number. I don't have any Wi-Fi on me right now, so what I'll find out later... Yes, yes. I'll be like, goddammit, she learned too well. The student has beaten the master. I will be the one that got away. Alright, give us an Aussie. An Aussie one. Oh, I may? You may. Lovely to meet you. And then the Portuguese one. Oh, yes. And now we trust each other a little bit. A little bit. That was pretty good. You'll get away with that in the Portuguese countryside. Let's hope so when I get there. Alright. Well, have fun in Portugal. I will. See you soon. Bye. Alright, gentleman James Marshall on the streets of Budapest doing some more infield chatting to ladies types of stuff. Now, we just left the house and it was a morning-ish, my morning, and I was a bit rusty, and so I did a few warm-ups and three or four girls in a row went, eh, eh, eh. Which, for a lot of guys, would be the end of their day. It's just like, I went out and I sort of tried to say hi to a few people and they sort of blew me off or didn't take their headphones out and you're like, day game sucks, I'm a loser, or whatever, and then you don't do it. I didn't do that. What I did was keep going and then, very quickly, I met the right girl. So, as John Keegan says, you're not for everybody, everybody's not for you, and there'll be a whole bunch of people who just don't like the look of you, or they don't feel like talking to you, and that's their right, and their prerogative, and that's totally fine, and then you find someone that is for you and you have a nice chat. So, what can I say about that interaction? Right, so she had headphones in, that's the thing that most guys think you can't do anything about. You've got to wave, make some gesture, I think I did that, and then she's startled because she doesn't know what's going on, so allowing her time to go, what's happening? And then I said, you know, what are you doing? Listen to music, she says she's in her zone, she's in a big rush to go to the gym, I noticed she's wearing kind of gym clothes, so, you know, this shows some social ability, and yes, she's on her way, big rush to the gym, well, clearly not, because she spent 15 minutes or so, chatting to me, very awesome girl, with a good character, good, honest character, good handshake, strong handshake, the kind of woman that can match me, or can keep up with me, and that's the kind of girl I was looking for. So, that worked lovely, liked her a lot. I could quit right there, but I'll go and do more, because, you know, that's what I do. \u266a"}
