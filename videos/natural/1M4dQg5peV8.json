So I just had to come and say hi to you. What do you need? I wanted to come and get to know you, especially with eyes like those. I think TNL is not just about dating. Of course, it's still the core, but I love that, for example, I read many, many times now in the client files, when we ask them why they actually like us, they say it's because it's already more like a lifestyle design. We have to start from the beginning, from yourself, look into yourself and start the transformation from there. Once you have that, once you know more about yourself and once you improve your own personal skills as a human being, you can be more closer to yourself as to know what to offer to women. Hi, a stranger just arrived out of the blue and that is me. Hi, I'm Jonas. Yes. You're very beautiful. So are you going to McDonald's? No, I'm looking for iBooks. For what? iBooks, for paying my telephone. Ah, okay. That is a new concept for me. I have just arrived in Ukraine like five days ago. How does that work? It's like you tap up your SIM card. Yes, I need it. Is that because you're watching Netflix all the time, chilling? No. So you use up all the data? I'm kind of like in tourist mode right now. How old are you, excuse me? How old I am? I'm 39. What are you doing for fun? Studying. Excuse me, I need to go. You need to go? I'm serious. Before you go, do you want to meet up for coffee perhaps? Just be honest. Maybe, yes. It's possible. Do you have Instagram? Yes. We need to move fast. Okay, I hope it's not like super serious. It's not like someone isn't... Is it a broken heart? No. Ah, I think there's no internet. Esther, let me see. Well, I can do this. And later I... Okay. See you. What happened at the end? At the end? She said like there was something super serious, like super urgent. And her eyes kind of communicated that, okay, this is... Probably something bad news or something happened to her, right? You need to go? Like really in a hurry? I felt like I pushed it a bit by saying, okay, let's Instagram close. And she didn't have internet, so she got half my username. Well, and there is like... Why you didn't ask for her Instagram? Like her username as well. Because you can even open notes and save anything. Yeah, I know. If you don't have internet. I felt like, you know, I would start to diverge into like the territory of... How should I say? Disrespecting her time. But you did well. You went there. You approached and you stayed in it. You didn't let yourself just to get refused. And you didn't leave just because she was not open that much. And you still like tried to talk to her. She was curious about you as well. That's a good sign. She was asking you stuff. I feel like I was... Not letting the pressure build enough. I don't know if that's... You didn't really have time for that. Because it was like not settled. The whole thing was not settled. I don't know. She had like a... Not a committed energy to the conversation. Maybe she was already in a hurry. And you didn't kind of... You couldn't get her out from the space what she was in. Before you walked into her space. Yeah, that's it. Let's go and find someone. As I look at them. It's more like a spiritual path. And they are all warriors. And when you hear their feedback. Actually it's really touching. Because they say that maybe they can't sleep. They feel this restlessness in their body. For some reason. It's something so new. They never done before. And that's why the reaction. It's so deep. It's so down to their core. That we can't just say. It's about dating. Or seducing. Or approaching. It's a whole life transformation. Stop for one second. I have a telephone call. Can you call back? What? Can you call back? I saw you walking this way. And I thought you look absolutely stunning today. So I just had to call you. Thank you. Can you stop for a minute? What do you need? I wanted to come and get to know you. Especially with eyes like those. It's not for me. How about I walk with you? Because it looks like you are in a hurry. I have a telephone call. Is it your mom? No, it's my friend. He has a different period. Oh, is this your boyfriend? No, it's my good friend. That's good. Because you didn't break my heart immediately. I'll see you. Have a good day. Fucking great. Good job. That was a great one. Tell me. I think I could have extended it longer. I think... Tell me the good things. Let's just talk about the good things. Good things got her to stop. I got her to hang up the phone call too. Actually, the first time I've ever done that. That's fucking amazing, right? She was hella pretty. Hella, hella, hella pretty. What about her energy? It was good. What can you tell about her personality? She's confident. She's definitely a confident person. She had this little mischievous smile. This little playful smile. More, more, more. We can tell so much about this. Obviously, fashion conscious. She knows what's going on. She's social. She has her friend who's a guy, which is interesting. She's really open. Yeah. Kind, nice. Because she just stopped. Anne hung up the phone. One thing that was interesting is I perceived that she hung up the phone and she was like, what's going on? I have to punch it hard. You look absolutely stunning. I saw you walking this way and I thought you looked absolutely stunning today. So I just had to come and say hi to you. Because if I come in with like, you look kind of nice, she's going to be like, why the fuck did I hang up the phone for this? What we talked about. She's going to get 100, you look nice today. I think I could have actually been more energetic in that. In the interaction. Where I was like, you look stunning. It was perfect. Seriously, you don't have to act too much. This is what I'm talking about. Being the person who you are at the same time. You were smiling. I was watching you and your presence was really powerful but playful at the same time. So actually now you found the perfect balance in what we wanted to reach. What we just talked about. You're smiling but at the same time you look stunning today. Even when you throw in the breaking heart stuff again. It's just working. She said it's not her boyfriend. I think that was a misplay. I think I shouldn't have done that. Because that was actually what got her to walk away. She was like, oh it's my friend. I should have said, are you talking about something important? No, I loved it. I loved it. This is already very personal. You met her one minute ago and she's already not justifying but sharing such a personal information that, no, no, it's not my boyfriend. It's a good challenge you threw into that whole thing. It was great. Let's go. The guys who are coming to take the workshop. I don't think we can say that there is a group of people. They are all individuals. They have their own problems. All childhood experiences or life experiences. Every one of them is an individual. If I have to say one or two things what makes them similar to each other usually it's that they are so nice. Usually they don't know how to connect to their masculine energy and how to project their sexual intent and their sexuality to women through being so nice. Hi there. Are you in a call? Yes. I have one question. Can you call back? Yes, I'm free. Hi. Nice to meet you. I'm Jonas. Nice to meet you. Yes. You look like you're almost radiating this missing sun. No, I like sun but I don't see it. I'm sorry. Maybe if I go outside and I look like I need sun maybe it will arrive? Yes, you look like it. It's not going very well, is it? Oh, we're talking about weather. So where are you going? I'm going to meet my friend Oh, nice! That's basically your plan? Just to go for ice cream? Yes, why not? I love that. Is that like a 6-hour schedule? Like an ice cream meeting? Yes. Maybe more. Why not? Why not 3 or 4? You're here to visit Kim? Yes, yes. I mean, I'm actually staying for a while. For a while? I'm staying here for a month. Oh, a month? It's a little bit... Yeah, we can walk. Why not more? I like your attitude. That's the correct question. Where are you from? I'm from Denmark. I don't know where he is. Do you know where Dania is? No. Someone told me every time I say Dania to a local, they'll be like Ah, yes. And when I say Denmark, they're like Ah, yes, Dania. I got you. I just said it before. I didn't hear it before. Because many of my friends go to Dania to work on a farm. Yes, on a farm. Yes. But you don't have a guide, right? If I don't have what? Do you have a guide who can show you Kyiv? No. So that's actually what I want to ask you about. Are you a good guide? I can be, but after my working time. At the gym? Yes. Okay, I need to go. But I hope to see you again. I should. Do you have some technology perhaps that can make it so that I can write hello to a guide I would like to schedule a tour from? Okay. I can give you a number on my Instagram or Facebook. Do you have WhatsApp? Yes, I do. I need to check in what is the number. You can get my number then you can just say hi. Okay, see you. You too. Yes! Good job. I like that. That was pretty long, calm, chilled, but you tell me. From the beginning what happened? How was your energy to the way when you just said goodbye? It was pretty relaxed. I was probably more relaxed. I was still jumpy inside. And your body as well? I didn't stand still? No. It's okay. Did you like her look? No, I can tell. I can tell your energy is very much aligned. But if I can tell, she can tell too. And that's my problem. That I can feel that you are not attracted. And I know it's hard to force it on yourself to act like you are attracted, but you still can practice the projection of any kind of intent. She was cute, she was open, nice to you. This is what I want you to tell me, that she was on fucking phone. Are you in a call? She was phoning in the beginning. You forgot about that? You made her put down the phone. Come on, that's amazing. And even she said, I'm not going to put down the phone. Can you call back? And you were like, no? And then that was quite a challenge. She felt a little bit bad that she said no, so she was like giggling. No, I said, I think I have a question for you or something. Yeah, but before she said, she said no. And after that, she hung up anyway. TNL is very necessary in so many ways. ways because from a really young age we see examples from our parents or maybe people around us. Maybe if we are lucky enough to experience like a deep connection in young age and probably in like teenager ages when we are most sensitive to these things because just the word open up to us and we are ready to experience, then we get a partner we can talk about this, like does this touch feel good or does that feel bad? And I'm talking now about physicality but it's also emotional wise it's the same. Like how do we know what's hurting other people? How do we know how we can harm someone? I think there is no system for that created and it should be. Wow, you looked very serious walking down the street and I said I have to go make her smile add some positive energy to you and now you've got this big smile on. What are you headed off to? Where are you headed off to? I will talk very low, very slow. You will help and then my Russian, very bad. But you can speak Russian? A little bit. I don't understand Russian. English much, much better. You look like a model. Do you do fashion? Do you do model fashion? I'm too small. You're too small? Yes. Well, next to me you are very small. What do you do? I go to work. Are you excited about it? What? Are you excited for it? Maybe, I don't understand it. Are you happy to go to work or sad? 50-50. Not happy, not sad? I'm happy. You seem like a positive person. Talking to you now, I was very surprised when you were walking down the street because you're very... But now you have this big smile on your face. It's very cute. Thank you. Okay, I must go. Okay. Nice to meet you. Well, I'm going to be very sad when you head off. What is your name? I'm Kevin. Nice to meet you, Kevin. Okay, well, I don't want to distract you from your work, but I do want to see you again. Okay. What's the best way to... You can find me on Instagram. On Instagram? Yes. Okay. I have to warn you though. I just started using Instagram three days ago. Seriously? Seriously. You want to see my profile? Okay. So... What is this? Angel. Is that because you are an angel? Maybe. Or are you more devil? I think the devil. The devil? It's me. So you are more dark. Okay. I must go, really. Okay. Nice to meet you, Kevin. Nice to meet you. Have a good work. She broke out with this big, big smile after she was... When I approached her. So that was nice. From this? Yeah. To this? Yeah. Like way happier. Which is nice. How do you feel? Good. Yeah, I feel good. That was... I would have liked the interaction to be longer. We didn't really get to talk about each other at all. That's life, babe. People are rushing to work. They have job to do. Yeah. That's normal. You have changing contacts. Yeah, of course. First date, second date, and all that. That's life. That's life. Yeah, it was good. It was good. Good. And? Yeah, she had like a very avant-garde kind of model. Like, you know, edge of fashion style look. Which is pretty cool. What about when she's saying she's small? Do you do model fashion? Yeah. Oh. I'm too small. You're too small? Yes. Well, next to me, you are very small. What can you say for that? I thought it was cute. I mean, yeah, but you said it good. Like, yeah, compared to me, you're small. That could be still like a little bit of a challenge. Yeah. But what else we can say to make her feel more comfortable with her being small-ness? I mean, I could say like what I think, which is adorable. And then going even more aggressive would be like, oh, you're very easy to pick up. No. Oh, you pick up like that? No, no, like literally pick up. Let's make it a good thing because she said it like as a bad thing being small. Oh, you're right. Yeah. And honestly, I didn't even perceive that just because I thought it was adorable. Yeah. But then you can say like you are small but gorgeous, you know, like small. Yeah, but cute and adorable, we say that for puppies. You know, you don't make her feel better because she's small and cute and like, you know. Just use more like strong, stronger words for being beautiful anyway. You're small and sexy. Yeah, sexy and like strengthening her feminine side. But being cute and adorable for a small person, sometimes they are even sensitive for that. Because it makes them feel even smaller. That's a good shot. That's a really good shot actually. Yeah. So I would rather say gorgeous, beautiful. Like treat her as a tall, like treat her like they are human as well just because she's not that tall, you know. Yeah, yeah. I mean, the thing that's so funny is I didn't even pick up on any of that because for me. I know. You find her cute. Yeah, yeah. Like I like shorter girls too. So like. But you can say that. Yeah. You can say that you are just my type. Oh, cool. I love that you are small. Cool. I should have said, yeah, I should have said that. It's interesting too because I just took it for given. I just took it for obvious. I didn't even like communicate it though. It's okay. That's why we talk about it. Next time you meet a short girl, you are going to like approach even like way stronger than that. Yeah. And make her feel even more comfortable by her being small. Maybe after that she will walk away and feel fucking sexy to be small. Yeah. Just because you changed her perspective. I like that. I like that idea. I like that too. So I love the way you challenge. Like you don't even notice but you challenge them. Okay. Like even the previous one and like many ways about the angel and devil. Like that could have been a good subject because you can go more deep into that subject with the angel and devil. I didn't want her to go because I think that was... I felt that part, that hook where I was like, oh, this is like where I can apply a little bit of pressure. But then she's like, I really had to go. So I was like, okay, cool. I like that you have the sense for it. And you know which is the place where to put the pressure or where to challenge. Because why do you have an angel tattooed on you if you are a devil? Yeah. What resonates with me and why I am here as well and I think all the other coaches, it's because we want you to connect with yourself on deeper levels first. And learn how to love yourself. Isn't that the secret to everything? Like loving yourself. It sounds like something, oh, it's so easy and everyone can say that. But let's learn that. Let's learn the way how to do that, how to live your life. And actually you can go to anyone, anyone without a fear and say hello. You know, make their life just a little bit better by meeting you. You have that power to change someone's day, even change someone's life. You will be the one person who they will think about all day like, hmm, that guy came to me this day and just said I'm gorgeous and it feels good. So, you know, just to give that power to people and to make them feel that they can have that actually, they wouldn't imagine before. That's, I think, our specialty. And we make them feel strong and, you know, like capable of anything. Like if I can do this, obviously I will be able to do that. That's a really powerful thing to give to people. And obviously because we have already those skills on our own ways and we everyday practice it in different ways. And, you know, I think all the coaches, like if I think about, like each one of them are such a beautiful human and they all have this kind of superpowers, what we just teach the student to have the same superpowers, you know, on social ways, on every kind of crazy ways you can imagine. So it is a crazy adventure even to just to talk to us, just to interact with us. And the students feel the same way after they are finishing their workshop. Like, oh, OK, that was weird. That was unusual. But isn't that makes life beautiful? Hey, guys, I hope you enjoyed the video. If you like to get one-on-one coaching with me, I'm in sunny Miami and still have few available dates for private workshops where I can take you through all the natural lifestyle system, including approaching girls, having great conversations, improving your self-confidence and much more.
