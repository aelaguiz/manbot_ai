Hey What's up, beautiful humans, how you doing out there? I'll answer for them. We're doing We're doing all sorts of ways right now. Sasha. Life's complicated. Yay. Good to see you. Yeah First thing I wanted to say was did you know that there's like a mild conspiracy theory that you and I have got beef Really? Yeah, I've seen a couple of comments Who knows but like there's comments like dude saying things like little do you realize that those two something something and like yeah A couple of people have thought that we weren't that we've got beef or something No, I keep getting comments. Like when are you gonna do a content with James Marshall again? Like quite a lot and then are you guys still friends and it's like yeah, I'm not having sex with him I'm not dating the guy but we're buddies. We don't live in the same apartment. You know what I'm saying anymore not anymore We do sometimes for like a week a year maybe or something. We used to live in the same bed a lot Oh, yeah, we slept in the same bed. Remember those days? I was disappointed once because you never made a move in all those times and You start after after a few times sleep, you know during your Euro tour some other course We're teaching together and it's like eighteen hundred dollars a night for some fucking apartment Oh, well, we're sleeping in the same bed. We're not we're not getting another apartment We're already paying this crazy thing and after a while sleeping in the same bed with a human being you think just to be polite You'd make a move once you know what I mean James just one time It happens it happens in prison after day day 64 or something. There's a certain day I think it just tips over at certain point. I just don't think we did enough enough nights. It's all right Yeah, we did spoon one time and that was nice. But now we did what did we I don't know What I what I know is that you yeah you used to I think I remember there was a time because we were broke and when so we would always get the Airbnb with just the one big bed and And remember we used to do that because there would those days we would be traveling with our usual entourage But all of us would be in one apartment now It's kind of like when I travel with the guys everyone has their own at least two-bedroom place for two guys, whatever It's very civilized and you know If you want to you could actually go and have a normal life whilst being a coach But back in those days, do you remember some of the fucking war zones that we left behind? Oh like there would be no behind. I cleaned up my own dishes James You're the one that's famous in your company for it I am Doing all the crazy things and it looks like there was a grenade in the kitchen and you're always like hey You pay the cleaning fee on Airbnb for a reason. Come on. I think we both Know remembering Blaha remembering Blaha square that one that Chubba gave us and at the end there was like 49 eggs because you and Boris were only eating eggs or something at the time and there was just 49 eggshell pieces like just Strewn like someone had gone in with a machine gun and just just just gunned down a whole bunch of eggs Guilty on that one. That was me. I do remember But all those other kitchens you're mainly the guilty one. Oh, listen, I am notorious for being messy That is a very truth truth yeah, I've got a feeling that today's podcast is going to be a bit of a Nostalgia thon as we talk about some old funny old times Now that we're funny old men and funny old farts in our in our 40s She's in our 40s, but we look pretty like think about it. We probably look like we look like we're in our 30s Oh, yeah, I mean dude, listen if I have a shave 30 tops James, I'm a 33 I'm a hot At the sauna, it's all steamy no one can tell and yeah, and when we get naked take off another five years just saying My body's been going is pretty ripped at the moment cuz I got a farm body cuz I'm trying, you know Just farming and it just rips your body Alright, well, let's have a chat about what the fuck's been going on for you Everyone knows what's happened to me lately in my audience so that so I don't need to say that again but what's been going on for you since the Corona hit and cuz when do we hung out last it was it was last summer here wasn't it? Yeah Yeah, it was like last summer Yeah, June June or July you were here for a bit at the farm Well, yeah, I mean nothing too too too crazy Yeah, I had a really big I had a really big well before we even get to the corona stuff I don't think I've ever talked to you about this So I'm gonna say it and if you brain explodes and you want to talk about we can talk about it But right be right before that this summer. I actually had a love affair and I actually broke four years of celibacy. I Know that so that happened Yes, yes, yes, yeah, let's talk about that cuz I don't I know that because I met the lady and I and you told me that everything still works Yes, I was excited after four years there's a party that's like I don't know for sure It's just switched off and it's just like oh we don't do that anymore. Yeah, baby's gonna be angry at me like hey Hey, oh, oh now you want now you want to do something? Huh? Now you want to yeah, so I was a bit nervous Alright, so you're like a drunken. You're like a drunken Neglectful husband coming back to your own penis to try and convince you like trying suddenly like hey, baby Like oh, oh really you're back now. Yeah. Yeah Okay, cool, so but let's talk about that because it's people sometimes don't have sex for long periods of time that happens in the world and Usually when that happens, it's not by choice, right? So they okay, they have a dry patch and it might go on for a long time However, you made a pretty conscious decision like you can get laid I know that because I remember back in the day old Sasha would get in late guy I remember that guy listen James. I have to do it. No. No, I was never all those videos on YouTube They're all stage James. I paid actors every single all the times I was hanging out with you and I picked up a chick I just paid those girls off the night before it was all but YouTube conspiracy commenters were right the whole time. No, okay That's not true Like like that where we did that where we did the you know, remember we swap roles Imagine if all you'd staged it with all those girls And I thought I was doing so well being you but you just lined him up for me mind him up gave him a few Forints didn't you? Yes. Yes 1000 points. No, but in all seriousness, yeah, my life was, you know, obviously all about, you know Connecting with the ladies and and there's there's a reason for that and we'll talk about that I'm sure later, but I was all about it and I loved it It was a really really good time and I had many many adventures you were there for quite a few of those but in 2015, I was actually staying in your very nice flat in in Budapest and You know, I just was going through a phase of I knew I needed to change the whole chasing women thing it was really becoming like a You know, it was it was becoming forced the coaching of it was becoming forced I just knew that even though it was fun I remember I had this one time where I was just coaching this one guy and he's talking to this lady and he's just He's just being awkward and I'm like, oh god I don't want to have to talk to this guy like this just so brutal just even listening to this and I just had this clear moment where I'm like This is not this isn't it? This isn't it for me? This has been great I loved it but this isn't the thing that I'm supposed to be doing and I knew it and it was all and that happened as I was Really getting into the spiritual side of things for my spiritual awakening. And so and and so around 2015 I really decided and I'd had you know, I'd had awakening experiences before you know those moments of like, oh wait Maybe there's more to life than just this person in this mind this body. We're all we're all connect There's something more going, you know, I'd had a couple of experiences before and but in 2015, I was like, okay I really need to wake the fuck up. I want to know what this what is this reality? What is going on? What's the point of this and running around all day chasing girls just wasn't a part of that So I decided okay, I'm gonna wake the fuck up and in that decision quite naturally I just wasn't in I just became much much less interested in in sex or at least just you know Sex for sex's sake and then at some point even when I had the opportunity I went no Let's just stay on the awakening and let's just stay let's take that energy and use it for waking up rather than you know just having fun and And I just kept with it. I just kept with it. Yeah, and it was it was good All right. There's there's some things to unpack here foot first I want to just reverse back to one thing you said about when you were on the mics listening in I thought about today. I remember this that there's actually an iconic photo of you and me I think when we were about 33 7 ish years ago or something like that because I remember We were 32 because you said it was two of us sitting on the bench and we had a earphone each in and we were Listening to one client and I was had my head leaning on your shoulder And I remember you saying at the time nothing to see here Just two 32 year old men sit and listen in some music and really we weren't we were listening Intently to one guy as he tried to approach a woman Now there's one thing that if you're not a infill dating coach who uses microphones You will never know this special feeling that only Sasha and I and a handful of other people around the world know very deeply and you have to have a certain level of empathy to feel the level of cringe the level of cringe that Sasha and I have experienced because inevitably when you go out and you take a new guy and you throw him on the streets with a hidden Microphone and you make him go and talk to a girl Many of those interactions will be a shitshow of some description. They will be Excruciatingly awkward they will be Uncalibrated they will be accidentally rude. They will be I don't know this girl's offended. There will be Blank stares, there will be Russian girls. Just looking down their nose with going how dare you and That's hard for the student, right? Like that's that's hard to go through and you have to go through that you went through it I went through it. We all went through it You have to go and face the eat the cringe But it's like we chose to then it's like some hell realm where we have to go back and repeat Over and over again the ultimate cringe because you can't help but feel it There's a special feeling right when you when he opens his mouth and you know, oh no, this one's not gonna nut this one No, no, and you're like And he's trying and it's just so I can understand why that kind of broke you a little bit because I've certainly had those moments on the mics and that's Why I don't do night game anymore Well, I don't like going out at night and I don't want to have to handle going into the machine-gun fire of a night Night club where it's even more brutal. So I know that was part of it And it wasn't like it was that moment that broke me. It's just it's just it built building up for a while You know and it's because you know, I had all this going on in my head. I'm you know, I'm but more than this I'm about comedy and and helping people here and wake up and Inspiring people and all and waking up and all this other stuff And so I just kind of randomly by fluke got into the specific dating and pick up niche and it was great But at that point it was just this moment of crescendo where I just went. Okay, I'm done here I'm done. I'm done. And meanwhile, I was like, I am not quite done. No Well funny though because around you know, both of us have been seekers all our lives in some form or another It wasn't that you were like some cocaine snorting fucking sociopathic Asshole and then one day life just slapped you in the face and you were like, oh I need to like change everything like Both of us were assholes in some kinds of ways. Both of us were Blind and blinkered in certain ways, but we were also people that were always seeking to try and find truths Ways of feeling more at ease with ourselves primary I think that a lot of it was started out with that right like just trying to feel good about being yourself and to feel worthy and to feel like you're lovable and You have a reason you have some kind of Crew some tribes some mission and I know your story coming like both of us had shitty childhoods in different ways And I would say one of the characteristics of those were not having any kind of certain sense of love like not being not feeling Secure and being loved and being supported by a masculine figure or about or a feminine figure actually Yep So do you want to talk a bit about like how some of those early wounds in your life? drove you because people get wounded and some people it breaks them right like it really just It sends them into addictions or onto the street or into violence or many things like people really some people don't come out of that Whereas when you know, you came from an abusive childhood and lots of crazy shit And I'm sure you got batted around a bit and you did get beaten down a few times But it certainly became something that inevitably in in the end led to you being extremely strong Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's funny I've had people say exactly that thing like when you know when I connect with someone I actually take a few minutes and I Really go into my story. They listen to it and they go and they go. Wow, and you never got hooked on drugs or booze Or you didn't you know, you like you like a lot of people that went through that They would just hate themselves and just be ruined and I'm like no I never I just just kept going and started healing and it's all worked out great In fact, you know now it's like that all had to happen for me to become the guy I am today but yeah the the beginning of it is really you really said it really well there the fact that I didn't have the support from a Mother or a phone like nobody, you know, and I was a kid my mom was a you know a Rage a holic that would be the best way to see it. She'd be really nice for like a few seconds But then she'd just go into this rage where her face would turn beet red and I'm not joking people think oh, he's being funny I'm not being funny. Her face would go red and she'd be just be spinning this there like just violence violence almost like hatred It was all this generational trauma that she had from you know Going back like her her mom and her mom in World War two and all this fucking shit That was in her and it just came out at me. I was her cushion I was her I was her psychiatrist the anger came out at me She was basically doing primal therapy on her son, which I didn't realize till years later. Oh, it's a technique I've done the course now I get it They're supposed to be a facilitator and there's a there's a sequence but she was just like every day fuck And telling me like I'm worthless I'm gonna be a garbage man of a people like literally just throwing objects at my head Like I got very good at dodging boots like like just fucking huge boots. Just dodging them It was Russian. It was Russian boots are the biggest and the worst but and they call leopard print and everything. I joke about this in my comedy, but the one advantage of that was I did become dodgeball champion in school for like four years. Nobody could touch me. It's like a kid throwing a ball at me. I'm like, you think you think I'm scared of a ball? I'm used to like boots with fucking metal. So it was very, very abusive. And she she never like she there was just no love. There was so few moments of genuine love or just genuine like, hey, you're a good kid, I love you, like almost never, almost never. I didn't get any of that. You know, I just it was it was a shit show. And then my dad, you know, he ran away from her because she was insane. So so, of course, I had absolutely zero confidence. How where would I get self-confidence from? From who? From what planet? How would that ever happen? Oh, yeah, that kid sure is confident. What's his childhood like? Gets the shit kicked out of all the time. Parents tell him he's a piece of shit. Wow. Uh-huh. That doesn't make sense. You see where he gets that. I see where he gets that. No. So so, yeah. So every and then it was there was more adversity as well. So it was all of that was going on. And, you know, and she's she's buying me like the worst clothes. Kids are making fun of me. Other kids wanted a dog. She bought me a goat in downtown Toronto at age 10. I had a goat that just shits all over the place. I mean, I'm not even making this stuff up. It's a cool, but that's I can't understand. Not not not. I've got four goats now. Now it's fine. You have a farm for the goats. That's different. But actually, interestingly, we're two men who actually have owned goats. That's interesting. Oh, yeah. So when I was and then I had to, you know, at 15, there was the threat of physical violence for my stepfather, who's a huge guy. So I ran away from home. I was homeless for a month on my 16th birthday. It was a very cold Canadian winter. I was freezing my ass off. I was sleeping in random places where I could sleep. And then on my 16th birthday, to this day, if somebody asks me, what's your happiest birthday in your life? I would honestly say my 16th birthday, because the youth hostels in Canada, they have to take you in at 16. You're technically an adult. So they give you a bed. They give you clothes. They give you like whatever was like five dollars and twenty five cent daily spend. And I was ecstatic. I was like, yes, I don't have to be on the street. You guys have to take me. And it was the greatest day of my life. I was I knew that that's it. I don't have to. I'm good. Happiest day. You are old enough, old enough to be cared for by the state. So what does that mean? 14 year old street kids. They're like, oh, no. Come back in two years. Please. I want some gruel. No, you're too young. Goodbye. That's right. That's exactly right. Yes, that's Dickinson, Dickinson. And then and then, of course, my stepfather died in a car accident when I was about 18. And then my mother killed herself also just just when I turned 18. So so so to try to trap it, just to top it off like it wasn't a shit show already. Hey, you know what? Fuck you. I'm out of here. You're you're on your own. So that that was me up till age 18. That's like that's like a like a lazy writer just ending a series. They're just like, man, just kill them both off just to fuck him up even more. Really? To both of them? Yeah, both. OK. Yeah. All right. So that's that sucks. That's fucking hard. That's a hard childhood. And you would be you would be forgiven for having resentment and anger lasting decades and for even defining your life to some degree by that, right? Like you could say that some people who've had extremely traumatic experiences, they are scarred for life or they never seem to really recover from it. And you can see, you know, it's it's not I wouldn't blame those people. It's just some people have had really rough upbringings or rough experiences and they haven't had the resources or the or the I don't know, just the internal resources to be able to get through it. However, you did. And, you know, my my experience in childhood was not it's comparable in some ways, actually, like my mother was also an explosively angry. And I think because when you have a single mother who feels very disappointed by her partner, I think this is a common one, right? Like a very maybe and often a strong and maybe kind of not that easy to get along with woman with a kind of weak and spineless man who then fucks out and disappears. And then she turns that rage kind of at the child or even if it's not rage, it's like the adultness, like she's so disappointed in men and in she has no one to talk to. And then it gets funneled at this this young boy. It's a yeah, it's a it's a really fucked up dynamic. And I'm sure it's reasonably common and vice versa in different, you know, for young girls as well, having their own issues. So we often we all do. I mean, who comes from a really good family? I don't know. Not that many of us have excellent childhood stories. Some of some people are really lucky, some not. But what were the processes that you used early on before you knew about like, you know, before you knew good therapists or good coaches, before you knew about good systems? Both of us still tried different ways. Like, you know, we just sort of invented things or hung out with other guys our own age who are also trying to figure things out. Like, so what were some of the steps that got you initially to build some confidence, some strength so that you could later on find the, you know, better tools? Well, interestingly, early on, I really didn't even occur to me that like, you know, dude, I was so messed up. I was so angry at women. I was I was pissed. I would see these beautiful girls and I talk to them and they just look at me like, get the fuck away. Like, what are you what are you talking to me? Because I was so insecure. It was I was so needy. It was unbelievable. I was just going around like, if I could make you my girlfriend, I would buy you flowers every day and make paintings of you. Like, literally. And girls were like, oh, my God, I wish I could have seen that. I wish I could have seen that. It was so and the thing is, what's so painful is there was beautiful girls who were interested. Now I look back, I'm like, oh, my God, all of these women were basically just going, just don't be a retard. You can do this now. I couldn't I couldn't do it. So so I really had no idea that you could heal or trauma or nothing. I was just pissed off at the world. I was pissed off at women. I was angry, angry. And I had a bunch of people screw me over in my early 20s afterwards, too, because I was so I was so desperate for a love of any kind. If someone just pretended to be my friend, you know, because I got a bunch of inheritance when my mom died. So someone just pretended to be my friend. Like, oh, yeah, you want to buy five? You want to borrow 20 grand for? Yeah, there you go. There's 20. No problem. You know, it was I was just so I got screwed. So I had even more reason to be, you know, to be pissed. So honestly, the thing that saved me, honestly, it was it was one decision I made when I remember I was about 16, 17 and I was watching TV. I must have been 17. And there was just some comedian on stage just telling jokes. And I was looking at him. And then just this moment, again, it was just a moment of clarity. I watched this guy doing stand up comedy and this thought came in my head. It just went. Yeah, he's he's kind of funny, but I'm funnier than this guy. And then I just went, I'm going to do comedy. And I knew it in that moment, I just made that choice. I'm going to do comedy. Now, the next thing was, well, how the fuck am I going to do comedy? I literally I just looked at the paper. I looked at some open mics. I went down to open mic show. You know, I was hanging out and some woman's like, hey, do you want to do you want to sign up? And I was like, well, if I sign up now, how long till I actually do comedy? Go six weeks. I said, fuck it. Sign me up. I signed up. I went. I started writing jokes and developing blah blah blah. And then six weeks later, I went and did it. Had a great gig. And after that, I was hooked. And that was it. And my whole identity, everything, my whole life became. Well, I'm a comedian and I went off to do that. But that because I had that, even though I was really messed up on so many levels, because I had that passion, that outlet, my energy went on that my energy became suddenly instead of like, oh, I'm so sad and people hate now my energy was like, all right, I'm going to become the best fucking comedian. I'm going to write the best jokes. How do I write better jokes? How do I be? How do I have more stage presence? Like, you know, and I just I just put all my energy into that. So even though I wasn't directly going, OK, well, I'm clearly I have issues I need to work on this stuff. I wasn't aware of that stuff. But going up on that stage, I was able to vent. I was able to scream. I was able to express myself. And even though some of the jokes were dumb and whatever, I was able to really follow my passion and live my purpose, even though I was a damaged human being. And somehow along that process, I just let go a lot of those things because I was just enjoying life and I was feeling good, you know, to a degree. I believe as soon as we're damaged on some level, the healing begins. Even if we're not conscious of a time sort of they say time heals all wounds. And it really does. So by the time I was 25, 27, I'm really doing stand up comedy, having a great time. Even though I wasn't directly working on myself, I felt good. I felt good making people laugh. I was in my in my element. You know, I was doing something that I really, really loved. And I started connecting with people and going deeper. And, you know, so a lot of this energy that was from my from my childhood, it just sort of started fading away because I was just finding who I was. You know, so that was that was the first the first thing really that saved my ass. It was the comedy. Yeah. Yeah. And for me, it was I think it was music. I was playing in a band, writing songs. And by doing something that's creative and public, inevitably you have to face a lot of different things. Like it's for many people, that's a terrifying like especially comedy is one of the most terrifying prospects to get up to do, even probably more so than public speaking or singing. For a lot of people would be comedy because the expectation is you have to make people laugh. And if you don't, then you have failed at this thing. Like it's a pretty it's a pretty brutal art form, right? It's one of the most pure, pure and brutal of art forms where you just the feedback is instant. It's just, you know, really from like I said the thing and people like, no, not amusing. You're like, ah, now I'm fucked the whole thing and I have to quickly make a joke. So but putting yourself out there in a way that is creative and giving yourself some way to express. And I don't think it always has to be public, but that is definitely a way that you and I, you know, started to get through that stuff. But I also think that is also part of the young man's thing, like the young man of like, I've got to prove myself. I've got to compensate in some way because my my motivations for music initially were more to do with I want to be cool and get girls than than that. I really love music. I mean, I did love I did love playing music. And that was I was into the thing itself. But I think that is also another part. It's like you get damaged and then you go out and you try to heal yourself by proving that you're worthy. And then you do. And if you do it well, then you do get you know, you do get affection. You do get people liking you. You do get to express yourself, feel confident and so on. And so it does does start to unravel some of those layers of pain. But it can also then become the thing that someone locks into that this is my this is this is all I am. Right. And then I had that when when when my music career was coming to an end, I was terrified that without music, what am I like? I'm just a normal guy. How am I going to get girls? People won't like me anymore. I won't get to go to the parties. So I think that's an interesting thing with your healing journey and your hero's journey, which is which is intertwined, is that the thing that the thing that you really needed at one time can then become the thing that holds you back in the next phase. And you need to know when to be able to like let let go of one form of learning or one one teacher and then move to the next. This is huge what you just said. So I'll just before I go into this one, I just want to point out if you don't have a passion like our passion saved us, you know, because someone else who doesn't have comedy or music or, you know, other things, you know, just go to drugs or alcohol or porn or whatever, some other addiction. So we were able to funnel all that energy into something. And you're there going, well, I know I'm laughing. I'm laughing because you said it like you suddenly kind of sounded a bit like Nancy Reagan, just like suddenly they'll turn to drugs or pornography or satanism or other things that are not good for the society. And when it comes to drugs and alcohol, just say no. Yes. But but it's just it's an obvious point. But what an interesting point is for the young kids. And this is something we should be putting out there. Like, go and find something you like, rap or either art, poetry, comedy, something, you know, like get into something when you're a kid so you can funnel some of your confusion or whatever, anger, whatever. So you have something to put it into. That's that's not snorting cocaine. You know what I'm saying? Something decent. I don't think even kids snort cocaine now, they vape it. Yeah, snorting cocaine. It's so 80s, right? They're probably nobody does that anymore. Boomer, we're just vaping. But and it doesn't matter. Even it doesn't matter if you become the most famous or the best. It doesn't even matter if you're that great. It's doing what you love. It's just having an outlet for expressing yourself and being creative. And so your point there is very interesting, what you just said, which was that the thing that saves you can be the thing that holds you back. And that was really my case. It was my case in my dating and pick up a journey at one point. It was holding me back. Like I told you, 2015 and comedy at one point to a degree, even though it saved me and it gave me confidence and I had a great life and I fucking, you know, gig with some of the most amazing comedians and all this kind of stuff. At some point for me, that was also holding me back because it was really a way to build up my ego and make me feel build up my self esteem. Like I always had to be the funniest one, have the funniest, you know, gig. I had to kill it every time. I you know, even if I was hanging around with comedians off stage, I have to be making laughs and joking around all the time. And people would be like, Sasha, dude. Well, they call me Alex, you know, Alex is my my non non dating name. They would just be like, dude, Alex, just calm down, bro. Like you just just it's OK. Just be yourself. I'm like, I am myself. I'm just funny all the time. What do you what are you talking about? That's what I'm like. And it's like I'm the comedy guy. I just do. That's what I do. So so so it became this this thing. And it's very similar. It's really when the ego suddenly became with the ego. I've got to be the funniest and the best and all this kind of stuff. And it's it's bullshit. So you build up this ego when actually when I started doing it, it was just about the self expression and a way to be me and share and all this kind of stuff. So then it became this big thing. I got to be. And so you can see it with anybody that gets good at anything. Suddenly it it goes from being a very healthy tool, an amazing way to to express yourself creatively to this monster that needs to be fed. And the same thing happened with, you know, with going on YouTube and getting a following, being a dating coach. And, you know, how many girls can I have sex with? How much how many views can I make for this video? How much money can I make? All that kind of stuff. There's nothing wrong with any of those things. But if you're all about that and building up that ego, that can be very damaging because then because you're never happy because there's always, you know, because the ego always wants more, more, more, more, more. You're never going to be the richest. You're ever going to be the most famous. You're never going to fuck most girls. So it's like it's not it's it's it's not good. It's not good. Yeah. And people do that with work, right? Like so many things so commonly by especially in their 20s and then 30s is just grinding themselves into the ground to try and be productive and like known for or liked for their utility, right? Or their resources or how much money they've earned or what position they've put into. Which, again, like is not it's not a bad thing to try and climb a ladder if you want to reach the reach a higher level in something for sure. OK, that's a reality in life. But usually you're dead before you get to the top level. Yeah, it's like you're usually dead. What is the cost? What is the cost? Have you seen Japan, Japan? Have you seen Japanese culture with those? What do they call them? The salarymen. Salarymen. Oh, man, it's just brutal. They just bought into this idea that their whole identity, their whole self-worth, their whole value is just like, can they provide money even though they literally want to shoot themselves every day? Can they just support this? Oh, it's such an interesting thing in Japan, because I've been there. I haven't spent enough time there to really understand their culture. But you can see that there is the sense of like an individual's happiness is completely combined with that of the nation. Right. So everyone."}
