So here I am in this little town called Pernicova, which is right near my property in Portugal. And there's this old hotel here, which is apparently haunted. And it's an art deco hotel from like the 1920s or something, and it's built over a 17th century Catholic chapel. And then it burnt down 20 years ago, well the roof was burnt down. And now it's just been left here, and here it is. Alright, so I've got a short question, which knowing me will have a longish answer. So this is from a gentleman whose name I must not divulge. He says, you've stated that direct is an attitude. Is there a way of polishing it and maximising being direct so you don't just only come across as uncalibrated? So the statement he's referring to is my famous statement, which is, direct is an attitude not an opener. So when I'm talking about this in terms of seduction, but way back in the day when there was these divisions between the schools, the indirect, the direct, the scripted, the non-scripted, the St. Petersburg school and the Berlin school, actually it was more like the London, LA and Melbourne schools of seduction. This concept of directness in its early days was misunderstood as being that you run up to a girl and you say, hey, you're fucking hot, wanna do it? And by do it I mean sex. I'm not being ambiguous, I'm talking about fucking. That's direct, right? I mean that's very direct, and most people would not advocate doing that. There's been experiments where men have tried something along those lines and it doesn't really work. However, if we dial that back a little bit into the rational world and it looks more like, excuse me, wow, you look fucking incredible today in that sequined polka dot dress, I gotta meet you, right? And so that's a direct opener, and my point here being that that's just the start or that's really just a reflection or a fractal of a way of life if you want to actually be direct. Anyone can learn, like they can force themselves basically as a performance skill or as an acting skill to walk up to somebody and say those words, right? Almost anyone who doesn't have extreme social anxiety could run up and say, excuse me, I saw you, you look fucking sexy today, what's your name? And they will get some results. Like if you just force yourself to do that 30 times, you'll get a variety of results from women and some of them will like it. However, you are not a practitioner of direct game doing this and you are not, I would say, a direct person. And what I'm going to talk about now is really what directness means in relationship to your life. So this gentleman has asked, how do I be direct without being uncalibrated? And that is a very relevant and an important question to ask because especially when you come from being a man who hasn't gotten what you wanted and has always been in a position where you've used what they call covert contracts to try and get what you want. So the classic nice guy pathology is that he's very friendly, maybe he's outgoing, maybe he's shy, but he's very helpful, bends over backwards for people, he's always attempting to connect people or do favors or be a shoulder to cry on or lend money or just be a nice person who helps old ladies across the road, is that how you help an old lady across the road? You just scoot her? There's other videos of me like patting little boys on the butt and now here I am just going, Granny, get across that fucking road. Alright, well, however you help grandmothers across the road, clearly I'm not a nice guy. Okay, nice guys do this, but they don't do all of this stuff, and especially when it's in relationship to an attractive femaleoid that they're interested in, they're not doing all this stuff without a gender. It's good to be kind, it's good to be nice, it's good to be generous, I try to do those things in my life. I have a policy that I give whatever coins are in my pocket to every busker I see, and I'm not saying that as a humble brag, I'm saying it as an arrogant brag. No, I'm saying that as like, that's part of my policy for life. I just go through it because I like music on the streets and I give that and I don't expect anything back except that the people keep playing and I'm not looking for something from that person that wasn't first outlined in the exchange, which is, here buddy, have a coin, keep playing music. Nice guys have a habit of giving in the hope and later the expectation and often the feeling of obligation that they should be getting things in return and when those unwritten and undiscussed deals are not honoured, then nice guys get bitter, angry, reactive, sometimes violent, they can react in quite extreme ways. And I don't want to be down on, it's always a bit of a dangerous thing to say, to group people in some category, right, so you are all nice guys with all the evil that you have inside you that you're masquerading as niceness, I know, like I know, there's multiple, there's many layers to us and complexities to us, but I think if you look at yourself, most people are guilty of this in some way or another, right, I know that there's sometimes that I do things, you know, for somebody with an extra smile, you know, it's hard for me, thinking, you know, maybe that person is going to give me something back and of course I do that with women in some respects as well, but there are large groups of men who that is their primary operating procedure in order to try and get what they want and it kind of sometimes does work, which is a false positive, so you know, if you give and give and give and occasionally people begrudgingly give back because they feel obliged to you, it sort of looks like that thing works, you know, if you're in a situation with a girlfriend or a girl you're dating and you're doing nice things for her and then going, oh honey, how about that, like pointing to your dick, like kind of insinuating that because I would cook dinner and took the garbage out and helped you with your essay that I should get a blowjob, that's a very unattractive position for a woman to find herself in with her man and this is where this starts relating into seduction and seduction again is not just about the meeting the girl, getting the number, getting to the sex and now we're seduced and now we can go back to being a boring, you know, non-perceptive, not intuitive, uncreative dude, no we cannot. Seduction, I view, if I'm going to continue to spend time with a woman or with a person I continue to seduce them because what is seduction? It's the art of influence, it's the art of making yourself heard, about hearing other people, about connection, about making you and her feel special in relationship to each other. Why would you want to stop that once you get into bed? That's going to be a shock and a disappointment to the person on the other side. So my style of seduction is the same as my style of negotiation, is the same as my style of presentation, is the same as my style of sexuality. It is direct and what do I mean by direct? Okay, it's not some words we say, it's not about you're fucking hot or I want sex or give me a raise or whatever the expression of the directness is. It's about clarity about what I want and not hiding that in relation to others. So being direct is the ability to cut the bullshit, to drop the fluff, to get to the point. These are all kind of sayings or memes or ideas that we're aware of and we can rattle them off but there are certain people who live like that in all ways. They try to and we don't always succeed of course. Every person who is direct and honest and clear has also lied and also spun bullshit and also been ambiguous for sure. I'm not talking about this in an ethical sense really or moralizing like I'm a direct and honest good person and nice guys are liars. Although I think being a nice guy makes you into a liar. It creates situations where you kind of have to lie because the whole strategy is a lie. And I've said that before as clickbait, nice guys are liars. And they are in the sense that if you're someone that is not able to say, hey can you help me or can you lend me this thing or I want that or would you like to go on a date with me or listen I know we've been colleagues for three years and this is a little out of the blue but I actually have feelings for you. Do you want to do X, Y, Z? Hi dad, I've got some shit I need to talk to you about. You know all of these things, this is a way of living and some people have a tendency or a practice and have learned how to face things head on through confrontation, negotiation, through speaking your desires, through expressing your needs and how you need to have your needs met. Most people are not great at this but some people have studied or practiced this and the results are huge in relationship to what that means in your life. So first let's talk a little bit more about what is the consequence of being not direct? Because when a question comes up like this, in a way this is kind of like an academic question. You talk about how do I be more direct and be more calibrated? As if it's like a choice. As if we have the choice to decide okay I choose to follow the school of directness and learn about its qualities and perhaps become skilled in that art form and then move on to something else. No I view it as like if I don't learn how to be direct and also how to be calibrated because those things need to be tied together then my life will be shit compared to the me that made choice points and learned skills that allowed me to be more direct. Just last week I was doing a private workshop in Barcelona with one guy and he was talking to me at the end and we spent five days together and at the end he said, man what you do is incredible because from these few days that we spent together, like I spent days with all sorts of business owners and famous people and I've done, like this is a mover and shaker, a guy who's high up in all sorts of societies, done all sorts of interesting things, very successful. But he was like these few days will change my life forever because from now on there are certain ways of thinking and doing that I will do completely differently. And I know just from the few days we've been together what the result of that is going to be and how that's going to exponentially stack is going to be amazing. And I'm not saying that necessarily just about my information, I'm saying that about finding any piece of true wisdom that is applicable in your life. And wisdom really, like wisdom is not a form of knowledge, it's not a skill set, it's not just okay cool here's a better way to knock in a nail than this other way. That's a skill set, a technique based around a skill set, based around a craft which has application and if I become a master of it maybe I can turn that into almost a spiritual quest. But in a way it's just something I could learn it and it would affect my life or I could not learn it and I could do something else and it would also be okay. This is not one of those things. This is a survival skill, this is a life skill, this is a critical skill in my opinion. The ability to be direct, to cut the bullshit, to be able to say what you mean is the skill that will mean that you marry the person that you want to. Instead of like fuffling around with somebody and half asking and not quite working, you get down on a knee and you say, listen Abigail, I want to make an honest woman out of you. Now I'm not saying go ahead and get married but that's a decision, right? The decision to cut ties with somebody, to move countries, to go up to a stranger on the street and say, excuse me, I know you're busy right now but you look fucking amazing, I'd like to meet you. Then the ability to follow that up with clear text messages. The guy that I was working with last week, I looked over his text and the problem he had was he had girls on the go and they were chatting backwards and forwards but he kept saying things like, hey, yeah, this weekend's looking fun, gonna be a cool party. Are you gonna be heading out with what's her name during the week? Me and some buddies are gonna be heading to this location over the weekend. Sort of throwing out hints and insinuations that if I wanted to go and someone said, yeah, cool party this weekend, I may have said, awesome, is there a plus one? I'll come. If I really wanted to, if I'm a hot girl with lots of options and some guy's like, hey, I'm doing this, doing this, oh, so what are you doing this weekend? Without ever actually saying, listen lady, do you wanna come out with me or I wanna take you out? Then you miss that chance. And that's the habit of directness. Before game, pre-game in my life, it's like an epoch in evolution or something. You've got the Jurassic and the Triassic and this is the period of the day that I realized that I could go and talk to a girl I didn't know. Before that, my life was still based around women. Everything, if I'm honest with myself, everything I did was in some way related to women, whether it was playing in my band or my social life or throwing parties at my house. These things were all to try and improve my status and improve my social standing and to attract women. And sometimes they did. Sometimes I met women at a party or girls at a party and I played in a band and occasionally met girls through a band which, sorry guys, is not the best way to get laid unless you're really famous, which I never did become famous. And so I was getting false positives on if I did a lot of effort through a huge party or ended up throwing big benefit concerts or built a band or made friends with this guy who seemed to be good with girls or tried to make friends with a girl who had single friends and all this convoluted stuff, in some ways it did get some results. And that is the reality of how most men and women will construct their lives and men being the ones that have to hunt and be proactive and actually go out there and make things happen, it'll mostly fall on their shoulders. And that's how most men govern their lives. If they have large resources or a good social connection, they'll try and leverage that. And if they don't, they'll still try and leverage it in whatever way. they can. And the dizzying difference in results of back when I used to try and rely on social circle or status or playing in a band or guys I've met who've relied on money and buying tables and having villas and fancy cars. I've worked with lots of people who've tried that kind of thing and sometimes it sort of works. Don't envy the guy with the Lamborghini and the Rolex and the helicopter who's trying to use that to get women. Because there are women who will be attracted to that. But they're like a class of women, very hot, good gold diggers that just bounce around the world taking stuff off these kinds of guys. That might be fun for a while if you suddenly land in heaps of cash and splash around and girls are using you for it and you're like, fuck it, I don't give a shit. That might be fun for a while, living in a rap video, but pretty soon that gets old when you realise that without that you have nothing. I'm not saying that money and status are not leverage points, they are. As I get more money in my life, I'm able to travel, if I want to go and see a mentor, I just go now. I don't have to save up or think about it. I'm like Ido Portal, I'm coming to you. This Kung Fu teacher, I'm going there. This business, this chance to meet this person which might be a great business opportunity, I'm there. It adds leverage, it adds multiplying effects, but nothing, nothing makes up for or compensates for your character, your personality, your communication skills. I know for myself, I'm able to navigate from the lowest gypsy busking hippie group on the planet through to the 0.1%'s suiting and booting in the fancy locations with the fancy people doing fancy shit. I can do all that. I make adjustments, here's where the calibration comes in. I'm not talking about belligerence, I'm not talking about arrogance, I'm not talking about being overbearing or domineering. These are not good qualities. These can give false positives as well. I've seen people who are bullies, who are pushy, who are unscrupulous, who force their will and sometimes they get, sometimes they're also charismatic and they're also kind of strong willed and clear about what they want. And so those people can succeed for sure, in the short term, I would say. In that they can slash and burn, they can take advantage of people, they can force their agenda and those people can get through. And sometimes those people get so good at this that they make a lifetime habit of it and they slash and burn and then move to the next field. So usually these people won't have a lot of close friends or close associates but they may have been able to hustle people in location after location or group after group. You want to be that guy? I'm not here to teach you how to do that. And I think that those people are usually like a character trait. They're slightly sociopathic, they're very disagreeable in their five personality traits, they have low agreeability, high testosterone, very out to win, competitive, very interested in the status within a particular hierarchy. So that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about a more graceful or let's say elegant version of that. When you're moving down those things at the airport, the ones that are flat, an escalator that's flat, which is not an escalator, a flatter later that just makes you cruise along. And I'm usually a bit late for the airport and when I get there and I'm running down one of those things, if there's a family there, which there often is just kind of chilling in amongst that, you know what I do? I charge through and I say, move. And they go, what? And they like startled and then if they look at me, I go like this and then I charge through. Now is that rude? Yes, that is rude by the British standard of things. Because there's politer ways I could do that. I could say, excuse me guys, do you mind just popping? Thanks, thanks very much. Sorry about this, sorry. If I was British, I'd be like, I'm really sorry. I know, I know. No, if I was British, I'd actually just miss the flight. I'd just stand behind them and if they looked at me, I'd be like, I'm sorry. And I'd miss the flight. So is it rude? Yeah, it's kind of rude. But it's not rude in the sense that I'm not making personal attacks and I'm not saying, you fat cunt, get the fuck out of my... Oh, that sounds fun to do. I'll never get to do that in real life. You fat cunt. I'll never get to do that. All right. Anyway, so I'm not making a personal attack. I'm not destroying the person's ego. I'm not criticizing them. I'm making my purpose, my direct purpose made felt very clear and I know that it's going to shock them a little bit and I'll charge through and they'll think, oh, he's a bit rude. And that's all right. That's part of the art of not giving a fuck, is that you will have to accept that some people will think things about you that you don't, maybe don't like, right? Like that's the definition not giving a fuck is that someone's like, I think you're a little bit rude and you possibly could have handled that in a nicer way. I'm like, I don't give a fuck is my answer, right? Because I know that I've made that decision and there's a consequence, right? Okay. That person may think something about me. If we then sat down next to each other on the plane, I would probably address that and just say, hey man, I hope it wasn't too abrupt. I was just in a super rush to get here and I'd release the tension on it, right? If I needed to so fix that, but I don't because that person doesn't think about me for the next five seconds. I haven't caused them any trauma and if I have, they're a real pussy so we can just move on with our lives. So, you know, these are like if you're sitting at a cafe and the here is the fine line, right? Like I, I worked in as a, as a waitress, as a waiter when I was like 18 and I sucked at it. I was bad and I got fired. Um, and, but I also got a sense of like working in hospitality is hard work and people can be dicks to you. You don't get paid very well and it's often not your fault because there's a lot of shit going on in the chef messed up the order and whatever. So, you know, if someone, if a waiter messes something up, doesn't bring the right thing or spilled something or whatever, I try not to be a dick about it. It's that because that is like the, ah, fuck and look at this piece of shit peasants who can't get this job right. My God, like that kind of thing. Yeah, this is me now using my slight level of status or leverage or money or sense of superiority to make someone else feel shit and, uh, you know, to comment on their work as if I could do a better job and so on and so on. So I don't do that, but in Hungary where I live often the service is awful. It's so bad. It's comic, right? Like in America, I get freaked out. You walk into a shop and they're like, excuse me, sir. Hi, how are you? Can I help you? Is there anything you need? Any substitutions? Oh, you want a tuna melt with no tuna and no melt? We can do it. Oh yeah. Like that level of service makes, makes me freaked out. I hate being called sir eight times over a cup of coffee. But the Hungarians do the other extreme where you walk in the cafe and they just keep playing Tetris and ignore you for like 10 minutes. So I now know when I walk into a Hungarian restaurant, when they walk past me and they, and they flop the, the menu down, if I don't get them now, it's going to be another 15 minutes before I can order some water. So they do that and I say, excuse me, can I get a bottle of sparkling water and a Chateau Ros\u00e9 Twondeuf 1942? I never order wine. Bottle of sparkling water. Thank you. Because I know this dude is going to wander off and grumpily do his shit really slowly. So I have to be direct in that situation to move things along. Guys come up to speak to me at a conference, right? Like I walk out of just on my speech and six guys will come around and say, Hey man, listen, I've got this question, dah, dah, dah, dah. And they'll start asking me stuff. And I'm there to help and I like engaging and I'll answer a question. I'll answer a question. I'm like, I've got to go because of, I've got to get to the next thing. And I'll, and I will bluntly and abruptly, he's finishing and he goes, and one more question. Okay, stop. We can't do another question, man. Cause I've got to go. Right. And I do this kind of thing many times every day. If I'm interacting with people, if I'm out on the farm, I just don't cause I don't need to tell the goat what to do. Although I do and it doesn't listen. Why don't you? Yes. Eat them all. Um, I'm interacting with people through coaching, through my personal life, in my business life. I try to keep it as my, as my mantra and my operating procedure to be direct because I know that although it may be uncomfortable sometimes, uh, it saves me so much of this feeling of all these loose loose ends, right? If there's someone I don't want to do business with anymore, I don't let it fade out. I usually just, you know, even if I don't talk to them in person, I'll send them a voicemail or I'll say, Hey man, here's the situation, dah, dah, dah. I can't do this anymore. Here's the reason why. Okay. Wish you well. If I don't want to see a girl anymore, even if it's casual, like learning the art of breakups is something that no one ever learns. And it's, and it's, it says it's as important as learning how to get in a relationship. I'm not, I'm not being a hyperbolic there because the consequence of not breaking up with a girl at the right time can be years of wasted life and then traumatic effects that you carry into baggage that you carry into the next relationship. Liam is the best person I've ever met at breaking up at the right time cleanly. I've seen him do a breakup in a relationship that lasted over a year and get it done in six hours with all the tears and the, you know, talking it through and, and uh, you know, people having big people being able to say what they want to say and then being able to process it and move on. He talked, his last girlfriend some years ago now, they were hanging out together in New York and she said this line almost jokingly, right? She said, you know, every year I spend with you is a husband, is a husband hunting wasted year or something like that is a wasted husband hunting year. And he said straight then and there, well, obviously we're going to have to break up, right? Like, like instantly. And uh, she wasn't like, this wasn't just an ironic joke. You know, it wasn't she, there was truth behind it. She had given some hints that she wanted something more serious in the relationship and he'd made it clear, very clear that he couldn't give any more than what he was giving. So she, so when she made that statement to him, it was so vitally clear, uh, that it was the time to go because our values have changed because we have now diverged paths. Even if right now it looks like we're together cause we're still standing next to each other. We still love each other. It was everything the same. No, it hasn't because on a, on a fundamental level, we're going in different directions and in relationships, I've, I've had that before where I've realized that at some point or at some level and then denied it for some time. Right. And that's okay. Like we all do that. Uh, not, not, not everyone. Some people that can be really, really clean about it, but we all do that. We delude ourselves that the emotions we have for somebody will override the reality, which is that person is going to move to Guatemala soon to become a, an excellent whatever they do in Guatemala. Uh, there are, you know, there are realities that we just have to have to face and we have to reach confrontation points. I, I love confrontation. Like I'm not confrontational. I'm not walking down the street looking for fights, but I love the process of confrontation. Even though an individual confrontation may be unpleasant. I love the fact that it exists because it means that things get resolved. Either you come into a confrontation and you explode apart because you cannot reach, uh, any kind of compromise or agreement, or you short, sort your shit out if done well. And there is an art form to, to, to, to, uh, negotiating in a confrontational way. Right. And that's something that again is like, there are some people who just shout at people and are aggressive and the moment something doesn't go their way, they get reactive and a rude and make character assassinations. That's not someone who is an intelligent, is intelligently direct. I would not say that a person is assertive because in my mind, the word assertive means, yes, I'm able to hold my ground, state my place and my wishes. Right. But I understand the responsibility of that as well. Right. I know that I have to earn that. I have to fight for that. I have to make that known as opposed to the person that is just randomly aggressive or pushy is just expecting that they're in their level of entitlement will be met. Right. They're expecting that if I'm standing in line for something and I get all huffy, which all of us are guilty of. Right. I mean, I've certainly stood in lines and got tough. Don't they know who I am? Uh, I can't believe this, but you know, when you do that and you're humping around and he's like, can we move these things along? I did it recently actually. I'll, I'll admit to one. So I was at a train station in, um, in Lisbon. I was waiting for it to buy a train ticket and the window was closed, but the guy was sitting there. Right. And there was one guy who was dealing with five people and there was this one dude who was just talking to some lady and they're just sitting there. And in my mind, because I know exactly what's going on in their life and I know how this business works, they're just sitting there chilling, ignoring me to my face, which may not be the case, but that's what it was. And so when I got to the window of the other guy, I lent in, I said, you guys are having fun in there, relaxing in there. And then they, and they went, huh? And then the guys in the line said, Hey, tranquilo, relaxo. And I went, and I stood there and I realized how foolish I must've looked and felt because my harrumphing didn't change anything. I didn't know, I don't know what the situation is. I don't, maybe that's his break. Maybe it doesn't work there. Maybe he's being lazy, but I didn't know enough to be able to harrumph about it. Right? So we all do that kind of stuff. I'm not in my power then. I didn't show that guy, right? I didn't hit him with a zinger. And sometimes I think people think the idea of a confrontation is to hit with a zinger. Sounds so dorky when I say that, right? Got to hit him with a zinger. That's the point of an argument. When they say, Oh, where were you the other night? I'll say, well, what about them shoes? Uh, so anyway, it's not to like one up them. You can do that. And I've done that sometimes and where I've won, you know, I've got, I've hit them with a zinger or someone's hit me with a zinger and you're like, okay, yep. You get this little thrill, but it doesn't really, it doesn't help to resolve anything. Uh, you know, you look at a soap opera, whenever they have a confrontation, it's always, someone says, well, I found out that you were spending all evening with Mildred and I just leave it there. And then they, and then they walk out, right? So they, they, they deliberately create a moment of like tension and unresolved dissonance."}
