One of the things that I often do with guys as we go through this kind of process is, I try to take them through a series of different tones of themselves. So it's almost like, what's it like when, okay, you can stop somebody and you can say something and then you can go for a close, but what's it like when you stop somebody with a very clear intent that you want to give them a positive energy, like you want to really give them some kind of compliment, some kind of meaning, some kind of like, I'm here to like offer you something from a place of abundance. Not because I'm trying to get anything, because I just wanted to stop you and like say, awesome thing, like you look cool, or I just wanted to say you have a good energy and I wanted to give you some good energy, you know, like this kind of feedback loop. And that can be, once again, I wouldn't say that's like, that's not the only channel to operate on when you want to be social. It's not like a seduction technique. It's like, okay, looking at what's it like to go into this from that place of blessing and giving as opposed to trying to take or various other ways you could go. So what can happen as an example, as a result of that kind of practice is maybe a guy who might have been shut down on his heart level starts to experience flow in his heart level. And then the interesting thing is because he starts having that aspect of his interaction available to him, then he doesn't even necessarily have to use it because he unconsciously knows that he has it there. And because there's a little bit of an interesting thing where as long as you are, you know, using aspects of yourself on a fairly regular basis, you will start to embody those essences. So women will just feel, and this is what I think that women really want. Women want a well-rounded archetypal man. Like they want a man who's centered in his ego and he's conscious of himself, but he can also take them on a whole range of different flavors of experience from being like, you know, soft and sensual and being very like in a kind of empathetic engagement or from being like very much in a kind of an open receptive kind of like, you know, being in her world and pulling her close kind of position or playing the polar opposite of being the authority, being the challenger, being the like the director, being the, you know, the one that is outside and is a little bit kind of like, I'm doing my thing and I'm closed and I need to like do what I need to do because I'm a man or whatever. Which may like sort of infuriate her and she might come clamoring to try and get in, but actually she needs that as well to see that you're a man who's autonomous. Like you're not a man who's now like totally dependent on her feminine nature to feel okay. Right, exactly. So yet again, to bring it back into kind of the meditative aspect is like the meditation is a huge key and tool and gift to learn how to observe and work with those different aspects of your archetypal self. And as we said, like you can get more distance from your typical reactive patterns of self, then maybe there's space for new possibilities. And particularly, you know, that's the huge, huge benefits of guys coming to do work with us that I see is that they get supported by a group of like, you know, typically on a workshop, there's like four, five, six, you know, trainers of us all supporting them from different angles. And they're getting, not only are they being supported into this space of like, be aware, be conscious, be ready for change. It's also a lot of like, okay, now let's uplift you and like work on this particular angle of this feedback and then see how that works in the system. Okay, you got that cool, now move on, now do this, now do this. So they get like a huge amount of versatility and flexibility in their character over a very short period of time because they're like tapping into our supply as coaches. It's like, try a bit of this, who's like, you know, I can, we can almost transmit some of that to them sometimes by setting up the right containers for them to have those kinds of experiences. And then once their nervous system registers a kind of an attunement or a frequency of like, oh, that's what it feels like to be a warrior. That's what it feels like to challenge. That's what it feels like to be like a little bit more direct in a woman's face. Or maybe the opposite, that's what it feels like to be soft. That's what it feels like to empathize. That's what it feels like to actually like listen and feel like who she is and what's going on inside her feelings, as opposed to like, you know, being the abrasive strong guy all the time. And yet again, I think a woman, when a woman feels that a man can offer her both the strength and the flexibility and the adaptiveness of his nature to be able to both take her on an adventure as well as be kind of, you know, be a ride in the fact that you're on your own independent adventure. It's a very powerful dynamic. I don't think, and then some people might be like, do I have to be this incredible Superman who is like, you know, alpha as fuck and totally solid in his own mission and can go out and hunt a bear by himself and be in the wilderness, but at the same time can, you know, caress and whisper poetry in her ear and be like the most intimate lover of all time. And, you know, it's not, I think it's like, it's not that hard to be those both, both those aspects, really. Like when you're, when you're lost up in your own story or your own fears or whatever, then yeah, it's very difficult to be any of those things. Because you're really just in fear response, in reactivity, in self-preservation and scarcity. All those things doesn't really allow you to, you know, like explore the totality of you as a man. But when you start to just even just get a little bit of space and go, okay, that I'm not that and I'm not that, or I'm aspects of those things and I can start dabbling and trying different aspects out. Suddenly it's like, okay, just learning how to give a good hug and, you know, be with somebody and look them in the eyes for 10 seconds, maybe a massive change. And that may be the thing that like for, you know, that you never did with your partners, but now you can do. And that settles a whole aspect of when, every time you had a girlfriend who like felt insecure in the relationship and she needed you to just like give her a hug and be present with her for 10 minutes, would have fixed it, you know, instead of all the drama and all the other disconnection, all the pain that came from you not being able to do that. Or on the flip side of it, just being able to say no to a girl, just being able to say, oh no, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna go to your friend's lunch. When like throughout your entire life, you couldn't say no to a woman's request that she said was important because your role is to be her doormat or to be her, you know, her Prince Charming. And just that once of just going, no, I don't wanna do that one. And then I, and having that choice now to do that, suddenly that puts you in an echelon of male who is like, yeah, I'm solid in my purpose. And like, sometimes I don't wanna go and hang out with your family. So it's not like these don't have to be that you're the most integrated, perfect, sexualized warrior monk dude, but I mean, shoot for it, why not? Just overwhelm the chicks with it. She's like, I just wanted you to be able to give me a hug. And, you know, like tell me no, sometimes like, no, I have become a god. Hey, sparta! Work towards that for sure. But it's more that like women, once you take, once you give a woman like the taste of true, the true masculine thing that she's after, then all of that other stuff that men spend their entire lives working for, which kind of does matter when that's all you've got, right? Status, money, position, brashness, authority sounding, all those things that like, if you don't have a clear relationship of joy and love with yourself, that you'll need some other thing to compensate. But when you, on the flip side of that, when you learn to become a much more flexible human being and you understand some of these basics of like, okay, these are the elements of masculinity and presence that a woman responds really well to. And here are some of her like, explosive and volatile aspects that I'll need to deal with and vice versa. And I'll learn to navigate that. It's not that complicated. And so it means that you can, with ease, comparatively, have fulfilling relationships, good sex life. You can navigate through decisions in a much more clarified way and you're enjoying the experience as well."}
