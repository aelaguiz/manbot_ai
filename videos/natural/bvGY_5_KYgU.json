It's related to the work that I've chosen and the social role that I've somehow found my way in, which I've been conditioned to be a good son, a good worker, a good citizen and to just play by all of these other people's rules. On very practical terms, what my recommendation is, is that every year, and we can start now, you don't have to wait till New Year's Day when you're like hungover and going, I promise I'll never do it again. Just start now. Is to look at your year and figure out how much time can you claw back from your obligations. Sometimes that means, for the guys that I've taught, often they've just gone, you know what, fuck it, I'm just going to quit. And I think quitting is a virtuous action in many ways. Quitting things that you hate or that are not soul enriching for you or that you're doing for somebody else is a really powerful protest. I've quit a whole lot of stuff in my life. I went to university initially out of high school, started an arts degree and went, eh, I don't want to think about these things right now. Like it's, yeah, okay, these are kind of interesting ideas, but for me, I want to go out and explore the world. So I quit university and I went and worked on an orange farm for a while and saved up enough cash and I quit that. And then I hit the road and traveled around India and did a bunch of other stuff. And then came back and then started a band and then sort of quit that for a while and then bounced into Eastern medicine and tried to grow marijuana for a while. That wasn't very successful. Quit that. Quit heaps of things. And that's good because every time I quit something, I pick something else up. And sometimes I return to things. Studying sociology and history and liberal arts back when I was 18, at that time, I recognized that this was a waste of my youthful energy. Now I'm really interested in those things. I read a lot about history, about sociology, anthropology. I'm fascinated by those things and they're really relevant to my fields of work now because the more I understand about how societies work, the more I understand about how our history has led us to these points, the better I'm able to work with my clients because I've got a broader, grander kind of narrative view of the world, especially than the light coaches who only focus on hustle and work and visioning and they don't see the kind of grand scheme narrative of the human condition. Music was something that I was doing when I was a child. I was doing classical music and then I dumped that because I was getting beaten up and I just wanted to focus on learning some martial arts. And then some years later, I picked it up again and started a band. Quitting and returning to things is totally cool but I've had plenty of clients who've come to me, done a workshop. Initially, guys always come to me because they're unsatisfied with their life. That's at the core of it. I don't get guys come to me who are amazingly happy with all areas of their life. I don't get guys who are like, you know, everything's awesome. I just want it to be a little bit more awesome. I get men who come because they're unsatisfied. They're just not getting sex or the girls that they get into their life are just not doing it for them. Yeah, they're just not interested in the women that they've had because they're just in their own social circle or they're just not that hard. They come because they're unsatisfied with essentially where their sex lies, with their love lives. They don't feel fulfilled. They don't feel connection. They don't feel this erotic power. They don't feel their fucking cock hard for life. So that's usually the thing that draws them in. And as we go through a workshop process, and of course, massive amounts of time, we work on how to approach, how to seduce, how to have the right mindsets, how to relax, how to project intent, all of the natural seduction stuff. But what happens is as guys start going through that process, they start digging a bit deeper and they recognize that it's not just the, it's not like if I just had chicks in my life and I'd be satisfied. As they start getting girls into their life very quickly when you work with us, they realize, oh, there's deeper things that are at play in my unhappiness or my dissatisfaction here. It's related to the work that I've chosen and the social role that I've somehow found my way in, which I've been conditioned in or pressured into or bullied into or enticed into to be a good son, a good worker, a good citizen, and to just play by all of these other people's rules, all of them from the state, from God down to the state, down to the fucking gender politics, down to the family hierarchy, down to your nagging mother or your domineering father or your judgmental sister, so many people around you that are just going, you must be this thing and recognizing that, oh, there's all these forces trying to pressure me to be something that I don't necessarily want to be and not for my own self-interest, right? When the grandmother is on your case to get married and have grandchildren, it's not for you, it's for her. It's so that she can have one more generation of people that remember her, so that she can feel that she's relevant again. I'm not saying that about all grandmothers, but that's a common one that I see, or parents pressuring, particularly from traditional cultures, Asian, Indian, Jewish, strong Christian families, where there's a lot of pressure to get married and have children, because that fits into their narrative, right? It makes them feel comfortable that their son is doing the thing that he's supposed to be doing, and so many guys don't want to just do that, and this is another rant for another period, another time we'll certainly look at, but in terms of when is it a good idea to get married and have children, certainly not in your early 20s or your 20s at all, in my opinion, for a man, much better to wait at least into your 30s before you even think about that kind of stuff, because that's the time you've got when you are young, vital, strong, powerful, and also you haven't made it yet, you haven't figured out who you are, and nor should you have to. I'm a great advocate for not knowing who the fuck you are and seeking, not trying to force yourself into a box or delude yourself that this is the way things should be, and allowing other forces or your own ego or pride to just go, all right, this is me, this is where I exist, and anything that I'm unsatisfied with or have doubts about, I'll just block out and pretend doesn't exist, because it pops up, those doubts, those regrets, those I wonders, that doesn't seem right to me, those things eat you alive at night, and man, I see it, because I get guys who come in their 40s, sometimes even later, who've lived by other people's rules, who didn't take four weekends out of the year to go and do that thing that they love, yeah, who just said no to that opportunity to go and meet that master, or to come and do the workshop with James Marshall when that was still a possibility, not gonna be a possibility forever, guys. I love doing this, but I'm not gonna do it forever. If you want the best, and that's me at my absolute peak, now's the time, now's the time. I see it with the guys who come to me later in life, who've done, especially, it's heartbreaking meeting those guys, because, and they're the ones that are lucky, because they're the ones that actually are making change, but when you talk to a guy who's been celibate for 10 years, or who was in a shit relationship for 10 years longer than he should have been, or who has been grinding away at a career that he hates, not because he necessarily had to, but because he wanted his father's respect, or because that was the job, that was the thing he studied at uni, so he figured he should keep doing it, or who saddled themselves with an obscene amount of debt in a small third-tier city where there's no opportunities and no hot girls, and bought a house there when they were 21, and they've been paying that off for 10 years. These are the kinds of things that, that's the risk, investing 10 years into something that you don't want to do, how many of those 10 years do you get? Seven, eight max, and the ones when you're young, and powerful, and independent, and you don't have children, 10 years, 20 years, maybe, 30 years, maybe, very rarely. We've got this weird thing as humans that we're just so unaware, we just keep ignoring our own mortality until the day we die, and we just don't like dealing with it. We have this insane sense that everything is going to be the same, even though, logically, we know that we grow, we get older, and we die, and it's over pretty quick. I look back, and I still feel like I'm 18 years old, and I go, well, I'm definitely not 18, and that's 20 years ago that I was 18, and I think about, oh yeah, I'm just kind of like that guy that used to cruise around, smoking weed, and playing the flute, and no, whoa, whoa, a long time has passed, and I'm someone who's hyper-aware. I've spent a lot of time being aware of the moment, and yet, still, I've slipped into unawareness for a month, and I come out of it, and I go, whoa, a month just passed. I wasn't really conscious of that because I was grinding too hard, and I was just focusing too hard on doing the thing that I was supposed to do, or I was distracting myself, fucking jerking off, or reading shitty whatevers, or watching too much TV or something. I've done a little bit of that in my life, far less than the average person, but it still chews away pieces of your life. Every day that you spend an hour scrolling through Facebook is 1 24th of your life that you're throwing into, just thrown into a poker machine of uselessness. Every eight hour times five block, or 10 hours times five block per week that you go and do an awful job or study that you hate without an exit plan is wasting of your life. Seeing that there's an opportunity out there, a great teacher, a great opportunity, an experience that's not gonna be there forever, and then going, I'll do the next one. Those are the things that leave you on your deathbed with deep regret because often there wasn't another one. Very recently, I got an opportunity, I was invited by a very influential, wealthy man who's become a friend of mine to go to Zambia on a safari with 20 very, very wealthy, well-connected men. And I had something else, two other things planned during that time, and it's reasonable amount of money for me to go and do that. And I just looked at it and went, when am I gonna have an opportunity to go and hang out with royalty, basically the Illuminati, super rich dudes who are really, really well-connected in Africa in a safari park where I get to live in a park where there's gonna be elephants and fucking hippopotamuses and animals that quite likely will, many of them will be extinct in my lifetime and see that with my eyes. When am I gonna get that chance again? Very unlikely ever. So whatever I have to do, cancel this, move this, say sorry to that client, I'll put you over here and I'll give you a discount. I just moved everything around and went, yep, I'm doing it. But that's the kind of thing where I just say yes to the things that are extremely awesome experiences and opportunities and I'll move everything else around. I'll work double time here. I'll owe someone something because I fucked them around a little bit there. I don't just fuck people around and forget them. I'll go, all right, student, I'm gonna move you here, giving you a discount and you get an extra hour on the phone with me or whatever I need to to make it happen because I'm not gonna give my life to my students. I'm not gonna give my life to this business. I'm not gonna give my life to any fucking fucker. I'm gonna keep it for myself as well as doing all the awesome things and helping people around me and creating an amazing business. I think that's enough of a rant. I think that was a good one. I didn't, I just had a little idea. I was just like thinking risk versus regret and I didn't know where it was gonna go and that's where it went. So I hope you liked it and I hope it inspires you to quit something and start something else and if your mother's annoyed about this, tell her I'm sorry. If your grandmother wants grandchildren, well, fucking just go and she can volunteer at an orphanage or something.
