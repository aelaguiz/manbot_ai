And so she needs to keep prodding at him, saying, hey, be a man, you gotta step up, I don't respect you. And over time, that can switch into a dynamic that if they stay together, which can happen, where he's henpecked, where he is pussy whipped, where he retreats into his cave to the nagging wife, and then she intensifies things, and it's a horrible dynamic. This is from Bogdan, how you doing, man? Good to hear from you. So he says, anyway, anyway, what is your guidance on dealing with women problems? When do you tell her, if you ever do this again, it's over? And when do you do the confrontation of, hey, when you do X, I feel Y. Context, a girl I was seeing casually for around six months was being a bit bitchy, I just ignored it, thinking she was having a bad day, but then it continued, I broke up with her two weeks later, but I think ignoring it is suboptimal for happiness. Okay, well, firstly, I don't think what you did was incorrect or unadvised. People, men and women, some of them, have certain character traits, which they have practiced and embedded so deeply that they are pretty much unchangeable, especially if a person doesn't wanna change them. So if you're with a woman, and over time you recognize bitchy behavior, right? So what would you fit into those categories? Anything where she's belittling you, passive aggressiveness, sarcasm. Now, I guess you're in the UK, Bogdan, so some of this, like that tends to be modus operandi for British people in their banter. So I might allow for a little bit of British black humor, sarcasm in there, maybe, if it's done in good fun, right? Like, yeah, sure. I know in certain cultures, people take the piss out of each other and tease each other, and it's done in a maybe lighthearted way, although it often does have teeth. Okay, so I'm not gonna take everything super personal or whatever, but if a woman is being overtly rude, passive aggressive, making no effort for, and being sarcastic or belittling for no apparent reason, I'm gonna take this as serious red flags, right? Because sure, I can put my foot down and I will, absolutely. And sometimes a woman has a strong behavior, but the man's frame is so strong that she's like, oh, I better be on my best behavior because otherwise I lose this guy. But often, no. Often they will, people maintain those habits. I'm not a sarcastic person or passive aggressive, but I use those techniques sometimes. And it's taken me until recent years to really note when I wanna say, I'm like, oh, that fits under the category of passive aggressive. And I'm like, yeah, but it's such a nuanced, no, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter how good it is or how correct it is. That's passive aggressive behavior. I don't do that. Or if I do, I'm like, fuck, I did a passive aggressive. I did a little passive aggressive, and now I'm gonna try not to do that again. But I've worked on that. I really wanna change that because I recognize, oh, fuck, that was one thing I, at some point I kind of held onto and that assisted me in some kind of way back when trashing each other was the thing in that group. It doesn't serve me. And it's not smart. It's not clever. It's cowardly. So if I wanna say something instead of saying, oh, cool, just making a little pyramid of dishes over there, are you? Actually, that's me making the pyramid. That's me passive aggressively talking to myself about my stacking dishes. But if I had a housemate, oh, nice, how's the pyramid going? Sarcasm, passive aggressive. I'm so funny. Fuck me. No, I'm not. Hey, man, I've noticed, I'm talking to myself, by the way. Hey, man, do you think you could do the dishes? I've got a girl coming over tonight. And then if me says, oh, no, but what? Okay, then I'll say, listen, those are your dishes. I can clearly see that. We need to sort something out. Let's figure this out or get the fuck out of my house, me. Tyler Durden. All of us will meet women along the way who have some character trait, which is toxic to us. Maybe it's not to other people. And it bothers you. And yes, we can address this, but understand that probably people don't usually change that much unless they really want to change. And if she doesn't want to change, and she thinks she's, oh, I'm just telling jokes, or she gives any kind of pushback, it's like, oh, you're taking it so seriously. I would just agree to disagree and fuck off. You, her, get out. Now, okay, in terms of how do we deal with women problems, I'll give you the most blunt version of it, and then I'll reel it back a bit. Our good friend, Sir Dominic, who you all know, has four rules. Now, I'm just, do I, yes, four rules. And he says these to girls as soon as they're in his life, and he says them exactly like this. All right, you got to understand there's four rules. If you want to be with me, listen, I'm old, I've got problems, I'm stuck in my ways, I'm not going to change. First thing you got to understand, no one's moving in, no one's having kids, no one's getting married. He starts off with like that, and then he's like, four rules are, you got to keep my stomach empty, know where this one's going, you got to keep me balls full, don't stress me out, don't be a bitch. Those are his four rules, and that's it. And then any time, I guess the first two are figured out, but any time a girl starts exhibiting anything that he might interpret that way, he says, hey, I said, don't stress me out. You're stressing me out right now. And because his frame is so fucking solid, and because he gives so much to the women, right? So like, it might sound like he's just being domineering, but this is a sub-dom relationship. And as he says, she's happier than a pig in shit, because she gets all her needs met. She's treated well as a sub, and it's understood that she can't undermine his authority, but his authority is underwritten by pleasure. Does that make sense? He gets authority over her, because overall, he creates pleasure in her life, and other things, security and a sense of femininity, and depending on the dynamic between the pair. But he creates it for, and he demands that she respect his position within that for both their sakes, right? And he's very clear about where his boundaries are and are not, and he states them on day one. There's no confusion. And when the girl does start being a bitch, he says, I told you, don't be a fucking bitch, you're doing that. And then he gets rid of it if she doesn't comply, which he has occasionally, and most of the time, women happily comply, because it's better for them too. It's one thing to keep in mind, now I'm not saying this is your case, Bogdan, but this is common, that women, when they don't respect their man, or they feel like they can manipulate him, they feel like he doesn't get the game she's playing, or the game, or the overall game, then she's more likely to act out, by far. Because in a way, she's testing him, right? The woman that nags a man all the time, it's not so much about the dishes, or taking out the rubbish, it's that she can't rely on him, not just in a physical capacity, but she doesn't feel like he can manage his world, his life. And so she needs to keep prodding at him, saying, hey, be a man, you gotta step up, I don't respect you, right? And over time, that can switch into a dynamic that if they stay together, which can happen, where he's henpecked, where he is pussy whipped, where he retreats into his cave to the nagging wife, and then she intensifies things, and it's a horrible dynamic, right? So being aware that women don't act out nearly as much with men they respect, I get very little bad behavior these days. Now, part of that is that I haven't, for a while anyway, gotten into anything serious, so I'm dating women casually, and we only see each other once a week for a few hours or something, so there's not a lot of time for us to get in fights. But it's very clear where my boundaries are, and it's clear that I have a strong frame, and she's not gonna fuck with it. How to for this? It may well be too late for this particular girl, because it is much harder, like if you've been doing this six months, coming to her six months later, and going, hey, listen, look, there's been this series of things that I've been unhappy with, it looks like to the person that's defending themselves that you've been making a kitchen sink list, throwing everything in it that you don't have the balls to come and confront her when there's an issue. It sounds like you're overreacting, because she just did this, and then you brought up the last six months of behavior. I did this the other day, right? So I met this girl online, I'm chatting to her, and I'm really glad that I wasn't as hardcore as I was gonna be with this girl, because she turned out to be fucking hot and awesome. We started chatting, and then at some point, like she lives in another town, she was gonna come here, I tried to get her a cab from the town, but you can't use Uber equivalent in that town. We tried and it didn't work, right? So I said, oh, let's come on Saturday. So we rearrange another date, so we fucked it up, first day, we thought we could get her a taxi, it didn't work. I said, okay, let's do it on Saturday. And I said, I guess you'll need to take a train, as there's no taxis on the weekday afternoon, probably they won't be on the weekend. She writes back, thank you for that information. Clearly sarcastic. I said, no need to sarcasm. And she said, thanks, that means a lot too. And I just said, I don't know what you're getting at, maybe sleep on it a couple of days and I'll text you then. And then I thought about it and went, I've got enough chicks at the moment, that's a red flag to me. So I said, actually forget it, too many red flags if you're rude when I'm politely trying to figure out logistics. Brutal, huh? And she wrote back straight away saying, sorry, I just got home from the library, I'm okay with that, full stop, final word, question mark. So that's her like going, okay, but are you sure? And then I said, if we can agree to be civil and you can make them on the weekend, then we can try. And then she says, what was rude exactly? And this is where I start thinking maybe she might have some slight autism. And she says, oh, like what red flags, don't hold back. And then I wrote back saying, is this a sarcastic comment referring to that? And she says, no. And then I'm like, okay, all right, fine. So I said, okay, I'll accept your word, my apologies. The fact that you asked to clarify things is a good sign. And then we were sweet, right? Then she came that weekend, she was very, I could tell she was a brat by nature and she's really smart, really ahead of her time. But she didn't, after that, she finished things with yes, sir. There was no question after that. Cause she was, you know, she was being a bit of a brat like, oh, I have to catch a train, Einstein. I'm like, nah, not playing that game. I'm just working out logistics. And she quickly changed her tune and was like, okay, cool. What did I do wrong? All right. After that, she's been really well-behaved. I was not only willing, I was just like, ah, fuck off. Like I was just like, I don't need this girl. I've got plenty others. So like, but coming from the like, all right, that's a deal breaker. Cause I can see where that's gonna go and I'm not gonna deal with that kind of thing. So I'll call her out early, win, lose. Win in this case, cool. But certainly other times I've lost on those kinds of things and good, I dodged a bullet, right? So yes, it's, you gotta call them out early. It's gotta be done clearly. We've talked about the, exactly how to do confrontations. And then we discuss, either she's willing to yield ground and she accepts and says, oh, okay, I can see where you're at. Look, okay, I won't do that in the future. I'll try not to. Or she arcs up in any kind of way. If you're, what you're saying is reasonable, which is like, okay, you insulted me in front of my friends the other night and that made me feel bad. I don't see why, like, that's not fun. And I don't do that to my friends. So do you have something, can you explain to me what was going on there? Okay, you know, general confrontation techniques. And she's like, oh, I'm just having fun. You're taking things too seriously. I'd say, cool, well, I'm seriously out of here, bye. I'm gonna save myself, whatever this is. That's my advice.
