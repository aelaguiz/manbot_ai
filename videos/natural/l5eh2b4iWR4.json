No, no, actually this speech, this rant is not going to be so much about seduction. It's going to be about issues with my mother. Well, it's going to start there and then it's going to end with issues with your mother. Now are you interested? Sanctus Dominus Sacrilegio Seductus Alright, so over Christmas I was staying at my mother's house in Australia and she gets up very early, I don't, as you all know, and I would awaken each morning to the sound of my mother walking, clomping, clomping. And Liam's a great clomper. The clomp is someone who's just, you know, heaps of downward pressure on their step. And I'd awaken to the sound of my mother clomping around the house at this speed. There'd be a pause and then another clomp. And it just like triggered all of these childhood memories. As I remembered, as I was growing up, that was the sound that I awoke to every day, which was back then when my mother was a single parent. She was working as a nurse. She was trying to keep two children surviving on a very, very low income. And she did a very good job of that. Well done, mum. Thanks for that. Thanks for keeping us alive and getting us educated and allowing me to go to flute lessons so I could become a funky flute player. Pooh, ba-na, bow. Funky flute. Spirit of fucking jazz. So, like, at that time it made sense. This was a woman who moved at an incredibly fast pace, was always stressed and anxious, and was trying to pull off a very, very difficult task. But as I woke up, this recent Christmas day it was actually, or the day before Christmas, and I heard her clomping around and it brought up those memories. I realized my mother is still moving at the insane, intense, insane, anxious pace as she was back when she was 30-something trying to keep us alive. She's retired. She owns her own house now. I'm kind of rich, so she's fine. Like, she doesn't need to get up and run around to survive like she used to. But she still does. And so, you know, as I came out, I'm like, Mom, what are you doing? And really, what was she doing? She was, like, clomping around the house, doing one dish, because there was only one dish, because she just created one dish, and then clomping outside and then gardening a little bit, and then clomping inside and then realizing that the cat might be a little bit hungry in about two hours, so she better go and think about that. Like, she wasn't really particularly doing anything that needed her to zoom around the house. Now, what's the point of this? The point is to just have a think about your mother. No, what is the point? The point is that I developed, I guess as a result of her conditioning and other things in my life, I developed this habit. And throughout my teenage years and going into my twenties, I was a highly strong person, very, very anxious, and stressed out about getting shit done and achieving things and moving fast. Now, at the same time, I was a lazy teenager, so I was also, like, a bit of a stoner, and I was also, you know, would sit on the couch and do fuck all. It's not that I was, like, an optimizer back in the nineties, or definitely not in the eighties. I was not optimizing anything in the eighties. But it wasn't that I was, like, optimizing. It was just more that I had this sense of anxiety and stress around needing to do things, that there were all these things that needed to be done and that you needed to move fast to do them. And I'm pretty sure that I have given the impression to all of you, all of yous, that's how Australians say y'alls, we say yous, I've given yous the impression that I'm a very relaxed, chilled-out, slow-moving and slow-thinking, presence and power-of-now absorbing entity. And that's part of my thing, right? People are constantly commenting, how do I, why is it that, and how do you get so chill? How is it that you're able to just be so relaxed in certain situations? And there's definitely truth to that, like right now I'm standing in the middle of a public square with a light blaring in my face and there's lots of tourists standing around looking at me and going, there's a guy with a light in his face. And that doesn't bother me at all, whereas for some people that would send them to therapy, having to have a camera and a light in their face in a public space as they walk along and speak about something about their personal relationship with their mother, that would send them insane. I'm fine with that. So, certainly I have developed over the years a capacity to sit within all sorts of types of pressure and to be able to deal with a whole lot of situations that a lot of people don't deal very well with, particularly public speaking. That's apparently something that people are more worried about than being brutally murdered. Hi there, how are you doing? Do you want to be in my TV show? But, oh. See, I don't mind that either when two hot Russian girls just sweep past me and ignore me. So, I certainly have a capacity to deal with all sorts of pressures, particularly in seduction, public speaking, presenting myself that maybe are underdeveloped in your life or in most people's lives. However, the idea that I'm a chilled dude, that I'm a dude, that I'm a relaxed kind of guy, just an easy going guy, is completely wrong. I am not that. And I have met some people who really are that. They really just move at a slow pace. Augusto, for example, who works on my farm in Portugal. Augusto, who has been working here for 35 years, since he was 25, he has run this farm. And when I bought the farm, I luckily inherited him. And he's amazing. That guy's chill. He's been on that farm for 35 years, slowly getting stuff done well, but very slowly. Yeah, well, I'll be back to fill more sleeves in front of you tomorrow, big church. I've met people throughout my life who do have this inherent thing where they just kind of move slowly, where they are fairly present, where their body is in a state of relaxation, in resting most of the time. But that is not me. It has never been me. And it still to this day is not me. This very day, I woke up and my alarm didn't go off because I turned off, just wait for the Catholics to think that's going to stop me. It's just going to make me pause for a second in a power pose. Twelve seconds later. Somewhere up there, there's a monk just like ringing furiously. We're going to stop that bastard. A few moments later. It's 5.30pm. What is it? What? What happens at 5.30pm? Two hours later. Maybe that was the time when they like collected all of the single women into the square to burn them at the stake as a witch. It was like done at sunset. Eventually. So, now that the Catholics have stopped rudely interrupting me, back to what I was talking about, which was that essentially I am not a naturally relaxed person. However, I have become a specialist at learning to relax. So the title of this video is Train to Chill. Train to Chill. And that is something that I have done all my life. I have trained myself to chill since when I was about 18 when I discovered Buddhism and then discovered meditation. That was when I was at the height of being particularly unsatisfied or very unhappy with myself. So when I was like 18, 19, I finished high school and I was very stressed out and very up in my head, constantly in a state of physical elevation and tension. And I really didn't like it. I didn't like myself. I didn't enjoy being in my own body. I didn't enjoy being in my own mind. And this led to some points to thoughts of suicide, to just get out of this unpleasant experience of being alive. So luckily I didn't kill myself. What I did do is I went in search of methods and answers. And this led me through to studies in Buddhism and later on martial arts and meditation systems, which I have then carried with me throughout my life. And the point that I want to make today is that there is a true art form to relaxing, to being chilled out. And there is a very big difference between collapsing or distracting yourself or laziness, you know, just sloth and actual active relaxation. These are two totally separate things and in some ways they're the antithesis of each other. They're almost opposites. I don't want to say they are opposites because in some way, actually, technically the opposite of sloth is something. What is it? You know it. He just doesn't know. But anyway, they're very, very different. Oh, she looked back. She was like, now she's walking off and thinking about it. What does it mean? This very day I have gone through dozens of experiences of spikes in stress. These habit patterns that I've had where I have this tension rising in me and in a speedy way. Like when I walk down the street, I walk still at a very, very fast pace. But I have to check myself constantly, constantly. It's something that I'm doing literally dozens and dozens of times a day. What happens is I have this war almost inside my mind that goes between there's a whole bunch of things that I need to do, which is true. There's a big list of them. And they're real. There's a business that relies on them. There's a whole dozen people whose livelihood relies on them. I've got a whole bunch of huge projects that I'm working on in my life. It's not like my mother who's retired just rushing around trying to find something to stress out about. She finds the one dish. That's all she's got to really worry about. I do. I'm at the height of my career. I'm a fucking busy dude. So in one sense, there is a reality. As all of you guys out there, most of the guys that I'm talking to are young professionals. You're guys in your 20s, 30s and 40s who are at the peak of your activity and you do have shit to do. You have a mark to make. You have an empire to build. You have a business to create. You have a fucking university degree to finish. You have women to meet and ways of personal development to unlock and understand. There is a lot of things to do. I'm not saying you should just do nothing. That would be bad advice. I'm not saying just unplug from the Matrix, man, and just don't be so concerned about consumerism and achieving things, man. Maybe there is an element to that. If that's all you give a shit about, if you only care about achieving things and only care about status and acquiring money and external markers of success, then yeah. Don't do that so much because that will not fulfill you. However, there is this kind of dichotomy when you're a person who wants to be a spiritually evolving person. What I mean by that is if we take out any religious aspects or any sectarianism, you want to be someone who is in touch with yourself at multiple levels. To know yourself at deeper levels, not just in this front of your brain thinking part, not only in the external manifestations of your achievements, which is where most of society places almost all value of you as a man. It's like, okay, you're valuable as a man if you have achieved, if you have procreated, if you have earned certain levels of status and wealth, and everything else, just fucking hold it together and don't become a psycho and don't go into a post office and shoot people, and just look like you're okay, and that's all people give a shit about. Now, I am always talking about giving permission to men to have many other layers of experience, to be an emotional being, to be a spiritually feeling being, to be a sensual and sensory operating human being who gets to experience life on all sorts of levels. That's vitally important. And so there is this, in my life, and I think for you guys probably as well, this kind of seesaw action where, on one hand, you want to go out and you want to get shit done, which, by its nature, projects into the future. If I have a task on my list, and I'm a listaholic, that is not a thing about presence in the now. It's a thing that in the future I need to achieve, and I need to start taking steps now to get there. So by its nature, it tends to pull me out of the present. Because there's like, okay, I've got to write that piece of email copy. I need to film this video out in the cold. I need to pay this person. I need to do this stuff. Well, it's not happening now. It needs to happen in the future, and now my mind's projecting in the future, which is not ideal if I want to be present. Because on the flip side of that, on the other side of that, I have my desire to be experiencing and milking the juice of life as it is unfolding in this present moment. Moment by moment is where life is actually happening, and the great tragedy of human existence, one of them, is that large portions of people's lives are not lived. Or they're being lived, but the person was not there. The person was thinking about something in the past or the future, worrying about something often that is never actually going to happen, which is a complete fucking waste, or fantasizing about things that won't happen or that might happen. All of the things that we're doing that are not actually being here right now, feeling my feet on the ground, feeling the cold and my schnoz, observing the light, being immersed in this present moment. And that's something that I have focused a lot on in my life, and that was the thing that saved me, essentially, back when I was an angst-ridden, suicidal teenager, the thing that saved me was learning these skills to become more present-time focused. And this is a question I get asked in various forms by guys a lot, like, how do I be a man of the world who's trying to build and create and there are elements there of being egotistical, because if I want to create a business empire, or I want to get muscles, or I want to get some cool clothes, there is egotistical aspects to that. Because otherwise, if I really didn't give a shit what anyone thought of me, and I had nothing to prove, and I had no status ladder to climb, then I would just find some place where I was content and I would just stay there. And plenty of people do that, but the guys that come to me are not like that. You guys, if you're watching this, even if you haven't really taken action yet, you want to. And there is a big, I mean, just sitting there and wanting to is not enough, right? You're going to have to get up off your fucking chair, get up off your whatever it is that you happen to be slouching on right now, lift your neck up from this angle and go out there and actually do something because absorbing information is not enough, right? However, that and the extensions of that is definitely a good start. So there is this dichotomy where on one hand you want to achieve things, you have stuff to do, you're a man of the ages who is attempting to become an excellent version of yourself, this is going to require you on some levels to have small egotistical motivations as well as larger ones that are more ethical or more humanist in terms of wanting to be able to provide value to people or to become a great king so you can look after people, you know, to be able to spread love and joy, to make yourself as good as you can be so that being around you is an amazing experience for people. There are plenty of positive motivations for going out there and achieving things in a worldly sense, you need to be aware of those and as a man you'll go through an oscillation where sometimes you're doing things for small-minded selfish reasons and then if you can pull yourself out of that and redirect that into doing them for productive and positive effects on the world, then that's going to be much better for you and better for people around you. However, that's an undulating journey you take as you grow. But at the same time, it's really, really vital that you learn skills to be able to chill. And that doesn't mean sloth, which I'll cover in a moment. It means precision tools for understanding the processes that your mind goes through to run off into directions of stress or anxiety or overachieving or workaholicism or, you know, getting tunnel vision and only being able to see one aspect of life as being important. For example, only focusing in on money, which I see with, you know, some clients, they come to me and they're very successful, but only in a very narrow band of life. And I've had, I remember talking to one guy recently who's running a very successful business and he said to me, look, I've done the numbers. If I do anything else other than this, it's costing me money. I'd say he was like, he knew that if he put all of his time and focus into this business, which was working very well, he would be able to make X amount of money per quarter. And every hour that he pulled out of that and put into something else meant that he would lose a certain number of dollars. And my thoughts on that were, well, you're rich and you're going to get richer for sure. Like you've done the numbers. I see them. They're good numbers. And your thinking is that any hour not spent, you know, that's not a sleeping or eating hour, any productive hour that's not spent in the business or on the business is going to be a waste of time because nothing can deliver the return on investment like working in this business. And I said, well, the problem here is that you only perceive one level of value, which is financial return and success, right? You are neglecting your body. You are neglecting your emotional states. You are neglecting learning about intimacy and women. You are neglecting the chance to use your youth to develop an art form, to absorb lots of information while you're young and supple, right? And so we had long discussions and we worked out that it was actually worth taking a couple of hours out, you know, of an evening to spend on something other than making more money. Anyway, what I do is I go throughout a day where I achieve a lot of things and I attempt to achieve a lot of things or I work towards a lot of things. And then I have a whole bunch of processes that are happening often within the same 10-minute block, mentally, that draw me back to the present moment, right? Because for me, I know that it's vitally important for me to relax because I have this tendency to wire up and start clumping around like my mother. It's not so much the physical pace that matters. I can move fast and be relaxed, actually. It's that that tends to lock in with a mental state that starts racing, right? So I get it. Today I got up late. My alarm didn't go off because I tried to turn my phone off because my health coach told me you shouldn't have phones near bed because they zap you with rays. And I thought, well, doesn't the phone just turn itself up on again? Apple, don't they just turn on and play the alarm? Well, it didn't. Or if it did, I slept through it. Anyway, I woke up late and I was like, oh, fuck. I mean, I'm two hours behind where I wanted to be. And so I like, I rush into the shower. I'm like washing my hair fast, right? Like I got to save an extra 20 seconds by like scrubbing this hair fast. And I'm thinking fast. All right, we got to catch up. There's a whole bunch of what was the thing I've got to go out. I've got to meet my lawyer and we could do this. And we're going to go and film this thing. And this is this is my natural tendency, I guess, taught to me through childhood or my early experiences. That's the way I naturally tend to move. Some people might, maybe they just get up like, whoa, missed two hours. Cool. Just going to take an extra slow shower just to like really chill. Maybe there are people like that. That's not me. But whilst I was in that shower for that five minute block, I went through that and then I noticed that because I use precision awareness, because I have studied meditation techniques for many, many years. I have these kind of release valves internally where I notice because I'm aware of I'm like, I'm thinking, I'm thinking. And then I take an objective step back and go, you're thinking really fast and you're washing that hair comedically fast. Like if somebody was watching right now, you'd be like, I've got to do it fast because I'm going to save 10 seconds. Okay, dude. Doing a power hair wash over there. Nice one. Saving plenty of time there, dude, with the fast hair washing. So I was doing comedy fast hair washing. And then I checked myself and I'm like, that's not helpful, right? That is actually wiring stress, burning a lot more calories and energy than I need, which as I'm getting older, I'm noticing that as I burn fast throughout a day, if I get into a stress state, you know, by lunchtime, I need this little snooze. I need a little nap because I've just burnt too much energy from thinking too fast and moving too fast. As opposed to moving swiftly, like I can do swift Kung Fu movements. And that's not going to burn energy the way of me, like stressfully, like holding tension and comping around and thinking too much and like erratically moving and knocking things over. All right. There's a different type of burn rate there. So in that five minute block in the shower, I went from erratic stressed energy to becoming aware of it using precision awareness meditation to then instituting a technique to resolve that. So what that meant in that time was simply standing still, standing up straight. And because I had erratic energy and I felt like I wanted to move, I lifted my hands up and I jumped up and down 60 times doing my jumping jacks, which my health coaches told me is good for starting the lymph system. Lymph system. And jumping is good because jumping is cool. Everyone used to jump before we became Stefan Bredesch. People used to dance around campfires and run over things and leap. Jumping is good for humans. So I just did 60 jumps because I had this erratic energy and I wanted to use it effectively. And at the same time, I let my body loose and I felt my body. And then I stopped in the shower and I slowed down and I went like Club Tropicana speed washing my hair and I deliberately made myself go slower than I wanted to. Felt the tension as it like jarred against me and then I just melted into it. And then I do a gentle stretch just because I still wanted to move. I still had this energy moving. I didn't feel like standing there and meditating. So then I just slowly stretched in the shower for a few minutes and chilled the fuck out. So then when I came out of the shower, if someone saw me walk out then, I would have looked pretty damn cool as far as I'm concerned. And this has happened throughout this day and almost every single fucking day of my life. That there is this oscillation between the impulse to create stress and the fact that I have studied my internal stress and I've learned tools to resolve it. Many people have not. Probably a lot of you guys out there have not. You either know how to turn off completely, which we'll talk about in a second, or you're in a low level or high level state of stress all the fucking time. So many students come to me and they walk like this. And I go and I go, I put my hand on the shoulder and go like, and they go, huh? And then I leave them and then a minute later they're up again. So many guys I work with have chronic physical stress where they're holding all of this extra tension and muscular contraction in their body that is completely unnecessary. And in bad cases, it means that guys walk around like this. You know, like these kind of strange robocop versions of men. And it doesn't look very sexy. And people can tell when they look at you, when they speak to you that you are in chronic stress. And the reality is people feel stressed when they're around stressed people. This is one of the reasons why I got good with women or how I got good with women was by learning to be physically relaxed in my physical form. And then when I'm around somebody, I can feel when they're tension raising and I counteract that often by relaxing myself more. And then this tends to lead somebody else into the same relaxed state. Women want to be around the guy that they, there is levels of tension as we know, you know, from the five principles that pressure and release that creating of tension can be a really powerful thing. But there's a quality to that tension. Sexual tension is this uncertainty building. It's something that it's an anticipation of the unknown in a really sexy way. All right, so that's a good thing. That's a tension that holds people's attention or draws somebody towards you. Speaking of which, just a little plug, coming up on the 17th of March is the re-release, the final release of my legacy edition of the five principles of natural seduction. So this is the course, the online home study course, which I developed based on everything that I have derived from my teaching guys live for the last 10 plus years. I put it into a course three years ago, I think it was. Roaring success, people loved it. Awesome successes for the students involved. And then I re-released it a couple of years later. And this is my final release of the online course. I have updated everything. I've gone through all the old material and then I have re, well, I've recorded new analysis or a new, let's say, a new take on the old principles, which is blowing this out to, I don't know, dozens of hours of incredible material. So if you want to find out more about that, click the link in the description, put your email in, you get a free video as a little bribe to get your email and then mark that in your diary that on the 17th, the legacy edition of the five principles is being released. Anywho, back to positive and negative tension. So positive tension is this draw, this tractor beam, whereas most of the time, what I'm talking about here is negative tension. This is where someone feels uncomfortable and awkward in their own skin. And that doesn't create sexual tension. That creates awkwardness, right? So somebody, and the girl sees when she's with that guy, okay, this guy is not comfortable in this situation, so how can I be? All right, we're gonna just get a little scoot across. She can't be comfortable with you if you are uncomfortable. And as a result, she wants to get away from that situation. All right, so that's often why the initial approach, you go up and you speak to the girl and you're feeling awkward and she feels your awkwardness and she's like, I don't want to deal with this. Even if he was to be the man of my dreams, I'm not gonna deal with it right now, so I'm just gonna fuck off and go, sorry, I got a boyfriend. So this is vitally important from a seduction perspective. If you wanna be good with girls, you can't just fake being chilled. Well, you can actually, if you're really good at it. And that's something I used to practice as well. When I was a musician, I would hang out in live band situations out in the music scene and there was a lot of people who had learned how to act cool, all right? And what does it mean to be cool? I think really, real cool is when someone is at ease with themselves, all right? And you see this with people who are very naturalistic in what they're doing. And I really like looking at old photos of tribes when anthropologists just find them. One thing that I really like about them is because they're not self-conscious looking at the camera because they don't really know what a camera is. And they're not used to being under the gaze of all alternate judgment eyes, right? So if you live in a tribal culture, you only have the tribe around you. They judge you based on what it means to be in that tribe. And if you fit within that, you exist there. You're part of the crew. You feel cool about yourself. You don't have to necessarily prove yourself in massive dominance hierarchies. I know the dominance hierarchies exist, but there is a naturalistic sense of like, I'm at ease with myself being this thing. One of the symptoms of postmodern world is on one hand, it's awesome. You get to choose exactly what tribe you live within, or you can make your own, or you can blend them. Obviously, I don't fit exactly within. I'm not a typical Australian male anymore. What am I? I'm some expatriate Euro-Australian hipster mixed with CEO, mixed with hippie mix. And that's awesome. I got to mash up who I am and feel cool, feel okay about that. But so that the good thing about this is that we get to choose the elements of what father figures we take, or what cultural elements we take, or what belief systems we take on. It means there is infinite potential on what you can be to redefine yourself as a man. And on the negative side of that is that there is often crisis of identity for all human beings, if they're not clearly within one in-group. But particularly, I think for young men trying to figure out who the fuck they are, where do they fit in and how do they make that work, right? So if you have to reinvent what it means to be a man in this postmodern world, each man has to do that themselves. Well, how do you do one that feels good for you and also works in the sense that, you know, you can interface with the rest of the world, you can succeed, you can have people accept you, you can have influence and you can have females wanting to fuck you. It's an important question, one that needs to be looked into deeply. You can't just rely on like getting to some state, some position in your life where you just feel cool all the time. Well, you're not just affecting it by putting on the sunglasses and wearing the right thing and standing in the right pose. As I was saying before, I used to work and live in, hang out in situations where people did a lot of that, right? So cool band guys, you could see if you had a keen eye for it, it might fool some of the young girls that walked in, but for the keen eye, you could see the tension underlying the cool, right?
