If your intention at this point is, I want to meet pretty girls and find out how they work, that is good, that is realistic, that is healthy. So do that. And when you see that pretty girl, that's your intention. When I do an approach, I have a very, very simple intent. I want to come and meet you, and I say it to myself, and I feel it, and I project it, and that's my admission to actually go and approach. It's very simple, it's very achievable, because I can do that every single time. And the moment I've done that, my intention shifts to something else. So let me show you, Kristen. Now this is like a microcosm of what could happen in an interaction. This could happen within five minutes, yes, this can happen, or this may happen over several hours or over several dates. I, again, don't adhere to a time frame. I've had seductions that took minutes, and I've had seductions that were on a juicy low simmer for six months, and I relished it. I wasn't the only thing I was doing for that six months, I wouldn't have relished it then. But a protracted seduction can be amazing, because you can learn so much about yourself, so much about your limits, and so much about women. So there she is, I see her. Hi. Hi. How are you? I'm wonderful, how are you? This is between me and her, by the way. It's a little loud in here, can we go? Okay, so this is what's happening on the surface. Now within every interaction there are at least three levels of communication happening. We've got what's being said, more or less irrelevant, particularly in this kind of context. Secondly, what's happening with our physical touch. And thirdly, and most importantly, what's happening at the intention level. So what's happening in my mind at this point is, I look her deep in the eyes, I'm friendly, I'm open, I'm curious, I want to come and meet you. At this point, whatever I'm saying is irrelevant, and I'm looking her deep in the eyes and I'm thinking, you're absolutely fucking stunning. When I'm in this close, this is intimacy. This is about me and her and everything else dissolves. So my intention is, I want to know your secrets. Can you hear that? That's my intention. Now, at some point in the interaction, I need to pull the fucking trigger. This is the moment where a lot of guys mess up. The girl is interested, she's ready to go, she's ready to be escalated on. She wants it, and she doesn't want you to test by doing some like three kisses on her forehead or something just to see if it might work. Yeah. She wants you to be a man and take the lead so that she can submit and enjoy that part of what it is to be feminine. So at that moment, it becomes lust, pure and simple. I want to take you. And finally, the leadership, you have to release a little bit of pressure because now she has to trust you. If I just blaze her with sex eyes the entire time, it becomes sleaze. Yeah. So there's not just one level of intention. There are multiple levels that will be shifting constantly depending on the needs of the situation. So the last one is, it's playful, it's fun. Trust me, it's going to be good. Let's go. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. "}
