Sometimes within a social circle people will have a simmering attraction or like the nanny and what was the English dude and the nanny that took like six seasons for them to finally get together. I don't know, many TV shows where there's the boiling simmering thing and it's giving guys the wrong idea that if you just sort of kind of hang around each other for long enough that eventually you'll have this boiling attraction. Yeah, occasionally people who've been friends or colleagues for ages will hook up at a work event or something but it's the exception rather than the rule. Women are attracted to men fast if they're going to be attracted to him and the action of him taking action, the process of him demonstrating his masculinity, his intent, his intentions and trying to move this somewhere is an attractive thing in and of itself. Just being static me as my personality without the action of showing what it does and how it operates in the world is not very attractive. I can be on paper the most technically interesting man on the planet, even more interesting than Dan Blazarian, even more interesting than a guy who got all his money from his dad and says that he won it in poker and has a golden machine gun. Even more interesting than that, yet if I just stand there and do nothing, then what is it? It's inert, right? So it's the action of me moving and doing shit with my life that demonstrates who I am and in context of man-woman, that is the, okay, I'm taking action to try and date you, to ask you out, to try and kiss you, to all the stuff that is seduction, right? So if I haven't demonstrated that I'm capable of that very quickly, then the girl very, very quickly puts me into a category of friend or irrelevant male in my orbit."}
