Yeah, she said, I'm Russian, so I might be dangerous or something. Okay, that's some flirtation there. Yeah. Wait, let's recap. You stopped her, then she kind of kept walking a little bit, and then... Good morning, everybody. We are in Barcelona, 2022. I'm here with JC. Hello. That's how I can call you, right? JJC. Yes, you can. Jean-Christophe. My pleasure. We're going infield today. We're on this beautiful seven-day workshop. It's day two. We're going to talk to a lot of ladies. How do you feel? A bit nervous, of course, but excited also. How was yesterday for you? The first day of this wild adventure? It went great, actually, and I was a bit mad at myself because I didn't do enough, but it felt great. It was amazing with the coaches. All right. Cool. Don't be mad at yourself. We're going to do much more. Yeah. You have the rest of your life to do it. Yeah. Hey, excuse me. You look like you are waiting for a taxi. You are? No. I went for the bus. Ah, okay. I love your style. Thank you. It's like you sell ice cream, you know? Oh, nice. Yeah. Do you? No, I don't. You are studying, maybe? Yeah. Okay. This is your bus? Yeah. Okay. Have a nice day. Thank you. Always good to get the first one done. Yeah. Yeah. Fine. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Yeah, fine, you know? Obviously, very tight time constraint when her bus is literally coming ten seconds later. Not much you can do. If you maybe already had a minute with her, you could have said, hey, when is the next one? Oh, yeah. You know? Let's chat a bit, but it was just \u2026 Oh, yeah. \u2026 it was too tight. So, it's fine. Oh, that one. You're from here? Yeah. I'm from Brazil. You're from Brazil. Yeah. I love \u2026 I couldn't tell you you're from Brazil because, usually, you guys have so many tattoos. Really? Yeah. Many you have. Maybe you have tattoos that I can't tell. Okay. My name is Jean, actually. I'm from \u2026 My father is Rafael, so it's like the same name. I love it. I love that you have Ray-Bans. Oh, thanks. I have the same, but like way cheaper, like three or four euros at Primark. Okay. I don't know, like the architecture. I love, like, spying in people's house, into people's house. Yeah. Yeah. It's nice to meet you. Looking at their furniture. Nice to meet you. It was nice meeting you. Have a good day. That was beautiful. Why did it feel awkward? Oh, the stop wasn't perfect. Like, I was a bit like \u2026 I wasn't face-to-face with her. Yeah. And after that, she was responsive, so I really \u2026 The connection could have been strong. Yeah. And I left it silent because I actually didn't know exactly what to say, so I left it silent. Mm-hmm. When did you leave it silent? I didn't hear much silence. Towards the end. Okay. And that's very interesting. Yeah. Right? Because in your mind, it's like, oh, my God. There was so much silence, but there wasn't at all, which means you have to stretch your level of being comfortable with silence, you know? Now it's like half a second that you're comfortable, you have to turn it into just being able to stand there and just stare at them, because it's going to create a lot of emotional impact and a lot of, yeah, strong anchors. Because you stopped her fine, good enough. She stopped. She liked you. She liked the look of you. You know, she was charmed. That's all good. But then you talked so much that she was like, I don't know what this is. So that's why she left. Yeah. So there was not enough silence. You jump between, like, four topics and, like, you're just, like, rambling at her. So you're like, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh. It's almost like you did a free association game in an improv class. Yeah, kind of. You have to see something and you talk about it. You have to slow that down. It's good that you're creative, but chill out, right? Slow it down. One question, then we listen, then we hear her, you know, it's like, oh, you're Brazilian. What made you move to Barcelona? Buh, buh, buh, buh. She finishes her sentence, you're like, okay. Was that difficult for you? We're going into that one topic deeper, right? Then she, buh, buh, buh, we listen. We leave space. I'm like, oh, I understand that was not easy, but cool that you managed or whatever, right? It's not like, ding, ding, ding, ding. Does it clear things up for you? Yeah, basically we just need one topic that works. Yes. Cool. All right. Quick commercial break and a question for you. Be honest, how many TNL videos have you watched in the last 30 days? If it's more than three, then what are you waiting for? Book a discovery call with us. It's going to be either a cock with me or Ryan, and we're going to discover where you at in life. Where's your dating life? How can we help you? Are you a good match to come on one of our workshops? Stop wasting time on YouTube. Stop wasting time at home. Life happens here outside. There's beautiful girls in here in Barcelona who are waiting for you to approach them, and we want to help you do that. We want to help you be a better communicator and have a better life. So book a call now. Don't just keep watching, and if it's logistically impossible for you, or maybe the budget is too high to come on one of our workshops, you can work with me online, one-on-one, in my private mentoring program. There's another link down there to get all the information on that. It's going to be several calls, the rest of our eight weeks, and I'm going to keep you accountable. We're going to set goals, and I'm going to make sure you're going to reach those goals. So take action. Don't just watch. Now, back to the video. I see you texting. No texting, but... No texting in English. No English? No. No, okay. Have you learned English at school? A bit? No, I don't understand. No? Not a bit. Not a bit, okay. No. I just wanted to say that you're amazing. That's all. Okay, bye. Hello. Hello. Almost forgot Todd. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. You must be waiting for someone, right? That's all right. And in general, do you know about this topic of like, oh what if the boyfriend comes, or the guy comes. I don't feel that. Yeah, it's very chill. In my like seven years of doing this and coaching many years and coaching hundreds of guys, we didn't have a single moment of like proper violence, or anything like that. You know, maybe the guy's like, oh, you guys look great together. Have a good day. And you're like, okay. It's a moment of love, and then it's fine. Yeah. Hey, excuse me. I just saw you from over there, and I thought you look absolutely amazing. Thank you so much. Are you Spanish? You have to go. Oh, wait. I just... You go in that direction? Yes. Well, I only have two minutes myself, so no problem. Are you French? No, I'm Russian, so you should be dangerous because of me. Oh, you're a danger. Yeah, of course. Okay, so... You should be scared. All right. Let's see. Okay. Anyway, don't kill anybody today, all right? Okay. See ya. Was she a Russian spy, she said? Yeah. She said, I'm Russian, so I might be dangerous or something. Okay. That's some flirtation there. Yeah. Yeah. I think if I had some... I could have handled it and make her stop and stay. I think that was an option, definitely. Wait, let's recap. So you stopped her, then she kind of kept walking a little bit. Yeah. And then why did you let her go? Did you speed up or you just felt like you don't want to deal with the walking part? Yeah. I wanted to deal with the walking part, but I wanted her to stop. But if I don't stop her, I think it's okay. Okay. So here's the thing. Often, the girl doesn't want to stop. So you just go with her. Fair enough. You go with her. And then we do what we basically just mentioned. You have to get her to a level where she feels comfortable with you. Because she's still on the edge. She's like, who is this guy? Stranger approaching me on the street. Of course, she's a little bit like, all right. She's testing you. You have to understand that, and that's okay. And then you chill her down. So you're like, okay, that's cool, Russia. And then get into the conversation. You're not allowing yourself to even get into her. Because she answered your question. Yeah. She turned it a bit. She wasn't like, Russia. Yeah. And she was smiling. Yeah. She didn't blow you out at all. It was you doing it. Most of the time, the guy rejects himself. So yesterday, with the coach, you didn't see that. But I have a tendency of just backing off. Exactly. Right. And it's very normal. Because it's uncomfortable. You're like, okay, I did the one thing, which is I stop. I say a compliment. What's next? You know? Basically, the rule is, like, the growth always happens in the uncomfortable environment. With everything. You know? Like, you can do five push-ups, right? That's easy. It doesn't hurt. But if you stop after five, you didn't really train your muscles. It must, like, hurt. You know? Like, even when I met Elise, somebody asked him, like, how many push-ups you do? And he's like, I don't know. I only start counting once it hurts. The same is going to be here. The zone where you're going to grow the most is where you feel uncomfortable. Because that's a new territory for you. That's where you have never been before. Like, suddenly you stand there and you ask me, like, how can I stay longer with a girl by staying longer with her? You know? Like, you're not even allowing yourself to stay longer with her. Maybe you could have talked ten minutes with her. Maybe after walking one minute with her, you can say, oh, let's stop here for one minute. Is that okay for you? Because I need to go the other way. And then Angie's like, all right, now I know this guy a bit more. Now she stands. Because it's awkward. The first three minutes are always going to be awkward. You know, even for me, in a way, like, obviously I'm way more comfortable just putting pressure on a person than sitting in pressure. But it's never going to be normal that two strangers just meet on the street. You know? Like, it's always going to be a little bit of, hmm. And it's your job as a man to just sit in it. You know? Just, like, feel your feet, look at her or walk with her, react to what she's saying. You can leave pauses. There's no rush. Excuse me. Hi. I saw you sitting there. You're, like, writing a text to somebody. I don't know. Okay. But you look really charming. Thank you. That's very kind of you. Yeah. Maybe you're into fashion. I don't know. Like, there's something. I'm not into fashion. Okay. I'm a tourist. Me too. You too? Okay. Are you from the United States? I'm not. I'm from South Africa. Oh. I thought, yeah, her English is, like, quite perfect. Oh. Where are you from? I'm from Brussels, Belgium. Okay. So you speak a bit of Afrikaans? A bit of Afrikaans, yes. Okay. How do you know Afrikaans? Because we speak Dutch also in France. Oh, yes. Of course. But I speak French. You speak French? Yeah. Je parle fran\u00e7ais aussi. Non. J'habite du Bordeaux. Oh. So how come you travel that much? So I'm here with my brother. Okay. Yeah. Just for one week. So you are showing him around? No. It's my first time in Barcelona. Okay. So, yeah. And yourself? Yeah. I'm with a bunch of friends. Okay. And we are visiting, doing all sorts of crazy things. Oh, that's cool. Going on adventure. That's awesome. That's what life's about. Yeah. Yeah. I guess with your brother, you cannot really... Well, yeah. We usually... Well, he works during the day and then... Oh. Yeah. He's here for business a little bit. Oh, yeah. So you're a bit... Doing shopping? Doing shopping and then meeting up with him. Okay. I'm meeting him in 30... 15, 30 minutes. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Where's your friends? Well, actually, I'm looking for them. You lost them? Yeah, with, you know, WhatsApp directions. Yeah. Yeah. I came here with friends, but I'm into theater, actually. Oh, lovely. I'm an amateur comedian. Okay, that's cool. Yeah. I play in a romantic comedy, which is called Com\u00e9die Romantique. Okay. That's very cool. And, yeah. So, yeah, the main character is falling in love with a girl. Okay. And I'm having all sorts of bad luck with girls. That's great. And also, my leg is broken, so I have crutches. Yeah. Have you ever broken a bone? No, I have not broken a bone. Oh. Never. Have you? Never. That's good. We are like old people. We take care of ourselves. Yeah. Well, I'm a dancer, so I can't get injured. Oh. Yeah. I have to take care of myself very well. Oh, cool. Yeah. So, what do you dance? You dance for a ballet or something? No, jazz. Modern jazz. Oh. Yeah. I'm a choreographer in France. That's what I do. Oh. I love that. Yeah. It's very fun. Wow, it's impressive. I love watching that. I don't know anything about it. Yeah. Okay. So, you're a teacher and just... Well, I'm not a teacher. I don't like teaching. Oh. But I just... You just audition. You just dance. Yeah. It's complicated. It's not easy to describe. No? Yeah. Like finding a job is complicated? Yeah. Yeah. Because you're always auditioning. Auditioning and then you're traveling. You know about auditioning. You know. Yeah, but this is your job. Your main... This is my main job. This is how you earn your life. This is how I earn my life. Yeah. I'm happy. That's big. Yeah. Yeah. How long are you staying? I'm staying until the 21st. Oh, wow. Okay. So... Yeah. You still have a long time. Yeah. That's awesome. How about you? I'm leaving tomorrow. Oh. Yeah. I flew in yesterday and I'm going tomorrow. It's going to be three days. So, it's like the city trip around the... Yeah. Back to Europe. You do a Eurotrip? No, no, no. Just... Just going to Europe. Oh. No, yeah. I still haven't seen Europe. I haven't seen a lot. I haven't been to Belgium. Hmm. I think you picked the right place to start off. I think so. It's great. Yeah. And you met the right person. What's your name? Okay, JC. JC? What does that stand for though? Oh yeah, you speak French. Jean-Christophe. Okay, I know a few JC's. I have two in my team. Oh yeah. Jean-Charles. Oh yeah, it's a lot. And your surname? It's like Luxembourgish. Okay, that's very nice. You know Luxembourg? Do you know Luxembourg? I haven't been there, but I know it. You know the capital? No. It's Luxembourg City. Oh, okay. That's easy. It's super easy. That's very easy. I like that. And what city are you from? South Africa? Cape Town. Cape Town. That's the southern part, I guess. The southern part of the continent of Africa. So there's a lot to visit there, I guess. But not administratively, there's not much. No, not really. It's a tourist destination for people on holiday. Yeah, cool. Yeah. I think I'll go get back my friends, but I'd like to take you on a drink tonight. If you have time. Oh, I can't play tonight. We're going to the Barcelona match. We're watching the Barcelona match. Oh, amazing. Yeah, really good. It's La Liga, so they're playing against... Yeah. Okay. I'm going with my brother. I'm not even doing this. I'm staying two weeks. Yeah, you've got to go. Come on. Me and my brother are going tonight together. Okay. Anyway, it was really fun meeting you. If you're ever in Bordeaux, then... Yeah. Yeah, for sure. This is a city I haven't visited yet. Oh, yeah? Oh, it's probably the best in France. Better than Paris. Oh, yeah. I don't like Paris that much. Oh, it's... You can find me on Instagram. I use Instagram more. Do you have a Dutch name or no? I'm not Dutch at all. My father is Portuguese. My mom is English. Oh, yeah. I was just born in Slovakia. Yeah. That was terrible. Do you have a French number, I guess? No. No, my number is actually my... Oh, it popped up. You don't call yourself that often? No, but I use Instagram more than WhatsApp or texting. Oh. Because I travel a lot, it's difficult with texting. Oh, yeah. So that's kind of... Are you posting some dancing shit on your... Sometimes. Oh. Not a lot, but sometimes. Okay, I'd like to see this because... Oh, yeah. Especially when I meet people when I'm traveling, I prefer to add them on Instagram because then I get to see what you do. Yeah. You travel. And you'll see I'm a real person. Ah. There you go. Okay, that's you. That's me. Amazing. It might be a dancing thing. Yeah, it would be a... It's not about my job. I have a reason to visit Bordeaux. One more reason. Yeah. And see you perform or taking a class. I don't know. No, performing. Anyway, it was nice meeting you. Nice meeting you. Ciao. And enjoy the next two weeks. Yeah. I hope I will. Ciao. Man. Cutie. Yeah. What do you think? I think it went pretty well. Yeah. Really all sorts of positive things. And she... She... I think she started with the... Let's exchange numbers. Yeah, that's crazy. That she's like... Yeah. As good as... Yeah. And she... Yeah, I think there would have been the game at Camp Nou. She would have... We would have met. Yeah. And then she's leaving tomorrow though? Yeah. Okay. Too bad. But now you see... I think because you were sitting down, you had a way calmer energy. And you just were... Because you were sitting down, there was no rush. You were grounded. It made your conversation more grounded as well. You gave it way more space. You got curious about her. Yeah. So now try to take that energy even into a busy street. Even... You know, I know it's hard. But it is totally possible to create like a bubble with someone even in a rushed environment because it's often just going to happen. You know, like sometimes the girl is sitting down and she's smiling at us and everything is perfect and it's easy. Sometimes she's busy, she's rushing down the street. And we have to still create that environment for her. Yeah. That's what we want. Under pressure, like. Yeah. I didn't understand the part with romantic comedy. I'm an amateur comedian. Okay, that's cool. Yeah. I play in a romantic comedy which is called Com\u00e9die Romantique. Is that your... Oh yeah. No, no. I wrote in a play. Oh, you wrote in a play. And I used that as a story. I understand. Okay. So, already pretty good, right? You felt it yourself. It slowed down. You can go into certain topics now even deeper because you have the environment. She's sitting down. No rush. She's not giving you a, I need to go in two minutes. You can take now even more time. So when she said like she's a teacher but she doesn't really like being a teacher. Yeah, something like that. Right? Obviously, we want to be careful. We don't want to talk about things that she is not into at the beginning. You know, that's stuff you can talk about on a second date, okay? But at the very initial thing, we want to keep it positive and happy. So, you can go into that. Oh, what would you rather do? Or do you have an exit plan, you know? Find out what's next for her. What's her other passion, you know? But you can still use that topic to go deeper into another topic. Because you were on the topic of what she's doing and what she's not passionate about. So, use that to figure out what is she passionate about, what she's exciting for in the future and so on. Because as always, the topic, whatever you talk about, is only like a vehicle to get into an emotional space. Like it doesn't matter if you talk about traveling or her job or what she likes to eat or the way she dresses or, you know. But the emotional space, it has to be like rather positive. At the beginning, yeah. For sure. Like if she's like, oh, I hate being a teacher. You know, she's like, oh, why do you hate it? Oh, because my colleagues are assholes. Or what did they do to you? Your life, why is that? What did they do to you to make you feel bad? And then suddenly she's sad, you know? And she cries. She has an emotion. No, that's not good. At the beginning, no. Obviously, there's a time and space to go into like traumatic stuff and so on. That's okay. You know, for later, obviously, that's cool. But at the beginning, you want to create a good mood. Cool. All right. Nice. Okay, because you look very chill. Just wait a minute. You might be Russian, I think. Ukrainian. Ukrainian, sorry. You're looking gorgeous. Thank you. What about that? Do you do fashion? No. I'm a shop assistant. I'm working now. You're working now? I have a break. Oh, it's your break. So you're going to eat. Yes, I'm going to eat. So you are a shop assistant? Yes. Do you like that? I don't even know what it is. Like you go shopping for people? No, I sell sunglasses. I was going to say something about yours. They're quite good. Yeah. They shoot you. What? They shoot you. Ah, thank you. Very much. What is your name? My name is JC. I'm from Belgium, actually. And what are you doing here? I'm looking for my friends. I lost them. Do you have a lot of friends here? No. No? Just two. Just two? But two friends. That's amazing, right? Yes. I like it. You can go party, enjoy Barcelona's life. It's complicated with work. With work, yeah. You work a lot? Yes. Yeah, but you are a perfectionist, I can tell. It's eight days that I work without a break. Without three days. Oh, yeah. You don't have a pause. Never. And I need to work more four days. Oh. Two weeks below. I think you should chill from all that. You should take a vacation from that. You know, a small vacation. No, I can't take a vacation because of the season. No? Yeah. Well, we could take a half an hour vacation and have a drink tonight. What do you think of that? It's impossible. It's impossible? One week vacation. No, I mean one hour vacation. Ah, one hour. It's not a vacation. It can be, I think. It's a break. You are... Right? Like it means victory. It means you defeat whatever the opponent is, right? Yeah. Yeah, I feel you have a strong vibe. I like it. I like it a lot. You are very... There is something charming. You know what? We'll go for a walk tonight, of course. When you finish work and then... I will be so tired. You'll be so tired? Yeah. I come home at 10 o'clock, so... You come home at 10 o'clock? Yeah. And tomorrow I need to wake up early, so it's impossible. Okay. So, you have to take a holiday someday, I think. Yeah. Small, little vacation in your head. Anyway, that was nice meeting you. Yeah. I hope you have a good day. Yeah, you too. And everything is going to be better and better. Thank you. Okay. Bye. Did you take her number or anything? No. Okay, run back and get her number. I tried, I tried. What did you say? Then get Instagram. Let's be friends on Instagram. Okay, okay. Victoria. Do you have Instagram? Yes, I have. Okay, can I follow you on Instagram? Because I want to know more about your sunglasses. Okay. And I will like your picture if ever you go on vacation. And I see you on vacation, I say, this is Victoria finally having a vacation. It's a bit warm to wear this, right? Yeah, but it's for night. Yeah. When you come out, it's like the wolves are screaming. Yeah. Anyway, I really liked your vibe. And as I said, have a nice day. I knew there was something more to do. Job's not finished. Job's not finished? Job's finished? I don't think so. All right, nice. So, she was a bit of a different vibe to the other one. How would you describe her differently than the one sitting down? Oh, definitely more shy. Yes. But that's kind of it. She was more shy and maybe she had things going on in her life, I would say. But she was receptive and positive. Yes. And she didn't want to leave, really. That's very good you say, because you could interpret the shyness as she's not into me. But that's not true. That's not true. All it is, she's just shy. She's a shy person. Exactly. Who is into you? Because she said. So, I'm very happy that you make that distinction. Yes. And remember that because it's going to come up again in other forums where it's like, she looked like a bitch, she didn't like me. She walked really fast, she's busy. All those interpretations of a fantasy. It's not reality. We have to find out. And that's cool. A shy girl needs basically more leadership. Which you did actually well. You got into, you were a bit also shy at the beginning. But in the end, you kind of realized, okay, I have to guide her. Like we just say, hey, this is what we do or how you say it. Like, let's do that. Let's do it. Yeah. One hour vacation. Something like that. It's great. Cool. That's what she needs, right? Like a shy girl, she needs leadership from the guy. You're in a masculine role and you're going to tell her what's going to happen. And you did that super good. When she asks you, what are you doing here? Or what are you doing now? You're just like, oh, looking for a friend. Yeah. That's kind of a waste of her interest. You know, like she's interested in you. Even though she's shy, she asked you a question. So use that. Yeah. Use that to tell more about yourself. Use that for her to get to know you. Can I use a lie or a white lie or something? No. I mean, what are you doing here? I'm on holiday. I'm on holiday. You don't look like a holiday. There's meat. I'm on a workshop. Shouting at you. I'm on a workshop, yeah. Yes. What are you doing on the workshop? I'm doing a self-help workshop, meditation, stretching. More than that. Meeting social skills. Why are you really here? Good question. I don't know. I feel better about myself. Yes. So you're here to learn about yourself, to improve yourself. Do you need water? Yeah, thank you. I got it. You're here to overcome barriers, right? Sure, you're here to talk to girls on the street. That's true, but we can tell that way better. You're here to improve yourself. You're here on a workshop to overcome your fears, to learn a new version of yourself, to come out of a shell, to challenge yourself, to start a new chapter in your life. There are so many cool things you're doing this week, apart from saying hi to girls on the street. Yes. And that's what she wants to hear, because obviously every other guy is like... Waiting for a friend or anything. I'm waiting for a friend, I'm on holiday, I'm looking at the cathedral, it looks nice. If you're the guy who's like, I'm the baller who's on a mission to fucking change his life, and I'm challenging myself this week to new things, she's going to remember that. Yeah. Because most guys don't say that, right? So when then later your name is on her phone, you start texting, she's like, oh, that's the guy who's on a mission. And that whole energy she wants to feel as well. Yeah. So you can say all that without her even prompting you, without her asking you, but if she's asking you even better, then it's always amazing when they ask me a question, it's like, oh, she's actually interested in me. I might as well use that to anchor something strong. I can bait her, small baits like, yeah, I'm here to change my life, and then maybe she will ask, oh yeah, how's that? You can, that's a bit vague as well. Either that, I mean, it doesn't matter too much, or you just go into a little of a rant, that's fine as well. Like, it doesn't, it's, you're not going to overshare. Like, it's okay, you can share a bit, and if you make it sound as cool as it is. I'll be inspired and just say what I, what true promise is."}
