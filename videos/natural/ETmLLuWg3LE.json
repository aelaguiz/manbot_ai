And during my time as being a professional seducer and seduction coach, I've certainly learned a hell of a lot about women, about how to escalate, about how to seduce, about different girls from all around the world. But in reality, I've learned a lot more about men than I have about women. Because I'm in a pretty unique situation where guys from every walk of life, every age group, every race, every country, tell me their deepest and darkest secrets, fears, and dreams. Because in order for me to be a good coach, they have to reveal everything to me. And so I get to see what's really below the surface, below the ego, below the pride, below the front and the masks that people put up in order to operate in the world. And over all of that time, the thing that has consistently, over and over again, been the number one thing that guys are concerned about, the problem that they have, is the anxiety around approaching women. Even after a decade or more of there being a huge amount of information that's available on the internet or through various schools and coaches, it's still over and over again, the thing that guys come to us for, primarily, initially, is to be able to deal with this approach anxiety. So today, what I want to do is dig deep into this topic and really start to dissect what it means and look at ways and strategies that you are going to be able to move into a much more free and open space with your interactions with women. Hello. How are you doing? I'm James. What's your name? Kiki. Cool. What are you doing? You don't understand. You understand this, that I think you're banging, sexy, awesome, and I wanted to say hello. You understood that, right? More or less? Okay. Can you lift your sunglasses? You can't? They're glued to your face. They're stuck to your face. Okay. All right. Well, see you later. Shall we continue? Now, the first thing that's important to do is define our terms. There is a big difference between anxiety and fear. Fear is a natural biological response to deadly situations. So it is a visceral physical reaction to a real or perceived threat that is happening basically now or in the not too distant future where we perceive something to be life-threatening or at the very least threatening to, let's say, our marriage or our position in society. Something that has a very real effect. And the interesting thing is that naturally children are only wired to be afraid of loud noises and snakes. So our brains are like hardwired to be definitely afraid of those things because typically they indicate something that is possibly going to cause us a life-threatening situation. Everything else we have to get conditioned to become afraid of. And interestingly enough, we can get conditioned to be unafraid of things that are actually very dangerous. Because I say this to students often, what is it the one thing, if you're living in a major metropolis and one that is not full of gun violence or it's not being bombed, what is the one thing that is actually dangerous to you? And the answer to that is traffic. Cars are the only thing that is really dangerous in a city like this. People will stand this far away from imminent death over and over again. They stand at the edge of a road as cars whiz by. Each one of them could easily at any moment swerve and kill you and yet you feel nothing. Your body does not respond at all in a way that probably it should. So the responses to fear have to be conditioned in and then if we are overloaded with stimulus about something that is potentially dangerous, eventually we just stop seeing it, which is the reason why the main thing that's likely to kill you in a city is walking out into traffic or having a car hit you. Now on the other hand, what is anxiety? Anxiety is more of a psychological glitch which is based around your perception of threats that may happen in the future and often they are not to do with physical harm, although they certainly can be, but they're more to do with psychological harm, perceiving that something in the future is going to cause you to feel awful about yourself based usually around the judgment or assessment of other people. And in this talk today I'm talking very specifically about social anxiety and the dreaded approach anxiety. Approach anxiety is something that was invented by the seduction community essentially in order to justify certain types of limitations that people place on themselves and later to sell products to people. And when the original seduction material came out in the early 2000s, based around the mystery method, there was this concept that approach anxiety was something that was hardwired into us. It was a biological response that every man was always going to have it, just like that fear of snakes and fear of loud noises that you have a fear embedded in you of attractive women or women that you perceive to be high value, because the theory was that back in the caveman days, which is a very simplistic way to look at pre-agricultural societies, back in the caveman days that when we lived in small social units, tribal units of maybe a hundred people or less, that if you approached a girl in her hut and said, hey baby, I like you and you want to breed? And she said, no way, I think you're a loser, a caveman loser. Then everyone in the tribe would know that you were a loser and then all women would decide I'm never going to breed with that guy. And then your genes would be deleted from the gene pool. And therefore it was an existential fear. It was a fear that if you get rejected, the timeline of your genes ends. That's a theory and it's based on zero research, based on zero science, pure speculation. And to me, it sounds ridiculous because in the caveman days, people weren't cold approaching. They all knew each other because they were in a small tribal unit. Like many traditional societies, marriages were often arranged by the parents, you were allocated partners. And so the whole idea of running up to a stranger and trying to start an interaction, that didn't exist. And that's something that's a result of larger scale societies in modern history. So I think that idea is completely false. I think it's just a theory. And unfortunately a lot of guys have believed that and therefore they've embedded in their mind as a belief that says, this thing is real, always ever present, and it has deep, deep biological roots that I can't fight, I can't work around. And therefore every time I want to go and approach a girl, I'm coming up against, against my body, against my genetics, against my entire physical form of fighting against nature. Even if there was truth in some level of truth in a biological aspect of this, it's a really bad mindset to carry around. It does not assist you. And my opinion is, there's no proof of it. So why are guys just taking that on face value? So let's have a look at this concept of approach anxiety. I think much more important than trying to come to some absolute conclusion on what this thing is, whether approach anxiety is a biological response or whether it's some figment of the imagination, the thing to deal with is the fact that something exists. So that almost universally, when I take a new guy out infield to go and approach girls, he feels weird. Something happens inside his body, which reacts with his psychology and his emotions. And he has some kind of lockdown or fear, kind of anxiety response to the prospect of going and talking to a woman. Almost every guy I teach experiences this. And I think there are two main ways to look at this. One is to look at what is the inherent anxieties, what is it that most men are concerned about and to recognize that most of those things are basically either not useful or completely untrue. Right? In terms of the things that you're afraid of, things that are not actually real because most guys don't approach girls because they're afraid of things such as being shouted at, having the cops called, being told to fuck off, having women awfully humiliate them, having women be incredibly nasty to them, all of these kinds of very extreme reactions, the most extreme things that could possibly happen. And I have been watching and listening in on a microphone to thousands and thousands of approaches of guys who have zero experience through a workshop to having some competency and seeing the reactions and the responses that women have. I know what women are going to do. And I know that if in a spread of a hundred approaches, that possibly one or two girls will be really nasty about it. And I know that when that happens, if a girl says fuck off, it's her problem, she's the one that has the issue. And it might be a legitimate issue, it might be just she's having a really shit day or she, you know, like she's having some personal issue in her life and the last thing she wants to do is talk to a guy or it might just be that she's a nasty, nasty person. But that is, that's the statistics, I see that. One in a hundred, two in a hundred maybe will be really nasty. On the other end, maybe five in a hundred, ten in a hundred will be really nice and open to almost any guy that comes up in a fairly respectful and calibrated way. He'll get a very, very open and awesome response. And then the rest of them, the vast majority of them will be somewhere in the range of polite blow off through to general disinterest through to just giving the guy a shot and standing there and listening to, oh yeah, I'm kind of curious and I'll see what's happening. Right? That's the reality of what's going to happen. And unless you've gone out and approached many hundreds of girls yourself, that won't be a reality for you. That's why men create all these very shitty movies in their heads about what is going to happen if they go and approach a girl. And they start to build the most negative one possible, the most negative scenario and implant that in their mind as if that was the thing that is always going to happen or the most likely thing that's going to happen. I know the truth. I've seen it thousands of times with my students, every type of student possible and I've done it myself countless times and I know the vast majority of people are going to be generally okay about being talked to. Of course there are big differences, hello, in cultures, some places are more open, some places are much more closed, but in general you are not going to get told to fuck off and nobody's going to call the cops on you for coming to talk to a girl. So aside from this concern that maybe something really awful is going to happen, which is very unlikely and once you start approaching, you recognize that awful things don't really happen when you're approaching in terms of like actual physical real world consequences. What's below that then? Because what is the thing that really stops men from taking action? I feel it's these two existential anxieties of men, which is one, to be ignored, to be not, to be invisible and even deeper and more terrifying is to be seen, to be revealed. That is the thing that men primarily are mostly anxious about is when they go up and speak to a woman, okay, so people around them might see things and they might get embarrassed by the social situation, the judgments of passers-by, yeah, that can be something that will make people feel weird about it and of course for most guys it appears to be much more difficult to approach a girl say in a crowded subway train than in an open park because they're dealing with multiple rejections, not just the rejection of the girl, but the rejection of the whole train carriage. But aside from that, what is most terrifying about it is that the woman that they've gone and spoken to who, if they've chosen her, is very attractive to them, therefore men, when they see a woman that they perceive to be very, very attractive, their perception is that she is somehow perfect. Because we place so much value on physical beauty as men and also the society that we live in also places a lot of value on young, beautiful women, they have a higher value in terms of people's perception. We perceive that if a woman like that rejects us because she's seen who we are, that we are not worthy human beings. And that essentially is the biggest issue that I am dealing with as a coach. It's not the technicalities of seduction, right, so most guys that come to me with practice can learn the nuts and bolts of seduction, they can learn how to say the things, how to use conversation frameworks, they can learn how to touch, they can learn how to use logistics and how to create good dates. All that stuff is their skills and they can be picked up sooner or later depending on how hard you work or what your natural aptitude is. But underneath that, the thing that makes the difference between guys who make very vast acceleration in their progress and the guys who stall and take a long, long time or never get it. is a sense of worthiness and entitlement, is feeling like you are enough, and that is the primary existential anxiety of men, is that you are not X enough to get that type of woman. And the X represents many things that we are told that we need to have in order to be worthwhile human beings. There is a lot of pressure on men to be grand achievers, and that your value as a human being is based, as a man, is based around how much you have succeeded in terms of the consensus reality. So that translates into how rich you are, how successful you are in your career, how cool you are, what you look like, what your social status is, how many men respect you, how many women desire you, how many Instagram followers you have, how many yachts you are on and how many Rolexes you have, and all of that external representations of value of a man in the modern world based on the kind of GQ ideal. And we are sold that message from various sources, from advertising, a lot of people want to sell us things from the general structures of society that want us to be good consumers and good workers. They want us to study hard, work hard, support a family, pay taxes and die, whilst paying for expensive cancer medication. There is a lot of structures in place that want you to believe, and I don't think of it as some kind of global conspiracy that there's some elite at the top doing this, but there's a whole lot of different factors that are going into telling men that unless you are XYZ, you are not worthwhile. And most men internalize this to believe that if they do not have certain arbitrary achievements or factors, or they don't feel like they have them, that women won't want them. So the anxiety around approaching really is about, if I go up to a woman and I go, Hi, I'm here because I find you attractive and I want to meet you, she's going to look at me, question me, and sooner or later, probably sooner, figure out, huh, on the scale of perfect men out there, this man doesn't rank, or he doesn't rank highly enough, and therefore I have the right and the ability to judge him, to assess him, to place him in a hierarchy and go, he is a loser. That's the thing that you guys are afraid of, really, is that the woman has the authority and the ability to decide whether or not you are a good, sexy human being, or whether you're a loser, whether you're out of the race, and whether you're not worthwhile. And that's a terrifying prospect, and so rather than have to face that, rather than have to face a woman looking you in the eyes, scanning you, using her terminator ability to just check in and go, alright, he's a loser, most men don't engage with it. Which is why most men almost never approach a girl outside of their social groups, outside of their university, outside of their workplace. Meaning that, although right now I'm in a city of over a million people, and I literally have access to meet anyone here, I can say hello, hello, hello, hello, to anyone walking by. I could potentially go and meet any person in the city. Most men view it like they're living in a tiny little village, where they know ten to a hundred people, and those are the only people that they ever interact with. And if they ever meet anyone else, it's because their social circle or their workplace or whatever, drew in some new, limited amount of people, and then possibly they get an introduction to meet somebody through that. So most men, no matter how big the city that they live in, essentially live in a tiny little village, in terms of their prospective choices they have with women. And that's awful, and that's a complete waste of being alive in this time and place, because you do not live in a tiny village where you don't get to choose where your parents force you to marry someone, because that's the way things are done. If you have the ability to get through this initial hurdle, this internal hurdle, because it's much more an internal thing than it is any kind of external technical aspect, then you have access to almost every woman on the planet. If you can walk up to her and say hello, you can start something. The biggest problem with this is that, and the biggest mistake that men are making, is that they are giving their authority. Hello there, how are you? You look very curious. It's just a big selfie stick, basically. What was I saying? Hang on a sec. Yeah, okay, carry on. The primary issue is that when a man goes up to a woman and approaches her and then is overcome by this anxiety and fear, what he's done is he's given her the authority to judge him. Literally, he has given her the agency and the authority to make that decision about who he is, not just about how he approached her, but him as a complete human being. And he's investing all of this expectation and fear into what it is that she thinks of him. If she gives him a really good reaction, then he feels like he is a little bit more worthy and possibly he's okay with himself. If she gives him any kind of negative reaction or neutral reaction, then he perceives that, okay, he was correct in that old and essentially ignorant assumption that he's not good enough because he doesn't have these things that society says that he must have. Keep this in mind, gentlemen, that when you go and talk to a woman, she cannot judge you as a human being because she has no fucking idea who you are. Most of the interactions that don't go very well, because I watched thousands of them, last for somewhere between 2 and 30 seconds. Within 2 or 30 seconds, the woman has either politely or less politely rejected the approach and ended the interaction and moved on. And when I start working with guys initially in their workshops, they'll come away from that kind of thing often feeling awful about themselves, feeling very shaken. And the reason that is because they perceive that that woman judged them correctly, like that she somehow is able to go, yes, I've assessed this human being based on his psychology, his emotions, his character, his soul, his heart, his hopes, his dreams. She's been able to check all that and go, not good enough for me. That is actually absurd because how can she make such an amazing judgment, such a perfect judgment of you in this tiny amount of time? Someone who's known you for years still can't really necessarily understand the depth of you and who you really are, but certainly not somebody who's known you for 30 seconds. So first thing to do is stop giving other people the right to make extreme judgments about you in very short amounts of time. The reality is what she has judged is what is in front of her. All she knows is the 10 seconds that she spent with you. All right, so that's all she has to work with. So the things that she'll be making her assessment on of whether she wants to continue this or not are based around your timing, your posture, your eye contact, the way you're dressed, of course, the way you look. Some people, some girls will look at you and go, I'm not into that kind of guy or that guy to me seems too old or too young or too whatever. Yes, girls and everybody makes snap assessments about what they're interested in and you're just going to have to accept that. I had to accept that a long time ago. I would not have gotten this far in my life if I had a problem with knowing that many women are just not into me. They're just not into the types of guy that I am or they've made arbitrary decisions about what kind of person they want to talk to and they've decided to screen me out before I had a chance to let them know that I'm a unique and amazing individual. So you're just going to have to accept that and again, that comes down to a girl, even if she rejects you on face value just because of your shoes, because of the shape of your face, because of the color of your skin, which can happen, that's not a rejection of you as a human being. That's just her having a particular prejudice or judgment that she's acting on and that's alright like all of us do. When you guys walk into a club, actually what you do is you reject 90% of the women in there before you go anywhere close to talking to them because you look around and go, too fat, too something, big nose, ugly, don't like her, whatever it is. You make snap assessments and doesn't matter what an awesome human being she is or how she might be the best fuck in the world or whatever, you've already rejected her. So accept that that is part of what human beings do. It can be brutal, but it is just a fact of life. But essentially, all she can do in those interactions is just reject the experience that she's had with you. She doesn't know what you're really like. All she knows is, in this moment, I don't want to continue this and that is often an indicator of things that you can improve. Of course, if you consistently get the response where the girl freaks out every time you talk to her, that's something to do with the way you're approaching her. That's because you're coming in too fast. That's because your timing is off. That's because you're boxing her in or some kind of technical aspect or timing aspect with the actual approach. That's the kind of stuff we work with all the time on workshops. In one day, I can fix all of that. If a guy comes to me and he's miscalibrating and getting all sorts of bad responses from the girl, I can fix that in a day because it's very clear to me why that is. So that kind of thing, yes, you need to take that as feedback. I'm not saying be delusional and go, anytime anything doesn't go my way, it's just her issue and I'm the most awesome man in the world and I don't need to change. Of course, we need to be able to change our behavior. But if it's, if what's happening is you're working on your skills, you're working on the technicalities of approaching and then you get a large spread of reactions, this comes down to her making snap judgments based on the small amount of information she has, not on your worth as a human being. One interesting thing about this approach anxiety is that before you had the concept that it was even remotely possible that a normal, average-looking, average-income man could run up to a woman on the streets and talk to her and maybe get a number, before you thought that was even conceptually a possibility, you didn't experience approach anxiety. So think about it. If you can think back to a time before you'd heard about the seduction community, before you'd heard about cold approaching, day game, night game, whatever, and you're walking down the street and you see a beautiful woman, you didn't suddenly feel anxiety. You may feel some other things like sadness or melancholy or desire or regret, you know, just thinking, oh, well, there's a gorgeous woman there and I guess I'm never going to meet her because how can you meet her? You couldn't just reach out and say hello to somebody, could you? No, of course, you couldn't do that. And therefore, the only possible way that you might meet a woman like that is if she comes into your social circle. If by some serendipitous fate, you somehow bump into each other. And that's what most men, before they've heard of seduction at all, are banking on. And they know that probably amazing women are not going to come into their lives just by chance. And so therefore, they accept that it's not possible. However, now, if you're watching this video, it means that you've probably watched some other videos and you're at least aware of the fact that some guys are going out there and doing this. Some guys are going out there and talking to girls. And maybe there's a part of you that wants to believe it's fake, which is where we see haters who are like, you're in fields of fake. Hi there, how are you going? As if I'm faking, you know, I put those women there and she looks nice as if I paid her to sit there and smile at me. You know, some guys say this kind of stuff on the comments. I think they do that because it's a way for them to protect their own ego and identity. If they can think, oh, that's not actually possible, that couldn't possibly happen, then they don't have to face it. But for most of the guys who are watching this, they at least accept that, yeah, someone's doing that. And so as you start to build this idea that, okay, I want to do this. I want to meet women that don't just come into my social circle. I want to have options. That's when you start walking down the street, you see the girl and then you're like, holy shit, I've got that approach anxiety, which is just kind of the second stage defense. The first stage defense is denial. Not possible, can't be done. The second stage is, okay, I accept that it may be, it's possible for some guys, but I'm blocked because I have approach anxiety, therefore it can't be done. So we've talked now about, this is a concept. Firstly, you're looking at it as, you know, possibly its origins are biological or sociological or whatever we perceive it to be, how it started. And my answer to that, my solution to that is, doesn't matter. Like, it doesn't matter why you have these feelings because we can try and chart them, we can try and research them, but it doesn't really affect us either way. Then we can start to look at what is it, what is it that you're actually afraid of? You're not afraid of being rejected by a tribe and having your genes deleted. What you're actually afraid of is having a woman see you, look at you, assess you, judge you and decide that you're not good enough. And that's based on, mainly on inexperience because when you go and do this enough, you see that women don't really judge you. They make judgments about the initial interaction. They make a judgment about this moment in time. She doesn't know you before this moment in time. She doesn't know your life's history. She doesn't know what kind of man you are overall. She just knows that for whatever reason right now, she doesn't want to continue this. Very often that's her stuff. She's busy. She's got a boyfriend. She's scared of strangers. That's the main one. Women are scared of strangers. That's the main reason."}
