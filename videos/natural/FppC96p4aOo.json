And then repeats that cycle three to six times until he gets someone pregnant or they just kind of muscle him into putting a ring on it. That is the story of how your mummy and daddy met. Inactive. Okay, so Vasily says, can you please elaborate on not jumping from long-term relationship to long-term relationship? So what you're talking about is like what I would say is a bad, bad idea, which is to go from long-term relationship, you break up and then it's like the next girl that you sleep with or the next girl that would get in a relationship with you more or less, you get in another long-term relationship, which is actually the main strategy of most men. It's inactive single, maybe gets lucky here and there, maybe not, and then the first-ish girl that's like he's not vomiting when he's in bed with her, that would get in a relationship with him, he does that, right? And then it lasts, it's one to three years, not being cynical, just saying, they break up and the man goes back into total scarcity, inactive single. Inactive single means I'm single and I don't have anything going on except swiping and hoping and maybe, you know, maybe I get laid here and there accidentally or drunkenly or something. And then repeats that cycle three to six times until he gets someone pregnant or they just kind of muscle him into putting a ring on it. That is the story of how your mummy and daddy met. That is the story of humanity, basically. Of course, throughout most of history, you didn't do it six times, you did it once and often you were allocated by the village elders. But since you had choice, that's kind of how things work. Do I need to spell out the problems with that model? I think they're pretty self-evident. Like, there is no chance that the next girl that you slept with is the next one in your life that you should spend three to five years with, I would think, statistically. So, the ideal, and okay, take it or leave it, it's just my, it's a model that I've developed or put down on paper, put down on rant, is to be never inactive single unless you choose to be, which is chosen celibacy for some period of time because you need to get women out of your head. Like, I just had two weeks of chosen celibacy, two weeks, two weeks no sex, and I haven't even had sex yet because my girl last night couldn't, just couldn't, just couldn't, and tonight I will. In fact, as soon as this lecture is over, I will. But that was 15 days, and I chose that, and it was good for me. So that's fine. You can choose periods of get the fuck away from women, but you never want to be inactive single, which is in cell, basically, right? Involuntary celibate. Of course, no one wants to be that. So, you want to be active single, which is hopefully what you guys are all moving into, which is learning to cold approach and date and having girls on the go. That may mean, you know, that may mean lots of periods of aloneness in the early stages or at any time you go back into active single. Like, I've worked out all sorts of buffers against that, so I really never experienced that, but I did experience it multiple times when I was a good pickup artist. It was just like, okay, I'm out, and I don't have any girls, and okay, nothing's sticking these three weeks or four weeks or whatever, and it's, and I'm almost, and then dropped it, and, well, okay, well, this is part of the game, and you have to accept that there's going to be loneliness and frustration along that way. And then, you move into dating multiple girls. Now, whether that's like explicitly multiple relationships, where I've had the talk and instituted some kind of ongoing relationship that is unfenced or involves you being with multiple women, ethically, let's say, and honestly, let's hope, because the alternative is just lying to lots of girls, and that, I've done that too, and that causes a huge mess and turns you into a bit of a cunt, to be honest, so I don't want to do that ever again. Yeah, it's that from then, from a dating pool, if and when I want to, and one girl stands out, and it's like, yes, I'm drawn to her, and I don't, I'd rather be with her than the other girls that I have in my life, the other options in my life, and then I choose to go into a relationship where it's monogamous for some period of time, one, three years, or forever, maybe. Then, cool, all right. Then, if and when it ends, which of course it will, probably, most likely, then, what do you want to do? Okay, you might have a period of mourning and, all right, get the fuck away from women, but for men, that's a dangerous thing to do, because men are at their least attractive when they are heartbroken and just come out of a relationship, whereas a woman is, like, vulnerable, and, like, teary and wants to get revenge, right? So, she is highly valuable, and there's all, inevitably, there's been guys sniffing around, if she's cute, waiting for their chance. So, a girl breaks up, and she's attractive, she will, she can have dick within seconds, right? And probably pretty good dick, too, unfortunately. So, that doesn't, it's not a thing for women. In fact, it's better for guys, like, oh, she's on the rebound, excellent. Whereas for dudes, it's, the girls are not like, oh, he's a total mess and let himself go, and, like, he's lost his self-esteem, and he's heartbroken. That's not an attractive prospect. So, like, I've been heartbroken a number of times in my life. I've been decimated by it, and I will be again, no doubt, probably one more time. And so, when I got out of the cycle of inactive single monogamy, then, what was it I did? I got straight out there, and I'm like, I got to get sexed, soon. And I learned, don't try, I'm not trying to replace my girlfriend, or find a girl that's as hot, or I feel the same shit for, or anything like that. It's like, young, fun, dumb, let's find one. There you go. You can put that on my gravestone. No, don't do that. Get out there, and as my friend, Clary, would say, just rub one on you. Just doesn't really matter what, what it's like. Just rub one on you, and then the rest of them can smell it. And then, get out into the dating pool, and then continue, and then repeat that cycle forever. I don't know. That's, I don't have the end point, but that's the thing that I think works better. Make sense? Gentlemen, good day.
