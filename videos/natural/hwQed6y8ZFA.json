And women who are in their feminine essence, they do tend to test their man. Consistently, over and over, every day, it doesn't stop. Now, this can be triggering, this can be annoying, this can bring you to a point where you're like, fuck this, I wanna be alone. Now, if you watch this video, I assume you are a man on his path who wants to grow, who wants to be stronger, and who wants to develop his masculinity. So it will be very important for you to understand this topic. This topic will come up over and over again for the rest of your life in every relationship you're gonna have with a woman. So listen up, we're gonna cover a lot. So I met this girl a couple of years ago, actually, and she was not a normal girl at all. She was a star, she was the one everybody wants. So I kept in touch with her, I was friendly with her. I tried to hook up with her, I failed many times. But over time, as I grew as a man, and my network grew, and we met each other over and over, we ended hooking up finally, it was beautiful, and we actually ended up in a relationship. So I was super happy at first, I brought her on the tour, you know, on the coaching tour, we lived together. But then something changed, or let's say I learned more about her. The more she was with me, the more she started nagging me, testing me. Sometimes even being aggressive with her voice towards me. It really got to me, I was like, fuck, why is she like that? And sometimes I felt insecure, I felt like, you know, she was like testing certain areas of my masculinity that made me feel weak, and almost made me feel like I don't deserve her. And it got me into a lot of thinking and reflecting, and ultimately made me much stronger, and made me have a really good relationship. But this is the topic I wanna talk about today. It's about women who are gonna test your boundaries, who are gonna test your triggers over and over again. A feminine woman tends to test her man. This is a thing that she won't just stop at a certain point, it keeps going over and over. And if you're the kind of man, and I assume you are because you're watching this video, who wants a feminine partner, because you are a strong masculine man, and you're on a path of developing your masculinity, then pay close attention to this video, I'm gonna go really deep into how to handle women, and how to set boundaries, and much more. So sit back and pay attention. Part one, why she's doing it. So let's discover first why she would even do such a thing. Why does a woman always test her man? Why is she constantly nagging? Why is she never stopping? First of all, we have to take on the mindset that that's a good thing. It is a good thing that she's testing you. It in a way means she respects you as a man, and didn't decide yet to leave you anyway. She has to do it, it's literally her job. Women are the sexual gatekeepers, and we get the same stuff doing day game approach, right? Talking to a girl on the street. Other pickup artists call this a shit test, right? She's like shit testing you. I don't like this expression to be honest. I see it more as a test to see if I'm honest, if I really wanna talk to her, if I'm bullshitting her, if I'm really strong in my intention, or if I'm just running a routine, I'm talking to 20 girls a day because some coach told me to, or if I'm really into her, if I mean it. She needs to do that early on, because she's the gatekeeper. She needs to know, is she making the right choice in talking to me, in going on a date with me, in having sex with me, right? So she needs to do that early on. And then the same theme continues in the relationship. Is she wasting her time with me? Can I handle her? And is she right in still having sex with me, getting attached to me, being my partner, being seen with me? So if you see it like that, it is almost her job to test me in that sense. That's the only way she can really do that. So I want you to take on the mindset that a woman testing you, no matter if it's early or late in a relationship, is a good thing, and it's your job to learn how to deal with it. I wanna read you a section from David Data's book, all time classic, must read if you are a man on your path, The Way of the Superior Man. So David Data is writing, your woman knows your weaknesses better than anybody. She knows where you will falter and give up. She knows the degree of mediocrity you will settle for. And she knows your true capacity as a full man, a man of free consciousness and love. Her gift, if she's a good woman, is to test you with her darkest moods over and over and over until your consciousness is unbothered by feminine challenge and you're able to pervade her with your love, just as you are here to pervade the world. In response to your fearless consciousness, she will drench your world in love and light. And furthermore, he's saying, the most loving woman are the woman who will test you the most. She wants you to be your fullest, most magnificent self. She won't settle for anything less. She knows it is true of you. She knows in your deepest heart, you are free. You are Shiva. Anything less than that will torment. And as you know, she's quite good at it. Powerful words, huh? I recommend you read this book. It's a must read. Now, is every test she throws at you totally reasonable and to test you and to build a stronger connection with you? No, some girls are just crazy. Sometimes she's just a crazy bitch, but let's talk about that later. Part two, understanding your own triggers. So it's your duty as a man to most and foremost, understand your own psychology, understand your traumas, your triggers, your fears, the things that are inside you that make you overreact, that make you have reactions that might be unreasonable. And your woman will find that, as David Data says, pretty quickly anyway, and she's really good at testing you. So you might as well get a headstart. Next time you get triggered, observe yourself, become more aware, slow down, and think why are you triggered? What triggered you exactly? Is it something in your past? Is it reminding you of someone who was unfair to you in the past? And what is it in your past that made you overreact like that now? So I'm gonna be vulnerable here and share a personal story out of my life that relates to this. Quick reminder that I'm giving away my social media seduction secrets for free. I have a guide that explains exactly how I attract and go on dates with the hottest girls through the power of my archetype online, through the power of my social media. It's three parts, it's for free. Click below to get it now. The year was 2021 and me and this girl, we had a bit of a discussion before, a bit of an argument, but I decided to be the bigger man and to look over it, to ignore it. So we went to a concert and it was beautiful. We listened to the music, we were in Spain, it was great. We got drunk before and after the concert. Then we got high and, you know, I've had amazing chemistry with these girls. It was this amazing evening that just went better and better and it became really erotic and naughty. And we then obviously started having sex, first really soft, being high, sensual. And then basically to release the argument before it got really rough and I fucked her really, really hard and she loved it. And it was probably at that point, yeah, it was the longest, hardest sex we ever had in our relationship. So I was super happy, you know, all the tension was released. We were together again, everything is perfect. And the next day I kind of, I guess I wanted to feel good about myself, right? Every guy wants to feel good about themselves here and there and we wanna get feedback. The classic one is that guys ask, you know, how was I? Which women obviously don't like hearing really because what are they supposed to say? So I thought I'm smarter and I phrased it differently and I started a whole conversation about a different thing and then kind of led into it and asked at some point, oh, how was yesterday for you? How was your experience? Or something like that. And she reacted in a way, I don't remember exactly what she said, but basically like, ah, it wasn't special for me. It wasn't my first time, something like this. Or she asked me like, oh, you think it was special for me? So in a teasing way. And I instantly reacted like so bad. I was like angry inside, disappointed, sad, vulnerable, because, you know, I was like, fuck, what's this great night? And she treats it like it was nothing and how dare she? And I spent all this money on this concert tickets and I waste all my time with her and I fuck her really hard and what do I get out of it, you know? So I obviously got super triggered. And I later realized like, if I'm such a strong man, why do I even need her compliment? Why do I need to fish for compliments? Why do I need double and triple and quadruple confirmation that this was good? The fact that she was there, that she spent a whole evening with me, that she didn't look at her phone a single time, that she, you know, tried out new things in bed that evening, that she followed my lead from start to finish, that she didn't complain a single time, that is her being there with me. That is her feminine essence. That is her saying, this is good. So me triple asking about it later just shows that I'm still, you know, that I'm insecure, which is not a bad thing, but it's then her job to call that out instantly to make me aware and stronger and be the man that she needs in her life. So the principle here is that women are repulsed if they are the source of your approval, when you depend on them approving you. You know, they're not your mom. Your mom can tell you, you know, well done, I'm proud of you but if you give your girlfriend that job, she will resent you. Now, of course, it's a bit of a paradox because we're human, we wanna hear good things about each other, right? We wanna check in how we're doing with other people, but if you give your girlfriend the entirety of that job, you will have a problem in your relationship. So here's a quick list of common male triggers. You know, maybe some of you fit for you, some are not, but this is things that could usually trigger you. Comments about your masculinity, you not being good and bad, small dick, skinny, no muscles, you don't stand up to your boss or your colleagues, you're too girly, you're too weak, also too weak in the gym, you couldn't lift her up, or she's calling you fat, she's calling you lazy, you're distant, you're not emotional enough, you're too closed off or you're too emotional, you're weepy, you're a wiener, you're too weak, you don't give her enough attention, you never text back, you spend too much time with the boys, your vulnerability is not valid because you should be a man, man up, don't be a boy, you're not tough enough physically, you don't make enough money, you're too poor, you don't give me enough, you don't give me enough gifts and then often that starts comparing, oh, Kevin gave his girlfriend the newest iPhone and he even added AirPods and you only gave me this, comparing you to her ex, to friends, to people on TV even or on fucking Instagram, she might flirt with other guys in front of you, doing stuff like that, in general complaining about your hobbies, about how you spend time, how you spend money, criticizing your decisions in that way, you don't spend enough time with her friends, you don't care enough about her, you don't care about her mom, you don't care how she's doing, you didn't ask her, she told you about this thing and then you didn't make sure if she's 100% totally fine and so on, so obviously the list is endless, there's a lot of things people can complain about and that you might get triggered off or that she might test, now obviously if she's a girl who's giving you a list like that every day, yes, it's fucking annoying and you should probably get rid of her but it is your job to start making your own list, make your personal list and figure out what is actually really trigger you and why, so take your note taking tool of choice and you can stop this video now and maybe write down five, six things that usually trigger you, that triggered you in the past or you maybe have a memory of the relationship you're already in right now, you've been in and just start writing down the trigger that happened and then maybe next to it, you can write down a reason why it happened, something that happened in the past for you that makes it so annoying and triggering for you. Now childhood trauma is obviously a very deep topic, it goes beyond the scope of this video and there's a lot to be explored there, if you have specific questions and you are open, you can obviously ask in the comments and if you wanna go really deep and you wanna work with one of us, feel free to book a call with either me or Shay who is an expert and in a game at The Natural Lifestyles, you find all the links below and you find online coaching packages on our website. So writing that list will give you clarity on what's triggering you in the past and hopefully in the future and most and foremost, it will make you start taking responsibility, it will stop you from constantly blaming other people, that's a very common thing with everyone, it's very easy to blame other people, it's very difficult to blame yourself. So if every time you get triggered, it's somebody else's fault but not yours, there's something wrong, there's something you're not doing right, you have to take responsibility for your own emotions, for your own reactions. So being aware, being conscious and start exploring that is the first step to doing that. Part three, different ways she might trigger you. Now not every test a woman gives you might be to strengthen the relationship and to see if you're the man and if you're worthy of her time. Sometimes she's just being crazy. She's a human too, with her own traumas, with her own triggers, with her own patterns that she repeated over and over time, with her own past relationship, with her own fucked up parents and experiences and culture. and background, or she might even have mental illness, you know, which can be totally not her fault. Maybe there's just something in her brain that makes her totally unbearable, and maybe you've overlooked it because you were in love and you loved the look of her, and the sex was amazing, and she's the source of your intimacy for a long time, or the only source of intimacy, and losing her would mean you don't have sex, and you go back to being single, and it's hard, so it's okay, and sometimes she's a bit crazy, but, you know, she's a really nice person. Very easy to fall into those patterns as well, so I very clearly wanna make the distinction of, yes, feminine women will test you, and that's a good thing, but if it's a consistent pattern, and it ruins your life, and it gets aggressive, you know, maybe she's like literally threatening your health, then that's obviously not a good thing. You know, unhealthy ways of her pushing you can be revenge, or holding a crazy grudge against you, sadistic tendencies, psychopathic tendencies, she might be a total control freak, or she might destroy things, or she doesn't, you know, accept your authority at all, never, ever, borderline personality, and sociopathic tendencies, and, of course, a combination of very deep childhood traumas of herself. Now, how to know if she, you know, is a person like that? Again, I'm not an expert on that, and I don't wanna, you know, make any clinical statements here, but if you have an assumption, you know, it's just been not good for a long time, and nothing you can really do or say fixes it, talk to a psychologist, describe the situation to him, and he might be able to, you know, take a step back, and see the whole picture, and hopefully, if he's a good psychologist, also call you out on your bullshit. Part four, how to react when she triggers you. Now, after a fight, or an argument, or a comment by her that triggered you, it's very easy to overreact and make rash decisions. So the first kind of lesson is don't do that. Don't make decisions in an elevated mood when you're triggered, when you're aggressive. You know, it's very easy to say, okay, fine, I'll leave, blah, blah, blah, cool down. Now, after a fight, an argument, a discussion, or simply some comment that triggered you, it's very tempting to react, and you're probably very eager to make a decision, or to create some consequences for what you did. Now, when making a choice or a decision, it's very important, again, to be very aware of your own triggers. Very often, also in my experience, I thought I'm 100% right, she fucked up, she overstepped, you know, she was outside of her boundaries, it's not just feminine essence anymore, she's just a crazy bitch. And then I cooled down, I reflected, I took a walk, I maybe talked to a friend who has more relationship experience than I do. I talked to my mentors, my relationship mentors, my fellow coaches, and I realized, ah, damn, she actually acted pretty reasonably. And surprise, surprise, again, it was my triggers, my traumas that made me react that way. So the first lesson is if you're in an elevated state, if you feel aggressive, if you wanna pay back and, you know, make her feel bad because you feel bad, or anything like that, cool down. Go out of the house, go out of the apartment, take a walk, listen to some music, call someone you like, and often that can help prevent something irrational or crazy to happen. Now, after that, if you still feel something, which you probably will, you kind of have three choices where to go from then. And it depends how important is she to you, how important is your time to you. Do you even wanna be in a relationship right now? Is she the one, right? Obviously, there's many other factors. Do you have children together? Did you buy a house together, and so on? You basically have three choices. Either you leave her, you break up with her, or you fix her, fix the relationship, fix all that, or you ignore her, you ignore her and her moods. Now, if you decide to leave her, obviously, as I said, do that after you calm down, and you can have a discussion with her on eye level and explain her, hey, babe, you know, I've thought about this long and hard, and I think whatever this is, and dah, dah, dah, it's not gonna work because of this reason, or we're just not matching in this, and I would rather not waste your time. You can even explain it in that sense. You know, you can say, hey, I know I'm not the right one for you, so therefore I don't wanna waste your time. Now, this can be tricky. And the one option is she overstepped. She played outside the rules. She really hurt you. She was acting irrational, even over the sense of her being feminine and testing you, and you're basically not dealing with her bullshit. You're calling her out on her bullshit, and you're just not dealing with it. This might lead to her opening up to you. This might lead to actually a good resolution because it will probably lead to her respecting you more, if, it might, if she's self-conscious, if she's self-aware, if she, you know, is able to reflect and see her own faults and is not delusionally confident. She might also be not and just, you know, make a big deal out of it and just say goodbye to you. But it can be a way to getting to know each other better because clearly she saw a boundary, and it can be a lesson for her. Now, don't use it as a tactic. You know, don't say, oh, I'm gonna break up with you in the hopes that she will open up to you and, you know, apologize to you and you feel like the bigger man because there's the flip side of that. Maybe she was rational, like I said before. Often I thought I'm right, and I wasn't. So if you are, after every little conflict, threatening with breakup and hoping that we'll fix it and hoping she will, you know, open up to you that way or apologize or break out in tears and tell you how amazing you are, this is not a tactic that will work very long. And you're basically proving to her her own point, which is you can't handle her, you know? She tested you, she triggered you a bit, and you broke. You wanna break up, you can't handle it. So she's right, you can't. She's wasting her time with you. You should break up with her and she should break up with you. So you breaking up with her is actually doing her a favor. So don't be surprised if she's like, okay, you know, you're right, we should leave it. And then suddenly you're like, oh, but I mean, I just wanted to like talk it out, you know? So be very careful, again, to make rash decisions and really think it through and take your time. So again, how do you know if she's reasonable or not? We covered that a little bit before that she might have, you know, crazy psychopathic tendencies. Again, tricky topic, hard to say, a million factors, every relationship is different. But in general, respect yourself, don't be a pushover, but also be very aware of your own triggers and be reflective, be conscious, calm down, practice meditation, and you have to kind of figure it out for yourself. Or as I said, book a call with one of us or ask a psychologist. Now, next one, fix her. If for whatever reason, breaking up is not an option, you can try to fix her. The secret about fixing your woman or your friend or your parents or anyone is you can't, especially if they don't ask for it. Obviously, there's people, they are realizing they have a problem or they wanna improve themselves or they wanna improve their communication skills, right? Those are the kind of guys who come on our workshops, which I have massive respect for every time. But in general, you trying to fix somebody uninvited just won't work and will not be well received. And who are you anyway trying to fix someone and thinking that you can? Start with yourself, fix yourself first. Again, a passage from our homeboy, David Dator on this. The feminine always seems chaotic and complicated from the perspective of the masculine. The next time you notice yourself trying to fix your woman so that she will no longer fill in the blank, relax and give her love by touching her and telling her that you love her when she is the way, whatever you filled in a blank with. Embrace her or wrestle with her or scream and yell for the heck of it, but make no effort to bring an end to that which pisses you off. Practice love instead of trying to bring an end to the quality that bothers you. You can't escape the tussle with the feminine. Learn to find humor in the unending emotional drama the feminine seems to enjoy so much. The love that you magnify may realign her behavior, but your effort to fix her and your frustration never will. The world and your woman will always present you with unforeseen challenges. You are either living fully, giving her your gift in the midst of those challenges, even today, or you're waiting for an imaginary future, which will never come. Which brings me into the third option on how to react, ignoring her moods slash dealing with it. Now dealing with it is most of the time the best option, but obviously also kind of the most difficult one because you have to be relaxed and just let it go. Because don't forget, often, as David Data said, and I repeat it, and in my personal experience, she hasn't been toxic toxic, she has just been crazy. She's just been feminine, she's been testing you. She's been in her crazy storm and she sees are you the rock in the middle of the ocean who can just be there for her, even if she's not totally reasonable. She needs to be able to trust you in that. Therefore, she wants you to just deal with it. She wants you to ignore it. That girl I told you about before, she would often say really rude things when she's angry. And I was like, what the fuck, you're saying those things. And she's like, I better said it when I'm angry, I didn't mean it. Yeah, that just made no sense for me at the beginning. It makes much more sense now. Does it make 100% sense for me yet? No, to be honest, and I'm still learning all that. But there's definitely truth in those words. Because don't forget, you might still, in your overreacting triggered mood, think that you overstepped and that's enough, and she's a crazy person and she's toxic, when really, again, she's just pushing those little buttons to see, can he handle me? Is he a man I can trust? Is he a man that even if I'm not at my best, he can just be stable, focus on his work, focus on his higher mission and just accept that I'm not always Mrs. Nice girl and pretty and everything is always perfect and there's rainbows. My girl actually said that. You think always rainbows flying out of my ass? So that's what she means by that. And I made that experience again myself with different women who were like, the harder they are and the more desired and the more feminine and the better the sex is, it comes with this testing. They might say things, when they're angry, they might say things they don't even mean and they even say that the next day. I'm like, you said a horrible thing, that was very, that hurt me, that triggered me. And they're like, yeah, but I said it when I was angry, I didn't mean it, I'm sorry if it hurt you, but it wasn't really me. Another way to put it, which is, I wrote it down here, is how Amy Winehouse put it in her song, Stronger, which I really like and you should listen to the whole song. She's saying, she's singing, but I'm gonna read it. You should be stronger than me. You've been here seven years longer than me. Don't you know you're supposed to be the man, not pale in comparison to who you think I am. You always wanna talk it through, I don't care. I always have to comfort you when I'm there, but that's what I need you to do, stroke my hair. So she's saying, basically, just ignore what I said, just stroke my hair, let's just fuck, you know, let's just leave it be, this is the past, now is now. Furthermore, she sings, why do you always put me in control? All I need is for my man to live up to his role. Always wanna talk it through, I'm okay. Always have to comfort you every day, but that's what I need you to do. Are you gay? It's pretty harsh words and if you listen to the whole song, it can hurt a little bit. For sure hurt me when I first really listened to that song and I was like, damn, she's right. You know, I've definitely been gay in that sense, no homophobo, you know what I mean. That song might teach you more about women than one or the other whole Red Pill dating coach channel from a guy reporting from his bedroom. So what does Amy want? What is Amy communicating in that song? She wants you to not make a big deal out of it. You know, she says, you've been here seven years longer than me, which basically means she's seven years younger. You're the man, be the man, brush it off. Why are you making such a big deal out of something some stupid girl says, you know. Do you respect yourself even, you know, why do you suddenly respect my words? Talking for her now. Then you, you're a strong man, brush it off. Just hug me, just stroke my hair. Just fuck me, fuck the shit out of me and let's fucking eat popcorn and watch a movie. Which brings me to part five, how to deal with it. Now, assuming she is not a crazy, toxic, you know, unhealthy girlfriend slash wife, what are the different options to deal with her moods? Now, ignoring it and just going back to work, you know, going back, working on your mission is often the best solution. Women, we repeated that over and over in this video, they say sometimes crazy things. Their, you know, their moods are up and down. They're in their feminine essence. And don't forget at the beginning of the video, they have to do that and it is feminine and strong men want feminine women. If you want total equalness all the time, you will have a problem. You know, the fact that there is polarity between men and women, leads to all the beautiful things as well. It's like the yin, the yang. It's the masculine, the feminine. It's what makes sex good. So accept that, let things go, ignore it, get back to work. She should not be your number one focus anyway. You know, your number one thing as a man should be your mission. That's what she's also testing in a sense as well. Can I throw him off his course with one little comment? Also, man used to hold a grudge way longer than women. You know, they're trying to have revenge and I'm like, you know, I'm gonna ruin his future and dah, dah, dah, and he will pay back and stuff like that."}
