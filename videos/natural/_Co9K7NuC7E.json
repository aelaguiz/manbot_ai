Hello. How are you? Good. I quit smoking three days ago using hypnosis. I thought I'd just test myself by hanging out with you, see if it's like triggering anything. So far so good. Sorry? No, no, I don't want one. Because I quit three days ago. I got hypnotized. No, I don't want your cigarette. I was just like seeing if I could stand near you and it doesn't bother me. You know, like a little test. And also you're cute. So together it was like two things that were useful. Well, unfortunately, my cigarettes... So I didn't get to be tested, did I? Didn't get to be tested. No. Do you feel like smoking another one? I think I'll do that. Now I'm encouraging. On my way to the gym. Oh, the hypocrisy. A few feet away. Yeah. And you catch me. I remember those. I was like that as well. Yeah. It's silly, isn't it? Yeah. I know, it's an insidious little fucker, so it is what it is. Yeah. What's your name? Emily. Emily. How do you do? I'm James. James? Yeah. Nice to meet you. Yeah. I'm sorry that I'm driving more cigarettes than you. It's all right. Well, it's better that I get to meet you anyway. Yeah. Oh, yeah. What's your thing? What? Yeah, what's your thing? Who are you? What's my thing? Yeah, like your thing that you love or that you do or that you are. I don't know. I'm sorry. What's your thing? Travel and music. Playing music and traveling. Travel. Those are both pretty good things to say. Those are things I do and I like to do. Yeah. I work a lot. Probably too much. Yeah, probably too much. I go to the gym a lot. How do you talk? I smoke cigarettes. And you what? I smoke cigarettes. In between. Yeah. Right. Yeah. I live around the corner. Which corner? Are you a New Yorkian or are you an import? I'm from Connecticut. So, not that far. What about you? I'm from Australia, so I'm quite a far away. I'm really bad at identifying accents. You couldn't tell? No. I had an accent? No, I couldn't tell you an accent. But I mean as far as like... Where I was from. Yeah. I know people are like... Yeah. It's not that strong because I've been away from home a long time. Yeah. And I try to speak clearly so Americans and Europeans can understand me. Oh, I think it's slight. Slight? Subtle, yeah. So, it's Australian light? Yeah, quite Australian. Is it sexy? Yeah. A little bit sexy? Yeah. It's quite light. Got me away from my cigarette and moved to the gym, so it's nice. Well, that's working then. Yeah. Yeah, if I can draw a smoker away from smoking. Yeah, that's awesome. And a gym junkie away from gymming. Yeah. Well, um... Yeah. So, what is it and what kind of gymming? Because you're quite slim. Just run. Just run? Yeah. What do you think about when you run? A lot of things. I actually feel like that's the best time to think because nobody bothers you and you don't have something. It's not like someone's trying to do something right now. Probably the gym. Yeah. Sorry. And it's repetitious if you're in a trance. Yeah, you don't have to think about it. Yeah. Yeah. So, that's where you ponder the meaning of life and think about sex and the future and death. Things I think about. Those are the four things? Yeah. Altogether? Sex, future of life. Yes. Good. Good. That's not a bad choice. Yeah. Hang on. Did we exchange names? Names? Yes. Yes. I forgot your name. Well... That's terrible. That's terrible. Isn't that terrible? That is terrible. It's because I was swept up in the moment. I don't know what I would say now. Forget my name. Well, there's two things you can say. You can say, Listen, buddy. You had your chance. Or you can tell me your name again. Do you remember mine? James. Oh. Well, that's no good, is it? I guess I owe you a drink. I guess. And then maybe you can find out my name. Mm-hmm. All right. So, I'll save your number as... Girl on the Smoker. Next time, listen more clearly. Yeah. Yeah? All right. I'm going to do that. I think, uh... Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Let's see. I think basically... Where are you en route to now? I don't know. I was just wandering around. Because it was... I felt like it. And next thing you know, I'll probably keep doing that. Yeah. I'm meeting some friends later, so I was just going for a wander. Because this city keeps interesting me. Yeah. All right. So, you actually did... Yeah. Write that? Mm-hmm. You know what? You forgot my name, and I can still tell you this is the first time I've ever given my number to someone on the street. Really? Yeah. How do you feel about it? I don't know. You're not sure yet? No, I don't. I don't know how to feel about that. Well, you can post this while you're running. Yeah, I will. I'll mail it over. So, next time, when you're thinking more clearly, I can discuss it. Okay, good. I'll let you know. All right, you do that. Do people ask you for your number on the street? It's okay, Sulan. It's happened. It's happened. A handful of times. But it wasn't done very well, was it? No. Usually, it's more of a, like... Damn girl. Listening to my earphones. What do I usually say? No, I mean, like, someone approaches you, you just pretend to interfere. All right. I just surprised you. That was my trick. You didn't have a choice. Get away. I was on it. I pushed a cigarette. Yeah. All right, cool. Well, mystery lady. James. We'll see you soon. Nice to meet you. Bye-bye. Be sure, because I know tomorrow when you're feeling better, you'll go, hang on a minute. I was in a grumpy mood yesterday, but now I'm feeling better and I should have talked to that guy. I'll walk with you for two minutes. How about that? Woo! You're disgusting already. I'm disgusting already."}
