It is a lifetime skill that will mean you'll get extra bits of life. You'll be more effective if you're not dead. The key takeaway that I want you to take from this video is firstly it is not realistic that you will ever reach a point where you are chill all the time, where you are in relaxation and it's also not really realistic to think that you're going to reach a point of achievement in your life where you then just get to go and sit on the beach in Thailand. Like I mean you can like from a from a from a realistic perspective if you have some kind of business that makes X amount of money or you learn to live remotely you could go and live in Thailand now it's not that hard you just get a ticket to Thailand you just get a shack by the beach and stay there. I'm not saying you can't do that but I'm saying that will not be the answer to your happiness. I've tried that I've done I've gone and like done a month where I mean literally in Thailand I'm just like cool I'm just gonna do nothing and and just did that for a few days and then got bored and then was like well I want to do stuff with life and this is not what I this is it's not the like it's such a ubiquitous fantasy. Palm trees island sitting there with either your smoothie if you're the health guy or the cocaine infused Malibu rum coconut cocktail if you're the party guy but whatever it is it's just like the idea that the end point is slothful distraction or just just living in hedonistic kind of sensory experience in a place where nothing much happens and I don't know about you guys but for me I want to move move and I want to change and I want to grow and I want to build things in my life so that's not the answer. Nor is the answer being the the hundred percent not a second wasted optimizer guy right the guy who gets up at exactly the right time does it does all of the effective things in his life and doesn't waste a single second that I think there's very few people who can maintain that it or who can even get there at all and if you and if you set yourself up for that and you fail which I did when I tried to do it daily I failed every day at being perfectly optimized in every second I felt bad and then I created internal stress I created feelings of self-sabotage or self-loathing as I was like you you know you lazy motherfucker you didn't do this you got it you're wasting time in you like it was I was being a bad life coach to myself by negatively chastising myself for not being the perfect robotic human being so it's not either of those ends I think what it is is understanding that throughout any given day if you are somebody who's moving places and you're actually trying to get stuff done stresses will activate the environment or your internal thought processes or emotions will activate these things your body is going to fire off stress responses your emotions are going to get involved your thoughts are going to start moving faster and you need to have techniques and ways to check yourself not once not at the beginning of the day and at the end of the day not only when you go to the yoga class three times a week not only in that two-week holiday to Bali at the end of the year but moment by moment right so for me it's like probably I don't know if I spend it as half the time doing either but it's like I very commonly get in my head where I'm like oh shit I got all this stuff to do and I've got to do this thing and then as soon as soon as I notice that not not miss not always sometimes I stay there and stress about something for an hour let's let's stressfully move across this street I think I'm not all just coming through a couple of writers they all that that's all right I'm not I'm absolutely not perfect and there are and there are times when I just let it all fucking get too much and I and I have a whole afternoon of being a stressed out dude not enjoying being in my body but more often and then and then I check myself eventually right and at some point of the day I'm like right go and have a bath go and do some meditation have a bit of a stretch don't stop worrying about the things that are on the list because the list is never done close the list now now we read a book right active relaxation yeah or sometimes the distraction stuff if I need to just switch off which for me I about 30 minutes a day I think is okay to just be like yeah that's fine beer beers lovingly slothful useless piece of hedonistic shit for 30 minutes a day and and and write that into your life as like it's good for you congratulate congratulate yourself or you know sitting in a bath of hot milk eating a lamington but don't do that every day all day just take pieces of time to do that and then be effective but be just as effective as at being effective in the world at learning to actually actively relax yourself train yourself to chill it is a lifetime skill that will mean you'll get extra bits of life you'll be more effective if you're not dead that's that's true right the one of the best ways to optimize your life is to not be dead so if you can squeeze out another five six ten years of life because you didn't have a heart attack at 65 but you have one at 75 that's the one of the greatest life hacks that I can give you stay alive more time to get more shit done and during that time try to enjoy it more not just in the hedonistic I'm enjoying it by injecting cocaine into my eyeballs or wheels with the vibrating butt plug up my ass whilst I'm also you know put running electrical current through my dick like we all do every night but not just that kind of stuff but through the enjoyment of breath through the enjoyment of feeling good inside your body through the enjoyment of rather than having racing thoughts all the time having gentle thoughts moving through or maybe even occasionally none that's also nice as well all right the enjoyment of being present not in a just saying it in some hippie way well the power of now man yeah man it's not that it is literally my nose is cold right now yeah I can feel my feet right now I'm really aware of the fact that I'm a living breathing human being right now because this is the best that I can get out of this moment right now walking along this cobblestone street in the cold talking to you the best that I can get out of this is to be experiencing it"}
