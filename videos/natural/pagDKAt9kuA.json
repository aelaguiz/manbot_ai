This has been the benchmark, like the real tangible factor that has made all the difference. I didn't want to put all of my eggs in one basket and risk everything on one location, on one style of living, on one social circle. And I look back at my friends who did that. Okay, they lived their lives. We're all in our 40s now. So we've had enough time to look back and go, wow, half my life's gone. My youth, you know, my young man days are at least coming to an end if all of my holding onto them. I mean, I'm going gray. So obviously they're coming to an end. But you know, that part of life is passing. And now there's another part. And I look back on all the friends that stayed in the small town or the small city that I was from, got married early, had kids early, bought property in a market where, I don't know if you know the Australian market, look it up, like average house price in Sydney or Melbourne. It's over a million dollars. So it's like all those people, they made their commitment to that country, to that social scene, to the people around them, for better or worse. And as a result, okay, they live their lives. And now some of them have families and some of them are happy. And some of them are miserable because they married the wrong person, had kids too early and got divorced. And that destroyed their income for another 10 years. And they're only starting to get themselves back on their feet now. Whereas for myself and everyone else that I know, everyone that I'm close to, we are all nomadic entrepreneurs of one type or another. Whether we're the boss or whether we work for somebody else, whether we freelance, whether we found a way to move to a new country and plug into the resources there, or to get resources from other countries and plug them into a cheaper country. This has been the benchmark, like the real, tangible factor that has made all the difference. And that's the main point I want to make to you guys today, is that you can't fight the system on a global level, right? Okay, yes, there will be people who succeed in every scene. But the realities of the numbers are going to pull most people down to the average of what is going on around them. And those who want to become outliers may want to think about, well, and when I say outlier, I mean, you know, someone who's self-employed, someone who works under their own, more or less under their own conditions that they want, even if they're working for somebody else. Someone who is able to work on lifestyle leverage projects. And most guys that I work with want to have an unorthodox love life, right? So they want to date freely. They want to experiment with multiple relationships. And they also want to have other relationships, but only when they choose to step into them, into a monogamous relationship, for example. It is vitally important that you are realistic about your unrealistic goals. I've had unrealistic goals my entire life. You know, I wanted to study in Shaolin Temple. I wanted to go to the Amazon and learn from masters. I wanted to date the most beautifully amazing sirens of the East. You know, I wanted to be a famous funk musician. I wanted all sorts of outlandish, unrealistic things. And I achieved almost every single one of them by looking at that in a realistic way. Yeah, like when I wanted to be a musician, I lived in, I was born in Canberra, Australia, the most boring, sterile city in the Southern Hemisphere. It's a city which honors Australia's past and shapes its future. And I wanted to be a musician. And there was two venues in town and like one studio. There was no scene there. There was no industry for music. And I was, yeah, I was passionate about being a musician. And so were my friends. And we took it as far as we could go within that scene. And there is any life coach that I may have hired at that time that told me to hustle harder and believe in my dreams and have more passion or whatever would have been useless to me. The only life coach I would have needed at that time would have been the one that said, all right, dude, so time to get out of this shitty city as quick as possible, which is what I life coached myself to do and moved with nothing, literally just the network I had, which was my band, moved to another city where there was a music scene. And that meant that eventually we could become actual musicians, right? In the same way that if I did start this business in Australia, but because of the limited population size, the smaller economy and also some attitudes about Australians, that I don't know about taking advice from people, which is a bit of an Australian thing and a British thing. Americans like taking advice. Europeans are willing to as well. So these systemic issues meant that the business could only get to us a level where we were just living paycheck to paycheck or workshop to workshop. It would not have been sustainable in the long term. And if I'd stayed in Australia by now, I probably wouldn't be doing this. I would have to have moved to another city. I would have to be doing something else. It was the ballsy move to rip up myself and my collaborators and move them over to Eastern Europe, where originally in this city, I could live for half the price that I could live in Australia and I could get a better standard of living, right? So I could get a cooler apartment. I could eat out more. I could afford to take taxis all the time. All the sorts of things that as a basically broke or, you know, dude starting out in life back in Australia, I simply couldn't do. You know, we would have to think about how often do I buy a coffee or, you know, I eat out once a week or, you know, I'm always struggling to pay the rent and so on. Whereas over here, the standard of living rose massively and the costs dropped. At the same time, I found myself on a continent which was very easy to manoeuvre around because I had the mindset that it was easy to move around. I wasn't thinking I'm moving to Hungary. I was thinking I'm moving to the continent of Europe and I'm going to milk that for all it's worth. And so I did over the last 10 years, plus bounced around to dozens of different countries and milked the best of lifestyle, weather. Like until now, I haven't had a winter in 10 years, right? So it's like my lived experience during that time, it was not just that I was like, all right, I'm going to hustle for the next 10 years and then I'll be a millionaire and then I'll sit on the Versace boat or something. I don't know. Versace probably doesn't make boats, but you know what I mean. No, it was like all along the way, how can I increase the metrics of my lifestyle, success and pleasure and nourishment, right? So that meant being in this city meant that I got to hang out with and sleep with and date more beautiful, interesting women more easily than if I'd been back in Australia competing against all the Aussie chads, which is called a Bruce, I believe. You know, the networks and opportunities that I found happened years faster and in many situations would not have happened at all if I hadn't have upped sticks and moved to new locations."}
