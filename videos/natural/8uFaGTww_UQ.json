So what a great question, okay, so let's look at that and this is an intriguing one too because why would we not want to become attached to a girl that we're having repeated sex to? Well there could be a number of reasons for that, for example, maybe you want to be free and continue to express yourself as more of an adventurous, playful, romantic type of guy that is wanting to stay open to the marketplace. So becoming excessively attached or locked in with one girl is something that could be not in alignment with your values and that brings up a really big point which is essentially what it comes down to is two things, is what's valuable to you and where are you putting your focus? There are some secondary things that come after that but let's talk about those two points first of all. The first one is, what is valuable to you? So it's important that you get clear about what it is that you want generally in life and that is going to shape everything after that point. So for example, if you get clear on wanting to build your lifestyle, wanting to be a guy that is able to do cool stuff, whatever that is, travel the world, make money, hang out with cool people, if that's what's valuable to you. Or maybe you want to focus on building your career, maybe you want to focus on becoming somebody who's really fit and healthy or doing some kind of spiritual practice or whatever it is for you and that's important to get a lock onto that first because that gives you like an orientation of meaning and value and then that's something that you can put your relationships into. So you can start to have the slice of your life that is relationships, that is sex, that is intimacy with women as a subset of that larger value, that larger mission and purpose. Now that's really important because if you don't have that, which a lot of guys don't, then there can be a tendency to find yourself in this uncomfortable position where you're putting a woman first or a relationship first or even just comfort and convenience in the path of least resistance first and that can then have a big negative effect on your life over weeks, months and definitely over years. So one of the biggest dangers that we have in life as men is not being able to know what we really want and getting too comfortable and complacent in our lives. So that's the first thing is work out what's passionate for you, what's your real purpose, what do you really want to do, what drives you. Now why does that affect your ability to attach or not be attached to a woman? Because you know where you stand and you know what's important to you and you know what you serve on a higher level. And then when you're dating a girl, you can start to filter how much you really want to connect with her from that kind of place. So that's the first thing is understanding what is valuable to you and learning to set a kind of an awareness or a priority to the kinds of levels of value that you have. Alright so that was value but the next thing we're going to talk about after you understand your values and what's important to you is your focus, where are you putting your focus and how is that then contributing to and affecting your relationships. Because you have a choice at every particular moment in your life every day about what do you want to do with your time, where are you going to focus yourself, what are you going to put your attention onto, what are you going to give power to in terms of your emotions, your thoughts, your opportunities etc. When you're dating a girl or you're sleeping with a girl on a semi-regular basis or more then there can be a tendency to start to fall into the kind of romantic narrative, the fantasy of culture that is you know you sleep with somebody multiple times so then you should start to be with them more long term because that's the right thing to do or there's something that naturally evolves out of that. Now the interesting thing about this focus piece that I'm talking about is that it's very natural, pay attention here, it's very natural that when you sleep with somebody that you can become biologically attached. Now women have a tendency to do this a lot more than men generally but nonetheless men still get chemically bonded to a woman over time because they're sharing all these things, pheromones, experience, pleasure and that stuff becomes powerful, it's where we build relationships, it's where we build meaning and it's important to recognize that if you sleep with a girl you know a couple of times even then there can be a strong sense of connection with her. Now one of the ways you can make sure that you don't get too obsessed with one connection is you can see multiple women. Now that might sound a little bit harsh and some people might be against that but the idea is that once you open yourself at least to seeing other women, you don't even necessarily have to be sleeping with lots of other women but be open to talking to other women, be open to dating other women, be open to allowing your masculine energy, your masculine sexuality, your masculine expression to be shared with other women so that it doesn't get all put into one basket with one girl. And that can be difficult because sometimes girls, if you're sleeping with them on a regular basis and they're attached to you and they have an idea that they're going to turn you into a boyfriend, they might be very offended or hurt or upset or defensive about you sharing your energy with other women and rightly so in some sense because they're just trying to protect their investment, they're just trying to protect their emotions, they're just trying to protect their identity and what they believe is good for them. So it's important to acknowledge that and to understand that in them as well but also stay true to yourself because otherwise you're going to end up in this difficult position where you're trying not to piss her off by not being true to yourself and when you do that then you're going to come up against something very powerful which is called the law of lesser pisses. What's that mean? Well that means that if you're going to piss somebody off, it's better to piss somebody else off than piss yourself off because at the end of the day, you've got to live with yourself and if you're not taking care of yourself, if you're not clear on what's important to you, if you're not doing what really matters to you then especially over time, you're going to just grow in more and more resentment, unhappiness, frustration and basically feeling repressed because you're not able to express yourself effectively. Now a big part of being able to do that with people in the world is negotiation skills. It's about knowing what is important to you. So for example in my journey where I used to be a very monogamous kind of guy who was having typical long-term relationships and that was good for me at the time and maybe that will happen again at some point but in those times when I was having those kinds of experiences, I really wanted to have a deep and meaningful connection with one girl. Then after a time, I realized that I wanted to do different things so then I became much more open and flexible and able to go with the flow of this big ocean of adventures and experiences and now that means that I have a fairly fluid relationship cycle. So I might see a girl for weeks, months, maybe up to a year or so depending on what happened but I'm also open to other experiences and other relationships coming and going within that time and this is something that is always negotiated step by step. So obviously it's important for me to know who I am and what I want first. I need to say to myself, I want to be the kind of guy who's open and fluid, has a dynamic sex life, has multiple partners and is cool and honest and leaving women better than when I found them but at the same time being honest with myself about what's healthy for me. Now because I live a very dynamic lifestyle, it's more applicable for me to have this kind of relationship set up. So it's important for you guys out there if that's what you want to do to work out why is it important for you to set this up for yourself if that's what you really want and get clear on your own philosophy, get clear on your own model of reality, get clear on your own beliefs about that, practice communicating that because that's going to become something that becomes a part of your identity. It's going to become something that is effectively communicated especially when it comes to negotiating with the women that you're seeing, the women that you're sleeping with and they need to hear this too because you've got kind of a choice. You can either pretend that you're the good guy, you're the boyfriend type but actually be going out and doing other things like giving your attention to other women and sleeping with other women and having another thing which some would say, yeah, you could do that and get away with it for a little while and maybe that's easier because then at least you're not creating a drama because some girls can't handle it and obviously also guys do that on a regular basis because they just don't want to face the possibility that if they tell the truth to a woman that she might not like them, might not be interested or wants to get away from that kind of situation and once again rightly so. The interesting thing about that is that there is a grey zone, there's a very big grey zone inside female psychology that is to be negotiated and even though in terms of the mainstream there's often like only really black and whites like people that are in long term relationships and people that are basically single or dating, there is like I said a huge space in between and I mean James Marshall goes on about this stuff a lot in terms of like the dating cycle and which cycle that you're in and how this kind of all lines up and by all means check out some of the other videos that he's talked about that because he goes into a lot of really good detail about the psychology and the ideas behind that which I tend to agree with all of that stuff. Now the idea though is that you want to really get who you are, what you want and where you're at in your cycle and then being able to effectively communicate that and what that looks like in practical terms is you are much more honest and upfront with the women that you're sleeping with which then also prepares you and protects you to a degree from getting overly connected because if you are in a stage where you want to be free and you want to be fluid but at the same time you're allowing yourself to act like and become a kind of a boyfriend then it's incongruent. It's incongruent for her and it's incongruent for you and it ends up becoming this kind of messy situation. So this is where the second piece of managing your focus is really important. So for example you've got an opportunity to go and spend time with a girl. Let's back up a little bit. Maybe for example you sleep with a girl. Okay it's cool. It's casual. It's normal. Then you sleep with her again. It gets a little bit more serious and then a little bit more. It gets a little bit more serious and before you know it you're hanging out a lot. You're going on dates. You're spending time together and if that's really what you want to do and you want to have that kind of more intimate relationship that's more of a boyfriend girlfriend kind of thing then cool. And honestly if you're moving into that kind of space then maybe you either need to look at negotiating if you actually want to be monogamous with her or if you want to negotiate some kind of polyamorous arrangement that's going to be good for both of you guys. But if she's the kind of girl that you're just happy to have basically in your rotation. She's there. She's somebody that you have nice times with you share pleasure with but she's not relationship material. She's not girlfriend material. She's not somebody that you want to have as an intense you know connection all the time. Then make sure you're not giving her that kind of attention and focus. Make sure that you're not leading her into an experience and an expectation or leading yourself into the experience and expectation of being there all the time. So what does that mean? It means don't get caught up in lots of emotional text messaging. It means don't be showing her a lot of boyfriend kind of traits like buying her chocolate or flowers or taking her out to dinner or holding her hand or showing her lots of public affection. Don't introduce her to your social circle and make her a part of your regular life and then make it a thing where it's almost like that's who she is. She's part of your life. You're framing her as a partner. Don't put photos of you and her up on social media that are kind of projecting this image that you're with her when you're actually not really wanting to be with her. And the interesting thing that I also said before which is a very important part of this is keep your focus open and available to meeting and connecting with other women along the way so that you can detach some of that energy. And this can be quite a bizarre experience if you're not used to it because what I've experienced anyway is that if I'm with a girl for a period of time, I become bonded. I become chemically attached. I become emotionally attached. I become mentally attached to her. And it's almost like we could say that's the process of falling in love. That's the process of having an infatuation, having a connection. As I also started to keep myself open to creating connections with other women and I would spend time with them and have the same kind of thing happening, what would happen is that my biological attachment and the mental focus and the emotional meaning would move from one girl to another. So whoever I was spending the most time with and whoever was the girl who was taking the most of my attention was the one that tended to become the target of my biology, the target of my chemical addiction. And it can be quite weird when I'm jumping between one and the other in days or I might spend some time one week with one girl and some time next week with another girl or I'm moving countries and I'm with different girls. So that can be a bizarre experience. But what I learn over time is that there is a higher level of awareness that happens out of that. There's a secondary part of me that starts to learn, oh, this is normal. This is how my biology works. This is how I create connections. And it's a dual-edged sword, this thing. It's a two-edged thing. Because in some ways, it makes me really appreciate connections with women when I have those connections more, yet at the same time it also makes me able to see those connections as biological and more or less a reflection of the investment and the time and the energy that I've been giving that particular girl. Now, I'm going to go into more detail about this on another video talking about how do you know when a girl is the one or a good one to really stick with or build a relationship with. But ultimately, different people will have different energies. Different people have different alchemies. Different people have different resonance with you. So it's almost like when two people come together, there's like two entire universes of being, like experience, beliefs. you know backgrounds, culture, everything coming together to create a unique synergy, a unique relationship uh... and that's something to really focus on too and appreciate that and enjoy that and make that part of your understanding, part of your philosophy, part of what it is to be a romantic adventurer is to enjoy and to uh... appreciate and to you know make the most out of those connections while you've got them but simultaneously recognize that you know there's there's a time and a place for different kinds of connections at different times. You might be with a girl who's really sweet in some ways and you can have a great intellectual connection with her but you feel like she's not emotionally very good for you or you might find a girl who's really emotionally good for you but you can't have any real interesting conversation because maybe you speak different languages or she's not interested in the same stuff you're into or she's much younger or she's much more uh... you know she's she's in a different place in her philosophy and where she's at in her life you might have a girl you're very sexually connected to and it feels amazing you have this uh... this strong desire to be animals and you know to to to share uh... sex together but at the same time there's no emotions or there's emotions but there's no intellect so these things can all match at different levels depending on where you're at at the time and where she's at at the time with different partners uh... and the interesting thing is to be aware of that as part of your frame as well what is the match of the different levels within you that is then aligning to create the kinds of relationship you are having in that particular moment sometimes that combination could mean you're a good match for a one night stand or you're a good match for an open casual relationship or you're a good match to be uh... someone even even keep in mind also you don't have to be having sex with every girl you're talking to as well you might be a good match to go and drink coffee and have chats together you might be a good match to go on bush walks and enjoy each other's time uh... and that's a cool thing too that a lot of guys don't understand often times is that if they're not fucking a girl that somehow she's meaningless or it's pointless or what's the what's the point well having female friends is a very important thing that's one of the things that you should have in your life and you will learn a lot some of your best learnings teachings and feedback is going to come from sharing time with women as friends and also guess what when you've got female friends often times they have friends that are females that are single that are looking for guys like you so that can be a big advantage too because you start to become a guy embedded into a social circle with female friends that have female friends and as you start to evolve yourself as the romantic adventurer the lover the bad boy you know the guy who is is open to this kind of lifestyle women will start to frame you as that and expect that from you and if you're friends with a woman and she knows you as that then she might say to her friends oh I know a guy who's going to be good for you because he's he's a he's a great no strings attached guy and he has he's going to treat you with respect and he's not going to be an idiot he's not going to treat you badly and at the same time there doesn't have to be any excess emotional attachment he doesn't have to become your boyfriend there are a lot of women out there who really want that in the particular phase of their experience right now whether they've just broken up from a guy or they're single and they just want to explore or they're just open to whatever's possible now why do I bring all this into the context of understanding how to not get attached to a girl because this is all factors and things that are really useful in your philosophy of understanding yourself and women that allow you to become a better communicator because the next piece that adds into this we're talking about boundaries and what are boundaries? Boundaries are the rules of what you allow and don't allow in yourself in your relationships in your interactions so once you've aligned yourself with what's important to you with your values you started to understand how your focus works and how to work with it more effectively to not allow your focus to pull you in different directions and hijack you into places you don't really want to go then you can start to learn and and set clear boundaries and what's the boundaries what's the boundaries of a lover what's the boundaries of a romantic adventurer now that's for you to really like negotiate on your own personal terms but generally the boundaries are going to be something along the lines of these are the rules that allow me to be the kind of guy that I want to be and to live the kind of life that I want to live and as James Marshall says make no apology and take full responsibility for that so that means be true to what you really want to do with yourself and how you want to live your life and then be able to communicate that and say to a woman I've got a lot of good stuff that I would love to share with you and I can share value whatever that is you know good humor, good emotions, good sex, good times good experiences, good information all these things that women appreciate I can share that stuff but at the same time I am this kind of guy these are my boundaries these are my rules I'm not looking for a relationship right now I'm particularly free in my exploration of who I am because I was coming from a place where I was shy or I'm still developing what I really want to know about women in life or I'm still trying to understand what it is to be a man and it's not the time and place for me to be in a long-term relationship just now I don't know what's going to happen in the future but right now it's not appropriate for me so you tell a woman this and then the last thing that you can say is and I really love spending time with you and would appreciate that we could keep doing this and learning from each other and growing as friends as lovers as whatever it is that you want to create and I also understand that that might be a little bit unsettling or uncomfortable for you and I'm open to negotiating that I'm open to talking with you about this and ultimately if it's not healthy for you then I'm also open to you doing what is good for you with your boundaries so then what do you end up with? you end up with a very powerful thing where you have two people being adults being mature communicating their needs communicating their boundaries and able to actually give each other freedom as well as open up the possibility of sharing something amazing together now that is something that is quite unique and in many ways women will find that attractive in itself because they very rarely find a guy who's honest enough and capable enough of actually being emotionally intelligent to do that so just the fact that you can do that shows a lot and a lot of women will be intrigued and curious because they want to have experiences too they want to know what it's like to have boundaries they want to know what it's like to be free because a lot of women are under the spell of the cultural norm you know of being a Disney princess who just stumbles into some guy who like then does something sweeps her off her feet and then all of a sudden they live happily ever after and be married and have kids or whatever but at the same time a lot of women understand that that's not a hundred percent of the story that there's a lot of life experiences to be had that they need to have maturity and experience and also a lot of women these days because of the opportunities to have a lot of guilt-free connections and a lot of guilt-free sex and because of social media and and and you know all these dating apps and things we have these days women are becoming in some sense a lot more masculine in how they look at sex and relationships they're looking at it in terms of like well how can I get what I want how can I fuck the kinds of guys that I feel like and some girls not all of them but some girls are really on a mission to be like well they're just gonna go out and slut around and there's nothing wrong with that if that's what they want to do just the same as us guys want to go out and slut around so it's a little key piece there as well is don't slut shame women and don't slut shame yourself be cool with being somebody who's a sexual person if that's what you are and that's what you really want and these are the kinds of things that will help you to much more effectively not fall into the trap of a simple monotonous you know kind of unconscious socially scripted kind of dating experience with the kind of a girl that you might be sleeping with on a regular basis so put all that stuff together and you end up with a very powerful combination know your values understand how to use your focus be able to clearly communicate what it is that you really want and then set the boundaries that are really important for you and learn to create the kind of identity that really works for you and works for others out there and understand the context of the dating the dating game and I guess the last piece that I'd put in there is that you've got to be able to take the highs with the lows something that is difficult and not always easy is that if you want to be a higher level operator somebody that's experiencing a much more intense level of the dating game and being with women then you have to be prepared to go through a lot of experiences both highs and lows so you have to be prepared to date a lot of women, have a lot of women flake on you have a lot of mess, have relationships not work out the way you want, you have to be prepared to try to negotiate and mess it up, you have to be prepared to to try to learn these things and realize that you fail or it fails because she doesn't want something you want or you weren't very good at communicating it or you fell under the spell of something that pulled you down a certain track for a period of time and you didn't even realize until it was too late that you'd already created a problem that you then had to deal with later and I'll tell you all those things really create a powerful foundation for you to learn and to grow and over months and particularly over years you will learn from those lessons if you pay attention you will learn from those lessons especially when you pay attention to the videos that we're putting out and other similar videos that people putting out that make sense and trying to create a logical framework and an effective framework to this you'll get some feedback and start to see how it works and definitely try to hang out with more high-level operators, try and find more unique people that are able to meet you on these levels and understand these kinds of things like personally I have a lot of friends in a lot of different areas in a lot of parts of the world doing a lot of different things and one of the things that that I appreciate a lot is meeting people on a similar wavelength to my understanding of dating, relating and sexuality because then I know that we can really share the sophistication of what's really going on. It's one of the reasons why I like hanging out with the TNL crew and I'm part of this great brotherhood because we're always learning from each other, sharing ideas and growing together not from a position of what can I get what I want and how can I manipulate women, that's not it at all it's actually the opposite, it's like how can I become more sophisticated human being to understand the real nature of relationships and the real nature of love and connection. So there you go gentlemen that is a nice little package there of how to understand not getting too attached to somebody that you're sleeping with on a regular basis. I hope that serves you well and by all means stay tuned for more other videos, subscribe, hit the bell and make sure that you ask me some good questions so I can be back to give you some more and more content.
