I propose to you that rather than seeing this as something that you want to try to avoid and get so cool that you never have to experience it, that awkwardness is actually an integral bridge between all of the most fantastic experiences and growth opportunities that you can have in this lifetime. Let me present to you the ancient and regal art of awkwardness. From my childhood, I have two excruciatingly powerful memories of particularly awkward experiences. The first one was when I was about seven or eight years old. My mother dropped me off at the local shopping center. She was going into the supermarket, and I had to go and get a book from the library. She gave me this instruction, which was not very clear to me. She said, go inside and ask them for your card. That's all she said. She was in a rush. She said, go inside and ask them for your card. I was like, oh, what? She just parked the car and ran off. I don't know exactly. It just sounds like she dumped me by the side of the road. I don't think it was that bad. Anyway, I walked into the library, and I walked up to the front counter, and there was this staunch middle-aged Australian woman. I just went up, and I said, can I have my card? She said, I don't know what you're talking about. Then I just stood there, and a couple of people in the line looked at me, this little kid. I went, can I have my card? She said, that doesn't make any sense. I don't know what you're talking about. Then just this horrible old lady, and I have her so ... I can't remember half the faces of people that I've had sex with, and probably many of them can't remember my face, but I remember her fucking face. I just burst into tears, and ran out, and went back to my mum in the supermarket, and said, I said, where's my card, and then she just did this. It was a deeply cringing scenario that I, to this day, it's a beautifully clear memory. The other one that I remember clearly was when I was about 11 years old. I'd started playing the flute a couple of years earlier, and I had to go and give my first public performance, which was for the flute school. All the flute students were meeting, and all the parents were coming to watch them play, the kind of thing that only a parent would do, go and watch 12, 11-year-olds play the flute. Great. Of the group of kids, I was the one who had started the latest, and so I was the worst. There was a girl in the class, Phoebe Porter, shout out to Phoebe Porter, wherever you are now, who was much better than me, and whom I was in love with in an 11-year-old kind of way. I was really nervous about playing this performance, and I remember before the performance, I ran around the fucking block a number of times, just saying to myself, good or bad, it doesn't matter, good or bad, it doesn't matter, which is kind of like a cool thing for a young kid to be doing. You know, a lot of positive affirmations, and I was just like, it doesn't matter, just go and try. I was so nervous, and so the afternoon arrives, I get up on stage, and I played this piece over and over and over again. I know how to play it, I can do it, but because I was so nervous, my body started to shake. Now, if you're playing the guitar, and your body starts to shake, it's probably okay, but if you're playing the flute, it meant that my lip started trembling, my jaw was shaking, my throat was vibrating, and so it came out like, like it was, in my mind, it was the worst performance of all time, and in my mind, I see the audience cringing for me, like, oh no, and I think there was, and I have this memory of Phoebe, although maybe she wasn't even there, I'm just implanted that of Phoebe just going, like it was a disaster. I could barely get through the piece, and I think I even stopped before, because my mouth was so dry, and I just couldn't do it, and eventually, I just kind of ran off stage, ran out of the room, it wasn't a stage, and then again, burst into tears, and ran out of the building itself, and hid out the front until my mother came out and found me and drove me away in great shape. So these are two cringe experiences from my childhood that still to this day have left deep, deep scars. What I want to do is I want to analyse what is awkwardness, and I want you guys to start to understand it not just as an, because that's an experience, these discreet experiences we have in life where awkwardness wins, where the thing that we were most terrified of happening actually happens, because in this scenario, okay, the thing that I was most worried about is I would fuck up the performance in front of Phoebe, and I did, that I would walk into the shop, and that the girl would be just, the woman would be just like, what the fuck are you doing here, little kid? And that, like it reaches the zenith of the awkwardness, because so often, awkwardness is about anticipation of the worst possible thing happening. And sometimes in life, it does happen, right? So all of us have experiences like this where we can think back and go, yep, there was that time when I shat my pants in front of everybody, remember? Remember at Julie's party, and I just shat my pants, and then someone pulled my pants down at the same time, and then I sprayed diarrhea in their face? That sure was about as bad as it could get. Let's just get across the road while we have that thought. You know, or you get caught masturbating by your entire family. You know that one? You know, you're just jerking off at the, there's an open casket of your Uncle Jerry, and everyone leaves for a minute, and then you're jerking off over his dead corpse, and then everyone bursts in at the same time, and you're like, oh boy, here I was, caught jerking off over the dead corpse of my uncle. That sure does suck. So everyone's had that kind of experience, you know, right? You've had experiences where the worst things happened. However, that is the exception, because awkwardness is not just those moments, right? Because I think a lot of people see, I'm trying to avoid moments like that in my life. That's why awkwardness is a thing that's present. It's a low-level fear that I'm aware of, and I want to be avoiding situations where I'm totally caught with my pants down, or totally caught where people go, wow, this guy is a fuck-up pervert loser. For the most part, awkwardness is something much more subtle, and far more present, ever present than you may think. It's actually a glue, or a bridge, between almost every social exchange that you have. Some of the only times you don't feel awkward is when you're totally by yourself, where it's not a danger, where you're out in nature. Have you ever been walking along and then seen a squirrel and felt a bit awkward because the squirrel saw you when you didn't have your game face on? No, you don't care what the squirrel thinks. You don't care what the trees think. You care what humans think. So awkwardness is always in relation to other people. And what is it in relation to? It's in relation to expectations. Expectations about social contracts. Expectations about levels of status. Expectations about where you should be and what you should be doing at any given time. They're around unwritten social rules, or in some cases, very, very strict and stringent rules. There are some cultures where the idea of saving face is a national pastime. Asian cultures and Scandinavian cultures, places where appearing to be in command, elegant, moral, cool, knowing what you're doing, feeling capable, these are lifted to a national obsession. And so much so that it's built into the way people have business negotiations. In some cultures, you can't come out straight and say, that price is too high, because that would insinuate that the person has been lying to you or has elevated the price. Whereas in other places, you can go, come on, that's too fucking high. Let's lower the price. Bullshit, I'm not going to pay that. And people won't take massive offense. So there are massive differences in the way that societies at large and individuals perceive needing to save face. Awkwardness, so much of the time, is about protecting your pride and protecting the image that you have of other people having of you. So what I mean by that is, well, let's use the example of approaching girls. All the single men that I'm working with want to talk to dozens of girls they see every day. They walk past all sorts of attractive women and they have the desire, a deep desire, not just like, I kind of feel like an ice cream, like an existential desire, like I need to fucking get a girlfriend, I want to talk to that girl over there, I want to have this experience. And yet most of the time they don't. Not because they're busy, but because they are worried about the consequences. Now knowing full well that the consequences are not going to be violence, they're not going to be legal ramifications, they're not going to damage your body or anything else, you're not going to lose money over this. So the reason primarily that men don't go and do what they want to do in these areas is because they wish to protect the image that a stranger may have. This lady here, what is the image that she has of me right now? Right now, because I was pointing at her, she's like, some weirdo, don't like him. They're trying to protect the image of strangers walking by and thinking essentially this. Stranger walks by and goes, there's an upstanding gentleman. That's like, people would rather have that, or there's an average man, there's a nondescript average man doing as he should, you know, walking in a straight line with his arms swinging in opposition to his legs, and he just is doing the thing that a human does when they walk down the street, and he's doing that fairly correctly, and therefore my judgement of him is fine, average human. And for the most part, people police themselves by thinking that everyone else around them is thinking that, right, he's looking at everyone else and going, oh, is he doing that right? Is he doing it right? Now, there is absolutely truth in this, right, this is not just a delusional fantasy. Human beings are policing each other all the time, and we do that in all sorts of subtle ways. Even if we, like, if you look at the way crowds assemble, we create distances between ourselves. If you're waiting in line for something, depending on how the culture does things, people will automatically space between each other due to unwritten rules about physical spacing. When I go to China, I always find it very amusing, because the concept of physical space is about six inches closer than it is, say, in Western Europe. So if you're in a crowd, people will just be stuffed in, like you'll have a grandma just here, just waiting in line, and you're just like, uh, are you, do you want to blow me or are you just, it's just, no, that's just the space. Grandmas get that close to you, and that's just how it is. People, you know, in Serbia, when you're talking to the waiter, he'll come over and he'll lean on your shoulder and say, well, the risotto's no good, and they'll tell you that their own risotto is no good, and they'll lean on you while they're doing it. It's a different concept of the written rules about space and physical touch and so on. So we are always policing ourselves and others all the time, and when you walk through the streets of London, it's, I find it hilarious, because you, if I walk and bump into somebody, like I did the bumping, they'll say, oh, awfully sorry, and it's a great fun game. It's not quite right in England. Just walk through a crowd and just put your elbows out a little bit and just bump into people down the street and watch them just go, oh, awfully, oh, it's my brother, didn't mean to, and you're just like, fucking, this is cool. You can just make British people apologise to you all day. I had to do that on a plane recently. This woman was apologising to every single person as she was trying to get her stuff down. We'd just arrived in Melbourne, and then these Aussies just fucking flunking along and grabbing and she said, oh, sorry, oh, awfully, could you mind, I just was trying, I was, I just said, listen, lady, in Australia, don't say sorry unless you punch someone in the head or shot their dingo. And she's like, oh, sorry, I'm like, don't do it here. No, you don't need to apologise. We're not in England anymore, my dear. Anyway, what was I talking about? So the experience of awkwardness is something that we actually must navigate all the time, and really what it is, it's the pressure that builds momentarily, usually momentarily and sometimes over longer periods, based around certain social contracts. Okay, so if I walk into the coffee shop and the person says, what can I get for you? And I just kind of stare at them weirdly and like blink my eyes, instantly I create awkwardness because the expectation of the pressure that is built by her question, what can I do for you, which creates a little vacuum, creates a micro moment where awkwardness can appear. And then I dissolve that usually by saying, I'll have a cappuccino latte frappuccino, thank you very much. And then it's released because now that little piece of contract has been done. And now she goes on to making the coffee and I go on to staring at my screen so I don't have to deal with, you know, looking at other human beings, which would be awkward, right? Would be awfully awkward. And so we've actually gone into play. There's been a scenario, a scene that's been set and both of us have stepped in to play out certain roles, which inherently have a certain level of pressure and release. And so obviously I talk a lot about this concept and the application of emotional pressure and emotional release as part of my five principles of natural seduction, which by the way, just to create a little awkward segue into a sales pitch, see, you feel it, you feel it, yeah. Now you're thinking of turning off on to cat memes. The five principles of natural seduction, my legacy edition online course is available right now, right immediately in this very moment that you're watching it, it's available and only for a few more days. This is a live course, so it's starting very soon. So I'll be shutting the doors and focusing in on teaching the guys. A five week course where I take you through the five principles, awareness, intent, pressure and release, emotional impact, and pulling the fucking trigger. These are the underlying laws that govern all grand seductions. All guys that are excellent, and ladies too, that are excellent at seduction have the ability to filter these principles through. This has been my... my life's work, essentially, and I'm presenting it to you now in a five-week course available. You just need to click the link in the description for full details. Anyhow, as I was saying, inherently, there must be pressure built in interactions. The only time you have zero pressure is when there is, I mean, really only in situations where you're hanging out with someone that you know incredibly well, you have no expectations of each other. Right now, probably, you're both zoning out, right, so you're not actually paying attention to each other. So if you and your buddy are sitting on a couch and you're both looking at your own phones, okay, there is not really any inherent pressure in here. However, if you and that friend then go to a restaurant and sit opposite each other, and let's say suddenly there's no Wi-Fi in the place, there will be an inherent pressure. Even with your very best friend, you'll actually have to think for a minute and go, oh, we should talk about something. So how's therapy going? And then you're going to have to actually enter into the awkwardness zone. Unfortunately, most people, I would say, spend their lives, like when you first go out into the world, as I did as that little kid, right, so I came out and I just, I don't know the social rules, I don't know how to navigate, I don't know what it means when I go and say, can I have my card, right? So everything that I'm stepping into is awkward, because I just don't, I have no command of the social rules. But as a child, I'm let off the hook, except by that nasty cunt of a woman, I'm let off the hook. Kids can get away with, well, firstly, when you're a child, at first you don't give a shit at all, right, because you don't know that there's any social rules, and then at some point, someone shames you for something, they're like, you shouldn't take a shit in the middle of the room, kid, and the kid's like, why not, because it's dirty, and you're a dirty boy if you do that, and then you feel a bit of shame, and now there's a rule, now there's something you should and shouldn't do, right, and so, of course, the levels to which we are shamed for our behaviours massively, are hugely different, depending on the way that we're conditioned, and whether our parents, like, shamed us for masturbating or not. And actually, my mother didn't, I used to do this thing where I'd kind of do this proto-jerking off in the living room, where I'd sort of just hump things, hump the pillow or whatever, and I called it funnying myself, and my mother said, very well, she's just like, funnying yourself is a good thing to do in your own bedroom, and so I did, mostly, and then I also have these memories of me, like, humping things when guests were over, and she just didn't, no one said anything, like, thank you, thanks, Auntie Pat and my mother for just allowing this, whatever, three, four, five-year-old kid to just hump stuff in the lounge room without shaming him, thank you, that meant that I developed a healthy relationship with masturbation, whereas I've heard horror stories from students where, you know, I had one student where a grandmother caught him jerking off, and said that he was going to hell, and that if he ever touched his penis ever again, he was going to hell, and so that was, that's a great start to your sexual life, isn't it, thinking that, if I touch my penis, I will burn for eternity, fuck you, grandmother, Jesus Christ, in any case, to one degree or another, once we become self-conscious, self-aware, that we are a separate, discreet human to other discreet humans, and we start seeing that there are all these rules at play, and that we fuck them up, right, then we start developing these levels of shame or tension and awkwardness around, am I doing things right, and so much of the problem with awkwardness is that we're, like, what are you really worried about, right, let's say you walk into an event, and you don't really know where to stand, and you realize you don't know anybody, someone invited you, and that person didn't turn up, so you walk in, and suddenly you're alone in a room with other people, and all these people seem to know each other, and you can imagine that, like, now, and let's just put, let's say you've got a bow tie on, and it's the wrong color, you know, you've walked in, everyone's wearing a black bow tie, and you've got, like, a comedy black bow tie, because somebody told you it was, you know, kind of dress wacky, and you've just fucked it up, right, what is the thing that you're really concerned about here, and I think the thing you're most concerned about is other people's perception that you are not up to scratch, right, that you, that the degree to which you are intelligent, or socially competent, or rich, or able in some way, has been compromised, that the truth is out, that actually, oh, and everyone looks and goes, oh, he's not nearly as smart as we thought he was, or, because the reality is, before you were kind of invisible, but now it's like I came out of the invisibility of being the average man in the corner, and I'm like, ta-da, oh, I'm not as good as, ooh, ooh, oh, I can't really play this tune, right, and which is a thing, of course, it's a thing that you are not nearly as good as the, as how you present yourself, when I stand here like this, someone could look at me and think, wow, that guy could be really good at almost anything, but the truth is, I'm not, I'm bad at skiing, I'm bad at mathematics, yeah, I'm bad at keeping my room tidy, if you've watched my Instagram stories, you'll know, right, there's all sorts of things that I am not up to scratch, I'm not perfect at, in comparison to all sorts of other people I fucking suck at, but the difference with me and many, many other people is I care way less, not, I don't care at all, because I do, because otherwise I would just shit my pants right now, if I felt like doing a dump, and just, you know, just walk around fucking doing wacky dance moves and doing those fingers all day, because I'd like doing that, but no, I shouldn't, right, like, true social freedom, I think, steps over into, into madness, right, because you see that, if you see someone who is truly socially free, as in someone who is covered in their own feces, someone who is howling at the moon in the middle of the street, that is a true social freedom to one degree, that's somebody who is not bound by almost any rules, not even bound by laws, right, yet that person has, has stepped over into the point where they're no longer interfacing with any other human being, that's not an effective way to be, I like social freedom exercises and we teach them on our workshops, I think they're a really good way to step so far out of your comfort zone that it almost enters into the absurd, right, so when it's into the absurd, you can kind of get away with more than just the subtle things, you know what I mean, like in a way it's easier to go up to somebody and pretend you're from a foreign country and say, excuse me, do no way to sexual health doctors for itchy dicks, that's a way easier, it's pretty funny to do, that's one of old Sasha's drills we used to do, it's way easier to do that than it is to just do slight glitches, right, to just, just to like miss the handshake a little bit and just double, like cutting on the person, right, things where the person just perceives you as a little bit off because that says to them, ah, this guy doesn't really get it, this guy's a little bit, okay, this guy doesn't, he's not cool, this guy doesn't know how to just, doesn't know the social contracts and you see that if you hear someone come into a shop and order something incorrectly, like they say, can I have a, like walk into a coffee shop and they say to a hipster with a whole bunch of other hipsters, you say, ah, can I have a sugar free espresso and that, like, ah, the cringe, imagine saying to a hipster, can I have a sugar free espresso and they're like, ah, espresso doesn't have any sugar in it in the first place, you fucking philistine, don't you know that this brown drink is the most fucking important thing on the planet. So what can I fuck at you? So yeah, try that one, go into like the hippest cafe in the middle of New York or some really cool place and just loudly say, ah, can I have a sugar free espresso, but yeah, that's a cringe worthy event, right, because it's just those little glitches that says, ah, this person does not understand, this person is not up to scratch, this person cannot operate in this social scene, alright, whereas if you go so outlandish that it, because I do that when I go to a foreign country where I'm clearly, like I did it in Dubai, I went to Dubai and I walked onto a train, right, so I walked onto a train, I'm just standing there looking around, I'm like, ah, there's a lot of girls in this train, I started checking out the ladies and then this Indian woman came up to me and said, excuse me sir, this is a ladies only carriage and I was like, and I looked and there was a sign that said very clearly in English, women only and I went, oh yes, it does appear to be that I am the only man in, yes, yeah, I can see now, now I realise that yes, I am the only man and there is five signs that all say I shouldn't be here because I've got a dick and then like it was another five minutes before the stop and I'm just like looking down like, sorry ladies, just, yep, can't read my own language and right, so actually it didn't matter because it was just so clearly, everyone knew that I didn't just, you know, just go on there to go, fuck you, fuck this, I was just like so clearly outside of my area of knowledge that someone politely came over and said, by the way, you're not allowed to be here because you're a man and then I scurried off at the next stop and got on the man carriage, right, and then I was like, sure, there's a lot of dudes in here, this is where I belong, just checking the signs, men only, I'm in the right place. Right, so in that sort of situation, it's not really cringeworthy because it's like, I'm totally, I'm totally foreign to this environment, it's those little things and that's where I come back to my original point, the issue with awkwardness is not about avoiding the Phoebe Porter flute gate, it's not about avoiding the shit in your pants, it's about the way that some people or most people choose to navigate these tiny little choice points over and over and over and over again, dozens of times per day, away from having a risk to their pride and towards comfort and safety and invisibility, right, and that's where it becomes fucking insidious, right, because the choice really is, you either get to learn to be in play with awkwardness and when I say that, remember what I'm talking about here is tension, right, so the tension of two strangers meeting or of there being an unknown social contract or of me going in and needing to navigate through a social scenario or some kind of deal or some kind of exchange and that inherent within that will be the awkwardness of uncertainty, I don't know what I'm going to say, I don't know what the other person's going to say, when I go up to the cash register and I just hand the person the thing that I want to buy and they just say, hi, how are you and you say, good, thanks and then they say, you know, cash or card or, you know, bitcoin or fucking, do I scan your fingerprints, like however people buy things in the future, there's very, very limited awkwardness, very limited tension because we already know the script, like we literally know the exact words to say to each other just so that we have the bare minimum of human contact so it's the person's like, hi, how are you and I don't give a shit and I'm like, I'm well, thanks, how are you, I don't give a shit, you may as well be a robot, I kind of am, so am I, in this moment, both of us are organic robots. So those situations, there's no awkwardness and it's very easy to glitch with that and play with that when the person says, hi, how are you today and you say, oh, just coming out of a major depression and the person says, and then see what they do, right, because suddenly there's a totally new set of rules at play and then the other person now has to experience the awkwardness of not knowing what to do in this scenario and needing to make it up as they go along. So much of awkwardness is about the need to improvise and so, because that is more difficult than not doing that, it requires awareness, it requires you to think on your feet, it requires you to do something and most importantly and frighteningly, it requires you to be exposed to the potential of somebody going, ah, not as cool as I thought, not as intelligent as they appear to be, not a sexual prospect, going to die alone, clearly. Just on that though, the biggest mistake that we make in this area of socialisation is thinking that other people are walking around all day like some kind of caricature of a nasty drag queen, right, someone who's just walking around going, oh my god, look at her shoes, wow, apparently the diet's not working, this guy over here is a total piece of shit loser and is going to die in his own vomit, as if every person is walking around aggressively analysing with great, great clarity and ability and pulling you apart, comparing you to everyone else in the social strata, judging you and then punishing you, right, so as if that's what everyone is doing all day, we're walking around just policing each other and that's all we do, just I'm walking by, I'm looking at a person like, oh, yeah, okay, that one can pass, this guy, no, fucked it up, don't like the way he's walking, piece of shit, get out of my life, you know, as if that's what we're doing, sorry, by the way, I said that a bit loud, no, no, you're great, you're cool, you be you, I believe in you, fuck.
