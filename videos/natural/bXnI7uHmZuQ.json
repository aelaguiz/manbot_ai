Now I've got a very, very interesting video for you guys today. A couple of years ago when I was in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and was studying tango, I met this amazing woman called Xuxu, who was a tango teacher. And I worked with her for a couple of weeks, and I realized that as we were learning this beautiful dance form, that there were so many parallels and crossovers between tango and seduction. And so at the end of my time with her, I sat down with her and interviewed her about tango, seduction, men and women, and the insights that she had were mind-blowing. As I was sitting there, I was thinking, this woman knows so much more about this than I do, and I should just retire now and give her my company. And recently I was just going through a bunch of hard drives, looking at all the wacky footage that we still have, which we haven't released, and I found this interview. So I thought, awesome, now's the time, and I'm going to put it out for you guys. So in the lead up to my Five Principles of Natural Seduction online course, which is coming very, very soon, here's one of the added extra exclusive bonuses that I wanted to throw at you guys. So without further ado, the interview of a lifetime with an amazing tango master, James Marshall and Xuxu. Enjoy. It's not fair, is it? Alright, gentlemen, this is James Marshall, reporting live from Buenos Aires in Argentina, and I'm here with my tango teacher, this is Xuxu Herrera, did I pronounce that correctly? Xuxu Herrera. Very good. And I've been studying with Xuxu now for about two weeks. Sasha was here for a while, and stepped all over your toes, I think Alex, you know him as. And then he left me, and now I've been working with her every day, and it's been a really fantastic experience. And she says that I'm doing well, is that correct? Yes, very good. And whilst studying tango, I saw some incredibly profound parallels between what we do in terms of teaching seduction to men. And it is now one of my top recommendations in terms of the extracurricular activities that all men must do if they want to become incredible ladies' men, along with meditation and martial arts, and learning how to dress well, you have to learn tango. It will help you infinitely. And so, I wanted to talk to you today about how tango is a metaphor for life, and for men and women, and seduction, and all these things. But first, can you just tell me about your history with dance, how long have you been doing this for? Right. In a short way. I am dancing for 25 years, and I am teaching. Since you were three years old. Three years old. Thank you. And I am teaching for maybe 13 years. And especially, I like to teach not only the movement and the steps to dance tango. Of course, you need to know your body, you need to mind the technique, you need to know some steps, but that is not enough to dance tango. Because the most important thing to dance tango is to get the connection with yourself, and then with another person. Right. Then, if you know how to do some steps, okay, you are doing some steps with the music of tango. But you need a plus. And that plus is the magic thing that tango has. Because into the connection, if you are dancing with your partner, and you get that connection, this is the moment like all the people are looking forward to feel. It's like one meditation moment in the movement. And it's like to make love. So you mean like a moment where you're not thinking, where you're only in the moment, you're just feeling. You can't think. If you think, you make a mistake. Then, if you really get the connection with yourself and with another person, three minutes, each tango so-so, three minutes of time, you complete yourself with another person. Right. I don't know when in the life you can feel that. For example, I don't know if when you make love. We hope so. And you love another person. And you feel that you are complete. You are not separate. Separado. Separated. You are not alone. You are one unidad. United. Unit. Unit. Unit. With another person. Then it's one state, very special, that you don't get, for sure. And then, when you discover that part, you want to dance tango the rest of your life. Well, I do. I intend to do it now. And especially, it was really good to see guys in the milonga who are 70 years old, dancing with very young, beautiful women. So that's something I remember when I'm an old man. Okay, so let's talk about the masculine and feminine roles in tango. Okay, so obviously there's a very clear and strong role for the man, and a clear and strong role for the woman. Can you explain briefly what each role is, what are the characteristics of the man's role and the woman's role? Yes. Till now, the man is the leader. He needs all the qualities to lead one situation, or any leader, in any situation, that is, to know about what he wants. Right. And the language to transmit to her what he wants. That is very important in the tango. It's the most important, and in life, too. Right. Then he must be very clear what direction he wants to take. Right. And have the tools in his body to have the good way to give the information to the woman. That is very important, too. Because, for example, if you try to force her to take some way, you are not a good communicator. You need to show your intention that she understands, and then follow you. She must follow you. She must interpretate your language. She's interpreter. You are creator. That's a really very profound statement there, gentlemen. I understand that. You as the man are the creator, and she is the interpreter. I think when I'm talking about leadership to the guys when I'm teaching them, I talk about authority to lead. There are two ways you can have authority to lead people in life. One is through fear. So through fear, F-E-A-R, fear. Fear. Yes, I. Right. You can force people to do things through fear, maybe. But in dancing and in seduction, this doesn't work. The other way is through showing them that when they follow you, they benefit. That it's pleasurable. That they enjoy this. Yes. So would you say this is the same in tango? That, yes, the man needs to know what he wants, but the woman needs to benefit from what he wants. She needs to enjoy this. Of course. Yes. Okay. Stop. Lina, I am making a video. Don't make a sound. Don't make a sound. I am recording the video. Don't make two sounds, okay? All right. Stop. Again, the benefits. The benefits. Yes. Okay. Okay. Yes, of course, all the women want to be treated in a very good way, no? If you force me to take one way, I don't want to dance more with you. If you treat me in one very nice and gentle way, then I want to follow you and feel the pleasure. How is nicer to move with you together? It's like one dance of, how you say, dolphins. Dolphins. Yes. Going together with the same energy. The most important for me, for the men, is to know that each woman is different. Yes, very important point. When you dance tango, you embrace to her for first time, you can't start to run because you want to do some steps with her, and you use her body for your pleasure. Or for your ego. Yes, to show you using her body. That is like in the life, for your own pleasure, your ego. Now, you need to embrace to the woman and get some time, take some time to feel her energy. How is this woman? What are the possibilities the woman has? For example, the old men know that the first tango is... The old men. The old men, who has a lot of experience in tango, know that the first tango is only to feel her body. They don't do too much steps. They only try to walk together. And they are testing her. It's like when you, I don't know too much about the horse, but you need to have the first contact. You can't jump on the new horse and run. And then, when you feel the possibilities of her to move, you offer to her the dance that she can do it. That she will enjoy it. Yes, because you want that she enjoy it. And you have not a book with the same pattern for all the women. You need to test her and have the reception, have the intuition, man intuition. Not only the woman have intuition. The man need to develop the intuition to feel to her before jump on her. Yes, that's very interesting. Because when I'm teaching a man to approach a woman, so he sees a woman in the street, he likes her, he wants to go and say hello. Many guys, they come up and they start straight away like, hey, I saw you, I thought you were really beautiful, and yeah, I wanted to meet you, and they are too much. And they don't take any time to see how she responds. And so, I teach men, when they go to speak to a woman, to first say not much, only a few words. Just to say, excuse me, hi, and wait and see how she responds. And then you may see that she's very friendly and open and funny, or that she's reserved and quiet or shy. And then you can adapt and change as you need, so that this dance in meeting a woman... It's exactly, it's exactly what you need to do. Satsang with Mooji www.mooji.org"}
