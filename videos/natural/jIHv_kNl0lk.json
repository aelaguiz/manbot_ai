Now, unless you've been living under a soundproof rock in the vacuum of space, you would be well aware that very soon I will be releasing my first ever online instructional video course, which is the five principles of natural seduction. This course is going live this Friday, the 18th of December, very exciting stuff. And in this final week leading up to it, what I decided to do was give you guys a sneak peek into some of the aspects and some of the content that's gonna be in the product itself. The product is, of course, around my five principles, and alongside the lectures and course material, I also provide a whole lot of weekly missions. This is where guys get to go out and work on both the internal and the external expressions of the principles in the field and in their own personal development. And then they get to report back to me on our private Facebook group and in the weekly webinars where the guys get to sit down with me live and discuss and work through all these issues, problems, triumphs, and the actual course material itself. So today, what I wanted to do was give you guys one of the missions, which is based around the third principle, emotional impact. And this one relates to conversation. A lot of guys struggle with conversation, running out of things to say, ending up in boring conversations. And this mission, this drill will assist you to get into very emotionally based conversations that are going to elicit feelings from a girl so that she's gonna be much more engaged. So without further ado, check out the mission. This is one of 25 or 30, I think, that are in the product itself. So this will give you an indication of what's to come. Check it. All right. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. On this windswept ambient melancholy day, I thought it was a perfect time to talk about the third principle, which is, emotional impact. Now, a lot of guys when they get into seduction, think that they need to become tough and heartless. They feel that in order to win this battle of the sexes, that they need to be quite rigid, stoic, solid, so that they don't get hurt, so that they appear to be powerful, and so that they are in control of the situation. Now, I can see why people would think this, but the truth is, as you get better and better at seduction, instead of becoming tougher, what you actually become is far more vulnerable. And that, in a way, is the overall theme of this week. Emotional impact can only be elicited from somebody else, if you are able to actually open yourself and become vulnerable. This, of course, can be a scary thing, because you risk getting rejected or getting hurt, but too fucking bad, that's how it works in this game. It's the guy that's able to become more open-hearted, to be able to present himself simply as he is, without putting on a mask or any kind of front, that's the guy that girls will actually resonate with. Now, of course, there's a difference between that and being super needy and, let's say, over-emotional, where I'm sharing way too much or gushing or giving all of my cards away at once. But at the same time, when I'm going into any interaction, I'm coming in from that position. As I've cleared myself through my awareness, I've charged my intention, if that's my initial intention, say, which is to meet the person or to get to know them or to project my desire. Overall, I'm not hiding anything. And this is actually the most disarming technique that you can use. If I'm not hiding something, then that gives her a space where she can become open and express herself to me. Moving on to some of the more practical conversational elements in terms of your approaching this week. A lot of men make the mistake of asking a lot of detail-based questions. How many? What? When? Where did you go to school? When did you start studying that? Or the girl says that she's from Copenhagen, you say, oh, I know a guy, my brother went to Copenhagen once. And she's like, cool. So staying on these kind of irrelevant details, fact collection or fact associations. This is not what drives a sexy conversation. From the main lecture this week, you will have heard me talk a lot about this in terms of getting below the general, below the specific and getting into the personal space with the girl. The easiest way to do this at the very beginning is to ask the question, why? All right, so this week, when you're in your conversations with the girls, why is the question you're going to be asking? Now, of course, we don't always wanna ask why over and over again, because then we're like a two-year-old annoying their parents, but you need to start orientating your mind to look at conversation at this personal depth rather than staying in fact collection. So when you talk to a girl and you ask her what she's studying, she says she's studying interior design, catch yourself wanting to say, what year are you in? Which university do you go to? It doesn't fucking matter. Ask the question, why? Why do you do that? Why did you choose that? And of course, we can do all sorts of other variations on that. What's that about? How did you decide to do that? What's your motivation behind this? All right, so any of these questions that get to her motivation, the way that she actually feels, her decision-making process, her values, her beliefs, now we're starting to move into her emotional space in our conversation. All right, so remember that. When in doubt, ask the question, why? The next extension from this is to make sure that you are revealing your why. When men start to practice conversation with us in our workshops, we find that very quickly, they get to this point where they're moving below the specifics and getting to the core motivations, the why for the girl. The problem often occurs that a lot of men are not comfortable in sharing their own reasons why. They're quite comfortable in sharing their resume. You know, they can say, I am a this, and I do this, and here are my hobbies. But if you're going to talk about yourself, we don't wanna just give her a list of things, no matter how interesting they are. I've got a lot of interesting things that I do in my life, but if I just list them to a girl, say, you know, I play music, I'm a massage therapist, I teach people how to move past their fears. Some of those things may sound kind of interesting, but still, it doesn't give her much to work with emotionally. So instead, when the girl asks you, what do you do, what's your story? Then you tell her, well, I do this, or I like this, and here's the reason why. Okay, so I say, well, I've been a musician for a lot of my life, because I love to express myself artistically, and I love that mixture of fear and excitement that I get when I'm out there performing for people. All right, so in this way, she can make the connection between the fact, which is that I play the flute, which is not that cool, to why I do that, how that makes me feel. Because then she can start to relate to those feelings. Remembering that emotional impact is not just about getting an impact from her, not just getting her emotions out, as if I'm some kind of psychologist drawing things out of her without any personal connection. The actual emotional impact really comes from drawing her emotions out, revealing my emotions, and now starting to discuss or experience these emotions together. So in that little example I gave you, she can then talk about some situation where maybe she does public presentations for a university, and she has that similar feeling where that nervousness and excitement and uncertainty of performing for somebody, of showing her knowledge and her experience in a place that's very vulnerable. Then we can have very different things that we're interested in, but we can find a common ground, or if we don't have the same experience, a contrasting ground, which is totally fine as well. She may not experience the world like that. For her, performing might be something that is absolutely terrifying and she avoids, or it might be something that she's totally cool with and she does all the time. That's totally fine. I don't need to be the same as her, but I do need to be able to understand her and she needs to be able to understand me. So remember, the theme of this week is vulnerability. Reveal yourself. Tell her why you love something, why you do something, or why you're afraid of something, why something's difficult for you. If right now in your life, you're unemployed and you don't know what you're doing, don't hide that. Don't pretend you're not in that situation. Tell the girl, well, right now I'm at a transition point. I'm not actually really sure what I'm doing, and I find that both scary and exciting because there's so much potential, and also I have no direction. So my mission right now is to find myself. That's absolutely fine. A girl's not looking for a guy who's perfectly got every single thing in line in his life as long as he's actually searching, yearning, changing, and growing. That's a perfectly beautiful place to stay at. I was unemployed and confused about what I was doing for most of my life, and I used that to my advantage instead of trying to hide it. Okay, so this week, reveal yourself, and then she will reveal to you. \u266a The mirror's image tells me it's all my fault \u266a"}
