Do you know what he just realized with his own mind? That this conspiracy is inside your own mind. Conspiraception. You conspiracepted yourself, dude. All right, I need to smoke some weed. What's up, gentlemen? It's James Marshall here reporting live for the Natural Lifestyles podcast. Hang on, I just got to check the cords and the audio's good there. Alex, you got that? Yeah, yeah, what, what, what, what, yeah, yeah. One, two, two, two, one, two, two, check. Right, we're nice. Hi there, guys, it's James Marshall and I'm here with my good prison mate, cellmate, the one and only Shay Matthews. It's all lies. They've been lying to you all along. All righty, so in today's podcast, I'm going to be quite pedantic. Okay, in today's podcast, what we want to talk about, what I really want to talk about is conspiracy theories. Now, I've been wanting to do this podcast for quite a while. I've mentioned Alex several times and he said, yeah, let's save that till after the launch. That's not relevant. We're not going to sell anything. Nobody care. I'm like, I know, I know. It's not going to help us financially, man, but we live in a society, man. You need to get your head around it. So yeah, this is the time in Corona when we get to discuss these kinds of things. Now, Shay and I have been in kind of interesting echo chambers throughout the last 20 years. So all of us now, especially, exist within bubbles of information. You know, look at your YouTube feed. I always get these ads for Coin Master with Jennifer Lopez in them. I don't know why, but aside from that, I always get videos about things that I'm interested in. Stephen Colbert, fucking Chomsky, weird stuff about gardening, lots of history stuff. You know, the algorithm knows roughly what I want because of my search history. So all of us have funneled our way into little pockets of belief structures, echo chambers where more or less the only people within them are people that kind of agree with you, or maybe they're a little bit centrist, but it tends to shepherd people into groups where they just say what everyone else in front of them believes. This is not new news, guys. And people like James, you're a bit behind on that. Yeah, I get it, I know. Just catching anyone up who doesn't know what an echo chamber is. Now, the thing about Shani is that because of our work, we're therapists or coaches that have been working with a lot of different men from many different demographics. We also collaborate with lots of different guys and girls who are in the life coaching industry, the dating industry, self-help, health and wellness, financial freedom, tantra and BDSM, alternative social and sexual lifestyles, so we have a lot of contacts in all of these different areas. And so therefore, we keep moving into overlapping or totally different echo chambers probably more often than most people do. It's no secret that my kind of ideology and that of the 21 Studios are very different. Anthony is now very happily out and proud, the king of the manosphere, make women great again, MGTOW kind of king, right? I'm not part of that ideology, yet I was part of that scene. I went in and I gave speeches in front of those guys and sometimes they didn't go down very well and then spent lots of time talking to people. And so what I've seen since 9-11, yes, but getting faster and faster and more apparent in the last, I don't know, 10 years is the proliferation of what we would call conspiracy theory thinking. And immediately, any conspiracy theorist out there will be banging their chest saying, I know I'm a conspiracy theorist and do you know, anytime you put two people in a room together and they talk about something that other people don't know, that's a conspiracy? So yeah, we're all conspiracy theorists and there are conspiracies happening, man. And therefore, if you don't believe in my conspiracy theories, you're a sheeple. You are close-minded, you don't see the big picture, man. You're just swallowing what CNN, what the establishment, what Hillary, what Trump, depending on your ideological bent, what the establishment wants you to think. So the average conspiracy theorist would divide people into those who get it and those who are asleep. And then the evil cabal that's running the thing, right? I would say loosely. My big point that I wanna get across today, and I'm gonna hand it over to Shane in a minute so that I don't just keep ranting, but the big thing that I wanna talk about today is the difference between a theory of a conspiracy, so let's say the investigation of, the uncovering of, the evidence-finding of, and then the breaking apart of an actual thing that happened that was a conspiracy, that was a cover-up. And of course, those things have existed all throughout history and they're existing all over the world right now. There's all sorts of rooms, boardrooms, military rooms, back rooms, all sorts of places where people are going, you know what, if we do this, we get to fuck them over and then we get more shit, right? That's happening, that's conspiracies, right? And that has been proven at high levels throughout time and in history, and I'll look at a couple of examples today, when it was proven eventually that the person that was running the country or the very top executives or the biggest people in the corporation knew that the tobacco companies knew that tobacco caused cancer decades before they admitted it, they covered it up, that was a conspiracy between 10 old white men sitting in a boardroom going, well, apparently it causes cancer. Well, we all knew that, but let's just keep that suppressed for like, oh, how, you know, another 10 years, pay them off 100 million and then we'll get another 10 years out of it and then we'll make another six bill, all right, let's do that. You know, that's an evil conspiracy of a group of people that profited from people's misery, they lied about it, it was covered up, eventually it was found out, the tobacco executives are put up in front of Congress going, did you know it was addictive? And like, nope, certainly didn't, swear blind. All right, well, you're lying, but we can't prove it, so pay heaps of money and don't do it again. Okay, that's fine, right? That's an example of a theory of a conspiracy or what is called in academic circles, a small C conspiracy. It's a conspiracy that happened, it's proven, it may go all the way to the top sometimes, and that's what it is, right? As opposed to what would be called a big C conspiracy. And this is where all of the ones that you love and I love too, fit into. 9-11, chemtrails, Mandela effect, throw them out. What else we got, Shay? I've got a whole list. Just start out the list, what do you got? Yeah, Bill Gates. Bill Gates, Soros. We got satanic networks. Satanic networks. Asteroids. Crystal skulls. Pharmaceutical industries. But it's gotta be bigger than that. We're gonna talk about the weirdest ones. 5G causes autism and- Pedophiles, Nazis, aliens, and reptilian demons. Right, okay, excellent. That's a great way for Shay to start. So, okay, all of those ones, you know, the ones that we would consider to be conspiracies in the modern like bracket of what that means, that's what I'm going to be talking about and critiquing. Because my premise tonight is to tell you just, which is not the best way to go to try and convince someone, but I'm doing it anyway, is that your conspiracy is wrong. It's incorrect, factually, and it cannot be proven. And same with mine. My favorite one, which is probably 9-11, is untrue, can't be proved, and there's no way that we can know that it was an inside job. And people are like going, fuck yeah, I know! And they're gonna be throwing all sorts of evidence about Tower 7 and how this one engineer said that and so on, but we'll get to that later. That's what I want to be chatting to you today because the only reason I want to do this, it's not because I just want to rant about conspiracies, although I do. It's because I see that the line of thinking that gets you to negate science, all governments, all media, all education, and I know that not everyone does that. Those are extreme positions. This coronavirus, all of this panic is just not warranted. I'm telling you, when I tell you, when I've told you that this virus is the common cold, when I said that, it was based on the number of cases. It's also based on the kind of virus this is. Why do you think this is COVID-19? This is the 19th coronavirus. They're not uncommon. But there is a tendency to ignore what is actually Western civilization? Like, what is Western civilization? It is the advent of democracy in Greece. It's the advent of sciences. Critical thinking. Critical thinking. You know, the separation of church and state, so the separation of it happened because a man in the sky said it, to all right, we'll let you just do that over in the Vatican and meanwhile, we need to deal with facts because that's what we're dealing. Science. Science, right? So that, what's my point? That that's important to know. That's it. My point is that if you don't follow this, if you follow a line where you let go. You're gonna be dumb. And if you're dumb, you do dumb things and then smart people do smart things to dumb people and then you gotta pay the price. That's the one. All right, over to you, Shay. So do you wanna do an opening statement on conspiracy theories or just to say hello to everyone? How are you? Where do I even begin? Well, yeah, I don't even know what my role is in the podcast. I'm just gonna act as some weird kind of feedback for James's views and stuff. I mean, I'm fascinated with conspiracy theories because I think that they go to a very root level of our human nature in a way. I think that they're built on some pretty primary mechanisms that we have to survive against the odds and there's a lot of very, let's say, healthy aspects to that kind of intention, but there's also a lot of negative things that come out of that and a lot of problems. And what we're seeing today is this kind of weird proliferation of mass bullshit mechanisms trying to create plausibility for many, many things. So anyway, conspiracies are an interesting topic because I think that they open up a lot of different avenues of perspective and I think that's a great, if nothing else, it's a great place to think and to learn who you are and what your place in the world is. So anyway, for me, at this current time, because we're in the middle of the Corona-Tam, we're just enjoying our own little enforced holiday for the last six weeks now, I think it is. I mean, there's obviously a lot of, there's a lot of things coming out inside of the media that are conspiracy thinking based and that's, I think, a result of a lot of different dynamics that are putting pressure on people right now. Instability about their routines, changes of their conditions, their circumstances, where their money's coming from, how they relate to people, what the future means, if they can even rely on the fact that they once knew what the past was, is that gonna mean that that's gonna be some semblance of a future? So this is kind of disorientating to a lot of people and I think that that leaves people in a position where they're vulnerable to taking on new ways of understanding uncomfortable situations. That's, we were just talking about this before we started recording, like I was theorizing that modern conspiracy thinking comes out of the 60s, this is my opinion, is that prior to the 1960s, pretty much everyone in every country believed their government, right? Like, you think back to like war era, Second World War or First World War era, America or Britain or Germany or any of those countries, people would get their news by newspapers or by going to the cinema and watching the newsreel where they're like, oh, oh, courageous boys have just beaten the Germans back and it'll be three months, they'll be home for Christmas and people are like, oh, great, Susie, yay. You know, it's like what the government said was true. You didn't really question whether or not they would lie to you. Like, that was not a question except for small fringe groups. So there was, you know, the anarchists or the Communist Party or, you know, there would be some fringe groups that would say, man, the government's lying to you and the best way to do it is like the Soviet Union or so on. But they were very marginal groups except for when by course of history, they suddenly became in power like the Bolsheviks in Russia, for example. But the average person had no, they would be left-leaning or right-leaning-ish, but they believed the government in general and if they didn't like their president, they still didn't think that that person was like going to destroy the planet and was gonna be the absolute antithesis to everything they believed, they'd be like, I wish he was a bit more left or a bit more right. But, you know, overall people believed the government. That all shifted and changed in the 60s due to a number of events where I think, especially in America, and there was Gough Whitlam in Australia, that the American population saw for the first time that they're proof that their governments were lying to them. A series of events, the assassinations of the Kennedys, of Martin Luther King, Watergate, the Vietnam War where, for the first time ever, a war was televised. And previously, in the Great War, there was just a grainy photo of men standing on their horses. Meanwhile, carnage surrounding them that the average person back home couldn't really wrap their head around. Oh, you know, Johnny's gone to war. Yeah, Johnny's gone to live in a trench for four years to fucking choke on mustard gas whilst bayonetting people every day in a futile attempt to take 100 yards and 100,000 men died over three years as they fought backwards and forwards for that one shitty bit of land. That's what the war was. And meanwhile, back home, God for king and country. For the first time ever, the Americans got to see, you know what a war looks like? It looks like GIs burning villages. It looks like a child running naked, burning from napalm. It looks like executions in the street. It looks like forced disappearances. It looks like all the horror of war. And we lied about why we're here. And we're lying to you all the time and it keeps coming out. And so I think in that period, initially the counterculture, the hippies, the lefties, the black power, the feminists, you know, the ecologists, all these people started to see through and go, fuck, they are lying to us on so many levels. And then, and that entered into the public consciousness to these days where I think, unless you're like a real hardcore liberal or hardcore Republican or, you know, a card carrying Trumpist or card carrying Clinton or whatever supporter, where you just like, no matter what, they're right, which is getting bigger. I think those followers of populist leaders where they just like, doesn't matter what he does, he's right or she's right. But I think most people now who give any kind of shit, who are political in any sense, in the sense that they think about it or talk about it, because a lot of people don't. A lot of people are completely apolitical. They don't care as long as there's food on the table and as long as the world is moving and working. They don't care who's in power and they don't care about the politics. And I don't even think those people are sheeple more than the person that's analyzing it all the time. There's a large conscious belief now that the government or aspects of control structures are now no longer telling you truth, which is evidently true. You can just pick out just from a week ago, probably, or from a month ago, you could find enough evidence that each government is doing things which include lies on multiple layers. And some governments seem to lie a lot more. Some governments seem to lie a lot less. Some of them have better suppression controls. Some of them are much more open, but there's a general feeling we can't necessarily trust authority, which I think is good because that meant that the Vietnam War eventually ended because there was real activism that came out of that. It took 10 years of students on the street chanting. And that's one thing, just as a segue, one thing I think Jordan Peterson is completely wrong about. He's often said when a young student's like, we should change it, he's like, you're too young to know anything. You're a university. You're not even allowed to be political because you haven't developed your political muscles yet. But it was students that ran revolutions. It was students that overthrew governments. It's students that have actually made real change. So there was activism directed at a specific thing, which was the way that America did war at that time had to be questioned for the first time. And it did eventually change the course of the war, even though the military and the government fought hard against public opinion and tried to say that anyone who was against the war was a filthy, dirty commie and discredit people and cover up the Malay Massacre, which was only one of hundreds of similar types of massacres. And then the truth came out and the Vietnam War was vilified for a generation. Nobody wanted, nobody cheered for those heroes. Nobody wanted to be around them. The truth of what the Vietnam War and all its horror came out, the conspiracies were unravelled and now we know what the Vietnam War was. However, you can know and then you can forget again, right? Because now there's revisionist history happening where on the 50th anniversary of the Vietnam War, what is the present doesn't matter if it's Obama or Trump or whoever, they're like our brave soldiers. That was an imperialist war. You went in and murdered a million people and you'd lost, and you lost the war and you lost 50,000 of your own people. And then, and now you're going to say that, and now you're going to rewrite history to be like, uh, that was, you know, heroic time, right? When it was, when it was clearly one of the most bungled and awful wars of many others that have happened in history. Right? So I think now we're at a time where people do question, which is awesome, but the biggest mistake I feel is that questioning starts moving to a singularity point. And this is something you and I've seen a lot when we, when we, when we follow the conspiracy to the end, because I don't think a lot of people do, right? Like they're like, ah, uh, like it happened on the MMC group the other day, right? Someone put up one of those posters, you know, how there was like a global concert, you know, the Rolling Stones and a bunch of people like stay, stay home and stay home and well connected. And it was called something, something global citizen. And one of the guys in our group writes, uh-huh. Global citizen, huh? They're just prepping us, prepping us to be, um, you know, good global slaves. And then, and I went, stop, right? Let's unpack that. Let's unpack it. Because, because right, what he did was he just like, ah, global, I've heard global, one world government, global. Okay. That's, that's a word that's combined with total authoritarian power. Global citizen. Huh, huh. That feels like in my, or I, I, I, I can see the logic there that they're really just trying to tell you we're all part of the global, you're all just global citizens. Eventually you'll be part of one global and, and you know, the Rolling Stones will be playing there as we fucking garage you, you know, that's the implication of what he's saying. And I'm like, okay, follow that theory through right to the end. If you're going to throw that out there, oh yeah, the government, yeah, the government something. All right, cool. How far does that go? So what you're saying is that Rolling Stones, everyone else is involved in this, they, they made a poster and they're so smart with their propaganda that they wrote global citizen and, and that hypnotizes what the Chinese, who for the last 5,000 years have identified themselves as Chinese, Zhong Guo, center of the fucking universe, uh, and the Americans who have God bless America. We are Americans. Like you're going to convince them with a pop, pop music that they're not Chinese anymore, that they're part of a global mass. And you're so smart that the Illuminati like slipped that little, little symbol in there and you're the one who went, uh-huh, check, see, I get another, I get another truth of point. I get another smug, I know what's going on point. Well, okay. Follow it. You know, follow that right through. You actually have an understanding of humans and see how absurd it is as you get closer to the, to the, to your singularity point, which is an ideology. So I'll throw it over to you now. Well, I guess a lot to unpack about from that. I mean, I think that there's always been conspiracies happening. There's always been tussles for power and there's always been different ways that people view that. And I guess, I mean, uh, maybe you could say that like the 1960s was a time where there was a popular archetype of activism. There was a popular archetype of counterculture. Maybe that's where the big kind of push came out of that. But maybe that's also a sort of a, a, a time when, um, you know, there was a, like a popular culture that was really starting to emerge that in some sense started to show the semblance of power. Cause maybe before that, like you say, for example, in the fifties, that was more just like, let's just be materialists and like accumulate stuff and just be like good normal people because we're still recovering from whatever the horror was that happened previous to that, uh, which was, you know, decades of world wars and problems and depressions and stuff. And then before that, you're getting back into, you know, very early industrial, almost pre-industrial stuff. And as you're going on back to like, you know, simple lifestyles, agricultural living, people were very, um, isolated into small groups. So the level of need for sophisticated worldviews was not really that appropriate, but I'm sure there's always been like, you know, Sun Tzu's out there meditating on like, uh, you know, the level of an emperor and trying to think about how do you be like the best general to overtake a giant, um, empire or something. Well, the great game, you know, you look like the, that known as the great game was like the, the, these strategic chess games between imperial powers, which were always Kings essentially. And they would, they would either be absolute Monarchs or they would have a government that kept them in check or they would have the Pope that kept them in check. But right. But it was always an absolute Monarch of some sort that was basically playing a chess game, usually against his own cousin because they're all, they're all interbred over centuries. So, you know, the Tsar of Russia was, you know, Napoleon versus the Dutch King versus whoever, right. And, you know, and then just vying for essentially resource control and, and land. And then that led to the great age of exploration, exploration from the 15th to the 17th century where they sent out in their wooden ships to try to go and steal as much of the rest of the planet as they could in this like race against time against each other. And but it even, but then it became like in, cause Africa was like the last piece that was really carved up. But it got to the point where they sat down and just did it in a boardroom. Like you know, Belgium was at the meeting of Berlin, it was the Berlin, can you look that up? 1901 Berlin meeting of Berlin or whatever it's called, where the Kings, the Kings of Europe sat down and carved up Africa and went, all right. Leopold, you can, he's like, I'd like the Belgian Congo, thank you very much, personally for me. And they're like, oh, Leopold, well, no one gives a shit, okay, off to the Belgians. Anyone want to know what Leopold did when he took the Belgian Congo? Look it up. It's not a fun ride. Basically, he murdered 10 million people, Indians, and then forced them to enslave labor to collect rubber back when rubber was only made by trees. And if you didn't reach your quota, you would come back and you would find the foot of your child severed and put it at your hut. No warning, no nothing, it was just like, you didn't come back with the right amount of rubber that day, there's the limb of your child. And this guy is as bad as Pol Pot, Hitler, Stalin, whatever, no one remembers him. Just remember him, Leopold of Belgium, one of the greatest cunts of all time. What was I talking about? I was talking about the tendency for conspiracies to happen over history and power games and things like that. That's what I was talking about. So yeah, and in amongst all that, there's always been, there has been false flags, there's been all sorts of nasty germ warfare, when the Americans settled, the settlers settled North America, South America, giving blankets with bubonic plague fleas example, that's a high level conspiracy or the conspiracy to shoot all of the buffalo to starve the Indians or whatever. There's been those kinds of conspiracies in terms of whoever was in power at a general level, at a government level, at a global level, to a king level, including the Pope or whatever, right down to the local tax collector who's conspiring with the other guy to squeeze people for a bit more. Of course, I would never question anyone who thinks that everything runs well and that the world is fair and that the facts of everything are kind of just out there. They're living in a delusion, for sure. And that would be nice. Well, I think that there's, you know, my point is that that's always been happening. There's always been threats to our survival and some of those threats have been conspiratorial, whether it be small groups of other people working against us or even just be groups of predatory animals working against us. There's always been something with intelligent survival skills working against our intelligent survival skills to try to get stuff. So I think that is a context of part of the human condition. Like paranoia, like a biological reason for paranoia? Not even paranoia as much as I think that it's important to just, first of all, validate the fact that we do have a context of existence where power plays and conspiracies are an intrinsic part of the conditions of where we're coming from. So that's a healthy thing. And that's, I think that's also something to keep in mind. And I also understand, but like keep in mind when people get negatively reactionary to anybody who has some paranoid thinking. So that's the other side of it too, where people get, let's say, overreactively negative towards paranoid thinking. Now I get it that paranoid thinking is something that needs to be checked with logical thinking, you know, with grounded facts, with understanding like what's going on. But that doesn't necessarily mean that paranoid thinking is a hundred percent bad. So the problem is that people take, you know, the tendency to want to look for those predators in the dark, to look for the unknowns, you know, the moving parts that are working against them. And you know, people judge them for that, you know, that's crazy, that's not real, etc. But what we're seeing, I think over time is there is definitely an accumulation of evidence to say that there is lots of that that's happened in time. And also, which is a kind of a cool point to sort of what you're talking about as well, we've, we've accumulated a ton of information over the last centuries that we now stockpile into the internet and we can access, and we haven't really had mass access to huge amounts of information previous to a few decades ago, you know, maybe a decade-ish, two decades, you know, and even then it's still picking up momentum, right? So we're still spreading the worldwide web. But what that also means is that previous to that period of time, it was very much a more mythological understanding of conspiracy theories. You might hear bits and pieces of stuff and there might be some conspiracies that get spread around, but it's not like you can look it up on the internet and find like the actual streams of data, of evidence, of all that kind of stuff. So we're in a slightly different period. In some ways, I would say we're kind of like, you know, early stage teenagers just trying to work out our actual position in the world and the internet's kind of affecting us with that. And part of that shift is we've moved from like a broadcast media platform to more of like this... Op-ed, decentralized. Decentralized, like everything, everyone's a broadcaster. But of course, there's still big players within that and there's also people that know how to play the media game too. So they're like, they're playing certain angles. Some people are just intuitively good at doing that and they get an edge on other people and some people invest huge amounts of time and energy to conspire, to get their ideas into people's heads for whatever purpose, you know, for positive and for negative purposes. Yeah. And like, let's have a little look at that. Like, cause when we talk about media manipulation, a conspiracy, a big C conspiracy theorist would say that all mainstream media is lying to you, right? And so what they would define as mainstream media will be different depending on what the ideal ideological position is, right?
