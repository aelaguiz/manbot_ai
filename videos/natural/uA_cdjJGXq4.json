Like, I'm looking for my purpose and mission and also for more confidence and what it means to be a man. And I think this is the right type of workshop combining many things, meditation, masculinity, purpose, body, movement. So that's why I'm here. So this, yeah, this is also coming out of my comfort zone, to know I'm going to spend a whole week with a group of dudes. But in that has been some magic. There's one thing that's united all of us, and that's our quest to be the best man we can be. Every single session you can take into the next one, and it just all builds. And it creates for me this sense of freedom, of looseness, just mentally and physically. I was extremely surprised that yesterday when we had the session with Shea, how impactful that was on me. And I did not expect that to happen. And especially not on day two. The mentors here so far, everything they've said and spoken about or handed out or conversations I've had with them, has been not just new, but also kind of a reconnection by making those experiences myself. Because I've been aware, but I've never been able to have some sort of process or technology to even break it down and release it and just get it out, which is why I'm here."}
