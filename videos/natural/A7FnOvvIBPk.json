That's your Instagram. My Instagram. Hi, you guys are there, cool. What's this? Lockdown crew. Lockdown crew. That's a special hand sign. You know the lockdown crew hand sign. Yeah, Alex knows that one too. Who's these guys? That's the whole YouTube crew. That's the whole YouTube, okay. And we're on, right? And we're on, let's do it. Okay, do you wanna just come say hi to everyone? Firstly, can we just have a, you know, shout out to Alex and Leon, who's been locked. He's been locked here with me for months. Probably the last time you seen me in a Kinta lockdown livestream. Right, he's leaving. My mission is done. Yeah, he's like, can you stay here? My mission is to leave. Yes, you can go now. Yes, now we will ship in the next generation here, which will be much less productive, but possibly be more fun. So yeah, Alex and I have been working on this product launch and a bunch of other stuff, pivoting the entire T&L company for a couple of months now. And he's been doing an insane job working around the clock. I know you guys as well. And yeah, he's heading off to Vienna. Yeah, yeah, to see my parents. Cause that's good. Yeah, it's important. And then work maybe on my shit. Oh yeah, definitely. Gonna see mom and lock myself in another office and work on my upcoming shit. I don't know yet what it is exactly, but. Okay, I can already see it now. That looks like it's way too bright on my forehead. No, it looks great on this one. Does it? Yes, as always. All right, fine. Cool, all right. You are dismissed. You made it to Vienna, thank you. Cool, all right, gents. And possibly three women who found their way here. I don't know how. How are you doing? You guys over here, I'll probably be referring mainly to YouTube. So don't feel offended by my profile. I'll glance at you from time to time, but I'm not gonna do that for very long. Otherwise, this live stream is gonna get surreal. Cool, all right. So there's a bunch, I've never done a YouTube live stream before. So I'm just, people are saying stuff. There's a bunch of questions to have questions answered. All right, I'll get into that in a minute. So firstly, a couple of things. My Lifestyle Design Academy opened for enrollments three days ago. And the response has been incredible. Like we weren't sure if people were gonna sign up because we thought maybe the world's population is being very conservative with their investments at the moment. But a large number of you guys have decided to join me for the next four months as we fucking wrestle our way out of this corona mess and out into the sun and then rebuild and forge ahead with insanely amazing life. So thank you for all the men that took the, and one woman, I think, who have taken the chance to join me. And I look forward to starting with you guys next Tuesday, is the first lecture, correct? Yeah, next Tuesday. And after that, every Sunday, but we're just doing it on Tuesday because the launch goes to the weekend. So thank you. Secondly, in one of my recent live streams, I made an appeal to you guys to share, share my shit, hashtag share my shit. Basically saying, look at this channel, it's good. We say good stuff. It helps people. Doesn't get enough views. Share it around. And a bunch of people did, but also one guy pointed it out quite rightly. He said, James, I would love to, I'm paraphrasing, I would love to share your shit, hashtag, but you seem to not be able to do a single video without mentioning extreme BDSM, swearing every sentence and showing photos of girls spreading pussies. So how do you expect me to share that to my workmates? And my answer to that is, maybe move to a new office and just swear that kind of thing is cool. All right, I get it. I get it. What I think I might do is I might actually ask one of my crew to watch through the last 10 videos and see if there is a single video where just by accident, I didn't mention BDSM, didn't mention anal sex, didn't swear all the time. And now I've mentioned all those things now. So this video is ruined, so I fucked it again. Haven't I? Fuck shit, can't fuck BDSM, tie them up and smack them. Maybe not. All right, maybe it's just gonna be you guys. Fine. If you have a social circle where that kind of thing is okay, and maybe you don't have to agree, you can say, check out this weirdo. Check this BDSM psycho. Anyway, up to you. All right, what's the point of this live stream? I'm gonna answer a bunch of questions. So if anyone has a question, maybe post them now, because even if you posted them right at the beginning, you know me, I'm a boomer, and it's gonna be hard for me to figure it all out. So, Rob, just bought the course, so fucking excited. Yeah. I wanted to say the how I got rich video, but the title and thumbnail made it kind of hard, yeah. Okay, there's a question here. I'm considering the course, just wanna know some things, blah, blah. Will you, James, coach us personally if bought the cheapest package? Yes, yes. So there's three tiers of packages. I can't remember what we call them. The first one, the second one, and the third one. The elite one is where you get private calls with me as well, so you get on a call with me, and I will speak only to you. The middle one is the full 12-month program, and the beginner or the foundations course is the first eight weeks. And those first eight weeks are taught by myself. So yes, there's no level of this course where, I don't know, like Pedro teaches it, or even Alex, which he would be totally capable of doing. It's all taught by me. It just means that for the first year, you get the first eight weeks, which is the most intense, like intensive course where I pack in all of the initial theory and show you how to basically dissect your current life, dissect your current life, and create plans for building an excellent social circle. So I give you all the stuff on leverage, on seductive economy, on confrontation, on boundary setting, on charm. There's a huge amount in there. So yes, you get access to me for those eight weeks. What do I feel, what do I think about fake gurus like Tai Lopez, Dan Lok, Gary Vee? Oh, hey, I don't think Gary Vee and Tai Lopez are in the same category. I don't know who Dan Lok is, but I can imagine. Tai Lopez, yes, we all know who Tai Lopez is. Well, what do I think about Tai Lopez? I think that he is a marketer who understood that if you pumped enough money in to advertising and just buried the internet in your ads and offered some kind of get rich quick thing, which is, I'm pretty sure basically teaches you how to do exactly the same thing that he did, which is bombard YouTube with ad revenue. So what do I think about that? I'm like, I don't know, it's just more of that bullshit kind of selling, selling, selling. Gary Vee, on the other hand, I think is a very different character. He is a proven businessman. So he, because he, what I look at, whenever I'm looking at a marketer or a business coach, which I don't do that often, but I do do sometimes, I'm looking at, did they run a business that wasn't a business about how to teach people to have business, right? So did they have a real bricks and mortar or service or some kind of actual business that they had to build? And have they been consultants on other businesses that are not exactly the same as their business, right? So if that's the case, like, you know, Gary Vee came from his background in wine selling online and he's moved into many different businesses and he has a lot of great information as far as I'm concerned. He's just, I mean, he's really over the top. He's a very different energy to me, but I don't see anything wrong with checking out Gary Vee stuff. I think he's good. Tai Lopez, also shit. I mean, he's like, I hate him. Who do you hate? I hate him. Have I heard about the Three Three Secret channel? No, but whatever that is, I'll check that out later. Doing an interview with Andrew Tate, no idea who that is. I'll check him out. Okay, this is a good question. What if you are not comfy? Which is a great word, isn't it? Comfy. Do Americans say comfy? I don't think so. I think it's a British and American thing mainly. Hang on, stop asking questions so much. We've got to go back to where I'm good. I can't just do my tangents, obviously. All right. What if you're not comfy with more than three people? Well, Corona's good for you, right? You're like, I don't do social circles, social experiences more than three people. Is it still helpful? I function best in one-on-one. Okay, cool. You know what? I function best one-on-one, absolutely. Shay Matthews functions best one-on-one. Other people I know, like Gareth Jones or Liam or Jess or a number of other extroverted people function best in groups. And that's not to say that they can't hang out one-on-one and I can't deal with a group. You know I can deal with a group. Oh shit, there's a group here. There's more than three of you. We're going to have to switch some of this off. So I can handle groups. I can stand up in front of a fucking room talk about BDSM, yeah, BDSM. Tell you what, today one thing my marketer told me, he's like, anti-marketing marketing is great. I was like, what? Is that a thing? He's like, oh yeah, that's a thing, anti-marketing. He's like, the bit where you impersonated me as the marketer and put me as like the third party that you were like fighting against the marketing man. That was great marketing. Whoa, okay, cool. Now you're on it. Now I've revealed my secret that I'm an anti-marketer. Maybe just forget that last bit. So basically what I'm saying is that you don't need to be able to entertain groups, right? That is a skill. It's a thing that is valuable in some circumstances but you can be an excellent lifestyle designer by working mainly one-on-one, okay? I would say you cannot just only ever work one-on-one. Yeah, I don't think that's gonna work that well because it's not time efficient but you can certainly work with smaller groups. I would be looking at it like that. So as I've said numerous times before, the average, not the average but the excellent lifestyle design crew is usually around five to 10 men plus one or two girls maybe if you like. And it's not 30 dudes. It's not like a huge entourage. It's a handful of guys that are working together on something. And keep in mind that the idea with a good lifestyle design crew is that all of you increase in confidence, wealth, contacts, sexual abundance, and so on. Not necessarily the same place but you're all moving together. And what that means is that a bunch of dorks can become a bunch of cool guys. Right? Like if you look at each one of us, were you cool in high school, Alex? No. And he was at a boy's school. So that's like, he wasn't even cool at a boy's school. Myself and Liam and everyone in this crew, I don't think anyone was cool. Was anyone cool? Tony Sala was probably cool. Maybe Tony. Yeah. None of us were cool. We were all nerds, dorks. I played the flute. I sang opera. Liam was a weird tread metal dude. Alex was always interested in spreadsheets and setting up businesses when he was six years old. Is that right? Or is that an exaggeration? It is true. What was it? Nine years old. Nine years old. Popcorn and I had a local market. Wow. Local stand and poster and shit. Wow. He had his own lemonade popcorn stand at nine years old. No wonder he's such a good entrepreneur. What are you doing with that? So yeah, you need to handle groups. Small groups. Okay. I like this question that will make me tell you something. Can you teach me how to get the most out of life for free? No, I fucking can't because nothing is free. You must understand this. This is a weird thing about the age of entitlement. And if you're joking and you're trolling, that's all right. Just let me assume that you're being serious so I can have a rant. He's like, I was joking. It was lost. The nuance was lost in text, my friend. And now I must rant at you. No, there is nothing. There are no free lunches at all. Nothing's fucking free. And it's so weird. Now I'm in a position of influence or whatever that people want my time, want my advice. And very, very commonly they ask for shit for free. And you got to ask yourself, why would I do that? Why would any person in influence who's busy or has a valuable skillset or whatever, why would they be helping you out for no reason at all? And you might be like, because charity, because nice, because not. No, absolutely not. You have to offer something. You either have to buy your way in. And I bought my way into social circles and I bought my, like I went to see Ido Portal. I didn't go, I didn't like contact his PA and say, oh, hey, like I'd like to meet up with the Ido Portal because I'm a cool dude and he's cool. And I'd like to hang out with him sometime for free. I paid $7,000 to go and spend seven days in Thailand getting my ass kicked and my ass kicked. And then that was, you know, and then I talked to him a few times and I'll do that a bunch of other times. And maybe one day, maybe I'll be part of his social world, but probably not because I'm not fucking strong enough. But the point is like, if I want to meet someone who's influential, I'll pay them or I will do them a favor, right? And this is what the seductive economy is about. It's about how to trade on non-financial currencies mainly. Money is involved on some levels and you will need to understand how to use whatever financial resources you have. But mostly when it comes to forming bonds of trust and friendship and respect and loyalty, that comes from the trade of non-financial currencies. I want to give you an example, but I would have to scroll. I can't touch my phone. Can I like? What do you want to say? Just something that one of my students sent me today. Okay. No, actually, hang on. I can open WhatsApp here. Cause I want to give you guys an example today of an old client of mine who had a chat and then he did what I would say is an extremely good seductive economy move on me and it worked. And I don't think he was thinking about, I hope he was thinking about it in those terms. So basically this is a guy who I've taught on the sex class and I hope you're on man. I'm going to call you Ben because that's not your name. So he came to the sex class with me and it was so funny because he was like the most kind of vanilla guy of the crew of the students. And he was the guy that when we first introduced the BDSM spanking and flogging classes, he was like, is this okay to do? Do we do this because girls just put up with it and we're doing it because we want to do it? while to really, really accept that we're doing this because we want to and because women, if they like this kind of stuff, really like this kind of stuff and they need it. And so once he got that, once he got that mental switch, he became an absolute demon. Sent me a bunch of blurred faced pics of women tied up and all sorts of stuff. But anyway, today he sent me a message out of the blue, just saying, with a video and saying, hi, you know, I've been thinking of you. I know your business hasn't been going so well. I just wanted to check in on you. And then his frontline worker in the NHS in England. And he mentioned in passing, he's like, you know, I actually even got Corona, but I'm fine now. Like just in passing, just like I got Corona, I'm over it and now I'm back on running away, driving the ambulance, which is what he does. One of the things he does. So firstly, he gave me good emotions. He remembered me in a way that a lot of clients maybe don't. You know, he wasn't just looking at me only as a teacher, he was looking at me as a human being. And then he said, we had a bit of a chat and then he sent me a video of him flying a helicopter. Yes, and he said, if you're ever in London, I'll take you on a helicopter ride. And I'm like, yes, yes, Ben. I've never been in a helicopter. So I will absolutely go in a helicopter with you. And that's a seductive economy deal. He offers me something I'm interested in, but there's a real human element in that. I like this guy a lot. I wouldn't, there's no way I would go if I thought he was a dickhead. I wouldn't do that just to get the helicopter ride. I'm not that kind of gold digger. But because we have a good connection, we like each other, we've had mutual respect, and then he offers me something and I take him up on that, that's a guy that I'm gonna remember, right? That's a guy that I've got his back. So that's what I mean when you can't get shit for free. All right, next. I guess this is gonna be a Q&A webinar, huh guys? Looks like it. Okay, James, thank you for your time. I will buy your course. If you answer this, all right, that's a good deal so far. I'm working on a cam-slat-only fans business, and I wanna relocate to Spain slash Eastern Europe. Possible question mark, what do you think? TNL rocks. And this is, I know you, man, you've been around for a long time. Okay, hmm, you wanna answer that question, Alex? Well, is it possible? Alex will give you a better answer. Yeah, come on, pull up a chair. It's to relocate to Spain. So it's a cam business, so run a campsite. Well, he's asking, is that a possible thing? Totally possible, because especially now, I mean, that's literally what I was thinking about the last two years of setting up. It's not the best business move. Like if you do it for money, it's not the best move. If you maybe sleazily think, if I'm the boss of a campsite, and then all the girls are around it, I can fuck them. Also, maybe not the best move, but. Yeah, what's the point of doing this then? It will get you. It's the same like running a model agency, maybe having a club. There's a lot of guys I think learned, what I learned in the last year is they think, once I have a system like that, I will automatically get laid, which is partly true if your team is good. The reason I think a lot of guys just have really bad game, including five years ago, is because they don't spend any time with women at all. You know, like guys who maybe work at a clothing shop, they're naturally better with women because they're around women eight hours a day, when a guy who works in an office is around women two minutes a day. And if you add that up over a year, that's an insane difference. So I don't know what your motivation is in setting up a camera only fan business. It's definitely a fun business, but it comes with, how do you say, caveats as well? You would be around hot women, which gets you insane insight into insane worlds because those kind of girls see shit that you wouldn't believe. No, you can't, you cannot believe. Like the thing is, it's enough. What we know now, we know way too much. But yeah, I mean, I don't know what kind of guy you are. It's definitely possible. It's fun, it's exciting. You would hang out around crazy girls, but obviously it would fuck you up a little bit because you realize what a fucked up place the world is. And it might even fuck up some relationships you have, because I'm in this world now a bit, or not a bit, I'm in this world a lot, and it fucks up other relationships because a lot of people just cannot handle the fact that I'm around hot girls that are very sexually open right now, and they push me out of their life. So possible, yes, but fun. I mean, if you're 25, then sure. Yeah. Yeah, so like we've been experimenting with not cam girls or anything, but like, I mean, we know a lot of cam girls, but we've been experimenting with creating these leverage points where women are part of the scene. So by setting up our modeling agency and lots of other things, which I'll talk, I will tell people more about that on the Academy, but it's not really stuff we can publicly talk about. Yes, possible, probably won't make you rich. And you gotta remember, like, I don't know what you're thinking, but like, are you gonna be like having a house where all the girls are in there doing cams? Are you going to be taking a percentage of them? Are you able to invest, as James said, are you able to set up a house with eight rooms, pay all pro-cam equipment, whatever, 4K cameras, good computers? Because I finally, the last Tinder date, I haven't used Tinder in two years, and then I installed it and I super liked the girl, it was really cute, cute pictures, and she matched me and she came over. Yeah, she's a really beautiful girl, really cute, like, look at her, like, innocent, nice, lovely. And I was like, oh, that's good, you know, I've been around a lot of, like, OnlyFans kind of girls a lot, and it's good to have a little bit of a nice, sweet girl again. And so we get along well, and we're hooking up, and she tells me, yeah, like, she's 19, and she's like, last year I was running my own webcam studio. So she was the pimp of all the other girls? Yeah, she told the girls about a fictionary boss, because she knew if she would say, I'm the boss, they wouldn't respect her. So she was like, oh, the boss is coming, and suddenly he never came, because he doesn't exist. So the only Tinder date I had in two years was a webcam studio owner, and I was like, oh, shit, I guess I'm doomed to attract those kinds of girls. You are totally infected by the underbelly. All right, cool, there you go. It can be done, not gonna be easy, but- Send me the link when it's up. Yeah, you know. Give us a shout out when it's up. All right, yeah, well, definitely this one's safe for work as it goes, all right? Okay, I'm gonna try and get, go through some a bit faster. What happened in Kiev, and do you like Serbia, Bulgaria, or Prague? Nah, let's not talk about that. What happened, nothing. What happened in Kiev was that we went there, and we set up a fucking cool life, and then corona happened, and we had to leave. So we'll be back. Do I like Serbia? I have a lot of emotions about Serbia, yes, I do. James, what do you mean by social retirement? Okay, that is what I wanted to talk to you guys about. That was my impromptu little lecture, so I will get back to that in a minute. I'm just gonna try and answer. Now, someone, when Alex was talking, something popped up that I thought was interesting. Hey, I was on a Facebook Live with Tyler from RSD, and mentioned the possibility of you doing a podcast together. He said you have him on WhatsApp, and just hit him up any time. Actually, Tyler wrote to me the other day, and said that he congratulated me on the launch. He's been really nice. Cool, all right, fuck it, yeah, I'm gonna do it. I mean, I would totally do that. I just assumed, because I've been told that RSD only does in-house, that he wouldn't, but maybe make an exception, and it's a weird time. So all right, I'll text him. After this, so hopefully, that'll be a very interesting conversation, huh? Yeah. Yeah. We're gonna get like 12 letters, right? Yeah, yeah, just to rant, rant, rant. We just settle in with like power shakes, and fucking intravenous vitamin B, and go for it. Okay. If anyone is interested in crypto, check. Is someone trying to fucking sell shitty crypto stuff here? Dude, fuck off. Spam, get out of here. Actually, hmm, maybe that's a good deal. What is mojo? Well, I mean, what does it mean? I mean, mojo means your fucking vitality, your sex drive, your aliveness, I would say. Like, yeah, that's how I see it. Okay. Slow down, everyone. Is it possible to pick up a coffee bartender? I think they're called a barista. Or are they usually just being friendly? Yes, it's totally possible to pick up a girl working, right? So that's what we're talking about. And yeah, okay, so especially in America, they're paid to be friendly, they have to be friendly. So it's not that because she's being friendly, it means that she likes you. But also, you've just got to remember, a girl working behind a bar or in a coffee shop or in a dress shop is a normal girl who has a job, and that's her job. So it's not like there's some special type of female that you need to approach very differently. What you do need to do is you need to acknowledge what's going on in the environment, right? So if you try to go in heavy direct on a girl who's working, it usually won't work very well because even if she likes the directness, she's concerned about people watching, right? So if her boss is there or customers are there, and I go up and I, hey, I saw you working, but you're fucking hot, can I have your number? She's probably gonna say no, even if she wanted to say yes. So I have to calibrate it. And that could be simple. It can be like, as she comes over and she says, anything else? Yes, there was one other thing that I wanted. I know you're working, but I would love to take your number. Okay, so that would be cool. The I know you're working is your pre-frame. And I have done that number of times when I pick up girls who hide guns, and we do that all the time in workshops. We always send guys into a shop where there's a girl working usually by herself or with another coworker and get them to try it because it's one of those things that it's on the bucket list of limiting beliefs. Yeah, like a girl riding a bike, how can I approach her? Standing from the bike and go, stop! Getting in a lift, how can I approach someone in a lift? Get in a lift and say, this is awkward, everyone, but I just filed it. No, I'm sorry. That's the social framework. This is awkward, everyone, but you're so cute. I'll get your number by the time we get to the fifth floor. Could be done. Like, why not fucking try it? I was talking to my French girlfriend years ago. She was in Paris. She called me from a phone booth back when that was still a thing. This was 10 years ago. And as we're talking, she's in a phone booth. And then I hear this clunk, clang, bang, clang, clang. It's a double shot, boom, boom. It's a double shot, boom, boom. Show them the legend. I'm like, did a guy just push into the, sorry, I just had a pubic hair in my mouth. Did a guy just push into the phone booth and ask you for his number? And she said, oh yes, like, of course. I was like, whoa, French dudes, fuck yeah. Anyway, so the point being is that yes, you can. You just need to read the scenario, use an appropriate pre-frame, and then give it a shot. Why the fuck not? Can we get recordings of the LDA? So if, what you mean by that is, can I just give them to you for free? The answer is no. What you mean by that is, once I do the lecture, because as I said, I'm doing live lectures every week, do we get recordings? Yes, within 24 hours of the live recording, the live lecture, the recording will be up on the website, so it will be there forever. So yes, everything that I record, all the technical lectures, all the Q&As, everything will be put back onto the website, so you'll have them forever, as long as there's internet. I can offer you my editing skills for free about half year, to be with TNL for one month, recording stuff like bookshops. You're in the right area, man. So it's like, okay, if anyone has an offer, and this is not just about me, right? This is about approaching mentors or approaching people that you, business owners or creative people, people who are in a higher tier of social or business or whatever influence than you are, and you'd be able to do that. So if you're in a higher tier of social or business or whatever influence than you are, and you'd like to work for them or join their team or whatever, that's the general idea, right? It's like, offer something, find out what is it that the person needs or wants, and see if you can offer that to them. And it can be simple stuff. It can be a cup of coffee at 10 a.m. It can be a shoulder to cry on and someone to talk to. It can be, often, like the way that guys got into our crew was by being interns. This guy over here, Alex was originally an intern, and he was doing a better job than I asked him to do, and was cool and fun to hang around with. And he was humble, but not needy or freaking weird about it. He was just like, all right, I'm me, here I am. I'm young, I'm learning, and I'm willing to help do whatever it takes to be part of this crew. And very quickly, that became clear that, yep, that's the guy. Same with another intern I've got at the moment, Stefan, who became my personal assistant. He came in when we were in London. We put a thing up on Facebook. Hey, we need someone to help us run around and do shopping and laundry and stuff while we're in London. He's like, fuck it, I'll do that. So he came over, ran errands for us for a few days when we were in London. And then we were like, oh, actually, we need a guy like that to come with us on tour. Fuck, what a cool offer. And we're like, oh, we need a guy to come with us on tour. And now I'm thinking about it. I'm like, wow, that must have been awesome when he heard that. So we're like, hey, man, do you want to come on tour with us? And he's like, oh, yes. And he got a permanent job out of that, and now he looks after my lizard full time. What happened with Travel Bum Diddy? Not passed one of James' trustworthiness tests? In short, yes. If I shut down T&L, what will happen next? You mean like to the time-space fabric? I don't think we will shut down T&L. I know I was talking about doomsday stuff. We are in a situation where if we can't run workshops, then we will have to go into some kind of dormancy. So it's been awesome that this product launch has gone very well. It will create enough income for us to keep going for some months. And that's fantastic. I'm really-"}
