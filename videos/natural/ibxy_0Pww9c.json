They have one social circle, and then they have several outlier friends. Without some kind of inherent privilege that gets you ahead of the curve, brutal reality is that you, as dudes, you're a bunch of dudes, of all quality of dude, are more or less useless to a high-value social circle. I reassess my social world regularly. I check in on it. It's not that I'm like ruthlessly like, this person is of no use to me now, out. Looked like I'd practiced that too much, isn't it? No, it's more that, okay, cool, what kind of people do I wanna bring into my social world? Is this partnership, in terms of these collaborations, still relevant, or do we need to let each other go off on our own tangents? Because I'm planning all of this, all the time. I'm not doing it in a Machiavellian way, where I'm simply thinking of people as utilities, but I'm certainly looking at them as partners, as tribal members. What is it that we can get from each other? What can we combine our forces to achieve that we can't achieve alone? Because the unfortunate thing is that without a strategy, without high levels of charm and confidence and a seductive ability, or without, let's say, some form of, some form of, what's the thing when you're born rich? Privilege. Without some kind of inherent privilege that gets you ahead of the curve, the brutal reality is that you, as dudes, you're a bunch of dudes, of all quality of dude, are more or less useless to a high-value social circle. That's the way they perceive you. Okay, so if you want to look at, okay, what is the reality of most men's social world? They have one social circle, and then they have several outlier friends. That's pretty much it, right? They have the group that they went to high school with, or uni with, or they go cycling with, or whatever is the thing that drew them together. That's their core group. And then maybe they have a few random friends of guys or girls that they met through that thing, or they really clicked with this person. And that's it. Who here would admit that that is more or less their social world? Okay, and of course, that's the common thing, because it makes sense. When you've stayed in your lane, when you've been apportioned a social circle due to what it is that you do and think and where you are, then that's what happens. And would you say that this group is usually homogeneous or heterogeneous? Full of similar people, or full of an X-Men team of bizarre and contrasting characters? Mostly pretty similar. Why? Because you all studied the thing, because you're all from the same town, you're all from the same income bracket or class or whatever else that tends to allocate people into similar brackets. You may have a whole bunch of different personality traits, but very likely you'll be similar in terms of your utility, the things you know, the people you know, the networks you have, the resources you have. What's the problem with that? Anyone? Yeah, it doesn't really allow for so much growth because you can't benefit from each other, from each other's skills, right? From each other's personality types. Doesn't mean that you won't benefit from each other as people or as support units. It can be a good group of guys who, I've trained with a lot of poker players who travel around the world in pods of poker players. And they all play the same game. They all have this really weird type of brain that's able to like run 16 screens of playing 400 people at once with their adrenaline spiking every two seconds. And most of them are German and most of them are very, very meticulous with the way that they operate. But the guys that I've worked with have been really, really good as friendship circles. They've been really tight, respectful guys who understand the floating alpha concept, which I'll get to soon. So what's the other problem with being in one of these kinds of social circles? What is limited? Resources and opportunities. There is a limit to them. Who's been in a social circle where when by some random chance an attractive woman came into the sphere, was introduced through someone or she came into the uni class or whatever, suddenly everyone's scrambling over each other and fucking each other over in order to try and get the one hot girl. Or if someone by some chance gets a cute girlfriend, he has to be on the lookout because everyone else is like jostling to get her attention. And if they break up, which they will, then probably one of his friends will try and fuck her, which will lead to what? Violence. Yes, drama. But this is the nature of limitations and resources. Today, none of us have limitations on water and food and having a house over our head more or less. Okay, so our basic survival needs that were the thing that we spent all of our group and our group energy working on and through previous generations, that's all solved. So it goes up higher into the hierarchy of needs. And we have this, that the limitation on resources for the modern male, particularly in the West, is to do with access to coveted, attractive, high value women, access to physical resources through financial advantages. But more importantly than that is what does that give you? It gives you leverage. Yo, hope you enjoyed that snippet from my iconic stepping out of the matrix speech.
