It does not require you to do everything perfectly and women simply do not expect that. The fact is that single women are looking for guys to hook up with. They're looking for people who are fallible, who are human, who have their own idiosyncrasies and strengths and weaknesses and the truth is that the actually confident men are men who are able to be more or less okay with the fact that they're not perfect."}
