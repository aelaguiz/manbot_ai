I can't think of anything that I've really gotten good at or that's given me really great results where it was just me. I'm not a lifestyle entrepreneur who sits on a beach or in my farm in Portugal by myself, doing it all remotely. But the thing that has held us together over time and has meant that not only I, but everyone else in the crew benefits, has been this idea of the seductive economy. The best way to get what you want is to make sure that everyone around you is getting what they want. I would say since around the release of Tim Ferriss' iconic book, The 4-Hour Workweek, there has been this new kind of archetype developed of a successful male. Throughout recent history, what had meant to be a successful male in the 80s was cocaine and Wall Street, hookers and suits with big lapels and nice, what are those called? Business cards. Or in the 50s, it would have been the upstanding man in the suburbs who worked in an office and went home to his wife and 2.5 kids and a Chevrolet. Is that what they had in the 50s? I don't know. But there's this new archetype which has become extremely popular and it seems very, very appealing, which is the idea of the digital moment, the lifestyle entrepreneur, the guy that works out some system of creating wealth and theoretically a better lifestyle, which is kind of a turnkey thing that you set it up, you work really hard for a short period of time, you set it up and you press go and then it just cashes, gives you cash and for four hours a week you check in and basically you just check in to go, oh, I didn't realize I got so much richer this week by doing nothing. So this is and correlated to this type of lifestyle is a lot of good things. So it was about hacking. It was about being more effective. It was about optimizing all sorts of areas in your life, including your health and your sleep and your time management and your finances and your location dependence and so on, so that you could create essentially leverage, which is something that I think is amazing. And that archetype has spawned countless numbers of men and women who are now working remotely or working way less or have unplugged from their nine to five and figured out ways to generate passive income or side hustles and so on. So it is a way better one than the cocaine and hookers and 80s greed is good kind of archetype of what it means to be successful. I think it's an interesting one, but it is also I feel missing out on some of the key components that really lead to multiples of your success. Because if you've read the 4-Hour Workweek or looked at any kind of digital nomad or lifestyle entrepreneur kind of courses or resources, very rarely does it, I haven't even seen it happen, does it talk about collaboration in any other way other than outsourcing things to virtual assistants, for example. So, okay, like you may have a team working for you, but they're not really a team in the sense they are contractors that do jobs for you and you pay them. So the aspect, like all of this is hyper individualist. It's really looking at this as like a single person, single man or single woman, can set up their turnkey online business and then end up living in Bali, going like this on the laptop a little bit and then what? Sipping coconut juice and surfing. Okay, which as a snapshot, like I think you need to be wary of like when anyone's selling your lifestyle, there's always kind of a snapshot of what it looks like, right? So there's the guy on the beach in Bali or Thailand with a laptop just living the dream. All right, that's a better office than being in a tiny cubicle, right? But what's going on for the rest of the person's life? Are they actually, is the business actually working? Because that can be dubious to see if that actually is true, but let's assume it is. What are they not getting, right? What do they have? Do they have a community? Do they have collaborators? Do they have women in their lives? Because I never saw a woman around Tim Ferriss. Maybe he was just keeping her quiet. And a lot of these kind of lifestyle entrepreneurs seem to be pretty kind of solitary and not really having relationships. Who knows? But that was the impression I got. But without the ability to actually connect with other people in a way that goes well beyond just having drinking buddies or, you know, going to network meetings where you exchange contacts and say, let's do a deal sometime. No, I'm talking about true tribe members, true brothers and sisters on the path, true people who have your interests at heart and are willing to give you those tips, help you out in ways that they wouldn't just publicly give all that information out to, to make sure that you benefit as well as them benefiting. This is what is missing, I think, in this archetype of the hyper individualist, can get it all done by yourself kind of, you know, like modern archetype of a successful man. In my case, almost nothing that I have ever achieved has been done completely alone. I can't think of anything that I've really gotten good at or that's given me really great results where it was just me, just me and a laptop or just me with my one skill or my one hustle. It just didn't work like that. And even though I'm the face of this company, there is and has been a huge number of collaborators who have worked with me from the very beginning to make this successful. So I'm not a lifestyle entrepreneur who sits on a beach or in my farm in Portugal by myself doing it all remotely. I have had partners along the whole trip. And the thing that has held us together, and it hasn't held all of us together all the time, I've certainly lost people and had breakups along the way. But the thing that has held us together over time and has meant that not only I, but everyone else in the crew benefits has been this idea that I have lived by for a long, long time of the seductive economy. I have this attitude, which is the best way to get what you want is to make sure that everyone around you is getting what they want. And that's, I guess, in a nutshell, that's kind of nepotism. But this is these are the facts of life is that people help people that they love and respect and and get benefit from. And if you want to be a great leader, or you want to be someone who is able to use the resources and the knowledge of other people, then you need to be able to make sure that they are getting what they want. It's some in some way as a result of being close to you. And look, this happens organically. Like I have I have this course, the Lifestyle Design Academy, and I have this system, the seductive economy system. But it's not something I invented. It's something that I codified and have worked out ways to vastly accelerate what what can and often is an organic be an organic process. Because it's quite likely that you've I mean, very, very likely that you have used this at some point in your life. And if you think about your closest friends, the reason that you consider them to be if you have them, I hope you got some. If if you do consider them to be really, really close, it's not because you have the same interests, necessarily. It's not because you were brought up in the same town or you're of the same demographic, necessarily. It's more to do with the shared experiences that you've had over time and the type of those experiences. Because you've probably had this experience where you've been in a social circle or a work situation or a study situation. And you had this this gang that you hung out with or a couple of people you hung out with after work drinks or, you know, waiting for class. And this kind of loose, easy to easy to put together social experiences. But then once the course is over or the job changes or someone leaves, those relationships just dissipate. That's because they weren't friendships. They were they were just hangouts of convenience with maybe maybe you really liked each other and you found each other funny and pleasant and interesting and you vibed. But you didn't have any real shared investment in each other. And so as a result, when the thing that held you together stopped, you fade off and go off into becoming Facebook friends. How do you know when someone is really tight with you? When they're a real brother, when they're your best friend, for example? Those kind of relationships develop because of reciprocal altruism or reciprocal trade of non-financial usually and maybe financial currencies. You help your buddy out with moving house. He helps you out with getting over this girl you're all caught up about. You help him, you know, study for his exam because you're better at that than he is and vice versa. Right. So these things accumulate over time and the investments in each other. They have to cost a little bit for the person giving like it kind of has to be. It kind of has to hurt a bit. Like if I go and help a friend move an entire house, that's a hassle for me. Like that's me putting myself out for that person, which means that it's a real investment of time and energy. And if I did this for a person where they just only called me up to get favors off me, the only time I heard from them was to have favors. I might do that some number of times because I like them and we were friends. But after some time, I would start to feel like this was a very imbalanced relationship that I was being taken advantage of. And if I was a really nice guy, then I might just put up with it for years and years and then eventually explode with violence or just hold resentment. Or if I was a more direct and straightforward person, I would go, hang on a minute, this person is just taking off me. So I'm going to downgrade or this relationship or end it all together. The bonds of trust and trade happen when it's not an exact ledger. It's not like I bought you a coffee and now you better buy me one when we just keep that exactly sent for sent. No, it's more like, okay, whatever resources I have, knowledge, location, car, access to social circles, access to really important information and so on and so on. This is then traded with the person or the other collaborators that then trade back, give me things that I need from them and that they are better at or have more access to. And as a result, over a number of those trades, we build this friendship. And that's why usually if you have a best friend, it's someone that you knew for a very long time because that takes time to build those layers of trust to the point where you're like, I really got your back, bro, no matter what. So these things do happen organically and that can be up to the luck of who happens to be around you, how social you are, how socially capable you are, how much you get this sense of like I scratch your back, you scratch mine. And how much or less you are a sociopath who just takes off people or on the other side, how much you are or not a super nice guy who just lets people take from you. So in order to accelerate this process, you need to actually dissect it and understand it. And that's what I've done with the seductive economics system. Gentlemen, I've extended enrollments for the Lifestyle Design Academy for a final 24 hours. So for the guys that were wanting extra time to do the part payments or paying crypto or just to get themselves together to figure it out, this is your final 24 hours. And then we'll be closing the cart. The first lecture is coming up this Sunday, the 24th of April. So now is your final chance. Click the link below for full details. Now back to the video. Instead of it just being like, okay, maybe over five plus years with someone, I make this amazing connection with them. I've worked out ways that we can speed that up to happen within sometimes a phone call, right? Or it might be some weeks or it might be some months. But it's a very, very rapid version of this. It's the hydroponic skunk version of the natural way that this might happen. This actually happened just last night. I was on a phone call with a guy that's very wealthy, very well connected in this space, this industry. I can't say who it is. But, you know, a big player who I got introduced to by one of my main collaborators who is an excellent seductive economics infiltrator and who had found this contact and found out that this guy was really interested in the thing that I'm really good at, one of the things that I'm really good at. Which is platinum and coin investment. Now, if you sign up for my course, which happens to be at this time BDSM and kinky sexuality. So we got on a call last night and we just did a trade. He knows way more about business than me. I know way more about spanking and choking and nasty things than he. And so we riffed. We spent four hours last night just giving each other stuff that was of value to each other. He was also looking to relocate to Europe and trying to figure out how to work the visa system there. I know this system here, at least in some of the countries. And so I was able to just say, here, call this lawyer. She's a boss and she's fucking hot, too. Kind of too hot to be my lawyer, actually. Like it's a bit too hot. But anyway, hot lawyer in Hungary. She can sort you out in getting a short-term visa. No problem. And he'd been researching for days and weeks trying to figure out like online which visa system works and which, hang on, they say that one does and this one doesn't. And I was like, no, I have on the ground information. I've done it. And I've helped my friends do it. All of us have used this system in this location and all of us have gotten visas without any problems super fast. So I can pass that information on to him. We now have a sense of being indebted to each other. After one long phone call, we started to create the initial bonds of both friendship, trust and reciprocity. We both benefited massively from that one phone call. And as a result, both of us are going to be wanting to continue this relationship and help each other get rich in different ways. Whether that is he helps me more with business, I help him more with his relationship life and the various other things that no doubt we'll find out over time that we're into. And as a result, we may or may not, but it's much more likely that he and I will become what is actual friends. Not just people, acquaintances, not just people that we all put together in class with and not only just the people that we went to high school with and your original crew. This is a way that, as a grown man, it can be sometimes really weird and difficult to make a new friend. How do you go and pick up a new friend as a guy when you're in your 20s, 30s, 40s? Because in, you know, high school and college and the younger years when people are dynamic and they're not tied down and they don't yet have kids and mortgages and wives and huge responsibilities and they want to meet people, there tends to be a social blossoming in your younger years for most people. Not all, but many. And then, very commonly, what happens is after this explosion of networking, which is kind of happening intuitively for most people or to better and worse degrees, then what happens? You settle into some space, right? So now this is your job. And so you hang out with your co-workers and the few friends that you had left over from high school or the local sporting team or whatever, kind of localized and kind of arbitrary group based around what it is that you do. And then as your responsibilities maybe increase and you have to work more and then maybe you get a girlfriend and then you move in together. And like I saw this happen for me and for many guys in their later 20s, is that the social world dramatically and rapidly shrunk from being a thing where you may know dozens or hundreds maybe, if you're a social butterfly, people to really only interacting with a handful. And over time, that can keep diminishing and diminishing, going down to a very small core group of friends and family. And that's not like an awful thing. It's kind of how humans group themselves in modern times. We're not involved, most of us, in a village where we know all 300 people and we're kind of interconnected because of the festivals and the raising of barns and the fighting off of intruders and whatever it is that you did in that small scale, but still numerically quite a large social group. The fact that mostly we are nuclear families or where you can live in a building with 500 other people and never meet them. This, it doesn't just happen organically, that you keep growing in your social world. And this is not just about parties and having fun and how many friends you have, which is important, especially if you're a guy who wants to improve your seductive lifestyle. I'll get onto that in a moment. It's not just about like the fun and the having friends. It's about what does those friendship networks create? Because another problem that a lot of, particularly guys that are my audience, who are usually technically minded guys that are in fields where there's typically not a lot of women and most of the people they work with, let's say a lot of my students are engineers, tech guys, finance guys, doctors, lawyers. These are often guys who are surrounded by men. So it's not easy to just meet women through their work or through the extended social network out of it because there ain't none or if they are, there's not enough. And the ones that are there are, you know. Except for my boss, hot lawyer, goddammit, no, you can't have a number. The other issue is that typically those social groups are pretty homogenous, right? Pretty much similar types of people in terms of, okay, you both, if all of you are in tech, for example, you probably think in similar ways. You have similar levels of intelligence and of a particular type of intelligence, right? So you may be way above normal intelligence when it comes to problem solving or mathematics or tech things. That's all the tech words I can think of at the moment because clearly I'm not that. But in terms of being like social connectors or emotionally intuitive or truffle pigging, which is a term I heard recently, which is the idea of a truffle pig, truffle, very expensive mushroom, pig trained as a truffle pig, sniffs out the truffles that are hidden in the forest and then the Italian guy goes, oh, that's a beautiful truffle. I sell it for 1,000 euro. Truffle pig being someone who can sniff out opportunities that other people wouldn't necessarily see. Someone who's a good reader of character and spots these kind of things and then goes and makes networks with them. So you and your crew may be very, very well above average in terms of certain things, but you don't have an x-men team. You don't have a variety of different abilities and connections and networks to then feed into each other and into the crew to then have multiplying effects. And this is a big problem, I feel anyway, if you want to expand your lifestyle. Because if you want to actually design a life like this concept of lifestyle design, it's something that is strategic and it is based around certain goals. Most men, even if they don't do it yet, are at least aware of and conscious of the idea that they should be thinking about their financial future and their career. So they will study things in order to move on to a certain type of work, in order to accrue a certain type of wealth and maybe to invest it in a certain type of way in order to be stable and secure and hopefully thrive. Some of us do that very well, some of us do it less well, but there's been few men that are not aware of that as a concept and don't think that's at least intellectually a good idea. But this is only one form of currency, one form of payoff. It doesn't account for all the other metrics of happiness, because happiness and satisfaction and fulfillment does not come just from having a secure financial situation. Many studies have proven that. What actual happiness is, is around if you have your needs met, you've got a roof over your head, you're fed, you can go on holiday a few times a year, you can buy things that you want when you want them as long as they're not Maseratis. You have a certain level of economic strength which makes you feel secure and that's very important, particularly in this day and age when there is so much insecurity. It is something that is a massively important piece. But what else makes you happy? It's the people around you. It's your networks, it's your tribe, it's your lovers, your friends, your family, the nourishing experiences that you have of shared enjoyment and also of shared heartbreak or shared disaster. Because it's like you're going to need those people for the good times and the shit times. So I think if you're a guy who's being strategic about your life, which most people who come to this channel are to some degree because they're looking at, all right, I want to optimise my dating life initially is why guys come. But then as you start to unplug from one piece of the matrix, which is the dating one which says that you, what is that, me pulling the tube out of a small Neo in front of me. Once you start unplugging from the general consensus advice on how to get a lady or a woman's attention, which is generally pretty shit, and you start saying, okay, there are better ways to do that, not inevitably but fairly likely that you would also look at, okay, are there other things, areas of the matrix that I can unplug from, other areas of commonly held beliefs which maybe they work on the broad scope for the mass of a country's population, for example, but do they really help the individual? Is it really the best thing to study for X years to get into a 9-9 job that's going to grind your soul away just with the promise of one day retiring with a decent pension fund when you're 65 or 70 or 75 depending on what it's like when we're old? Is that really the answer to fulfilment and happiness? For some people, yes, but for many, the guys that are curious about the lifestyle entrepreneur or the digital nomad or they're starting to claw time and resources back from the man so that they can enjoy more of them, then you start to wish to and start to figure out ways to unplug from all these things. The reason why I've been able to live a lifestyle which was actually very precarious, like I don't have a pension fund and I never really had an employer. I've bounced around multiple different countries. I've lived in all sorts of different places where I didn't speak the language, didn't understand how it worked, the culture, the bureaucracy, et cetera. I've lived a really what looks like on the outside of very risky life, but when I think about it, if I'd stayed in Australia and followed the course of what I was kind of doing early on, that would have been the massive risk for me. Maybe by now I would have been saddled with a massive debt for a place that wasn't really going to benefit me. I would have been stuck in one place. I wouldn't have been able to have all the amazing adventures and love affairs and bar fights in Mongolia and all the other wacky stuff that I've got to do, and I feel like my personal enjoyment and my sense of fulfilment and satisfaction and happiness would have been way, way less, and that's a massive risk. That's the risk that really matters is that am I risking wasting my life? Am I risking an unhappy and unfulfilled and eternally overworked and isolated life by the course of the choices that I'm taking or the lifestyle that I'm designing consciously or unconsciously? Because you are designing it day by day whether you're aware of it or not. When you become aware of it, you can start to change the metrics and start to reach out and plug into different social circles, bring in different collaborators, build tribes so that you and then the tribal members can multiply your effects. How does this relate to women? Because this is not just about making best friends. There are ways that you can use the seductive economy frameworks to attract lovers into your life and to make it a lot easier for them to want to be with you, right? Because there are kind of two ways to draw women and hold women into your life, regardless of whether it's by apps or whatever. But one is to meet women individually, so cold approach or swiping and liking, which I don't touch that kind of shit but people do do it. But it's like going out and finding a woman and trying to use your charms to seduce her and then you bring her into your bed and your life and you're done. Cool. And if that ends or you want another one, then you go out and you do it again. It's kind of like working hour for dollar. So if you stop working, you stop going and meeting girls or stop going on dates, then you stop benefiting from that. The other way that people have tried to ingratiate themselves with ladies is by building a kick-ass social circle where women want to go to it, right? So by, I don't know, owning a club or being a club promoter or throwing big parties, creating a social network where there are lots of women involved, which is also valid, right? And that can work. Both of these things can and do work to greater or lesser degrees depending on your skill and depending on the networks that you have. The best way or the most effective way to draw women and keep them into your life is to combine those two, right, is to have the ability to go out into the well outside of your social world and meet women through cold approaching or I guess through online dating but to use your personal seduction skill to go and make this happen and then to draw that woman into the social network that you have because in general it's not a great idea to be trying to pick up girls in your immediate social scene, right? And that's back before Tinder, I remember back in the earlier days when I was growing up, that always happened. Like guys would, if there was one cute girl in the social circle and the couple broke up, then immediately the guy's friends were hitting on her and there was always like this incestuous mess of people trying to pick up within the social circle because there was so much scarcity happening. They didn't, the guys usually, didn't have any other way to meet girls. It was just like, oh, well, there's three cute girls in our social scene so I'll just wait my turn, right, or worse. Very, very limited view. It's like as if everyone was living in a village of six in an episode of Friends, right? Friends being a good example of the 90s show of that kind of scarcity, like that they are incestuously banging within their crew. But when you have the ability to go out, meet girls and then bring them to a social network that is attractive, that has a whole bunch of currencies which the girl appreciates, which is fun and excitement and feeling accepted and who knows what other bells and whistles that you guys have, access to certain social scenes or a cool clubhouse, you know, with a ping pong machine or something, one of those, what is that called? Pinball. Pinball. It shows how old I am because that's when I last played them, you had to go like this to shoot the ball. I think they just shoot by magic now, the magic of electricity. Yeah, so even if, yeah, having a clubhouse. So it's like the best thing is if I meet a girl out on the street and I invite her to a social event where I have social proof, I'm a cool guy in that scene, people like me and my wingmen and wingwomen are trained to assist me, not to cockblock me, right? So they make me look good. They welcome the girl in without being flirty. And so the girl comes into the situation and goes, wow, this is a cool crew. I like these people are great and he's well-respected within this, I'm more attracted to him and it's going to make the whole seduction a lot easier because in a way your whole crew is helping to assist to attract the girl, right? So that's the dynamic that I prefer to work on with seduction. I've done countless hours of me alone cold on the street or in bars going and crafting my skill and learning the cold approach skill which is irreplaceable. The ability to go up to a stranger and make them attracted to you or respect you or like you or depending on what it is that you want out of the person is paramount. You can't replace that with owning a club because even if you own the club and you never approach, you don't know how to seduce, the best case scenario is you get some kind of gold digger chick who wants just the prestige of being with you but doesn't actually like you as a person. So the dynamic formula is that ability to build"}
