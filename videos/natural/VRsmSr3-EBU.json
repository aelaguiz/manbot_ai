How are ya? Good. You're so adorable. What? You are so adorable. Adorable. Do you know this word? Yeah, I understand. Oh, good. Well, that's what I had to say. You're also really cute, but I'm so crazy about redheads. It's nothing personal. Oh, thank you. What's your name? James. Hello. Hello. Are you Russian? No, I'm not. I'm from Czech Republic, yeah. I live here. All right, good. I'm an Australian. Yeah, that's cool. Is it? What do you know about Australians? I don't know so much, but my friends will study there three months in this... No, this one. In this holidays. Yeah. He's a singer. He's studying singing? Yeah. Like classical singing? Yeah. We are both opera singers, too. Really? Yeah. Are you an alto? No. Yeah, she sings some lower voice. Yeah, and I'm a soprano. I was a beautiful boy soprano when I was younger. Yeah, lots of boys sing higher than me. All right. Yes, I'm not anymore, though. I was a musician for a long time, but not an opera musician. Which kind of music? Funk, soul, reggae, drum and bass, Latin, mixed. Yeah, lots of styles. Lots of stiches. Yeah. Well, do you want to go on a date with me? No. Why not? I have a boyfriend. Yeah, I know, but boyfriends come and go. I'll be back. What? We can have it in a year. It doesn't have to be right now. Yeah, okay. That's funny. Sorry. Yeah, but it's true, right? I mean, boyfriends do change. How old are you? I'm 18. Okay, so it'll last about six months, maybe. So why don't I get your Facebook, and then when I come back in a year's time, then we can go on a date. You really want my Facebook? Yeah. Okay. I'm serious. I'm patient, too. I can wait. I will see. I'm serious. I'll be back. Okay. I'm serious. Okay. All right. Well, you can write it there, and I'll add it when I get back to the Internet. And if you give me a fake name, I'll be sad. No, it's my real name. Oh, good. Yeah. She can... She's like, yes. I'm not lying. All right. But this is the most frequent name in the Czech Republic. Oh, there's lots of... Well, what's the photo of? Your photo is... Yeah, yeah, I have a photo there. Of you, not of a squirrel or something. Yeah. But girls like me, which names like me as thousands and thousands. So I have to look through thousands of girls to find you. All right. Well, then you'll see how committed I am to our relationship. Okay. All right. Bye. Bye. See you. So James, what's like the process of coaching the students? Is there like one coach for each student or are you changing them? On these workshops, when we're rolling out around with the students, usually it's two guys coming out with one coach. Inevitably, one of them often disappears off on an instant date with a girl, which is what's happened right now. So I'm back to one-on-one. But yes, there's a lot of personalized attention during these workshops. Remember what I'm giving you today is a skeleton framework. It's only a guideline. So don't get fixated on the idea that it has to be pre-frame open, da, da, da. I can go up to someone, I can open with a handshake. I can say, Hey, what's your name? I can totally do that. I'll demonstrate one for you soon. I can open with a compliment. You look fucking great. And then I can go back to the pre-frame. Don't worry. I'm not crazy. You just affected me. Right. So these are pieces that I can move around in various order. It doesn't necessarily doesn't necessarily have to go in a specific order. You look amazing. Don't worry. I'm not crazy. I'm a little bit crazy. Do you want to meet me? Yeah. What's your name? Okay. And you have a good handshake and you have a good firm handshake as well. So it means you must have a strong character. Thanks. You made my day real. Because I feel like I have a bad day. Oh, do you? Yeah. I didn't sleep too much. I had an event with a client and I got to bed at 2am and I get to wake up at 6am. All right. Well, I'm very glad. I noticed like when I don't sleep enough, I'm very grumpy. So I'm glad I could make your day better. All right. See you later. Bye. Bye. Clearly, that was a plant. Clearly. So, all right. So I opened, what did I open with? I opened with the compliment. And then I, and then I said, don't worry, I'm not crazy. And then I introduced myself. Right. So you see that these are interchangeable pieces and they have different functions. And the main reason why that worked was what? Because let me, let me do it again now and so sure and deliberately not work. Yeah, you look pretty, you look great. I'm not crazy. What's the difference? Why did the first one make that woman's day and the second girl thinks I'm a fucking weirdo? That was very clear. Yeah, I was committed to it. I was warm and I was friendly and I was there.
