They always want to eat. They have a good habitat. Are you a model? Am I a model? No. I did some modeling when I was a young man. This is you. This is you. August Z. Okay. And what will you do today? Where are you from? Australia. Australia? Oh, good. Oh, good. Why is that good? Yes. Do you like Australian people? Yeah, I have... I've been before. You've been before? This? Yeah, yeah. This one. \u4ec0\u4e48\u4e2d\u56fd\u540d\u5b57? \u5f20\u8bb8\u4f73\u3002 \u5f20\u8bb8\u4f73\u3002 Yeah, yeah. It's okay? \u5f20\u8bb8\u4f73\u3002 Okay, following you. Okay. And do you have a telephone number here? Oh, telephone number? Yeah, I can text you. Yes. How long will you stay in New York for? This way. Uh-huh. Just two weeks. Two weeks? Yeah. Yeah, I'm not here for much longer either. All right, hang on. One minute. Plus one, nine... Seven, nine... And what are you working on here? Modeling. Yeah, I know. But what kind of modeling? What's the thing? Catwalk and some shoot. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Do you like it? Yeah. But what do you really like? Yeah. In life? What's your favorite thing in life? I don't know how to say. Fashion week? Say again? Fashion week? Fashion week? Yeah, I know that. But I mean, in your life? Yeah. What do you like the best? What's your favorite thing in life? Oh, yeah. Yes. Dancing, dance, and model. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Nice. What do you like about dancing? Ballet. Oh, you're classically trained. Yes, you must be very slim. And can I lift you up? Yes. No, I shouldn't do that now. But how does it feel when you dance? How do you feel? Just sometimes. Just sometimes? Yeah. When you were younger, you did more? Yeah. Uh-huh. All right. Good. Were you going now? Yes. It's off? Yes. Okay, well. With my friend. All right, so I will text you. When are you free? Tomorrow evening? Tomorrow? Oh, I have job. Yes, we can message. I will. Okay. All right, August. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Excuse me. Hello. Hi. How are you? I'm good. How are you? Good. I like that you're immediately friendly. Because often people are not in this town. They think that I might be doing something weird. It happens. I am doing something weird. But it's not bad. I'm just talking to you because I think you're cute. Thank you. What's your name? I'm Angela. How do you do? James. Do you live in Australia? Yes. Cool. Yes. Awesome. I've been meeting a lot of Australians lately. Have you? Like, randomly on the streets? Because it's your summer there, right? This is your travel time? It's our... Well, I don't really live there, so I've forgotten what's what. But you are allowed to. What is it now? It's coming into our summer. Yes. How long have you been living in New York? Just a few weeks. Okay. How do you like it so far? I love it. It's insane. I know. Everything is mad all the time. It's awesome, huh? Yes. Are you new? I've been here two years now. Okay, so you're not jaded, though? No, not yet. I'm from California, so I got a good leg up with the Sunshine City. Ah, right, right. It'll probably take a while. But I broke my phone last class. I need to go see what I can do to fix it. I think it's pretty easy. I've done it before. You just go in and someone will fix it and charge you some amount of money for it. It's ridiculous now. Maybe 50 bucks or something? Yeah. If you ask her... To replace the screen, too, it'll be like 100 bucks worth. Will it? Oh, no. Unfortunately, yeah. Do you have a girlfriend? No. No? No? No? No? No? No? No? Well, it's not a hundred bucks worth. Will it? Oh, no. Unfortunately, yeah. Is that the first one you've done? No! No, that's why I know. Why do girls break phones more often than men? I think that's the thing. I don't know. Is it because it's in their back pocket and they fall out when they're in the bathroom or they're dancing? I don't keep it in my back pocket anymore. Hm. Because, yeah, that does happen a lot. Right. Someone should do an anthropological study of that. I think so. Or gender issues of breaking... You should just have bigger pockets. I think it's unfair that I have to carry a purse and you can use pockets. I know. That's totally the patriarchy at work. Look at it. Don't you... Well, maybe you could get pants with pockets in them. I mean, girls have cuter butts though, so you don't want to, like, show it off, probably. Yeah, we put all weird shapes in there. Yeah. Um, I try to keep my butt fairly clear so that people can check it out if they want to. That's a good, good tactic. Hang on, sorry, hang on, sorry. I'm just gonna... There you go. That's better. There you go. What do you do? What do I do? Well, I run a funny business. A funny business? Yeah. It's called a funny business. No, it's not really. I'm a life coach. Oh, that's cool. And I'm a... I'm in a class called the science of happiness, and it's taught by a life coach. Really? Yeah. What is the science behind happiness? It's about your positive psychology and learned optimism and... Right. ...changing your thoughts to change your life and all that stuff. Huh. Yep. That's... That definitely works. I've been reading about these hill tribes in New Guinea recently. They have no depression at all. Do you know why? Why? Because they blame anything that goes wrong with them. Yeah. I don't know how I feel about that. I know. When I read that, I'm like, oh, I don't know how I feel about that. That's a different way of dealing with it. Yeah, that's awesome. That's not the kind of life coach I am. What kind of life coaching do you do? Mainly to do with, yeah, to do with mindsets, belief systems, confidence. I do a lot of meditation, so I teach people a lot about that because so many people are up in their heads all day buzzing around, thinking nonsense. Yeah. So I try to help them to get out. Especially in this generation, there's no peace. No, there's not. Even when you're alone, it's still connected somehow. I'm kind of actually happy that my phone broke because every time it breaks, I'm like, oh, it's broken. It's broken. It's broken. It's broken. It's broken. It's broken. It's broken. It's broken. It's broken. It's broken. Yeah. Well, I'm going to go in here and try to get a deal. Get a deal. Yes. Would you like to go for a coffee sometime, or are you already taken? Sure. I'd love to. All right. Good. I won't get your text because my phone isn't in this place. Oh, yeah. So I won't be offended if you don't reply. But then how will we stay in contact? Let's just text me with your name, and then when I have a call, I'll text you with my phone number. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. And then I'll text you with your name, and then when I have a phone again. Okay. Now I've forgotten your name. Angela. Have you forgotten mine? James. All right. I owe you a coffee then. Yeah. You do. All right. And that's not even a difficult name. I'm like, how do I spell that? Let's try and pretend that, nope. Angela is pretty normal. All right. So your number is what? 925- Okay. Well, I'll text you in an hour or so when you're done. Sounds good. All right, good luck. Good luck. See ya. Bye. Bye. See ya. "}
