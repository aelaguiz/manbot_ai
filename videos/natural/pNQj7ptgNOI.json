Let's go and see what we can rustle up on Kreschytyk Avenue I What's up, oh wow beautiful eyes. Yes, who are you? I said, oh, that's good. That's a good start. But I said, who are you?

I think the modeling thing In that case, I was just really feeling the initial vibe. She was confident clear. She has to go So I just cheekily asked for the number she said no and then I said yes, and then she said, okay Well, let's talk about it after your interview That doesn't make any sense you give me a phone number then we'll go and get a coffee and we'll talk about it after Think she respected that or she was just trying to get rid of me. We'll find out later. All right next Hi, how are you? I'm not selling something. I just thought you looked really cute Is that a script? Do you have the exam today? Yes, you're studying while you're walking walking and studying you are either You're a very good student or a very bad student because you're trying to catch up somewhere in between Okay, nice. Cool. And what's your name? Classic Ukrainian name James Where do you think Nine long way away very far The other side of the planet Australia It's really interesting because I have learned topic for my English exam about Australia Really? What did you learn about the history or the animals? We don't really have a history We have a very very short history So do did you like what you learned? Do you like Australians? Do you like me? Thank you Right and you have a really funky style. I like it. Do you know this word funky? How would I describe funky you see the funk is a living creature about the size of a medicine ball but covered in teeth It means let's say cool with a with your own unique twist Yeah, but it's also refers to 1970s music Disco like, you know disco disco, but with a heavier bass beat I'm lost No, I I live in Europe like I lived here last 10 years, but I lived in different places in Hungary and Portugal And now I have some business here and a lot of my friends live here and my grandfather was Ukrainian So coming back to my roots Yeah, but it's a good place now because you know, everything else is locked. Australia's locked Europe's locked. So better fun here Yes, but I have like my own business so I work when I want it's like online business Coaching business You know what I mean Yeah, teaching people about communication skills and body language and business skills and other skills that people need And you're a full-time student How do you keep so many languages in one brain I guess that's with most things if you really enjoy it, you'll learn it Cool would you like to get a tea with me sometime? Yeah, I don't mean now I mean like sometime after your exams Yeah, when you when you have some time I have some time. I'm quite busy this week, too So maybe we can meet next week. So I get your whatsapp. You look a bit nervous Yes, why do you prefer Instagram so you can stalk me and see what I'm like All right, I will add you Oh Mrs. Are you married? No, you know that mrs. Means you're married. I know should be miss Or mistress would be good, too All right, I have followed you add me add me And you'll need to ask me back because I'm very private person. I Never share anything to the public Okay, I got you nice Yes, good luck with your exam. I will see you soon. All right, bye a a Common issue that I see in field with guys is they ask a girl out and she says a soft No, because she's busy right now and often that can be because she kind of misinterpreted I think that girl thought I will can we go for a date immediately? And so she says no and I've heard so many times on the mics The girl gives that kind of soft logistical. No, and the guys like all right fuck come out Instead it's a small problem that I can solve So because I've been listening to what she's saying, I've got it in a read on what's going on in life She's got the exam. She's kind of busy right now, but she's there. She's smiling. She's sweet She's open a little bit shy, right? So when I asked for the clothes I can see in her eyes that she's It's not a hard. No, it's not a boyfriend. No, it's like I'm not sure about this. And so I'm softening my vibe Chilling with her and then when she gives this small objection, I just solve it Yeah, I don't mean now I mean like sometime after your exams Yeah, when you when you have some time I have some time. I'm quite busy this week, too so maybe we can meet next week and this is one of the Most powerful aspects that of masculinity that a man can project is when there's a little bit of an issue. I'll solve it There's a vanilla rice song that goes something along the lines of that. I've got a problem. I'll solve it something something the DJ I'll have to check up on my vanilla rice. You get the idea soft. No solve the step around the objection Solve the problem. You're good to go. If there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it. Check out the hook. Why DJ revolves it? All right, that's two for two I'm gonna go and try and get some rejections so that you guys don't think that this is all fake All right. Let's see if some girls can tell me to fuck off Hi, how you doing? Thank you. That's exactly what I needed. Thank you. Now. They know I'm not faking it Excuse me. Hi, you look so dreamy You're off in your own world, is it a nice place Sometimes right now it looked okay. You were sort of, you know in the moment Good me too. We're in the same moment I'm not selling anything or trying to convert you to any religions or anything like that I just thought you looked wonderful and wanted to meet you What's your name Well, and how would you say it All right, I'm James just says James are you from here And what's going on in life Of Oh, well like an opera singer. Yeah Are you an alto and alto your register Really But you have quite a low speaking voice Yeah, I was a boy soprano when I was a young very young This type of voice Right you mean for Women Okay. So for a young boy whose balls haven't dropped yet. You call him a discount. Yeah. Okay, that's good to know That's what I was All right. I miss those days. It was it was nice. Yeah What else what else do you do with your life? You must have to practice a lot right like this takes up a lot of your energy I'm Meditating yes, you're meditating. Yeah, that's that's the verb Because it's good for your soul and Yes, I also meditate a lot for the same well for not only that reason but yes because before I Meditated I was very stressed out and angry person Yes, I was fucking furious now you're chill if you practice you have to maintain it It harmonized you wonderful, can I ask what style of meditation you learn? Like like money You mean like manifestation or something like this like the secret no because I don't think that works Affirmations, yeah, right. I Think that's useful But you also need to go and make it happen in the real world because you can't just go Come on universe. Give me money. It doesn't really work like that Only director stage director and I need to Yeah, I don't know A bit You mean for the the way that it should look You mean you don't have ideas for the way that the stage should look or the what do you mean? So you need to think of a theme like for example to choose a period in time or something like this Topic about what I want to tell Two people, right Through this performance, but doesn't the opera have a specific story already like yes, but you will interpret it or change it in some way But you need to interpret this and make something fresh yes, right we got there Where we can with this is what this works this works fine Yeah, is it true in Ukraine that I don't know what it's like at the Conservatory, but I was told, you know the pink University Right, I was told by some students that it's pink because it's embarrassed because it's so corrupt And if you want to get a good score, you must pay the professor Is this true? So this is a meritocracy, so you have to earn it. Yes. Right. Well, that's good. I'm glad to hear that not all the education system... That's not the one question that you want to know, yeah? I mean, that was the one that was in my mind at this point. Yeah, I was just curious to know. I know, I know. What's this? Oh, it's sheet music. Yeah. Uh-huh. My aria. Your aria. Aria. Uh-huh. Well, probably the way you say it. Awesome. In Ukrainian. In Ukrainian. Okay, cool. And what are you doing now? You're just wandering around in your own world. Go to home. Okay, cool. Would you like to get a cup of tea with me sometime? Now? Not now, but soon. Sometime? Yeah, sometime. And you, what do you do here? I'm living here at the moment, so I'm from Australia, and I've been living in Europe a long time. I have a farm in Portugal, where I spend maybe half my time growing olives, and then I have a business. Well, it's like online business, so I do it wherever I want. A lot of my friends are here now, because we all are Australians who are in exile. We had to move from EU to Ukraine, so for this summer I will be here, more or less. That's part of my story. There's a lot more, but that's the general idea. Does that make sense? Can you repeat, please, because... All of it? Yeah. Because I turn off. Okay, right, right. I'll start again. Yes. So, do you remember anything? You're from Australia. Yeah, I'll test you. What do you remember? Okay, you are from Australia. Excellent. And you have a farm in Portugal. Right. I don't remember about your friends and how you appear here. Your appearance here. Right. It's two... Two out of five. Yes. Not bad. Basically, because a lot of my friends are from England or from Australia. We were working in Europe, but then we ran out of visa, so we must go in exile. Do you know this word, exile? No, I don't know. Do you know your Napoleonic history? So, when Napoleon was finally deposed, he was sent to an island, the Isle of Elba. This is called exile. Okay. So, we are in exile, where we must leave Europe and come to Ukraine, because it's not in the EU, for some three months or so, and now we are here. Does that make sense? Yes. Good. Story checks out. And you have a job in here. Yeah, I have my own business, so I'm not, like, working... I work wherever I want, so it's online. Oh, freelance. Something like that. It's an online business, so I can do it anywhere I want. But I don't work that much. Like, I work very hard short periods, and then I spend most of my time travelling, learning martial arts, and growing trees, and many, many adventures. That's good. Yeah, it's fun. Sometimes it's a little bit disjointed, like, because I move so much, so it can be a bit confusing, so I have to stay centred. But it's a good life. Tell me your name again. Sorry, I forgot. That's right. And mine? James. Yes, you win. You win. Alright, I pay for the tea. Correct. Okay, let me get your WhatsApp or something. Okay, WhatsApp. You have a really nice, gentle energy. Yeah? And clear eyes. Oh, thank you. I know my eyes don't look clear, I didn't sleep so much. I think it's clear too. So, my number, yes? Yes. Well, you can maybe type it. Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy, but here's my number. You know this song? I do. I'm surprised an opera singer chose that one. Is there an aria that they talk about? No, no, no, no. That one's appropriate. Okay, alright, you can type your number. Okay. Yes. Maybe I'll text you now. And you can send me, like, hi. I can do that, yes? Yes. Done. Got it? Yeah. Okay. Well, I'm going to go for a walk to the park, I think. This is my day off today, so I will relax. Nice day to you. Nice day to you too. You're lovely. I'll see you soon. Take care. Bye.
