It just means she goes to parties and has a bunch of friends She's getting a lot of attention from men all the time and she's always chatting to a bunch of guys I Okay, this question I'm still getting very flaky behavior through text Is this always going to happen or should it happen less as you get better? The answer is yes to both of those things Yes, it's always going to happen girls are always going to be flaky and I hope It's hard to understand the female position when you're not a female If you're an attractive girl who's young and has a decent social life That doesn't have to mean she's on VIP list at clubs. It just means she goes to parties and has a bunch of friends She's getting a lot of attention from men all the time and she's always chatting to a bunch of guys especially younger girls these days are always In a cycle of validating themselves in different ways some girls do it by putting Instagram photos up of themselves in bikinis So the guys say you're hot other girls do it by just being seen all the time of parties and flirting with people and You know making sure that they're always socially connected, right? But the thing is if you're a girl in that situation, you are going to have a large amount of male attention Projected at you almost constantly even if a lot of it is not very good even if a lot of it is kind of Nice guy trying to slip it under the radar stuff It's happening and a girl is if she's chatting to you She's probably chatting to other guys too and often it's just going to be a matter of you don't she doesn't get back to you because you're just not a priority to her in amongst a number of priorities and I've had a small experience of this when I've been in really highly abundant states where I'm dating multiple girls at once I'm finding myself just flaking on That sixth girl or not replying to that girl it was hot but just not as hot as the others and That was me at my most at my height of you know out there all the time Juggling all these women and I got a little experience of what it must be like for a standard hot girl every day So you can't take it personally you need to understand they are they live in a different Dating world than we do they live in a different experience than we do Sometimes that can be flipped depending on the location or age ranges various things may change that sometimes you meet really hot girls who don't have a lot of guys in their life because they just You know, they don't like going to clubs and they're kind of quiet and shy But they just happen to be so smoking pot if you can find those girls hold on to them. They're awesome But mostly you're going to be up against other people so except yes that this will be part of it. However, the number one thing Secondarily, yes, it doesn't happen less as you get better But it still happens a shitload. You know that there's still in amongst me and Keegan and Liam and travel by when we're hanging out Flaky girls is still a very common topic for discussion. You know, we still it's very common that one of us is going Fuckin this chick hasn't been back. Anyone got any ideas how to get this chick back on the line? That's still common and we're supposed to be the best in the world and it happens a lot. So yes, just have to Breathe it in breathe it out. Let it go and it can be frustrating. However, how can we minimize flaky? Good question The Main reason I believe that girls flake on guys they give numbers to is because the guy didn't qualify them properly Particularly if it's day-to-day game approaching where you are going and doing a fairly let's say standard day game kind of natural Sequence where you're pre-framing Showing you're attractive getting into some chit-chat and then asking you for a number if I'm not putting pressure on her to reveal herself to Prove herself to me in some way and then I'm asking her for her number. I said to her You're hot enough to fuck That'll do That's what I said or you are so hot that'll do right The point one of the main points of Qualifying women properly is that it shows them you have choice and that you demand Excellence in your partners in some way, right? When I challenge a girl to say hey, so we're good at or what's cool about you? Or are you spontaneous? Well, would you be interested in doing this spontaneous thing or you know, can you are you creative? Let's let's make a jigsaw puzzle out of all of this Stuff whatever I'm asking her and then challenging on it She then steps in reveals herself to me and then I tell her that that I like her for that reason now It's a good now. I'm much less likely to have her flake Right. So if I say hey listen, look, it's been really awesome chatting. You're fucking sexy and I love how Like creative you are with your word choice you you're a quirky thing. All right, or I'm like, all right, I gotta go like I said, you just look awesome today and you seem to be really interested interesting and I like how passionate you are about whatever it is that she said so you and I need to hang out again I want to find out more Right. I want to see her again because yes, she's attractive But she has aroused my curiosity and I think she's cool because she showed me something that was cool about her That's why I want to see her again, that's why in her mind That's a good reason to give me her number because if I just went and did the the general chit-chat One she probably will give me the number or often will because I've been polite Because I haven't been a dick about it and she feels uncomfortable Blowing me off, but she's gonna flake because I didn't make any emotional impact and I didn't show her That she had to show something to me. I didn't put any pressure on her to reveal herself Therefore she's like that guy. Yeah, he just wants to fuck me Now what do we talk about? Yeah, I'll get back to you later and then she flicks Try working on your qualifying tell the girl why you like her at the end It doesn't need to be a big long story. You just say look you're you're fucking crazy and you're sexy I need that in my life right now. Let's let's hang out can be simple like that Right, but it's that I'm affected by you I'm interested in something about you that's and I've shown you something about me and that's why you're interested in me And we need to continue this then you're gonna definitely minimize your flakes Are you sure because I know tomorrow when you're feeling better you'll go hang on a minute I was in a grumpy mood yesterday, but now I'm feeling better and I should have talked to that guy I'll walk with you for two minutes. How about that?"}
