I just know that they come to me and they say things like, all right, I work in front of a computer all day and I have to figure stuff out in a linear and logical fashion. And I'm glad you guys are doing that because that means that we get telephones and finances that work and machines and buildings that don't fall over and all of the amazing things that analytical scientific thinkers have created for us artists to just waft around in and have a pretty cool time with and be able to use these machines like, wow, I can just access all of humanity's knowledge by doing this. So thank you for doing that. Please continue. However, you guys know this better than anyone that this often leaves you in a position where you, if you're trying to go from that type of thinking into a social flow, there is often a really difficult glitch to step from. Most of my clients fit within these realms and I need to be able to give you guys effective tools to be able to shift gears essentially. So the first thing that you need to take on board is that your adherence to and your commitment to analytical thought is your downfall, right? The vast majority of the day you could actually spend outside of, particularly if you're in a field where you have to use this logical linear thought process to solve problems. Okay, that's your job. You've got to do that. Fine. But every other moment, pretty much, except for when you need to make linear decisions, could be spent in presence and awareness. Transcribed by https://otter.ai"}
