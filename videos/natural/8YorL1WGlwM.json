And I know this because this used to be my game. So while I'm in town, I thought I'd do a quick Ask The Naturals for you. This one is from Tom Grer and it says, James, I'm a fairly good looking guy and a thoughtful person. He's a catch. When I'm alone, like walking down the street or entering the bus, etc., a good number of women check me out. However, when I'm with my friends, three or four other dudes, I feel like I'm losing my power. I feel like I'm just another dude in a big mass. Girls don't look at me or if a girl comes to our company, she may or may not want to learn about me. Is this normal? So you've said you're a good looking guy and when you're alone, girls are checking you out sometimes. That's cool. And you're worried about that when you are within a group that you don't have this power. Now, the main issue here is that you are relying on and that you are invested in girls checking you out at all. To be honest, I'm a better than average looking guy and I dress very well thanks to years of hanging around people who have got good style and working with what I've got. I work with my face structure and my hair and so on. So I do get looks from girls sometimes, which is fine. And of course, once you start walking around the streets with presence and awareness, once you hold your head up, once you start facing the world at eye line, once you dress well, once you walk with confidence, then you'll start getting more feedback from girls. You'll start getting looks. And this doesn't mean you have to be a model good looking dude. Any man that walks with confidence, dresses with a cool style and knows who he is and has some presence about him will start getting looks from girls. Every day, every girl that's not, even if she is amazingly in love with her partner, she's checking dudes out. And so you will get these, what they say, IOIs from time to time. If you're relying on that in order to be able to approach a girl, then you are going to fail at this miserably. And I know this because this used to be my game. Well before I got into cold approaching at all, my game was, such as it was, was being in a band that wasn't very famous, play gigs, hang out at the bar afterwards, stand there, trying to look as cool as I could. So I'd do the cool things, which is like pick your pose and sort of stand there. This is before mobile phones, so I couldn't pull out my phone. So I just stand and I had a few moves, had this one. I had the one where I'd glance, I'd look and I'd see the girl looking and then I look away and then I look at her again. That was one of my moves. And I had the ones where I'd walk past the girl and she'd look at me and then I'd look at her. Had that move. Yeah, that was pretty much my moves. So that had the result of making me sometimes feel like I was kind of cool and sometimes girls would look at me. And if we're going to use decimal points, these would be girls that were below the seven range because they were looking at me and going, okay, he's more attractive than me. And so I'm going to try and get some of those genes in me, in my genetic hypergamy or whatever drives women. But it didn't actually get me anywhere, really. Like occasionally I would say something to a girl or maybe a girl would say something to me and then something will get started. If you're relying on your looks, whatever they are, the best you're going to get is girls that are less attractive than you, who have got some game and are trying to move up, trying to hunt guys that are more attractive. And in my workshops, I deal with all sorts of guys, right guys from every age range, every looks demographic, every height, weight, cool, hairy, race, whatever. And every workshop, I have one or two guys that you would consider to be very attractive. Every workshop, you're just like, Jesus Christ, this guy is beautiful. Often those guys are nice guys. As you said, you're a thoughtful person. What the danger is for those guys is if they don't learn game, they don't get to be good seduction. Then at some point, a girl who is not hot, who has game, who's charming, who got a bit of sass and who pulls the fucking trigger, he's going to get that guy and wrap him around her finger and keep him because she knows that she's hitting well above her league. And because the guy doesn't have confidence, he doesn't approach girls, he's not able to go for what he wants, she's going to be able to get him, right? Because once a girl decides to suck a guy's dick and get him in bed, most guys are going to give in to that unless they're very, very living in huge abundance. So it's vitally important. If you think you're a hot guy and you're relying on looks, like you're relying on attention from girls, then you're failing at this already. I remember reading once like on a forum, an internet forum, seduction forum years and years ago. I can't remember who wrote it, but it was a cool thing. It said something like, accept with an A that you are ugly. Accept that you're a hideous human being when you're going out to approach women, right? Now that's not necessarily objectively true. You may not be hideous or may not be an ugly human being, but the idea behind it was approach women as if your looks are not going to assist you in any way at all, right? As if you can't rely on anything visual from the girl because that mindset means that what I'm attempting to bring to the female is everything else aside from my visual representation. Now I'm not saying it doesn't matter. Yes, girls discriminate based on looks. Girls are into certain types of dudes, particularly things like style make a massive difference. If you dress well, that is going to have an effect. So I'm not saying be a slob and don't look after yourself and don't work with what you've got. And if a girl gives you a compliment and says you're attractive, we'll take it, that's fine. But again, relying on that means that you have no agency, that you have no control over what's going to happen. You're just basing it on like going, okay, does she find me hot? And is she going to pick me? And if so, awesome. And if not, well, I'm fucked. Assume that girls don't find you attractive visually straight away. Assume that you are an attractive human being, right, that you have something to give her and work on those aspects which you can have an effect over, which is of course your approach skills, your mindset, your internal states, your belief structures, your logistical understanding, your touch skills, all of this stuff which we work on in seduction is what you should be focusing in on, not whether or not I'm able to be hot alone and hot in a group and whether that makes any difference. So stop fussing about it. The guys that I've found the hardest to teach are the ones that are stupendously good looking and have had women choose them in the past that are invested in looking cool. Back when I had my moves, I was really invested in being cool and maybe to like the outside observer if they walked in the bar and went looking around going, who's cool? And they see me there doing this and doing my thing and going like this. Maybe they go, yeah, that guy's cool. Being cool is stressful, seriously. Cool people have to spend all day being cool. They can't be silly. They can't make mistakes. Coolness is the perception that you are always at ease, always in control, always know what you're doing, you know, always smooth, always know the right thing to say, the right thing to do. That's what being cool is. What's actually real cool? Real cool is Liam McRae. Was that guy Matthew Silver? This is the memory. The guy we'll see in Union Square later. People who are actually able to be themselves, silliness and all, make mistakes, trip over their words, say the wrong thing, accidentally spill a drink on a girl and still be okay with themselves. In my opinion, that's what actual cool is. The investment in like, okay, I'm an attractive guy who's situated, who knows what he's doing, who fits into the social scene, who's got things covered. That guy is not going to get nearly as good ever. He cannot get as good as the guy who goes, all right, basically I'm a dork. The world sees me as a weirdo, as a loser, as an outsider, as a strange man. All these things, people are going to judge me in all different ways. I'm going to accept that. Most of the planet doesn't want to fuck me on sight, right? Accept that. Most of the women on the planet don't look at you and go, yes, I want to fuck you. Sometimes they do. And there will be a dozen girls every day who look at you no matter what you look like, because people have all sorts of tastes and go, yeah, I'd fuck him. But even that doesn't really matter. It doesn't help you unless you go over there and make a move, assuming that you have no inherent, you're not entitled to anything, right? You're certainly not entitled to women wanting to fuck you just because of the way you look. Even though I'm an above average attractive male, I have to go and hustle just as much as anyone else. And I'm going for girls that are hotter than me, way hotter than me, right? So when I'm walking up to a girl that's technically a 10 and I'm a whatever, less than her, she doesn't perceive me as particularly being interestingly attractive. She just goes, all right, it's a man. And from that point, I have to work and prove myself to myself, to her, and make something actually happen. So that's my main answer. I'm not fucking worrying about whether you're good looking or not good looking. And guys are always talking about this. They're worried about, do looks matter? Girls are only interested in this kind of guy, whatever it is. Yes, women discriminate. Some girls are only into super tall guys. Some girls are only into black guys. Some girls are into whatever. People have tastes. That's a reality. And if you hold onto that, then that limiting belief, whether or not it's based in some elements of truth, it doesn't matter. It will not assist you and therefore you cannot progress. G'day gentlemen, James Marshall here and I'm actually outside my old high school back in Canberra, Australia. And this is where I first learned my moves, how to try and look and act cool and hope that women would notice you, which didn't work very well. Eventually, I figured out another way and now I'm teaching it full time. So if you'd like to take 2020 by the balls and get what you want when it comes to your relationship, love life, lifestyle design, and so much more, then you should consider joining me coming up at the start of May in Budapest, where I'll be running a seven day live workshop focusing in on natural style seduction, meditation, lifestyle design, sexuality, dating, texting, everything that goes into making yourself a modern renaissance man who is not just standing around reliant on looking cool. Click the link below if you'd like to join us. Get on a call with one of our lads and I hope to see you in Budapest in May. And now I'm going to go and get another meat pie. See you later. Bye. Bye.
