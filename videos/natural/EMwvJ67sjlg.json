Proudly. And then someone asked my partner in the dream as well and she said it was 200 men. And I was furious and angry, right? And then I woke up from the dream and I was all angry at her and I was like, I just had this dream that something, something and then you said 200 and she said, that's not far from the truth. The question is from Ratnam, have you ever encountered men with a Madonna whore complex on themselves? So what the Madonna whore complex is essentially the idea that men split women into two categories in their mind, good, nice girls that are sweet and lovely and then whores and the idea coming from the Bible of where there was the Virgin Mary and then there was the prostitute and they were the kind of only two female characters. And so in a lot of men's mind, which I can, we have this idea of like, you know, there's princess, virgin, lovely, sweet girls that you treat in one way and then there's these other girls that are slutty and sexy and bang around or whatever and then you have this thing where it's really hard to reconcile that actually it's their women exploring different things. So have you met guys that have been? Well, based on what? Because this is judging. Yeah, of course it's judging. This is already judging by the look. Yeah, well, often it comes up in terms of, let's say, look, I was very guilty of this with one of my relationships a decade or so ago where I had my girlfriend lover that I love and whatever but she had a crazy sexual past and that made it difficult for me to like try and reconcile that she was mine and she was also at some point a crazy slut who was having fun and that caused me a lot of stress. So the question is, have you had experience with men where that's been a big issue? Well, because we are talking about judging, of course, because everyone is judging and just thinking about something like, I look like a whore, obviously. Why is it so obvious? Because you have blonde hair and I'm just saying that, of course, I experience this all the time because they think that I fuck for money. I never fucked for money but because beautiful girls in these days and most, I think, Ukraine and Russia and Hungary is like really big in that, this kind of industry I mean, I'm not even judging in that industry. No, there's an economics going on here, for sure. But, very diplomatic way to put it. Well, there is, it's like beauty is a currency and people pay for it in all sorts of ways and it gets traded around. But this is gonna be like more and more, it's sad but it's normal on that way that young girls, they choose to sell their body instead of going and learning and working in that kind of areas where she has qualities. Of course, because this is coming from here then people start to judge even more that, oh, if you look like that, probably you are a whore and you fuck for money. Even until today, it's a kind of struggle to make people believe, even like people close to me like ex-boyfriends, they question me, who fucking know me like so deep that I wouldn't do anything like that. It's just, you know, you can't change people's mind. I'm not gonna prove anything to anyone. I can show you my past as a movie and prove it that I didn't fuck anyone for money, I just fuck for fun and if I had a connection with someone. But that doesn't make me a whore. I fucked for money once. A couple of times, I was on a porn, they paid me and I had a sugar mama who was basically paying for stuff so that kind of counts, right? Yeah, that counts. And I also masturbated a Jewish mother every week. So yeah, I did way more whoring. Yeah, so, see, and you wouldn't tell. And are you gonna judge me for that? Yeah, we walk next to each other in the street. Not a Madonna anymore, which one's the hooker? And he was more whore than me. And you wouldn't think because you're judged by the cover. So my advice is on this one, and especially personally because I have this experience, don't judge by the cover that much. Like try to figure out who is she? Where is she coming from? Don't ask too much about her experiences if you don't wanna know the answer. You want to know things, but after that, you judge on that person and you ask about her past. It's a kind of trap that someone is walking into and the girl should be conscious enough to say, I'm not talking about my past. And then you don't think I'm a whore. Yeah, you wanna hear how I fucked that up so badly with my ex? You know, I met this woman, I knew she was like cool and hot and was involved with kind of powerful dudes and that already bothered me. And then we moved to Australia and I had this dream and we're having a fight about it cause I kept on bringing it up. And then we're having fights about it. And I had this dream that we were sitting at a dinner table and someone was asking me how many girls I'd slept with. And I said the number, oh, it's something, something, proudly. And then someone asked my partner in the dream as well. And she said it was 200 men. And I was furious and angry, right? And then I woke up from the dream and I was all angry at her and I was like, I just had this dream that something, something. And then you said 200 and she said, that's not far from the truth. Oh my God. Oh no, that was not a good day. And then I, oh God. But well, it's coming from your insecurities as well. Sure was coming from my insecurities. Well, and like the thing about that though is, I think jealousy and possessiveness like they're human elements, right? And people feel them in different ways. And they are natural in the sense that humans experience them in the same way that any emotion that most people have come in contact with, envy and jealousy and possessiveness of a partner and of her past, these can be issues. And it can also be an issue for a guy if he hasn't had heaps of experience and then he somehow lands a girl that was very social. Maybe she had more experience or maybe he just perceived she did. But I guess the thing that I've come to terms with over years where that was a really big issue for me to where it's something that is just a remnant of and I can manage it and control it if it ever comes up is to really allow for women to be women in all their capacities. The idea at some point that my partner could want another man's dick was the thing that made me angry or made me upset. And now I just accept that humans want to fuck various people and sometimes they act on it and sometimes they don't. And you can't feel diminished because your partner or a girl you like also has desire for or has had desire for in the past because that's an unwinnable battle. If it's like you need to be better than or you need to only be with a virgin. Like what's, how's that going to work in the longer term? Yeah, it's like. It's an unwinnable battle based on you trying to compare yourself to somebody else and trying to force a woman to be something that she is not, right? Because the reality is that women are sexual. They're not built to only want to be attracted to one man in their entire life. So even if under some weird circumstance in these days that happens, which is also very unlikely, you just have to reach a point where you accept that she is the Madonna and the whore. She is neither. She is like, okay, she's a woman with sexual desire. She has cultural overlay. She has, as we're talking about, like an economic overlay even like, because I've been around a lot of women who have been sex workers in some capacity back from the early days in the nineties when it was being a stripper through to webcamming, through to sugar babying, through to. Now it's getting more and more like you. It will be hard to find a woman who didn't do that soon. Yeah, well, it'll be hard to find an attractive woman who hasn't traded on her beauty. It doesn't necessarily mean she's explicitly gone sex for dollars, but the fact that she's going to be invited to fancy things and people are gonna spend money in her direction or on her in order to try and get her into their world or attract her or win her over in some way. I mean, that's nothing new, but it's happening at much more accelerated rates now because women can advertise themselves through Instagram in the way that they used to could only do by going to the local club. So yes, that will be something that people need to be aware of. I also don't have any problem with that. Well, if you don't make a power game out of it, because I think this is the problem where it just fucking up the whole thing that someone is feeling less because they can't afford that, for example. Or he feels that he can't give the same amount of anything to the girl because they have less. But the thing is, and the fact is that you are not less because she had those men in her life. Like you still can have something special together. There is no point to compare to yourself, to these people because they represent different things in her life. My ex said to me, when she was trying to kind of make me feel better, she's like, I don't even remember most of their names. I'm like, that's even worse. She was trying to say like, it doesn't matter. But like, it's true, of course. It's like, okay, in this time and space, if this woman is committed to you or whatever that means in exactly what you are and are doing with other people. And she's there and she's with you now. So she could be like in a boat and fucking rich dudes, but she's there and she's with you."}
