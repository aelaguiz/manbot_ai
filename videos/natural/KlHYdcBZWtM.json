We can move in on someone else's carefully constructed dominance hierarchy that they've been working on in the scene for four years to try and angle to get Susie. And then if I, you know, walk up to Susie on the street and say some cool shit and she likes to look at me, then I can negate all the need for all of that stuff that the person who was trying to build it from social circle accrues. Younger women are more receptive to online dating? Absolutely, but I wouldn't say, the thing about being receptive to dating in person is you gotta understand, like, I mean, I don't know how you feel about this, but I still think attractive women aren't really approached, you know, and when they are approached, it's approached badly. So what we're doing sort of isn't really on par with their initial thoughts about it, you know, in terms of online dating versus being approached in person. Yeah, like, I mean, what I would say is that, like, without question, in our lifetime, things have changed completely. In the sense that, I mean, the idea of meeting online when that first appeared was creepy and weird, right? So that was only creepy and weird people who did that or, like, weird e-girls or whatever. What was it? Did you get murdered? Yeah, that kind of thing. Goth chicks and that kind of stuff. Ones who had Tumblr accounts, you know, those ones. And now I would say, like, in the general ether, the idea of, like, being approached by a man is a weird idea. It is weirder than meeting someone online. However, the vast majority of people are still not meeting online. If you just look at the stats of it, most of the, you know, it's a 10 to one ratio of men to women. So there's nine women for every, you know, there's a bunch of women that aren't online, right? The point is they're still, how are they hooking up? They're just hooking up the same way they always did, which is, like, at parties within the general social world. That's been extended out with Instagram or basically Instagram in the sense that your social reach can be much broader, especially as a young, attractive female. But still, most of those people are just numbers on a screen. She's still gonna be most, like, yeah, there might be some kind of high status fuck boy that gets through the online space to her. But for the most part, she's gonna be choosing guys out of whatever social networks that she has. And therefore, cold approach is still the great equalizer and still the great, like, glitch in the matrix in the sense that we can move in on someone else's carefully constructed dominance hierarchy that they've been working on in the scene for four years to try and angle to get Susie. And then if I, you know, walk up to Susie on the street and say some cool shit and she likes to look at me, then I can negate all the need for all of that stuff that the person who was trying to build it from social circle accrues. So yeah, like, there's definitely differences. And I think probably, well, I need to check the stats on this, but I, and I think I've seen this, but I think that the younger generations, Zoomers and Xs are having less sex and less relationships and less hookups than we did as, you know, because, you know, back in our day, like if you were social and you went out to, even well before pickup, before I knew how to cold approach, you would just go to parties all the time or go to events or gigs or whatever and fucking drink and go over and go, oh, you like the band? And people would hook up. Yeah, that there's probably less of that because people are spending much more time getting their stimulation needs from screens. So, you know, there's a lot more chatting and fucking Instagramming and only fanning and whatever going on than there is people just like hanging out as guys and girls in parks and parties and whatever, like they did in the nineties, man. I think that's also really interesting too, because the whole, the only fans thing too, is also like, we're really, really, really creating an atmosphere. Like, and I'm all about, you know, free sexuality and sex work and stuff like that, but we're really creating an atmosphere where like women are really, really conscious of their desire, like their, this is so weird to say, they're really conscious that they can be treated as a commodity. And there are a lot of girls that are like, yeah, I dated fucking three guys and it was shitty, so I have an OnlyFans and you paid $12 and that's my romantic life, you know? And that's, you know, we're going through a weird time where Tinder started and, you know, everybody had an Instagram page with like 100 followers and hot girls would be like, jeez, I hope I find that guy. And now hot girls post pictures of themselves on Instagram and they have 50,000 followers and a lot of them are like, well, I deserve to be married to the chic and so I'm not gonna mess around with these guys and it doesn't work that way, you know? Like, so a lot of like, a lot less sex, a lot more dissatisfaction, a lot less appreciation for what sex is and what it can do and that connection between two people. And that's been very weird too, you know? Yes, and there's no point railing against it in the sense that it's absolutely gonna keep on being like this. It's like, how do we work around, how do we work around these newer dynamics? At the end of the day, like women still need men and the best way that we've, is still to just go and talk to them. Yeah, just to show them, yo, this is it. It's in real life and they go, oh, fuck. It's in real life and they go, oh, fuck."}
