Now for years, men have been asking me, am I going to write a book and when is it coming out? And for years I've been saying, yes, I am writing a book and it's coming out very soon. Today, I am very excited to announce officially that the book is finally coming out. That's right. It's finished. It's ready. And this April 2016, you and the rest of the world will have a chance to get your hands on a copy. It's called A Natural History, brackets, The Seduction Journals of James Marshall. And right now, hopefully on the screen, you'll be seeing some kind of trashy 80s animation of the book itself. Now, this book is not your average seduction book. It's not a collection of tricks and tips and theory so much as it is my own personal journals, diary entries, essays, musings, and various other stories about my development from being really shit with girls to being exceptionally good with them. I actually wrote the majority of this book way back in 2006 through to 2008. And these were the years when I first got into seduction formally, when I first started going out and cold approaching women. And during that time, I meticulously documented the entire process. So I wrote journal entries about almost all of the seductions that I went through during this period. Also, I wrote in-depth journals about how I was feeling, my mindsets, what was going on for me personally, the struggles, the self-doubt, the self-loathing, and all of the breakthroughs, breakdowns, and wacky adventures and stories that happened to me. So this is a very personal account of my own journey. It is totally uncensored, no holds barred. It is dirty, grimy, wild, sex and drugs and rock and roll soaked. I definitely dished the dirt on myself as well as the other naturals that I was hanging out with at the time. And of course, all the ladies that we encountered during our adventures. My story is quite different, I think, than the average dating coach. A lot of the guys who went on to become seduction coaches tended to come from fairly technical backgrounds. They didn't have much experience with women until the point when they started to go out and approach and figure this out. My story was quite different. I was very bad with girls when I was growing up. I was a dorky, big-nosed, flute-playing, wimpy, kind of effeminate guy growing up in rough sporty schools in Australia, getting beaten up because I was a bit of a poofda, which means gay for those who are not Australians. What I did early on is I started to develop myself, not specifically to get girls, although this was definitely a driving force. But what I did is I got involved in a whole lot of aspects and lifestyle activities to further myself, to improve myself as a man. So early on I got into theatre and music, I got into martial arts because I was beaten up a lot and I needed to learn how to protect myself. I definitely wanted to get good with girls all through my teenage years and early twenties. I didn't know how to cold approach girls, I didn't know how to go and make something happen with a stranger, but what I did do is develop social circle, the ability to connect with women, the ability to express myself emotionally and all of the other aspects that tend to make a man much more attractive and powerful. So by the time that I came to start going out and specifically approaching women, I already had quite a solid foundation in terms of feeling generally confident, generally clear about who I was and what I was trying to do. However, once I started to go out into the field, I was inevitably smashed like any man is when he first goes out to try this by the ego crushing reality of women coldly rejecting you on the street, of finding out that certain women were totally out of my league. I simply was not capable of seducing them at that time because I didn't have enough experience, I didn't have enough confidence or a strong enough mindset or a clear enough understanding of what women really wanted. So in these journals, in this book, you get to see the internal process as well as the external results of me struggling through those initial periods of being totally lost, of not knowing what to say, of feeling the crippling fear of approach anxiety. What you get to see is me in the genesis of the man that I was to become over the next 10 years. I think when students or fans look at guys like me or other seduction coaches that they look up to, they tend to assume that we were always like this. Guys might look at me and think, okay, this is a guy who's got it made, he's successful, he's got girls in his life, and that's true, but I was definitely not always in that position. And in this story, you'll see me coming from that position of being totally broke, totally alone because at that time back in Melbourne, I didn't have any wingmen, I didn't have any single male friends, and I didn't have any mentors to teach me. So at first I just went out cold and tried to figure it out. Over the course of this story, you'll be introduced to some very interesting characters. The other guys that I did come in contact with in my years of training who were exceptionally good naturals. These are guys who actually are not seduction coaches. They did some coaching, but they moved on to other things. But they were incredibly formative and incredibly influential to me in terms of being able to start to look at what was the crossover point between these naturals because they all operated in very different ways. As you'll see in the book, we have this introverted, kind of insecure, yet powerful, low-energy seducer of Z. You have the brash, incredibly rapid-escalating club king, Wolf, and the chameleonic social puppeteer of Flows. These are the three other main guys that I started to wing with early on, and we hung out for those two years, going out almost every single day together, learning from each other's styles and working with each other in the field. So you'll be introduced to these wacky, interesting characters and all of the adventures that we went on. If you were to look at the early part of my life, there was certainly no indication that I would end up where I am today. Many of you would know from my backstory that's been talked about previously that I was a very dedicated Buddhist and martial artist during this time. I was very strict, very austere, and really working towards removing myself from worldly desires rather than chasing them. My plan at the time, in the early 2000s, was to move to China permanently where I had been visiting periodically for training to essentially live at Shaolin Temple and become a monk. However, fate and circumstance had other plans for me. I decided before I moved, finally, to China that I would bury myself in hedonism. My idea was that hopefully I could get it out of my system by having as much sex and drugs and madness as I needed to the point where I would be satisfied. I now realize that there never really is a point of absolute satisfaction, and along the way I met a very young but very powerful seducer, who in the book I call Wolf, who made an offer to me. He asked me to join him to start what at that time was the world's first natural seduction company. I agreed to spend six months with him. I said, I'll give it a shot. We can try this business thing. My condition is that you and I go out every single day, every night to work on seduction because I want to become an absolute master at this. So we made this agreement and began this journey together. Obviously, I didn't end up in Shaolin Temple. Sex, drugs, rock and roll, and coaching took over, and during this book you see my transition as I go from that very strict, kind of humorless, rigid young man to being someone who was much more expansive, creative, and definitely much more seductive. The book itself contains dozens of my early seduction stories, going from approaching fairly average, not that hot chicks who were irritating, and going on excruciating, expensive dates and fucking it up, and ending up with chicks who were really annoying, through to as I improve, as I get much more competent with my skills, and also as I develop much more of a sense of worthiness that I actually deserved better, you see the quality and intensity of the seductions increase. So that over the course of the book, you see me going from working with very average girls to very intelligent, highly coveted, incredibly beautiful women, to the point where towards the end of the book, I'm juggling literally five girlfriends. Along the way, there's also lots of interesting interludes where I'm in China training with my masters, where somehow I end up as the star of Australia's first big-budget feminist porno movie. Yes, that really happened, and I'll explain it all in the book. Through to the adventures of me and my funk band traveling around Australia, and through to me making my first journeys over to Europe, meeting the Eastern European sirens which blew my mind, and which inspired me to build the Eurotour workshop, and eventually to move over here where I am now. You'll also be introduced to a very important person in my life, which was the woman that I would fall desperately in love with, eventually marry, and divorce, and then move on to more wacky stuff afterwards. But it was through this epic seduction and this epic relationship with this woman that I really stepped into my power, and coming out the other side was, I would say, fully actualized and fully complete as a seducer, and as a person, a man who feels at ease with himself, confident, and nowadays is able to travel the world doing exactly what I want anytime, anywhere. So if you've ever been curious to find out how I got to where I am today, to read about all the misadventures, disasters, successes, touring, porn star, Shaolin Temple, dozens of seductions, all of it, I have completely revealed myself, raw, all of my failings, all of my lies, all of my doubt, all of that's in there, which I think is really important for a lot of guys to see, because the truth is, success in seduction is not just technical. It's not just about the skills you learn. This book is not a how-to manual. I released last year my five principles of natural seduction product, which is definitely a how-to product which explains the foundational principles and how to use them. This book is not that. This is an insight into the mindsets, the growth, and the change that I went through, which I feel really is important for guys to see that it is the long game that makes the difference, and you'll see how I was able to keep motivated and to keep picking myself up no matter how many times I got smashed down in order to finally reach the successes that I truly wanted. I feel like it is an inspiring story. It's raw. It's real. It's very, very open and honest. I'm really bearing my soul and everything to the world, and I think you guys will find it useful, entertaining, and hilarious. If you're interested to find out more, here's what you should do.
