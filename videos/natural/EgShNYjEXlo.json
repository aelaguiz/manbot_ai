Nice to see you too. Shall we? What do you do for work and stuff? Oh, I was talking about that before. I'm a graphic designer and started my own non-profit and do triathlons. So all the stuff I was talking about earlier. But yeah, this is just something that I'm trying to let off steam and get out of my head. Do you like going to sort of a bit nicer place? Do you like going out for dinner? Sure. Have you ever been to, what's that new place I like? Have you been to Nobu? It's like a fancy sushi place, right? Yeah. That's definitely not my scene. I kind of prefer to cook, actually. I really like cooking for people. Do you feel like you want to get out of the house, though? Yeah, of course. I'm out of the house every day. But for me, food is a community thing. It's family, it's culture. So I like to be able to share that. And who do you do that with? Whoever wants to come over. Friends, family. Do you not have a bit of a door policy on that? Because I'd find it really weird if I suddenly had a bunch of people I didn't really know in my apartment. It's not just an open invitation on the street. No, it's like, yeah, there'll be people I want to bring over. People that I feel affectionate to, I want to feed them. Who do you feel affectionate to? You mean specifically? Yeah. You just said the word affectionate. I thought it was kind of a funny thing to say. You're saying we're on a date? Yeah. I'm not sure what you mean exactly. I just thought, because if you say about cooking in your house and you're being affectionate, it just sounds like a very particular kind of scenario. Okay. Yeah. I mean, it could be, I guess, under certain circumstances. What do you mean it could be? Well, if I had a date with somebody or I was with a... So you're seeing someone? No. Is that very relevant? Well, yeah. The only thing is that I'm extremely relevant considering we're supposed to be here together. Yeah. Yeah. We're definitely just you and me here. That's for sure. Yeah, but I'm not saying about when we're not here. Because it seems to me like when we're not here that you've got someone else that's actually in your life at the moment. Okay. Well, I kind of think that's fairly irrelevant considering this is our first... I don't think it's irrelevant at all. I don't want to go out and spend my time with somebody who's actively seeing other women. Why would I want to do that? I didn't say anything about... I was kind of talking about cooking for my friends and family. That was where this started. No, I remember that... I think I'm not remembering this right. You definitely said the word affectionate. People that you're affectionate with. That's true. And you did say about having dates there and it just made me feel a bit uncomfortable. Because this is meant to be about me. Right. Well, yeah. That previous time if I ever cooked for someone, true, that was not about you. Yeah, I guess I shouldn't have brought that up. Although I'm not sure that I did bring it up. Anyway, do you know how to cook? No. No. Cool. Alright. So, who was this person? Have you seen each other a long time ago? Yeah, not anymore. No, no. She and I are through. Are you still following each other on Instagram? Yeah. Isn't that a bit weird? Probably. You know, because it makes me feel like it's obviously not 100% over, right? If you are still seeing pictures of each other every day and having that connection. Would you like me to unfollow her right now? Yeah, I think so. Okay, cool. I will. I went right into the... Probing and questioning who I was with on last Thursday night. Right, so I think, I guess I was trying to do a really accelerated, very overt version of wanting, I guess, too early on to establish what the guy is about and what he's up to. And I think that comes down to a lot of scaremongering and a lot of bad media stories saying that, not that all women want commitment, but the general line would be no men want commitment in this modern age, you know, because they've got all the dating apps, they've got so many women everywhere. Okay, well, I'm not talking about you, James. I'm not talking about you. No, I'm just talking about the men who are just like, fuck that, this shit does not work. We do not, we're not buried in pushy, it's not working. Right, but so if women are coming from that space of thinking, their first question going into that date is, is this guy going to be open to a serious relationship or not? That is totally the wrong agenda to have in the early dating stages. It'd be like, why would you want commitment with someone that you don't know? Like you have an experience if you get on, if you have a connection, if sexual attraction has really been established. So I would hold off on any commitment probing questions or any detailed questions. It doesn't have to just be about his ex or that girl that was in his Instagram stories last week. It could also be more subtle. It could be like, oh, where did you go on Saturday night? What time did you return home? You know, all those kind of probing fact find questions. Again, surveillance questions. Surveillance questions, yeah, they come from a space of insecurity. And instead, it's actually good to just be like, I trust in the fact that I am attractive enough. I don't know this person yet. I'm going to deal with that feeling of uncertainty and I'm going to allow myself to just slowly explore this connection. And when it comes to commitment, commitment is not something you try and get or weedle out of someone else. That's something that you mutually give to one another. If you both decide that's what you want and you want the same things. After a long process of getting to know one another and deciding that that's worthwhile. Yeah, because especially when somebody has choice about their partners, they're very aware that when someone is trying to like lock them into a deal that that person is in a weaker position. It's, I mean, like in kind of in any exchange, if someone's really trying to push the deal, then you recognize that that person has more of an agenda and more to lose, needs this more than you. And when you're a guy or girl and you have some choice, it's not an attractive prospect. Better to, you know, chill, give each other space and time to want each other. I just want to say, I really liked how you did that thing for your mum. She's retired now, so she has time. It's finally good to be able to take her to see Gaudi. She's really into the architecture. Yeah, and I know you said that she's doing this novel thing. Yeah, she's been writing it for decades almost. It's the story of her father, but according to her, it's almost finished. I'm looking forward to reading it so she can put that aside. She's a good writer though. Yeah, do you think that's because I know you do a lot of writing as well. Do you think that's where you got some of your creativity from? Well, I don't know if I'm super creative, but I mean, it's a creative outlet at least to be able to express something. Maybe, yeah, she was always encouraging to us as kids artistically. Never told no, told to, I guess, explore. On the flip side of that is ignoring or not being aware of when a woman is making advances, or as I would say, most good seductresses create opportunities. Right, exactly. So whether that's making herself physically the proximity closer, I would say that's probably one of the most common things. You know what my three points I teach to the women that I work with is visibility, eye contact, proximity. So you walk in the room, you make sure he sees you, you're making eye contact with him, you're smiling, and then you just happen to find yourself really nice and close by to the guy. So it might not be in the same way, but a key thing you have to understand is women make effort in their own way within the dating process. She might not feel like it's her role, or she might feel uncomfortable, or she might feel worried about being judged by doing anything that could be considered too overt or too aggressive. But she'll do things like I was doing. I was kind of like, you know, I wasn't like folded. I was like, had my life, the undersides of my arm just there to be stroked. I was trying to be tactile, and I kept trying to do these little mini touches. And I noticed that she touched me, I'm like, oh, I better not touch, but there's a woman near me. And obviously what this communicates, because women do this also verbally, like if she gives verbal hints about like even something like, oh, it looks like I'm about to miss my last bus. And the guy's like, oh, I better get you to the bus then. But if I don't pick up on one of those hints, I'm pretty sure like these are deal breakers. It's like where the woman's really giving you a chance to step into your role, to take leadership and take advantage of the fact that she's open, and you don't read that, you don't move on it. And I've seen a lot of dates not connect where I felt like the man and the woman were pretty compatible because the man was not able or did not feel comfortable to cross that physical boundary and actually make the move to kiss her or something else along those dates. So I think it's not about you, you know, portraying yourself like Mr. Super Arrogant, you're the fourth woman I've got on a date with this week. But it's much more about actually presenting you're comfortable within your sexuality. And I think that's definitely because a woman is going to be really attracted to a man. And it's not necessarily about number of partners or anything like that. It's just you're comfortable with your sexuality, you're comfortable with taking the lead. If something happens, you're going to move this forward. And you're going to be really actually taking those cues from her and being responsive. Yep, definitely. So it's like advanced test, respond. Don't take it too seriously. The cringe of the bad date.
