It's about not fucking wasting this precious finite amount of time that you have on the planet. It's about not wasting your life. And this was a rant that I gave yesterday in the residential that I'm currently teaching. One of the students asked me, how do you keep the spark alive in a relationship when it's fading? And I started to talk about that and then I got off on a tangent where I was talking about how people so often stay in things that are unsatisfactory, whether they be relationships or careers or friendships or cities that they hate, that they're not enjoying. And they end up chewing up years, decades, sometimes their entire fucking life. This is really important. It's a wake up call. So please watch this video. Have a think about where you're at in your life. Are you enjoying it? Is it satisfying? Do your friends respect you? Is your girlfriend the right one for you? Are you living your passion? Because if you're not, nobody's going to reward you at the end for just working hard. Go out there and fucking live it. Also, there is less than 24 hours for you guys to purchase my book, A Natural History, which follows my personal journey from when I was definitely heading in the wrong directions in my life. And with a lot of self-awareness and will, I managed to steer the fucking Titanic away from the iceberg and go off and live an exceptional life, which is not an easy thing to do. It's a risky thing to do. It's a scary thing to do, but you absolutely have to do it. The alternative is stay safe and miserable. So if you want to buy my book, plus all of the extra bonus course material, the six phases of the seducer cycle, which looks at this, the long-term arc of your own personal development in relation to relationships. So how is it that you are going to chart the course of going and meeting women, starting relationships, building an amazing lifestyle over the long term, plus a whole bunch of other awesome bonuses. If you haven't decided you want it by now, I don't know what else to say. So click the link below. All the information is in the page that it'll take you to. Now, this video coming up, please pay careful attention. It could save your life. I've been in relationships back in the early days when me and my friends had our first girlfriends and we're in the like two year to three year mark is when shit starts falling apart. Usually, because that's the mark where it's either like, what are we going to do? Have children to try and make something happen here or buy a house together? Because it's like, and that's when you look, I have had plenty of students who come in and they're like, so yeah, it was okay with my girlfriend for the first few years and then it was really not working. So we decided to have kids. Or we decided to buy a house together or start a business together because we thought that would fix it. And then, and now, and then I'm like, okay, here we are eight years later traumatized children. And I mean, and then you can't say, well, you shouldn't have done it because then now there's children who are like, okay, they exist. And so they love the children and it's too bad. And now that's the, that's the karmic path they've taken. But trying to fix a relationship by adding a huge layer of complication on top of it is the worst thing you could possibly do. And my parents absolutely did that. I'm glad they did, but I'm really not glad that they did for them because it fucking fucked them up for decades. So at that two, three year mark, that's where, uh, I remember me and my guys around when we were like in our early twenties, all of us had a girlfriend around that time. And, and then we started having conversations like maybe we should start going to a salsa class with our girlfriends or something. And that's where you're like, oh no, when it's like, maybe if we do this thing and there'll be the spark will come back. And then I'm trying to imagine us like we've grumpily like learning salsa together, like that's going to fix it. Sure. Go and learn salsa with your girlfriend. Totally, totally do that. Salsa is a cool thing to do. But if you're at the point where you're trying to think of doing a thing together and that might bring the spice back, it's too late. Go and have a few salsa classes where you're just like, oh, what are we doing? You go and fuck Mario. I'll go and fuck Natasha over there and let's just call it quits. The, the getting out of relationships roughly at the right time is one of the most important skills in life. Yeah. It's the, and everyone stays in them longer than they should. And I know you think what you're thinking right now, it's just the way it's just part of life. Uh, everyone stays in them. I, I stay, I, and usually they stay in them about 30% longer than they should sometimes much longer. And we, we often dealing with guys who've been in, you know, 10 years, too long, five years, too long, whatever. If you're in a relationship and just, this is just an aside, but it's really important inside. You find yourself in a relationship and for two, three months, it's been really, really bad. And you, and you guys have, and you, and then you've come and you've sat and you've honestly talked about it and seen, seen, is there some, is there, what's the issue here? Okay. Sometimes the issue is simply that this person's work life is just destroying them. Your, your, your girlfriend's life or your, or your, or, or the girlfriend's work or your work or something in a family or someone's died in their family. Okay. There's an external factor, which is really causing a lot of stress on one or both of you. Okay. That's not necessarily the relationship. Now that's something that, that, that person needs to change or you need to guys need to work out how to change together. I had issues where I was away for five, six months at a time because of my, my lifestyle and because I was traveling too much. And that was reaching a point where she just couldn't handle that. We did that a couple of times and she's like, this is, I can't, it's not enough for me. And so I did, I adjusted my entire life because she's so fucking important to me. I wasn't willing to lose her so that I could have an extra month in Australia a year or I could go off to the Amazon jungle and do my thing because I was living on my, this is, I'm doing what I want to do all the time. And she's has to stay at university in Belgrade until she finishes this year. So I, so I adjusted everything and I said, all right, we'll never be apart for more than a month. And that was the thing. And then it meant that, okay, now, and then the relationship went back to being fucking awesome. Right. And it was on the brink of like, if, if I didn't change that, then she couldn't handle it anymore. All right. So sometimes there's external circumstances that you can adjust and change. And that will can, that is the thing that will keep the relationship going. But if you find yourself in a situation where you had, you were enjoying it, you were connected, you were having a good time. Overall, of course, people fight and day to day ups and downs. But then you find, you notice I'm miserable in this relationship and I've been miserable for a month. Okay. Maybe it's some other stuff and I try and work on it. A month later I go, I'm miserable in this relationship. It's time to leave. And you won't, you'll stay a little bit longer. You'll stay another month. That's okay. Stay another month, but don't stay another year. Don't stay another five years because we don't have that many blocks of five years in our life. Certainly not the ones where we're young and capable and not fucking in wheelchairs yet. So let's make sure that these years that we have left of our prime, whatever, however much they are, that firstly we start looking after our bodies so we can extend that prime and, and after our fucking psyche so that we don't explode our hearts from stress like men so often do because they work themselves into a fucking grave for no particular reason other than that you're, you're supposed to, someone's, the general fucking, what is that Puritan work ethic of, what's the German work ethic based on the, whatever the, whatever it is, the, it's the, the religious, what's the Protestant, the Protestant work ethic that work is virtue, simply work is virtue. The fact that you're working is virtuous is what kills most men. And that is the killer of men. Yeah. It's the thing that gives you the fucking heart attacks. It's the thing that gives you the stroke. It's a thing that sends you into psychotic rages where you eventually blow your brains out. It's the thing that makes me medicate themselves with drugs and alcohol until they're in a stupor. These are very, very serious dangers in men's lives and we are not taught about them. We are taught fucking work, work, work, succeed, succeed, succeed. When you're 65, retire two years later, die of a heart attack. That's what we're taught, right? Don't do that. If it means taking a pay cut, if it means taking a year off and going, I don't know what I'm doing. If it means leaving that woman that is, even is the mother of your children, do it because it's going to be better for the kids anyway. It's going to be better for her anyway. Even if she's like, you can't leave me. I've been, I gave you my life. I'm nothing without you. I can't fucking handle it. She'll handle it. She'll, she'll figure it out. Yeah. Because otherwise you've given your life to somebody else to, to a, to an idea and to labor for labor's sake. It's really serious shit. I don't know how we got onto that, but I feel like it's important. At least we can skip some stuff on Sunday. Yeah, well this is lifestyle. This is lifestyle in terms of like, not, not the like lifestyle I'll talk about on Sunday is the, how do I get new friends? How do I start new cool things? Like the functional, like let's make, let's build a cool lifestyle. Like the TNL guys are enjoying in some, you know, let's have an enjoyable life. I'm looking at the why is that important? I'm looking at the big things. I'm looking at right now, talking about the big picture of the fact that we have this very limited finite time being inside this thing on this planet with, and not in the middle of a war, not starving to death, not living in abject horror like so many people on this planet are and have no fucking choice about it. Western males submit themselves to voluntary slavery often for their entire lives because there is the idea that that is of virtue in and of itself, which it's not. No one, no one is there at the end to go, good on you, buddy. If they are, it's with a watch. It's like, there you go. Off you go. Next, next into the machine, churn them up, churn them up. Yeah. Don't blame that on feminism. Don't blame that. You can blame it on the military industrial complex. You can blame it on the Illuminati. You can blame it on whatever, but blame it on yourself. Blame it on the rain. Yeah. Blame it on the boogie. Blame it on, don't do that. Blame it on yourself for staying in it when you realize if you, as of today, or you guys have had these thoughts, you know, you're people who are thinking outside the box. That's what people who come here, it's not the first time they've ever had this kind of thought before. And it's, and it's the thought that is at the base of the gut of most men as they're going through another year of that grind, another year of that, like, fuck, I'm so not happy with my life. I'm so exhausted. I'm, you know, I'm so whatever. I, when I was 20, when I finished high school, I applied to join the military. And not just the military. I applied to join the officer's academy in Adford, Australia. And I got through all of the rounds of it because I knew my, my father works with the military. He supplies them. I've been around military guys. I knew the way they talked, not like me. I knew they were, I knew the way they were certainly not more like me at all. I, I, I, I, I was smart and I was fit and I fit the, I fit physically. I could, I could be a soldier and I could play the game. And I went to the interviews and I, and they had all these group games and stuff. Cause this is like the elite, you know, you join as a, as a, and you get trained as an officer. They pay for your education and you stay there. Once you're in, you have to stay for nine years at least. All right. You have to go and do your, you get, they pay for it. You do a university degree in the military and then you have to pay them back basically with another six years of your life before, because if you leave, then you have to pay the whole thing back or something like that. Right? So at 18, I was staring down the barrel of joining the place, which was the least like me at all. But I thought my dad wanted me to be there. I thought that it's, it seemed, and I'm not saying that joining the military is a bad thing. For some people it's the perfect thing. But I thought, you know, that's, it's, it seems like a good job. I'll get it. I was even thinking about the dental shit and like the free healthcare and stuff. I'm like, I'm looking back now. I'm like, what was I fucking thinking? You know, you get an education, you, you know, you learn skills, you're part of the team. I didn't give a shit about protecting Australia or any of that nationalist shit. It was just absurd. Protecting Australia from who? What? From America, our greatest ally, really, which is going to nuke the entire planet once they've pissed enough people off. I didn't care about that. It was certainly none of that. I wasn't getting into it because of that. It was like, okay, well, this is a sensible decision. And I got through round after round because there was about five, six rounds of this selection process. And I got to, and every time I came out of the interviews, I was, I was on it and, and guys were getting bumped off in this kind of, uh, you know, what do you call it? Knockout rounds. And I, next time it's just me and less guys and less guys and less guys. And they're only going to choose whatever five out of the 50 that applied or whatever it was. And I got to the final thing, which was the psychological evaluation. And I walked in and every time I left those things, those things, I felt sick in my stomach. I just felt this horror of like looking at my twenties gone. And I was a musician. I was an artist. I was, I wanted to travel. I wanted to go on adventures. And then that I was like, well, you know, let's do this. And then when I'm 27, eight, whatever, I'll come out and then I'll have a bit of money and I'll have a something. And then I can get on with my life. And I sat down on that site last psychological exam with this, with the army psychologist. And he started asking me questions and I was telling him exactly the answers he wanted to hear. And then something inside of me broke a little bit. And he just said, so James, uh, have you ever considered suicide? And I just went, well, yeah, of course everyone has, right? He's like, oh, have they tell me about that? Uh, did you ever make any plans? It was just an idea. I said, well, yeah, of course I did. I thought like, if you're going to hang yourself, the danger, I don't want to, I don't want to hurt. Right. And I honestly thought, well, if I'm going to do it, I wanted to, you want to do it right. You don't want to be in a wheelchair afterwards and, uh, and may as well have a rush. So I think, yeah, probably jumping off a very, very large building. And, um, have you ever had any homosexual inclination? And I said well, I think everyone's a little bit fire, right Very good, and he didn't you know because he's you know, he just didn't flinch at all. He's just right now definitely no And then and then I'm sorry and he said something about your country Hey, and how do you feel about your how do you feel about your country? You know, you know, how do you feel about the idea of protecting your country? And I said well fuck yeah, I'd kill any motherfucking Arab that came into this place and tried to mess with an Aussie Asked me a few bunch more questions. Okay. Thank you very much James been a pleasure Thank you very much walks out the door cross and then a week later. I get a get a letter Yeah, mr. Marshall. Thank you for your something something we and as I read the words we regret I just like burst into tears of joy. I just fell to my knees in gratitude God That was so close and then I went to my dad You know the first thing I did is I got on my bike and I rode over to my best friend John's house and this isn't my Book and we'd agreed that if I didn't get in the army But we were going to India one way or another I rode around and I went to the back of his house and I banged On his window. He had really strict Christian parents. He came to like He's like, I'm sorry, I'm like Just came out and came out the back in his backyard. We ran up the hill We lit this thing on fire this letter from the arm. We put it down. We pissed on it. We scream And we fucking did go to him And that's where all my all of this started and then I went to my dad. I said dad Didn't get in the army. He said I will fuck him. What do you want to do? Oh You"}
