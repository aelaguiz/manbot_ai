For sure, I prefer to have it every day. Don't wanna be stuck in a spot, telling you it ain't what I got. Don't wanna be stuck in a spot, cause I don't really like what I got, so I change shit. First question is about choking. So, can you describe what it feels like, why it feels good, if it does feel good for you? Personally, I think I like that it makes you lose the control and relax the whole body and to free your mind. Like, when I'm getting choked, I don't think about anything, what happens after that. So, it puts you into like a moment of intense presence, and is it because you're not thinking, because your brain's starting to switch off? Something compared to astral, yeah. Like what, sorry? Astral. Astral traveling? Yeah. You feel like you're kind of leaving your body, is that what you mean? Sometimes, like dissociating. Okay. And then, does it physiologically, physically affect you, so does it make your pussy wetter, does it make you more horny, does it affect you in that way? It makes it, yeah, it makes pussy like... Clench? Yes. So, that's why it feels good physically. Uh-huh. So, your body kind of automatically reacts, or do you do something? No, it reacts by itself, yeah. Okay. And is there like a psychological element to it, like the feeling of someone having complete control? Of course. So, explain that a bit. Like any part of all of them dominating actions, of course I like it to feel totally controlled by my partner, and letting him do whatever he wants, because I trust him. Is there any element of it that's like violent, or like a role-playing abuse, is that part of the psychology of it? Maybe, but it's also nice to just feel myself weak, and a little girl next to him, yeah. So, do you like choking? Yeah. Okay. So much. So, what does that feel like? Because it's very sexy, I'm feeling very sexy with choking. Like, you mean you feel like you're more sexy as a woman when you're being choked? Yes, yes. And it's good because in some position you have, I don't know what in English it is. Pressure? Yeah, pressure. Right. So, for example, when you're lying on your back, man's having sex with you and holding your throat and squeezing, that feels really good, yeah? And does it like, does it make you stop thinking, or does it make your body feel good? Like, what is the effect of the choking? In my head, it's like fog. Yeah. Like a trance. Like in a trance? Yeah. Okay, right. Because you're like, there's not much oxygen, so you're kind of a bit... Yes, yes. Passing out. But don't use choker all the time, because it's not good for health, I think. Yeah, it's very dangerous if you don't do it correctly. Yeah. Have you had a man do it badly or a woman do it badly? No, no. Really? Yeah. You've always had good choking? I'm lucky. That is very lucky. Okay, good. But yeah, as you said, it's not good to do it for two minutes, you know, just continue to hold it, right? So like 10 seconds, 20 seconds, and then let go or something like that. Yes, yes. So tell me more about this. You're talking about it feels good to be completely controlled, right? So, you know, for some people that would be the opposite of what they like having. What do you get out of being controlled sexually? Well, I guess it's also connected to this fact that we all are living our lives and having to control different things in life, like a job and other stuff. And we all have responsibilities. Yes, responsibilities. I think it's something we need sometimes to have sex, like a psychotherapy, so we can just lose this control and get this feeling of being irresponsible. Non-responsible. So it's like you're handing the responsibility to the man. And if you trust him to do it well, then you don't need to make decisions. You can just forget about your responsibilities, your stresses, and then knowing that the man will take you on a journey. Yes, because I can't do it all the time in my life, but probably only in sex I can give my partner the whole responsibility and enjoy it. Have you had experience with men that are not necessarily submissive men, but not very dominant, where you have a sexual situation where the man's not really taking the lead very much? It's not that he necessarily wants to be tied up or something, but there's not a lot of polarity. So have you had this experience and what's that like? Yes, I had. And that's exactly what I was talking about a few minutes ago. It makes me take the control by myself. It makes me having to be the dominating one. Because otherwise it would be super boring sex. That's why I'm trying to save it and take this proactive role. Sometimes it's fun, but if it happens with the same guy all the time, I think personally I wouldn't keep on seeing him. So the type of sex which has dominance, which has polarity, is kind of necessary for you as a prerequisite for a relationship, let's say. Like if you had a guy who was, let's say, very vanilla, never spanked you, only does three positions, you know, he might be doing it well, and he might be able to make you come and know your body well, but let's say he doesn't feel like he's allowed to or doesn't really know why, doesn't understand the dominance thing. So without that, you think it wouldn't work long term? Sometimes it's a thing that can be fixed with time. If I really like the guy as a person, yes, sometimes it takes time and I feel like I can help the guy get this energy, masculine energy out of him while sex. If he's not too confident, it also just comes with time to get trust between you two so he can start to explore it and try step by step. And I had this experience once, well, let's say it took half of a year to see the guy turning from this kind of vanilla guy to... Bit of a beast. Yes. So you trained him or you encouraged him, let's say. Yeah, but he also was skilled from the start. So it wasn't a boring sex. It was still good. Did you do something specifically to encourage? Like, did you tell him, do this to me? Or was it more like you were trying to give him signals that you liked something? Yeah, I didn't tell it by words because I think it could also make him feel not good enough for me. So I wouldn't like to make him feel this way. And yes, it's more like being weak and feminine by yourself in the first place. When you're giving him this energy, it can... Inspire. Yeah, make him feel like a man. Yeah, I think this is the key. Yeah, I think, I mean, it's a fine line because yes, men do have like fragile sexual egos often. And yeah, I mean, I've had it in the past where a woman has told me like, do that better or do that harder or something. And it's not as inspiring as a girl saying, I love this. Can you try this? Like in a way that, you know, makes you feel like you are still the man in the situation. So can you tell me what are some bad things that men have done in bed that you don't like? Totally, I don't like when I suck dick and my head like this and men just, good job. Mark, please help me. Right, that's a very, very important point. Yes, it's unreal important. When men help me, I think, oh, wow. See, that's really interesting. You phrase that as help me because I teach this to guys, you know, take the hair out of the way because it gets in the mouth and it's... Yeah, because it's not comfortable for me, not comfortable for you. And it looks much sexier when I hold your hair. It's excellent. Okay, good. So take note, gentlemen. That's one thing. All right. What else is bad things that guys do? When they kiss me, like... Right. It's... You all, wow. You haven't any makeup because she just cleaning this. Right, so... Yeah. Okay, because, you know, when we are kissing in these scenes, when I first kissed you, I noticed instantly that your style was delicate, soft. And so sometimes you have a man who's like licking and doing too much. When men licking too much, it's so fucking terrible. It's like dog. Yeah. More bad than dog. Fine. I prefer dog, yeah. All right. And what else? Other things? So much stronger, all time. All time spanking, all time just... Rough touch. Touch and... So with me, so bad dialogue. Right, just saying nasty words. Yeah, yeah. It's good for combination when you're soft and then you're strong. Domination, strong, soft, strong. It's good. Because you can charge when all time stronger. You get tired. It's like too much pressure on you all the time, right? And so you can't enjoy in total. Right, because you don't have time to catch your breath and relax. If it's pain, you need some time to recover before the next pain, but then it gets too much. Yes, yes. Because I have just red skin and they touch me. It's not okay. Right. Right, so you're saying that you do like strong rough sex and hard spanking sometimes, but it needs to be mixed in with the softness so that you have these different sensations. Yeah, of course. And more bad with me. It's when a guy don't understand how to do knee lingus. Okay. What? You know, where is clitoris? Why you say this? No, please. A bit lower. Yeah. Right. Have you, in that situation, do you try to explain to the man? Do you ever say, do it this way or? Yeah, of course, of course. All the time, I think it's, I know just two guys who understand how to use it. Right. And all guys, it's like, no, turn right, turn left. Down, please. Not so much. You're not so cat. And do you find? Be more soft because all guys, more guys are doing this very stronger. Like with a sharp tongue? Like this or? Yes, like this and just. Like biting? Yeah. Biting your pussy? Yeah. Dude, don't do that. Yes, please. I mean, you can like sometimes, you know, just like kind of pretend to bite. Like, you know, I might just put my teeth on. Actually, don't even do that. Don't bite pussies. Is that common? Yeah. Really? Wow. Okay. You need to master this. I'm doing what I can. And so when you tell a guy, you know, go left, go right, go down. Do you find, do they listen to you or is their ego stop them from listening? Yeah. Something like, listen to me, but something like, I know, I know. Yeah. Right. So, so you've told him, can you do it this way? And he says, I know, I know what I'm doing. I know. Just relax. Just relax. Can you talk about, um, any common or let's say mistakes that you've experienced with guys sexually? Like things, maybe they thought they know what they're doing, but they don't. Different, like maybe not great at communication or technical issues, like any problems you've seen? I think it's such a big list can be. Yeah, give me a few. Okay, for example, I don't like hyperfixation on my orgasm. When the guy makes it his first goal and I feel kind of pressure on me and it turns me off, of course. It's easier to simulate and just not make it last for hours, let's say. Also, I just want him to think about his own pleasure too and not make my pleasure 100% the most important thing in sex. Because orgasm isn't actually the necessary thing, not always, let's say. Yeah, that's an interesting point because I've heard that from women before. And he's doing it from a good place, he's trying to please, but then it becomes this kind of frustrated thing where he's working away. Yeah, when he's working for an hour and I can see him tired and wet and of course I don't want to... Exhaust him. Yes. I think that's a really good point because that kind of comes into play with this idea of giving and taking, receiving and allowing. Shifting between when it's time to take, take. When you want to give, give. Ideally, you're giving without expectation and I think the problem comes when the guy is giving but he has an expectation that he will achieve his goal. Okay, that's a good one. Any other things you've come across which guys do badly or you've had technical problems? Well, I don't like super silent guys. Guys when he controls himself to not make a sound and I also want to hear what he likes or how he likes it more or less. So it helps me to understand what should I do next. So yeah, I think it's important to not be shy, to mourn sometimes for guys. Yeah, and also I guess it's like the man letting go. Like you're getting to see more of his animal beast as opposed to stoic and controlled the whole time. But I mean, of course, I'm not talking about loud sounds or sounding like a predator. It's not about it. Just some natural breathing. And him telling you what he likes or that he's enjoying it. Yes, like if I'm doing this right. And yeah, it's in the same way as it works to girls. I don't think it's much fun if a girl is just silent. It's very weird. I've had it a number of times. I can't imagine. I literally had to stop one time and go, are you awake? She's still alive. Yeah, she was just like, no, I could barely even hear her. Is she breathing? Yes, that is definitely a turn off. Okay. I think those points you brought up are really good advice in terms of letting yourself go a little bit, being able to breathe, sigh, say, fuck yes. I love that. You look so hot giving affirmation back. This is an important part of sex for me too. Communicating through this way. Although you could talk too much in bed, right? Would you find if a guy was talking to you the whole time and you were trying to concentrate, would that be... No. Are we having sex or having a discussion? No, of course not. Only if it suits the moment and if it sounds organically. Okay, cool. But not talking about something or... Not having a political debate. Yeah. Okay. Can you describe what it's like to have sex with me? And if it's good and if so, why? For educational purposes, don't worry about my ego. Even if I would worry about your ego, I don't know what would I say that could hurt it. I mean, of course, I'm totally satisfied with sex with you. But... I can see the weak sides or moments. You cannot? No. Okay, so tell us about the strong moments. What is it about what I'm doing? And it's not about what I'm doing. We have a dynamic together. But what is it about what happens with us that you find works really well? Maybe you can think of specific things or the way it feels or both. Well, I feel like you can predict what I want and feel what is right for me or not. You're always one step further than me. And... Yeah, as I said before, you're like an absolutely dominating guy. This is what I like the most. And so when you say I'm absolutely dominating, like, obviously I can be rough with you, but it's not... Like, what's the difference between a roughness or dominance where it's not really... I'm using you, let's say. And I can use you in a good way if it's like part of the play. Yeah, but I still always feel myself respected next to you. Anything you do, you do with respect. I kind of can be sure that you're always caring about me while bringing physical pain or, yeah, I don't know, choking me and stuff. So this is super actually turning on. When we're having sex, you call me daddy sometimes. What does that mean to you when you're calling a partner daddy? Of course, it's obviously something about daughter-father issues coming from the childhood and stuff. But I don't put exactly like this sense in it when I'm saying this. I just remember you asking me to do this on our first meet and I just liked it. I don't know, it's just, again, it makes me feel like a little girl next to you. So it's something about this. Right, so it's not about like... Well, let's talk about the daddy issues, which I think everyone has really, but boys and girls. What does that mean to you? So would you say you have daddy issues? Who doesn't? Okay, so describe your daddy. How does it relate to sexuality for you or relationships with men? Well, my father always been not too emotional person. So I felt a lack of some sense of warm or loving feelings from him. I knew it as a fact that he loves me, but I wish he could express it more often. So yeah, I think it works like gaining what I've missed earlier, gaining it in a moment, maybe like this. But why would that necessarily be needed to be connected to fathering? Like, let's say, okay, you didn't have that type of emotions at some point and then you grow up and then you're with men. So why would there need to be a connection to the fathering as opposed to I get warmth now from my partners, for example? Well, it's a base of psychology. I don't know how to explain it. It's just, it is like that. So you think it's mostly like childhood imprinting that's kind of created that? It's like trying to put yourself in similar positions as you were when you were a small child and try to fix it in a moment. Why do you think there's a sexual element to it then? Well, I think it's not only sexually. I think it can be seen in different parts of life, in relationships and sex and career, whatever. It's just, yeah, I think everyone is bringing some complexes from their relationships with their parents, both like mother and father from the childhood. So in some way, it always affects a person in adulthood. So yeah, maybe just we should be aware of this and it's not a bad thing, I think, if it's about sex. I guess, in my own case, it only makes the sex better. And do you feel like it has some emotional healing process? Do you feel like that issue or whatever is being worked through or is it kind of like going back in time occasionally? Do you feel like that type of role play has any longer term psychological improvement for you or it's just a game? On a conscious level, just a game, but unconscious, who knows? Do you like spanking? Yes. Okay, so have you had bad spanking in your life? Yeah. Okay, what's that like? What's bad about it? It's too hard. Right. Too hard, not professional. Like with a stiff hand maybe? Yes, yes, like this. And spanking with this thing. Belt? Yeah. And too hard, you mean? So hard, yeah. Yes, you need to understand, guys, if you want to like, you know, use intuitive kind of things. Like a belt can be used, but it's strong, like that's going to really hurt if we don't know what we're doing. So better to use a soft flogger or your hand. And it's not good when you first spanking so hard. Right. You need to be more soft. So when I was spanking you in the sessions and it starts soft and warms up and then you can take a big hit. You like that? Amazing. And what does it feel like? So when I was spanking you, can you describe, does it like, does it make your pussy feel good? Does it, do you get turned on? Like, what is the physical sensations like? Yeah, all my body feeling good. It's not too hard, but it's like, to spanking more and I say orange. Right. So you mean, usually I get to just to the right point and then I don't go too much. You can stop when I want. It's good. You mean, usually I stop. Yes, I don't tell it, but you understand me. So because I gave you a safe word. You understand my body, I think. Yeah, I try to. Yeah, because I'm looking for your reactions. And I know that when I hit like a hard hit, I pushed you to a little bit to your edge and then I soften it. So it's like almost too much and then I back off a little bit. And it's so good when you spanking me and then you just doing this. Right. Okay. So it's not just the spank, it's the touches, the squeezing, the caressing, because that's like a big difference from the spank sensation, right? Okay, cool. And does it make your pussy feel good? Yeah. So you get horny when you're being spanked? Yes. So when I hit, can you feel it in your pussy? Yeah, I feel it. Okay, good. I'm glad. Coming up very soon on the 4th of March, I'm going to be releasing my brand new online course, The Master Lover Method. This is the most comprehensive and explicit sex course that exists online."}
