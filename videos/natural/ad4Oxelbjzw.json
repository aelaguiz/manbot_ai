What's up, gentlemen? It's James Marshall here for the TNL podcast reporting lockdown, day number 643. Today I have an extra special guest. They're always special and they just keep getting more special, but no one's more special than anyone else. They're just awesome. All the way from Taiwan, we have Dr. David Tien. How are you doing, man? Yo, what's up? Good to be with you, man. Yes. So we've hung out a couple of times over the many years. I think we met, was it in Australia at the 21 convention? That's right, yeah. 2011, something? 2012, 2011. No, 2012. And you were like, back in the day, I don't know if you do that, the conference circuit anymore, but you know, back in the day, we were like, we've done our time. Not now. Yeah, definitely not now. Right. So yeah, back in the day when we were, you know, hustling around the world, I would go and speak at many different dating conferences and men's conferences, and there was always a colorful cast of characters. But you were one of the few people that stood out to me as someone with exceptional presence, charisma, and knowledge. And I would say you are the most academically qualified dating and men's coach on the planet. I'm going to say that. Can you tell my audience a bit about who you are and, you know, some of your background and credentials? Because you got some. Yeah, for sure. Thanks so much for the introduction, James, and likewise to you. It's an honor to connect, especially at this time. And great to see your face and to hear how awesome your life's going. Oh, thank you. Yeah, so almost 10 years ago on the conference circuit, I guess you could say. And I started off my career, my first career was as a professor and an academic. So I did three master's degrees and a PhD in my 20s and then became a professor. Can you just pause for a second? You just said I did three master's degrees and a PhD in my 20s. Just for anyone out there who wants to feel bad about themselves. That's a lot of degrees in your 20s. Most people in their 20s are like, I spent my 20s kind of like figuring things out. Well, it's figuring things out and racking up some degrees along the way. But there's ways of hacking that, by the way, in case anyone is interested. But then I became a professor at the National University of Singapore. It was the best position in the world at the time. I was also looking at offers in the US. But I went with Singapore and it worked out really well for reasons I could not have anticipated. Because I also had on the side, as I was writing my dissertation, starting a dating coach company. And back then it was just it was pick up. I mean, back then the word dating coach was a euphemism for pick up. Yeah, it was like how to get chicks in the club tonight. That's what we're doing. Oh, yeah, yeah. In field in the clubs. Yeah. And it was good. That was going so well. And I was having so much fun doing it that eventually I resigned after a few years as a professor and went full time into that. And then I pursued that and persisted with that for several years. And towards the end of that period of several years, it got more and more meaningless and empty. And I just didn't want to be in clubs and do that kind of thing anymore. I looked at ways of tweaking the model so it would be more meaningful, having them work with me for a whole year. And I could take them through a more mature journey. But in the end, I needed to sort out my own issues. So I was able to arrange things so that I could travel around the world in a way. I left Singapore. I was mostly in Asia, but I did every year go around the world through North America and Europe. And I ended up getting a lot of psychotherapy and benefited so much as a recipient of it that I wanted to get training in psychotherapy. So I've in the past over five or six years now been getting training in psychotherapy. So a lot of my work, especially in private coaching, is with a therapeutic model. And I've had training in IFS therapy, Gestalt, Schema, CBT, DBT, DBT Advanced, and working on IFS Advanced, as well as life coaching methodologies and modalities. The Tony Robbins, Chloe Medanus was my first certification. And that's just taken my work in a completely different direction the past several years. But it all comes together in many ways because it's all part of my own personal journey. And it's been really fascinating just discovering that you also have gone on a similar trajectory. And it's been a really meaningful part of my work now. So I'm a therapist and life coach specializing in men who need help initially with women and discovering that their issues are actually deeper and then being able to go deeper with them into resolving their inner conflicts and healing and unburdening. And that's where I'm at right now. So there we go. Awesome, awesome. Well, this is seems like a very amazing set of coincidences to that we're looking at similar stuff at the same time. It's funny, I think that both of us and I've talked to other dating coaches, you know, that I'm good friends with. And there is definitely something about us going through our own 20s and 30s. How old are you now? Turning 44 this year. You fucking bastard. You look like you're 28. It's the lighting. You look the same as when I first met you. And I'm like, I'm looking at my, I don't. Anyway. You look great, man. You look like sexy Jesus. Yeah, I'm wearing my silver fox thing now. It's working for me. But it's interesting that we kind of used this pursuit of our own exploration. And then we coupled that with our own, with our business exploration at the same time and our travel exploration. And that's a big part of what I'm looking at at the moment is lifestyle design, which in the way I would define that essentially is consciously and strategically putting together a life that works, not just in terms of exterior success. Because I feel like there's a lot of information and a lot of good information, but also a lot of hypey information about how to optimize and how to hustle and how to outsource and you know, four hour work week kind of stuff. And a lot of guys that we work with, I would assume anyway, are interested in, you know, kind of outside the box lifestyles, not just, not just the pursuit of, you know, going to the club on Friday night to meet girls. And so it's been really interesting that we've done in this, in this pursuit of business and travel and so on, we've also uncovered our own stuff, right? Our own issues, because I don't know about you, but certainly for me, when I first started doing pickup and then the early couple of years of me doing teaching, I had a lot to prove. A lot of it was about some kind of ego gratification, about showing myself and others that I could get those types of girls that, you know, I wasn't the dork that I used to be that, you know, I could social climb, I could get respect and influence and so on. Like it was, there was definitely that sense of the young man trying to, you know, make his mark. But that certainly shifted for me over years. And I think as we both matured, we've seen that the issues that men face when it comes to, okay, their skills with women, that there usually is something much deeper. And that's something I've been bringing up recently in terms of looking at male shame and trauma. I was wondering if you can talk to me a bit about that from, from, you know, your therapeutic perspective of, of perhaps your own experience, but also your clinical experience, uh, to talk about what are, what do you think are some of the core, like shames or core, like internal issues that men often carry around because that so many, so much of the time, we're not allowed to even express that or it's not encouraged. So yeah, what have you found like patterns in terms of, as you've dug with men over the years, things that keep reoccurring, uh, in terms of their internal issues? Yeah. Oh man, you just said so many really, uh, big trigger points for me to just have all these, uh, reflections. And, uh, one, it was just how we adopted the sort of, uh, nomadic lifestyle in that led to awakenings. And, um, that's a whole, I want to come back to that because that's a pretty deep one. And then in terms of men and the type of shame that they're more commonly struggling with, um, there are a few layers that I've, uh, seen. And the first, the first layer is just feeling in general. So one of the biggest obstacles is being in talking about, uh, psychology is that you don't want it to just be intellectual or cognitive in order for any real work to occur. It's gotta be in the emotions. They have to feel it. And in fact, the intellectual is actually not necessary. They can just go straight to the, to the feeling and then you can heal and grow and unburden there. And many of us have strong intellectual parts. I know your audience, you were saying a lot of white collar workers and, and maybe, um, intellect workers. So they work in front of a computer, they get paid for it. Yeah. And that was one of my biggest problems. And the, the first and biggest obstacle was actually breaking through the repressive shame of feeling vulnerability. So it's, it's one thing to just pay lip service to, yeah, I get, I understand theoretically, I wouldn't even think it, I wouldn't even use the word theoretical for this, but I would say, I would have said back then, I get it. I get why vulnerability is good. I read some Brenny Brown, totally on board. I agree with vulnerability. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I can do both. I can do vulnerability. Right. I'm going to crush vulnerability. Came to, yeah, right. And then when, but when it comes down to it, I get, I used to get really close to feeling the emotion of often it was sadness. Sometimes it was preceded with anger, but the one we were trying to really get to was sadness. And then it was just be like something would happen for me. I know, I learned that my defense mechanisms clicked in really easily and unconsciously where I do something with my eyes. So it would just be like some blinking, some rapid blinking, and then the emotion's gone, or I look to a certain, in a certain direction, or I take a deep breath. And all of these things took me out of feeling the emotion. So I had to learn first to identify what my own ways of repression were, and then to stop doing those things. Or as soon as I identify them to just make it stop, and then come back to what I was thinking and focusing on, and then just staying with it. So it kind of freezing my body language in a way. So I'm not avoiding dealing with that memory or the feeling that's bubbling up, or often when you're about to cry, there's tension coming up around your nose, you know, and you can relieve that tension just by physiology. And instead of relieving it, I stayed with it. And it was so challenging, because it was happening unconsciously for me, that my therapist at the time was getting quite frustrated. He's like, Look, David, we've been on here for 40 minutes, and we've been having a nice discussion, but we haven't done any work here. Like, what do you mean? And then I started to sink in like, Oh, it fucking wants me to cry. You know, and then I'm like, Oh, I can fucking cry. I'm a strong man, I can cry. But I couldn't like not really. And then I actually engaged a method acting coach, because I thought my breakthroughs are on the other side of repression. And in order to pull off this character, well, a sad character, or whatever the emotion is, I'm going to have to actually feel that for at least that time when I'm delivering that line. Holy, it was hard. But then I learned through the method acting coach that I have not just with sadness, but with any emotion that I'm not, that's not part of the toxic masculinity category of emotions. Like, I can act like angry, like Hulk angry. That's acceptable in toxic masculinity. I can act like powerful, dominant, charismatic, I can do all that, because these are all socially acceptable for a man. But when I'm acting, let's say resentful, or envious, or, you know, something like that, like some kind of perceived weakness that a man, a real man wouldn't have, like somebody offended you and gets under your skin, how do you show that? Yeah, okay. Yeah. And then, of course, real sadness, the kind where you're just racking. And so then when I was able to get those breakthroughs in acting, I came back to therapy. And in the therapy sessions, I was like, Okay, I can, I can act, I can cry. And, but I didn't feel like it was sincere. But I discovered that if I actually did that, of just leaning into that emotion that I didn't want to feel, unconsciously, that I unconsciously didn't want to feel that it would then catch up, and I would then be able to start to do the grief work that was necessary. That was really the first step to the healing. This getting to that first step for me was over a year and a half, about a year, about a year and a half of work. But then once that clicked, it was much faster. Everything just started, like a volcano just started going out. And then I found that that is the biggest impediment for achievers, especially male achievers. They see, very commonly, they see sadness as a weakness. Right. What do you think sadness is, if not a weakness? Because I've been reading quite a lot about pre-agricultural tribes. And I always think that's a bit reductive to just say that people back in the Stone Age had it all sorted out, and then agriculture came and screwed humans up. I think it's more complex than that. But certainly, throughout the ages, there have been rituals or processes for both initiation and also things like grief, whether when a tribe would come and grieve, like a ceremony almost, or passages of transitioning from war, coming back into peace times. In various times and places, humans had, as a group, processes for moving through some of the traumas of being alive, because traumas were inevitable, and probably much more so than they are today, for most people anyway. So what do you think, for anyone who's watching this who might feel a bit triggered in the sense of, well, there's two grown men who are supposed to be mentors of men, and they're talking about how they both go to therapy. And it's like, if they have that sense of like, Uh, that coming close to those kinds of emotions, even hearing about them makes me feel uncomfortable. Maybe we can give them a bit of a different mental position on why that's even a benefit. Like some men would be just like, why should, why would I want to face grief or like learn to cry? Or, you know, I, I'm, I'm a tough guy. I'm a guy who gets shit done. I don't like to complain. You know, I'm not one of those pussies that's going to lie on someone's couch for three years and talk about my mother, you know? So what do you, what do you think is like in terms of a practical or like more pragmatic sense of what grief is for? Mm hmm. It's so part of it is the stigma of mental health and stigma against therapy. And a lot of achievers are in their grandiose phase or stage or in their kind of like narcissistic personality or narcissistic part. And when that's happening, then they can't understand why they would need to grieve. And the only thing I've discovered is that you kind of have to wait until they present. So they, there's some, they come to me with some kind of thing that they want to fix or improve and almost invariably that has to do with shame and the, well, the, the belief that you're not good enough and that you need to change yourself in order to be worthy, that you're not good enough the way that you are or were, and that, that is good enough for love specifically, love and connection. And when it comes to the grieving and the sadness, that's necessary because what is being repressed is the grief over the incidents or those micro traumas, as I call them, perceived traumas in your formative years that led you to that belief that you are not good enough, that you're not worthy. And in order to access those place, those memories, those times in your, and those neural pathways, we want to get more scientific that are associated with that time in your formative years. So when a trigger happens and you get triggered and then you basically in a kind of PTSD pattern, you go back into that anger or that sadness or that whatever the coping strategy was back then to achieve or to please or to be a joker or to be a rebel. Those are all different responses to perceived micro trauma or perceived trauma. In order to undo all those coping strategies, we got to go back to the original, the source of that and what you should have been able to do, but you weren't able to do because you were a child is to grieve, is to see that what was done to you, either you misinterpreted it and your dad didn't mean it like that or your mom didn't mean it like that and you took it the wrong way and, and you can grieve the lost years and you can grieve how sad it was for this little boy to have believed that about himself, or it really was an egregious wrong that was meted out on you. And that is sad and you have to go and grieve that. But when you were a child, what happened was instead of grieving it, you said, you stupid kid, you got to be stronger. I'm not going to let this happen anymore. And then you went into some other part, another part of you arose to hide this wounded child. And you said, I'm going to now achieve in order to get mom, your daddy's attention now because they're ignoring me when I'm this way and I can't be that way anymore. So I'm going to exile that part of me. Well, I think that's really profound. And I think for most men, if they would think back over their histories now, just as you're saying that I'm like thinking of just like, and it's particularly when you said like perceived Like I can think about things that happened to me where I was deeply offended and it really hurt me, but it was just that some, an adult was being a bit of an unconscious dick at that time. You know, it wasn't like even necessarily the trauma was a objective truth, although, you know, of course there are objective traumas, but, uh, that, that, that was something that then made me feel bad about myself and I didn't, didn't resolve it. And also that I definitely did, um, try to compensate by, yeah, like proving myself or yeah, being, being a rebel or getting into drugs or, you know, all sorts of different things too. I mean, I don't want to be like draw two simplistic correlations, but yeah, you can see how those things over life, um, definitely affect you. And I, and I certainly can see that with clients that they have swung hard in a, in a compensatory direction. And I, and I, one thing like this line kind of occurred to me when I was working with one client a year or so ago, I don't know if sometimes I have many, most of the times when guys come to me, they're, they have a level of self-awareness that they know that there's something that needs to shift. And then because of the fact that they've come this far, uh, to actually ask for help, they're usually ready. But sometimes you'll get a guy who is so, so, so unconscious of the thing that is, that, that is his schema. But when I sometimes look at them, like the only thing that is holding this man up is the thing that is fucking him up, right? It's like, you can see that sometimes that people just put on these defense mechanisms of humor or of, uh, I don't know, ironic, um, fatalism or all sorts of other ways. And it becomes, and it kind of calcifies into a character, um, and often one that is not so appealing because, because it is a, it is a, it is a mask of some sort. And people perceive that as ingenuous. Um, what do you think about these? Because we, we both work with high achievers, you know, we both work with men who are successful. Um, and what are some of the ways that men put up these masks and do you find that they're permeable? Do you need to convince people or does someone need to reach a crash point or some crisis point to actually, you know, seek help? Yeah, well, I try to convince them all the time through videos and, uh, sometimes I'm successful. Uh, but, uh, when you're sort of like an alcoholic on a bender and people are saying to you, dude, you're an alcoholic, man. And you're like, ah, I'm just having another drink. Just having fun. You're exaggerating. And it's really when he's facedown in the gutter in the morning, he'll be like, yeah, dude, I need help. Right. And, uh, that at that point he's primed and ready. Uh, and, but then you have a small window because if he gets his act together, he's back in the bar. And it's sort of like, so alcohol is an obvious external, um, coping mechanism for an alcoholic, but achievers have their own and achievement is their alcohol. And I've worked with, as you have mentioned, we both work with a lot of achievers and it's when you work with them for the long term, long term, there are periods when they're down and that's usually when they start working with you and then things start to go well. And then for like three, four months, they're like, you know, I don't really need this work anymore. You know, let's just put this on hold and life's going great, you know, and they're not ready to go any further. And then it's really until they get, they hit rock bottom again because the cycle again occurs and they're back at it. And eventually enough of those cycles will occur that you can then say, look, we're just going in circles here. And you're going in circles as you have been in almost your whole life. And let's go deeper. So in terms of just the pedagogy of it, how do you get through to a person like that usually requires them to encounter the depths multiple times before they're really, you know, they're ready to see beyond their mask. But they've relied on, as you said, these coping strategies of achievements, of making more money is a common one, of seeing their self-worth based on their net worth or what their reputation is or how other people perceive them. Like when you ask them, because often they will come to me initially with girl problems or relationship issues. And the single guys, it's astounding, they're still as immature as it sounds. Their ideal woman is often a woman who will make them look good. Like they want to have, they want to be the power couple. So then when they're out there at whatever conference or networking event, when the other guys or people see them together, it'll like double their social value or something like that. And they're still in their narcissism, even when they're thinking about trying to meet their needs for love and connection. And can I ask a question about that? Because I think that's really interesting. The idea of a trophy partner, which I know I've been guilty of and probably still am. Like if like if, I mean, I don't have a, I don't have a permanent partner, but if I was to present to the world with one on the balcony, I'm sure she would be, she would look great. Because it's interesting, this thing, and I've seen this in my life as well, that again, the things that fuck you up are the things that are holding you up. Like I needed all those narcissistic, well, maybe I didn't need them, but I followed certain narcissistic things to prove myself, to like get X amount of girls, to get the hotter girls, and I definitely cared about the fact that people knew that. Like, you know, I was, I mean, as a professional, I was putting up photos of, here's me with hot girls. And like, I certainly had a lot to prove back in the, back in my twenties, a lot more than I do now. Do you think there's a, do you think there is a healthy way to live in that space? Like can you, can you live in the world, but not be of it? Can you have the pursuit of a, you know, a beautiful partner without that being narcissistic? Or do you think that it's like a phase that men go through that, or maybe never come out of? This need to prove externally is always a negative thing or, cause you know, it's, that's the, that's the thing that also makes you build the Sistine Chapel or, you know, conquer the world in some way. It's, it's a, it's a weird paradigm. Yeah. It's also the artist's dilemma. So speaking of enlightenment figures, many, in many cases, the artists were not celebrated during their lifetime. And is it the art? So the, in the analogy I'm drawing here is with a woman, obviously you can have a beautiful wife and, and love her and delight in her beauty. But the question is whether you're doing that for external validation and you're getting off on the fact that others in the room where, where you're, wherever you take her are looking at you like you're the man because you have her. And then it'd be, that's a narcissistic drive. And there's, you can take an example of, you know, those fairy tales about whether you would want like a Shrek and Fiona kind of situation. Like would you want her to be beautiful just for you or, you know, is it the more important thing to have her beautiful when you're out in public? And so, so that's already been known for hundreds of years and that dilemma and those who choose the outward mask because of their false selves are always going to be unsatisfied and unfulfilled dissatisfied in life and they'll never find real fulfillment or, or peace or just joy. And eventually I think they can keep doing that in their 20s and 30s because in my 20s I didn't really care. I like to be, it's hard to coach guys who are just coming out of university because in a way they just haven't experienced life. It's like at a certain point you just can't, it's, it's counterproductive to spend a lot of time on the deep psychotherapy if it's an 11 year old boy, you know, like sometimes you just need to learn how to toughen up and there's a lot of value in what I call that knight or warrior energy of that hustle and grind and hard work and doing stuff that you don't enjoy because it's good for you and, and just becoming a productive member of society because we actually, because the capitalistic system we live in, we're going to have to pay for the food and shelter. You're going to, it'll help you if you're able to create value, even if you don't like it, it doesn't fulfill you and all that. You have to be able to work hard and at that age, the younger ages, that's fine. I think they're not going to get that screwed up yet, but when they get into their forties or late or mid to late thirties, it really burns them out and that hamster, is it a hamster wheel? The rat wheel, they will, they're eventually going to find the emptiness in it. That's what happened to me. If you had told me while I was on my narcissistic bender in my early thirties, all of what I've been reading now and learning now about psychotherapy and clinical psychology, it was actually exposed to me. Like I had a few friends who were telling me, Dave, you know, you should look at this or have you considered this? I'm like, give me a break. That's all bullshit. You know, that's not real stuff. That's not real science. And I was just on a high, everything was going pretty well and I was getting off on validation, all kinds of other stuff. So I really had to hit rock bottom to see that. But a lot of it has to do with just, it runs out, it runs its course in a way. It's also just some, that blind energy of youth, like, I mean, you know, like it just starts to slow down a bit in terms of that need to prove and conquer and fuck and there is such a big thing about that as a young man. We have accomplished it. Like the easiest people to teach this to are those who already are at the top of the mountain and then they're still unfulfilled and you can just point to it like, look, when you exited, you thought your life would be the best ever and now you feel more empty than before. Isn't that telling you something? And then they're ready. And it was in a way the same for me. I thought that my happiness would come from getting the right, the right number of women around me and getting the right type of guy and just even as something as simple as getting the VIP treatment the first time, you know, at the club and all that and getting the celebrity treatment. It is pretty fun when you've been a dork all your life and you're like suddenly like, I'm in the club. Yeah, I'm doing that thing. It's the same with like your first business class flight or your first first class flight or your first time getting upgraded to a suite at the Four Seasons or whatever. It's fun. There's no doubt about it. But it's not going to be like the fulfillment of your life. And I've still, I've still never been upgraded to, I've never been upgraded first class yet. So David, so I'm still waiting. Upgrades to first or yeah, I've never had that either, but you can get it on miles. I probably need a, probably need a haircut before they're going to give me that. So let me ask you a question about worthiness because as you brought up, and this is the thing that we, we uncovered over the years because yeah, I originally started as a take guys out on Fridays and Saturday nights and we're going to get laid and have fun. You know, that was, that was the business back in the day. And yeah, very quickly started realizing that, that, okay, there's internal issues and then saw over the years that the same ones pop up over and over again, particularly as you very loosely described this worthiness to receive, to be worthy of love. So what does make a man worthy? If not his achievements, his utility, his hustle, his, his, you know, his muscles, his power, right?"}
