People trying to get your attention to sell you stuff essentially or to change your mind and get you to vote in a certain way. You will be the victim of that and the person who shouts the loudest or has the slickest production will get your attention. Seeing that somebody liked an opinion that you had for five minutes or a photo that you put up doesn't give you anything other than a pseudo hit of what you're really searching for. Because why do people do that? They want likes because they want community engagement, they want recognition, they want to be part of something. And as we live in these mega insane cities with millions of people where we are in small tiny boxes but surrounded by crowds, where we are separated, where we don't know our neighbours, all of these things have broken us away from what makes us human, which is community, which is collaboration, which is sharing, which is competition with other groups of course, but a sense of being part of something, not just an individual consumer. And that's unfortunately the role that is allocated to most of us. We are simply here to be fed poison, to be taxed, to pour our attention into something, massive amounts of attention, just so somebody can get an extra percentage point on their click-throughs for their advertising for example, like all of this stuff that's drawing this mass of human creativity and imagination, all the amazing things that humans can potentially do, and then leading it all to this completely pointless ends of just being able to sell more widgets. On the flip side, the potential of what is available to you and what is possible to do in this modern age is staggering, even in comparison to me growing up in the 90s. Now you have the ability to cheaply travel all over the world, the ability to set up businesses anywhere, to be able to work remotely, to be able to connect with people of interest in different scenes or different things you're interested in all around the world at the touch of a button. The ability to connect, to collaborate, to create international communities, to travel, to make money whilst on the go, to be able to start something entrepreneurial with almost no capital. This has only become possible in this modern era. I would not choose to live at any other time at all. I'm not here complaining and saying like in the good old days back when you used to read a book and look out the window when you're on a drive. It's like I'm glad that I got to experience the transition between these two very different ways of living, but this one is vastly superior in terms of what's possible for me to achieve and many people who are willing to live outside the status quo. It is very possible to balance the positive and negative aspects that are existing in this time and place, but only if you do that consciously. Because we are flawed, because we are fallible, because we are easily addicted to shiny things and buttons that press and things that make our dopamine level spike. All of us, no matter how spiritual or elevated you think you might be, you're still checking your phone, you're still validated by your Instagram likes, you're still wasting massive amounts of time online, unless you are conscious of that. So what's really important to do is to take the best of the time and sometimes that means making drastic changes in your life, moving cities, changing jobs, rethinking the philosophies that your parents gave you that said that the only way to do things was to study hard, get a good job at the local firm and stay there for 30 years. Things that have become redundant and changed in this last generation, you have to be able to adapt in order to keep up. If you want to be able to live an amazing life, that may mean you need to move cities, may mean that the thing that you studied is not the thing that you should pursue. You need to be willing to adapt at the pace of change and the pace of change is incredibly fast at the moment and unless someone drops a nuke on us, it's going to continue exponentially over the coming years and the problems associated with that are going to get worse. What happens when you have an entire generation that was brought up staring at a screen? Millennials are different than us. We were brought up looking at comic books and going out and kicking balls, even those of us who are quite uncoordinated, not very sporty and now you have generations that are just brought up by screens, by this constant flickering images, by very short punchy little bites of information that people can't read an entire book anymore or watch a whole movie or sit through a lecture. They only take highlights, they only take the most garish and clickbaity things. This is over time going to affect society more and more and people are going to become, large numbers of people will be unable to concentrate, will be unable to be present and that's the crux of what I'm getting here is that if you don't create some buffer between you and the outside world, you will just be constantly bombarded with information until you die. People trying to get your attention to sell you stuff essentially or to change your mind and get you to vote in a certain way. You will be the victim of that and the person who shouts the loudest or has the slickest production will get your attention. Black Friday has passed but lucky for you, Cyber Monday is upon us.
