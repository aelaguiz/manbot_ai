It's challenging. There is a massive amount of men on this planet who are unsatisfied in their dating lives. You see beautiful women walking by every day depending on what street you're on or city you're in and as a red-blooded male you want to interact with them. The issues that men face are not just the words that they have to say or the texting that they need to do to get a girl. They need to understand themselves at deeper levels. We need love, we need connection, we need intimacy, we need hot sex. We need to feel respected, we need to feel supported. And yes, we get that from family and friends but the intimate relationships are vital. This is possible. Other guys do it. They're not celebrities, they're not catwalk models. They're normal human males and they can do this and therefore you can do this. And I do challenge you to ask yourself what really is going on in your dating life? When was the last time you had a date? When was the last time you kissed a girl? When was the last time you had a beautiful girl sucking your d*** and looking at you like you were a god? Because if the answer is months and months, that's not okay. Natural Lifestyles Natural Lifestyles Eurotour Natural Lifestyles Eurotour Natural Lifestyles Eurotour Natural Lifestyles Eurotour Natural Lifestyles Eurotour So, welcome to the Natural Lifestyles Eurotour. I will be leading this workshop and I'll be working with you guys on your physicality, on your presence, on your posture, on stretching, on hip and spine mobility. So stuff to make you look and feel sexy. And so my hope and my role here is to help you guys to look deeper into your core, to understand your relationship with fear and anxiety and your emotions, to really get a sense of what embodiment means in a functional way. So your relationship with this physical structure that we inhabit our entire lives and how that can be used as a sex machine as opposed to a brain on a stick. It's good to be here with you all. I've been part of this crew since the very, very early days. 2008 I think we started this thing and been through many different evolutions and workshops and been worked with thousands of guys now I think over the years. So this is something that I've done a lot of. My specialty is to really help you with framing and understanding the journey from different perspectives. And I'll be doing a lot of infield stuff with you guys but also the morning workshops which would be a great time to do a bit of conversation debrief as a group as well as looking at mindsets and let's say key kind of understandings and technologies that can help you to integrate the experience. Yeah, my name is Virag and I've been working with the guys for five years now. So we've been through a lot of adventures and I think I got a pretty strong base of knowledge and experience next to them. How to treat situations and how to use their frameworks and I did my own life experience. So also I'm honored to be here and represent the female perspective and excited to just support you through a huge transformation. I'm going to help you in so many ways putting loads of pressure on you and kicking your ass when it's needed the most. Also when you are feeling like a little bit down or crying then I'm here to give you a big mama bear hug but after I push you again. So yeah, I hope you are looking forward to this at least as much as I do. Hello guys, I'm Alex. I joined this WECI team back in 2014 for the first time. I just ran through my head all the kind of developments and transformations I went through in those years and it's incredible because there are many of those. I'm really excited for you guys because you got in touch with this team in 2021 now today and this is a start of a journey of a lifetime for you guys because as everybody said we will teach you so much and it's so much that you can use for the rest of your life. It's about communication. It's about connecting with yourself. It's about understanding women. I think if you talk about speciality like one of the things I like doing is try to see everything from her point, from the woman's point. Like how does she feel right now? What does that mean to her? Like why does she react like that? I'll be with you not on all the days but on most. One of the biggest things to keep going in my experience is to really develop joy of this because it's joy, right? It's not like I had to fight and work hard for the last seven years and now I'm at this joyful point. No, I had fun along the way. It was a great journey, right? And it will continue to be a great journey so I want you guys to have that mindset as well. Hi everyone. My name is Jonas. I'm from Denmark. So why am I here? Part of my way into finding you guys and finally signing up for this workshop. Last year, almost sort of kind of like at the start of the pandemic lockdown across Europe, I think I changed like one or two gears in approaching because before that it had been like random and chaotic and not really a planned or conscious thing and the results were thereafter. And at some point I think I started watching more sort of dating introduction videos on YouTube and reading about it because I was not satisfied with sort of my experiences with women and there was some frustration there. And then I think at some point I was like, okay, I'm fed up with this. I need to find someone who can help me. I mean, there's like a million coaching companies and they have way more followers and et cetera. I think it has something to do with perhaps something about me feeling that I can, to a higher degree, relate to you guys. You seem more human. You seem more rounded. I mean, you seem to not be afraid of showing the full picture, including all the bad stuff and the bad feelings and heavy stuff like depression. And I think it seems very authentic and that I think it's something about trust, seeing that and feeling that I can trust it, but also that I feel sort of, should I say, safe to be myself. I'm super excited to finally be here. And I'm also like, I have a little bit of that sense, you know, like when you're in a roller coaster and you've decided to go on it and then when you finally get all the way up and it's like, oh shit, now it's really going to happen. Am I ready for this? It took me like forever to fall asleep after the last day. The thoughts were just spinning around in my head and I went out on the balcony at I think three o'clock in the morning and tried to sort of, you know, do something else instead of just rotating in the bed. I expect to be thrown out of my comfort zone, be thrown out into things where I perhaps has a tendency to sort of do it in a more controlled fashion if I'm on my own, like slowly ramping up, approaching, slowly trying out new things in a safe way, not taking too much risk. My name is Kevin Today. I'm 29 years old. I'm originally from Chicago. I've been living outside of the US for the past seven, eight years now. I've been approaching before. I first saw James back in 2013. So I had a friend who introduced me to a James video. TNL was sort of the first guys who really were projecting the idea of natural game. But then, of course, as I dug into TNL, I'm like, oh, natural game is the thing I Google for. And then I found a bunch of other guys. But the other guys, I didn't want to be. You know, they didn't inspire that respect in me where I'm like, oh, I want your, like, I want to be you. You know, you are a role model for me in terms of the man that I want to become. One thing that James said yesterday, which was really cool, was he's like, these are all the coaches. Every one of them is way better than me at at least one thing. And I was like, cool. It's like the mark of a true leader, right? Like somebody who's surrounding himself with people who are better than him. And that was, I think that was kind of the moment where I'm like, okay, cool. He's really like in person as well as on YouTube. Okay, so first we're going to start with the easy one. Hi there. What were your favorite thing as a child? Going around. Enjoy your day. I don't mean to be weird, but... I'm not... What? Let's try the marry me. You don't want to marry me? Marry me? Okay. Hang on for just one second. I really don't understand. Very little English? Little English. Okay, okay, cool. Little, little. I have a very strange question for you. Okay. Will you marry me? No, I'm sorry. You won't? No. Oh, my heart. I have a boyfriend. You have a boyfriend? Lovely boyfriend. Oh, maybe we can just talk then. He would get very upset, right? Yes. Again? Again? Oh, again? Oh, yeah. Yeah, no, no, come on, come on. It's going to be good for the Instagram. No, no, no, no, no, no. Here we go, here we go. Oh, how cute. Zhenya, hi! Oh, my God! Yes, yes! Thank you. You're a good sport. Nice to meet you. Thank you. I hope you guys have a good day. You know, it's going to be a problem when there's one that says, yes, let's get married. I have a question for you. I know it's weird, but... Okay. Do you want to be my girlfriend? What? Will you be my girlfriend? No. No? No. Hello. Are you crazy? Oh, no. Are you sure the answer is no? I think I'm just going to sit here for a while. So what am I supposed to do now? Enjoy life. Let's record how the guys are feeling after the social freedom exercise. This. I'm feeling free. Yeah? Free as a bird. Yeah, okay. And you? A little bit less free? A little bit less. I mean, I'm still up there. I feel that there's still potential. I sort of, within the last five, ten minutes, I really sort of cracked it, I feel. I'm very much the type that is kind of like, want to be in control. Did you come here to be in control? No, no, no. I come here... Came here to get wrecked. So that's maybe the time for us to start to make it conscious. Why the fuck we are here? Why did you want to come here? Pick up chicks. Exactly. That too. And so many other things. Like changing yourself on really deep levels. But this is how we start. We talk about it. And you try. And you do it anyway. So it's a great fucking job for both of you. You have to work on your silliness. Just be a little bit less when it comes to women. Hey. I noticed your hair as you were walking down the street. Maybe a little bit of English? A little. So-so. So-so little. So-so. So, I'm going to use Google Translate. Do you know this? Ah, yes, yes. Can you look at me again? What? Can you look at me again? What? You have the prettiest eyes. You are like green and red. Yes. Like a little fire. Like a fire child. Like a fire. Yes. Do you have to go somewhere? Yes, yes, yes. Okay, I'm going to walk with you for two minutes. Okay. And then I'm going to let you go. Okay. I don't know English so-so because I not practice. Practice. Practice. Practice. Practice. Here. There. Now you have an English teacher. Where are you from? I'm from Chicago originally. Do you know where that is? Yes. It's very cold. The people there are very closed. Very... And so I've been trying to open up, to talk to people more. So, for example, when I saw you, I said, I have to talk to her. I must. You must. Go. In Ukraine. Because you want to speak with Ukrainian people. I have... I'm doing a class. Ah, class. Yeah, a class here. Do you know meditation? Okay. Like meditation, like... I know, I know. Yeah. Do you know? Do you know human design? Yes. Yes? I know... Like a lifestyle design? I study human design here. All year, I mean. Oh, okay. So you are like a... You are a student? No, no, no. I am a student. I finished studying. Ah, so you are working now. I am a consultant. Are you a consultant of anything you want? Of human design? Yes. Okay. And so, human design is more like psychology? Yes. Okay. More like... God, it's so hard to explain to you, honestly. You know Russian, right? A little bit. A little bit. A little bit. That's good. Yeah. You don't understand a bit, right? I don't understand. You don't understand at all? No, I don't understand. Do you want to speak? More? Yes, I translate for a long time. Ok. God, it's so hard for you. She's so adorable. I don't understand a bit, right? I don't understand at all. I don't understand at all. I don't understand at all. Do you know human design? Yes. I have no idea. I don't understand at all. I don't understand at all. I don't understand at all. Hey, excuse me one second. I'll walk with you. I said you had a very... Ok, I'll let you go. See you. Ok, so I kind of knew that was going to happen. I just kind of wanted to see what you would do. Ok. Right, because my instant read on that girl is... I need to go in stronger. Is that she's not... She doesn't look open. And she's in a rush and she's got headphones on. Ok. Right, so can I work around that? Sure. But I'm going to need to do a powerful stop. Yeah. So she's walking like... Yeah, yeah. And then she goes, Hi, you look fucking sexy. You know, like straight in. Because by the time she's like, What do you want? Oh, I saw you from... Oh, no, whatever this is, no. Yeah, I feel uncomfortable with that. So that's really cool. Cool. So it's an adjustment, you see. The different girls can give vastly different reactions, obviously. So, yep. Cool. Hey. Stop for one second. What? Stop for one second. I had to come and talk to you. Because you're coming down here. You had this kind of dreamy look on your face. And I wanted to go and say hi and see what that was all about. Where are you from? Chicago. Chicago. Very far away away. But I'm living in Mexico City right now. I see. What are you doing in here? Can you believe I came for a class? What? A class. Class? Yeah, like a workshop. Workshop. Yeah, yeah. What about you? What are you... You seem on your way to somewhere. I go to American in the Center. It's my school. I'm studying English now. You're studying English? Yes. Ah. It's my goal to speak English fluently. Ah, well, I am, in fact, an excellent English teacher. I mean, I don't want to... I don't want to... I don't want to, like, brag or anything. A native speaker, yes. I'm a native speaker, yes. But you... I mean, of course, you'll have to teach me Russian in return. You want to know Russian? I do, actually, yeah. In college, I studied for six months. But... A little bit. A little bit. I don't speak Russian. Well, it's... It's not bad. It's okay. Yeah, slowly I will get here, but... Yeah, it's sweet. So, what do you want to do with your English? I want to use it in my future job. I finished... course, PA engineer, testing. You're... Wait, sorry, you're an engineer? Awesome. PA engineer, you know? Yeah, yeah. Quality assurance engineer. Yes, yes. So, I need English. That's awesome. Yes. That's interesting, because I would not peg you as an engineer. Your pronunciation sounds difficult for me. I know. Do you know, even native English speakers tell me that I have an accent. They're like, you're kind of difficult to understand sometimes, because I talk... You're from Chicago. Yeah, Chicago. Chicago accent. Chicago accent, exactly. If you can understand us, you can understand anybody. Okay. But... I try, I try. But, as an engineer, I would have guessed you would be something... You seem like a... kind of like a people person. You seem like somebody who really enjoys being around people. Yes. So... It's true, it's true. I'm a creative person, but for me now, it's interesting, because my brother, for example, he's a developer, and he has a good salary. It's interesting for him, it's modern, I think. In Ukraine, it's one of the modern jobs for young people. And personally, I think it's a great job. Okay, maybe developer, or... You want to become a developer? I don't know. Now, I don't know. It's interesting for me, but I don't know. I think it's some difficult for me to sit always in one place and tap, and it's difficult. I'm a more active person, I can sit. You know, it would be very difficult for you to express that social side, when you're only... Yes. So, I actually am a programmer as well. Developer? Yeah, developer. And I find it very difficult sometimes, where I just need to get up, and I need to go and talk to people. Like, sometimes I work from a cafe, so that I can just have people around. It's good for you, it's comfortable for you to be with people around you. Yeah. I used to be very shy, many years ago. And now I've kind of learned to get past that, and start to enjoy being around people. I see. Do you like him? I do, yeah. It's... I think... So, I'm living in Mexico right now, and everything here is just... It's clean. People seem like they're driven. In Mexico, not always the case. I really like the culture in Mexico, but... Yeah, this to me feels very European. You know, it feels very modern. In Kiev? Yeah, in Kiev. Well, relative to Mexico City. Do you understand? No, the last sentence, no. Do you know Mexico City? Yes, I do. So, in Mexico City, things are crazy. So, sometimes your power will go out, and sometimes your water will disappear. And so you're trying to figure out how all that stuff works, but... Anyways, do you want to stay here in Kiev? I'm thinking about it, I don't know. I want to visit Canada. It's my dream to live sometime there. I want to live maybe half a year and understand if it's my country or not. What Canada? I think it's a perfect place for a job, for living. I think that's all. Maybe we can come down on trips to Chicago. It's not far from. No, very close. Have you ever been in Canada? Yeah. Yes? Yeah, I used to work there. I was working in Toronto for two months. Did you like this country? Yeah. The culture is very similar to American culture. I'm practicing you for Canadian culture, of course. So, I must go, because my English lesson... Oh, I'm going to make you late for your... OK. Sorry, but I must go. I wouldn't want that, but I would love to see you again. I don't even know your name. I'm Kevin. Kevin? Yes. I know, movie, you know. Home Alone? Yes, Kevin. Do you know, I was talking to another Ukrainian earlier, some guys, and they were like, Kevin, from Home Alone, I was like... It's a favorite movie of all Ukrainians, maybe, from childhood. I'm him, but just bigger. Yes. Just bigger. So, let me grab your WhatsApp, and we'll go for a coffee sometime. OK. OK, but you're going to have to help me with your name. OK, I can. Did I get that right? Yes. And I know it's difficult to type, and... I've sometimes had to explain my number, and I'd be like, P'yat, sem, no, vosim. D'yevet? It's impossible, so... OK. It's lovely to meet you. Oh! Yes. Oh, you're always right, you guys don't do that here. I understand. Not Ukrainian culture. I'll see you soon. I can see the look in your eyes, you're like, hang on. Possibilities. Yeah, dude, it's Kyiv, man. This is something different. Fuck Chicago, I'm moving here. Yeah, fuck that shit. OK, awesome. Nice. Terminator Shreds, man. Huh? Terminator Shreds. Look, I mean, firstly, there's a lot of good things going on here, in terms of your pacing, and your delivery is like, there's no, like, major issues with delivery stuff. I was a little dry in this one. I felt like, I don't know why, I just kind of felt like I wasn't quite getting, like, the emotional depth that I wanted. It doesn't matter. It was, like, you were vibing. Like, we don't need to stress about, like, a particular type of depth. Depth. The type of depth. In the, especially in a quick street interaction. It's like, the girl makes the decision based on the general vibe and feeling of, like, I feel good with this guy, I'm attracted to him, he's not a dickhead, and I'm single, yeah? Yeah. Okay, sometimes, I mean, sometimes we might get really deep with the girl on the street, but often not. It's like, that's kind of all we need. It's cool. Um, now, I would definitely recommend"}
