So air touches, and so you're going to be integrating these types of touches in everything we do from now on, so when you lay hands on the woman I don't want it to be mechanical, so we don't want to be like okay if I'm going to turn her that I'm doing this. I want it to be smooth, so I want to be able to melt into the contours of the body and you can think of a touch in these terms. So an air touch is like this, so where would I apply air touches on the neck, on the inside of the arms, the lower back, around the back of the neck, so we have this kind of air touch. Watery touch would just be where there's an increase in the tactile contact, so instead of it just being like kind of hovering down there, which if I do an air touch here once it'll be nice, if I do it here for example it's going to probably be ticklish, so there I wouldn't do an earth touch or a watery touch on those areas as opposed to a light airy one, so you need to be aware of what's the difference in terms of the tactile sensation for the girl, so air touch here, that'll be nice, but if I keep doing that it's probably going to get too ticklish. So then I move into like a watery type of touch, which is primarily what we'll be doing today, so where we get these, this kind of touch here, this kind of thing. Now, what do you think fire touch would be? That's a fire touch, so scratches, spanks, like rapid movements, so if I wanted to shove up against the wall kind of thing here, that's a fire version of what could be a watery touch, and earth, you can think of it as grasps, so hold, hold, hold, any kind of these locks, these things here where it's solid, it's dense, and I'm taking command of her, so it's just a model, it's a map, one way to think of touch as you're going about it. So what we're going to start with is things that most of you have seen before, which is essentially turning from hips, from shoulders, from hips, we'll work on the neck as well, maneuvering her from there, and we'll lead her through the space using the rubber band string thing, you guys remember what that means? So if I want to lead her, don't walk until you feel that stretch, wait, there, so being able to have that where she's coming through the water, so I'm allowing time for her to catch up to me. So to start with, I'm going to start by placing hands on your partner, you can start with a little bit of these air touches, water touches, you can start to get these slow maneuvers around with this additional touch, so we're getting these here, this blend, and I think when I originally showed it to you guys, I showed taking the center a little, so as I watch my hips, as I turn my hips, now I'm taking her center, so then the turns are easy because it's an extension of my hips. Alright, same if I want to move on to the pelvis, the bone goes into the center of the palm, here, turn, and you can add the commands as well, so that you're getting used to doing that and it's clear to her what you want her to do, turn, turn, now if I want to unwind this here, there, that one there, and then I just open her out, pull her in, for example, then I can decide where I want her to hold me, so we're going to play with that, and then we're going to add in this tango step, so I want to take her up against the wall, so I pull her in at the hips, and I get this step like so, so what I did then was I placed hand behind the head to support so I don't bang her on the thing, I lean in with my body weight like so, so that step is like so, because if I walk like that I'm going to step on her feet, so I get that tango step, okay, works totally well from behind as well, hot move, okay, let's start with those, I've got lots of other ones I want to add in, but I want to get you getting into a flow first, so remember it again from the start, we lay hands on, get tactile with her, you can get her to like touch you a little bit as well, so we're getting in that watery, airy space, and then I start to take command. I wouldn't walk it that far, okay, but not too far, all right, so that's the stuff to initially start to play with. Now, what if I wanted to, let's say I threw her on, I just put her down, put her down, all right, now this isn't the best place for us to have sex, because yeah, I'm kind of hovering on the edge, and I have to keep myself up, so I want it further up the bed, all right, so how do I move her up the bed? Up, done, yeah, or come here, all right, so just lift and scoot, lift and scoot, so we practice those for readjusting her into positions, cool, come here, now I want to show you guys a few holds, so these would be earth touches, and a lot of these are essentially restraints without tools, all right, so here's one, this is one of my favorites to do, so all I've done here is I feed my hand in behind the tricep, and I grip the other side, now whenever I'm gripping a woman, I need to be aware of not putting claws in, like not like, you know, grabbing like I'm a cop or whatever, think of it as a compress, all right, so I'm holding her tightly, but I'm not digging my fingertips in, I'm bruising her, all right, so if we, you know, go from our sensual touch here, all right, so I come in here, I'm closing with her, and you see in this situation, I'm wrapping around the shoulder, so I've got her completely packed in here, okay, from here what I can do is lift the throat, so this is a hold, it's not a choke, we'll be covering choking another day, but it's, put your head down again, all right, so it's just this lift, right, so it's a dominance hold here, okay, which if I'm using it on the bed, oops, sorry, my mistake, like so, like so, like so, right, so I have these hold lifts, now this is a distress position, well, here it's not distress, here it's distress, okay, so I may hold, I mean, that will be hot for some moments, maybe I'm holding by the hair fucking really hard in this moment, and then I let her go, right, but I don't want to hold in that position for two minutes, you can imagine, you know, do it yourself, you're like, okay, that's not gonna be comfortable long, whereas if I just do a little tilt here, right, or come stand up again, so be aware if I just made a mistake then, have the thumb on my cheek, it's not a major mistake, but probably I don't want to be touching your makeup, so I'll be aware that's under the, under the throat, okay, and then if we have in here, like so, okay, cool, um, doggy style, like you're moving, she's on her back, you mean like this, oh, right, right, okay, cool, so if we're here, all right, and I'm, and I want to move further up, I'll walk her up, move forward, yeah, so that only works because I'm like, walk back again, like, not working anymore, right, so that's because I'm trying to like, second guess her or like, lift her body weight, I'm just like, move, cool, well, no, I mean, that was more, that was that fact that I, because the, when, when it didn't work, what I'm doing is, I'm like, okay, well, I lift a little bit and then see if she responds, oh, she sort of did, and then I'll try and lift this or whatever, yeah, it's like, yeah, I'm just going to move forward. Now, obviously, now, Lara and I have practiced that a bit, so she knows what to do, sometimes the goal, you know, she'll, let's say you don't know what you're doing, right, so come back and you resist the first time, move, move forward with me, good girl, and it's a silly moment, it's not a sexy thing, seeing us like two beetles, you know, this is not our sexiest moment together, it's functional, so, okay, it can be a bit funny, all right, it's like, all right, move up, we'll laugh about it, and if we miss, mess it up.
