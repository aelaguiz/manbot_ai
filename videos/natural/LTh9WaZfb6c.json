I find that I get into relationships for too long and then I'm not doing myself any favors or I'm not doing the other person any favors by staying in it and I just want to know how to unplug from all that and what I need to refocus on and how to do that because it's such a long, it's such a pattern that's been there for so long. Yeah, it's a good question and I think part of that kind of relates to that previous question in a way. It's like whenever we have relationships then we start to move into a world of consensual arrangements. You know, we start to negotiate what is the territory that we're going to create together and when you move into a deep and meaningful kind of relationship, often it's monogamous, sometimes it's not, but you move into a relationship where you have a lot of emotional significance placed onto somebody. Then once again, Jamie kind of touched on it, James touched on it when he said it's like he has his primary girl and then he has like other sort of more lovers, if you will. Now in some sense what he's saying is that he has a compartment for somebody that is very, very important to him in his intimacy and how he relates to them and he has a compartment for not so important or this is more casual, this is more loving, this is more sexual pleasure and exploration as opposed to emotional intimacy and attachment. Now once again, they're different compartments. It's like having different files or parts of your life that you have those images of people in and those symbols. Now the interesting thing to look at is if you're getting into a relationship of co-dependence with somebody, then it often comes from this idea that you've put them into the compartment of I need you to be okay, that you are my source of goodness, greatness, amazingness and I've been there. I mean I had an amazing, brilliant relationship that was also very enmeshed in a lot of mess and because it was actually so excessively devotional, it was so excessively based on the fact of the expectation that was placed in that relationship was like it has to be awesome, it has to be perfect, it has to be this good thing. So I think co-dependence kind of comes from this idea that we find a partner and we want to make that partner everything and we want to feel like they are, like we're also everything for them and of course it comes from an assumption of lack of wholeness. It comes from an assumption, like I was saying before, of not being attached to the infinity of resourcefulness that's actually around you. Because imagine, just change the context, imagine that you had like a dog and the dog was great, you know, just always unconditionally loves you and wants to hang out with you. You go walking in the park with the dog, you know, the dog's always playful and you're like, cool, I love my dog, like me and my dog are awesome and then you go to the doctor one day and the doctor says, you're really sick and you need that dog around you all the time to be okay and if you separate yourself from that dog then you're going to be in danger, you're actually probably going to get really sick. Now you're going to start to look at that dog very differently, you're going to start to try and control that dog and feel disappointed when the dog doesn't want to hang around you and you're going to feel like you need to try and like always be okay in the dog's presence. Now it's the same thing with relationships. So open yourself to broader possibilities is the way that you break out of that and ultimately the thing that I feel is like the big game changer for me out of breaking out of codependent kind of stuff was realizing that there's a much bigger world of awesomeness out there that's waiting for you to connect with it and also if you can find, like I was saying in my speech before, if you can find a higher source of drive inside yourself that is beyond women because women are awesome, they're amazing but they are not the pie, they're not your pie of life and when you fall into codependence it's because you turn the woman who's a slice of your pie into the pie and then you forget about all the other important things that are going on along the way. So one of the ways that you break free of codependence is make yourself strong in all the areas that make you independent and for example I would probably recommend like you know if it's possible and true for you to go out and explore what it's like to have casual relationships, to have open relationships, to have multiple lovers and to see what happens along the way because you may find that there is a part of you that's created a kind of an equivalent story inside your head that like if I can't really enjoy you know pleasure or connection with somebody unless they're everything to me and that's not true. I mean you can have amazing connections with somebody you only get to know for a week or a night and you could have mind-blowing magical creation connections that can change each other's lives in hours. So there's a whole bunch of things that all arise from the rules and the compartments that where you're putting these things and once again it's not always easy to sort of say oh there's just one thing that you do and then all of a sudden it's resolved but yet again it's self-awareness, it's kind of understanding where do you put this relationship in your mind and how do you worship it in a way that keeps you attached to it because the thing is you'll keep doing what you're doing until you're sick of doing it and the whole reason that you maintain those kinds of structures is because you get something from them and it is a really common thing that people get into relationships and they keep putting this kind of effort into this thing that's not really getting anything out of it and the result is that they just you know it's just trying to beat this dead horse because they're hoping that it's going to come back to life and you know who knows maybe it will if they get the perfect combination or whatever but oftentimes it's not true. Oftentimes it's much better to look at the situation clearly as adults and make an assessment based on yourself and think well this is something that I need to change, this is something that I need to come back into awareness of and start to give my power back to the places that really do matter. So then you can just basically compensate in a way that's actually healthy like stop compensating your life by just having one person in your life that means everything and instead deal with the fact that you have many compartments, many things going on and be powerful in that and in time with practice you'll start to become much more confident and capable of operating without your woman being the ideal thing because there's also a very big negative in that too because if you make a woman the center of your world then you depolarize the relationship. She starts to feel like she's responsible for you. She essentially starts to take on the masculine role. She doesn't want that. She starts to want to get away from that then it becomes this negative feedback loop of trying to you retain and get your masculinity back by you know retardedly giving her more power. So you've got to back out by getting strong in yourself and putting the power where it needs to be and if she wants to come with you great, if she doesn't then that's part of the reality you deal with as well."}
