I've said this phrase many times before, people treat you how you train them to treat you. So if you allow shitty behavior, if you don't show that you have standards, if you don't qualify girls, then they will treat you with disrespect, right, or they will just, and it's not even that they're actively maliciously trying to hurt you, it's just that if people put up with certain things then people just don't even notice that they don't have a boundary and they just lean into them, right, because people are bumping into each other's boundaries all the time and those who are really reactive and go, that's my boundary, don't ever touch, you know, move my towel from that side of the rack to that side of the rack. Okay, that's way too reactive and that's not a boundary that we should be rigidly attached to, whether someone used your spoon or something like that, but certain deal-breakers about your physical, you know, your physical barriers of pain and being treated nicely and not being insulted in public and all those kinds of things that you would expect that you would not do to anyone else if you have a code where you're like, all right, I treat people with respect, I expect it in exchange, then people operate within those parameters or they don't and they fuck off. Good, that's how I've cleared people out of my life as I've navigated through and gotten better with my boundaries and better with my testing of men and women and I've been very clear about, I give clear eye contact when I meet someone, I shake their hand, I listen to people, I respect their opinions even if I disagree with them, you know, I am generous, I have different aspects of myself that I'm happy with and they relate to the way that I relate to people and I will not accept anything less than that from the people I deal with. Clients, I have fired clients, I've kicked clients off of workshops and refunded their money because they've been fuckwits, because they've been rude, because they've been disrespectful in a really shitty way to women, right, because I am not willing to compromise my personal ethics and my core operating mission statement just to have someone on side or just to get laid, right, so all of this is just to help you to get some perspective on this idea because the question came from this guy from a position where you haven't thought enough about what you want from women, you need to have standards and of course you do need to be realistic, like when I first started out cold approaching, I couldn't have the standard where like I only date PhD models who are parkour masters and have a deep understanding of existential French literature, right, I can't expect to have some perfect goddess woman in my life if I'm not an equivalent of that and I hear, you know, guys saying, oh that's not fair, women don't have to develop themselves as a woman, they just are hot and if they're hot then they get all this stuff for free. Yeah, that's true, they don't necessarily have to develop themselves in order to get male attention but they do need to develop themselves if they want to maintain and keep the attention of a high quality man, absolutely, so yeah and this, you know, girls see the repercussions of this over years, I've watched multiple generations of young hot girls through my life and seen what happens as friends and lovers and girls, girlfriends of friends and all that, I've seen what happens to the girls that do nothing to develop themselves other than their beauty, they tend to burn out because at some point their beauty becomes less and the type of men that they attract are the type of men that are only interested in her beauty and therefore they don't probably value her so much as a human being and so they can end up in shitty relationships that end up in abuse or just being lonely and not having a great run of it once they're not the young hot club chick anymore, whereas many women I know who are of my generation who are now in their late 30s who were young hot chicks at some point and now are mums and women who've grown up, they have a lot to offer in many other areas and so they have been able to hold the attraction of awesome interesting men, so it does, you know, even out over time, yeah okay in the cosmic scheme of sexual karma, okay, things kind of do balance out anyway but don't, there's no point being angry at young hot girls for expecting to get stuff for free and heaps of attention because they're young and hot, it's your fault, you're the one that likes their photos, don't like hot chicks photos on Instagram, I have never ever liked a hot girl's photo on Instagram, not once, right, the only photos of girls I ever like are of my female friends that I don't have sex with, you're the ones who are feeding them constant cheap attention for nothing, so what do you expect, they're like cool I get all this stuff for free because I'm young and hot and then some guy's like well it's not fair that you get all this, you know, you should you should something, she's like what are you talking about, I just got like $10,000, put a photo on Instagram of me with something, you know, all that shit, okay, whatever, too bad, that's just the way it is, if you were young and if you were a 21 year old hot blonde chick with big tits, you'd do it too, in the long run I think it's still better to be a man, you've got way more time to figure shit out and yes, you do need to develop more something other than your looks because yes, women don't test and screen just on looks, right, so on one hand, okay, that means that you don't just get handed shit on a plate but the other thing, on the positive side, it means that you can change your position, if a girl is ugly and fat, she's going to have a shit life, it's going to be very very difficult for her to, you know, get great relationships in her life because men are so militantly brutal about looks, if you're a, you know, whatever, I've taught every dude, you know, short, fat, funny looking, whatever, you can change, you can develop character, you can become someone that is sexy, you can command the attention of a room, you can develop your charisma, all those things can be done and so it's best to look at it like, okay, cool, men and women have different advantages and disadvantages and if I want to level the playing field against the young hot girl, then I'm going to need to have some standards and I'm going to need to start testing girls, not in a belligerent way but just in a way of like, okay, what do you got there, tell me some more about that, okay, do you want to do something spontaneous and fun, aside from being pretty, what's your thing, you know, these qualifying questions, they're just examples of things I might say in an initial conversation but it's the attitude behind it which I then carry through the relationship which matters, if I have a relationship with a woman, I expect her to continue to give, to continue to contribute, to continue to be great in bed, you know, to all those things that I am offering her because otherwise why would I bother sticking around when I don't have to.
