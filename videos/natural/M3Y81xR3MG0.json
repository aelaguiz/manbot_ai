standards and you know her being attractive is simply not enough because of that again even if you write a longer message but you're like you know hey your profile looks interesting maybe we could get a drink sometime funny it's funny though because that is you've just kind of described the male sexual uh strategy and you've hit on a good point there as well about kind of some problems that will come up a lot with online dating is that having some rough templates or ideas of messages you work to for the first message is actually smart just because you may find that you have to send 10 messages out to get a response you will you may think we'll have to let's get those stats let's get those stats down for good gentlemen because it's it's lucky if it's 10% return yeah and i would say after and i literally legit have worked behind the scenes at some big dating apps and platforms around the world and true stat the stallions the top performing insta model worthy totally crushing it guys on online dating profile profiles they still only get a max of 35 to 40 response rate so that is like you know you are brad pitt you're at 40 or whatever it is so and you may think that this is like terribly unfair but i think with the asymmetry of dating i'm just gonna stand up for the women here i work with women as well and for women imagine that what you get you open your like it's like another inbox and you've opened it and there's all these messages in there and they don't seem at all relevant to you they're either as you said very low investment like hey how's your day going hey babe what's up hey that kind of thing oh you stole my best line there you know or they seem to be like written and the women are there thinking these guys haven't read my profile they're just spamming everybody you know this guy doesn't even look like there is no way in my mind i could conceive us hanging out together so when and women because of that they really struggle to narrow that down and figure out who to invest their time and energy into and often get it wrong they also if they happen to be looking for relationships which certainly not all women are lots of women are looking for stuff that's more casual or just entertainment or some other motivation but another consideration they'll be battling with is is this guy just using dating apps right now as a distraction is he just looking to hook up or you know is there something more sincere here so women usually are faced with basically a huge admin pile in the world of online dating and some difficult decisions which are actually very difficult to come to conclusions with with the limited information they have and those decisions need to be made basically in a split second really exactly so when you write a low investment message you're going to come across as basically that guy i always call it the hey guy because every woman on her instagram will have some person or some man who just says hey multiple times yeah forever with no response and basically what you're sub-communicating there is like you know what you cannot respond you could have the personality of a stone i don't care you're the only hot woman i might talk to this century so because of that i'm clinging on in there and that's exactly the wrong way to present yourself you have to present yourself as a man that has really good standards and you know her being attractive is simply not enough because of that again even if you write a longer message but you're like you know hey your profile looks interesting maybe we could get a drink sometime because she she hasn't done anything she hasn't responded yet she hasn't invested in the interaction so whilst it's definitely true that you should progress to their date quickly and use your messages effectively and not become a pen friend if you go in immediately with the date a lot of the time you're going to come across as the guy who's just chancing it and that's inherently just not attractive to most women that are out there funny it's funny though because that is you've just kind of described the male sexual uh strategy chances chancing it just like throwing out whatever i can and hoping something will stick that's i'm a man that's what i have to do so you know you can be all like oh you should have more standards i do i have standards which is i need to get laid pretty soon so i'm going to do whatever i can is this right no oh can i change it yes you"}
