Now in today's video I'm going to be deconstructing and analyzing this little phrase which you may have heard thrown around on the internet which is the juice ain't worth the squeeze. So in order to pull this apart we're going to have to look at what is the juice and what does the squeeze involve. So most of the time when you hear this phrase used it's not referring to your career, right? It's not saying oh well it's not worth studying, interning, working your way up in a corporation in order to fulfill your career even though there's a lot of squeeze that goes on in that. People don't say that's not worth it. Or in terms of many other things whether it's your hobbies or your fitness or your your health in general, financial pursuits in terms of investments and so on, it would be rare for people to say it's not worth the squeeze. Now there's definitely kind of doomers and various people who perceive that the in general the system out there is not to your advantage and it's not worth involving yourself in but this phrase is almost exclusively used in in relationship to women. It's spoken about in in relation to two primary things. The art of learning how to approach women, right? So that the amount of effort that is involved in order to go from someone who has never really cold approached, doesn't really know how that works, to going out on the streets, in cafes, in bars, wherever it is that you choose to do it. Learning the skills in order to be able to meet women that you don't know, strangers, get them into good conversations, ask them out on dates and for them to say yes and for you to end up going on dates, getting into bed with them and then getting into some kind of relationship. So this is the first part where we're describing this it ain't worth the squeeze thing is in relationship to approaching and getting good at cold approach seduction in general. And the second area that is spoken about because we see this whenever we put up some of our more sexy videos about BDSM or bedroom skills in general. These ones tend to go a little bit more viral because they're a bit spicy you know when you see spanking and ropes people click on it. It's not coincidence that we put those up you know people are interested. But then this goes outside the TNL bubble usually right so we have our core audience and then when something goes a little bit viral we're getting guys from the peripheries. And this is where we often see again this statement that it's not worth the squeeze and in this case we're referring to your abilities in the bedroom. So when you see a long-form video where I'm explaining the intricacies of 18 different types of spanks and 14 different ways to tie a girl up with a piece of silk, some guys would look at that and go wow that's awesome and interesting and I want to learn that and I can see some benefits in that. And then the other attitude would be that's not worth the squeeze because then I have to learn all that stuff and that's putting all of this extra effort into my you know bedroom skills again it ain't worth the squeeze. So let's let's pull this apart and see if it is or isn't. My thesis just as a spoiler alert is that it is worth the effort and not only is it worth the effort it's necessary. We're not talking about hobbies here. The difference between being a guy who can play a bit of ragtime on the piano you know hit some chords and sing along with an easy song and a guy that or girl or whoever that is a concert level pianist is massive massive differences. You know the ability to plink out some chords and sing along is something that someone could develop over a period of weeks or months depending on their natural abilities but in order to be able to play some huge concerto you have to spend eight plus hours a day for many years in order to be able to do it. So the difference in the squeeze is huge in terms of being competent to being a master and you could say well I could live without being a master pianist. I could live without playing the piano at all and you would be right because you could find some other hobby that you were more interested in or that gave you more joy and your life your quality of life would not necessarily be discernibly different from whether you play the piano or not. This is not the case with women dating seduction and sex for most people. Most men and women can't live happy fulfilling lives without the opposite sex in their life in some way without having a good sex life. It's just one of the realities of being a biological human is we're attracted to each other and we have a whole lot of things that we need from each other in order to feel fulfilled and if you're a man who doesn't have the access or the skill set to be able to bring enough or any women into your life or enough or any sex into your life then your life is not going to be much fun or it's going to be way less joyful than it could be. So the way I see it is kind of regardless of what is the level of squeeze that we need to use you kind of need to learn it one way or another because the alternative is you know black pill doomerism or being an incel and committing to that as an ideology. I'm not here to shame or make fun of anyone who doesn't have much sexual or any sexual experience and I know there's a lot of that out there on the internet you know when incels are kind of a joke in and of themselves but they're brought up in disdainful ways cruel ways often like kind of victim blaming ways that's because they're something something it's their fault that they're undateable and I don't perceive that at all I see that like the sexual marketplace is a complex dynamic there are people who have massive advantages and massive disadvantages there are people who lucked into being in social scenes or having mentorship which meant that they've learned how to do this early on and so it becomes part of their you know part of their confidence part of their lifestyle part of the thing that they just do and for many men that doesn't happen because of isolation because of the fact that they were shy because they didn't have any older brothers to show them or older sisters or women in their life in general to get used to being around women because they were because of computer games because of the internet because of the atomization of societies in general I think it's unhelpful to blame these kinds of things on one big monolithic cause the most common one being talked about here is feminism you know just like this one word that covers all the ills and all the problems that men face is because of this massive power of the feminist movement I think this is quite reductive and doesn't take into account many of the other factors that have changed societies and changed dating the mating dating game in the you know in the recent years like I mean I can see massive differences in the last 10 to 15 years and then there are huge differences over broader periods of time again mainly to do with economic changes societies adjusting and becoming far more insular atomized so that we don't have such links to community going out to parties being part of community events having extended networks where historically most people met their met their partners even when I was growing up in the 90s man that was the situation where there was no internet to speak of there was no online dating there was no Instagram there was guys and girls trying to fucking fuck each other one way or another and so that happened in usually in response to proximity right so being around each other in class at parties you know at raves early 90s raves you know at house parties hooking up through friends being introduced to each other by friends of friends all that kind of stuff that's how it was done because there was no other alternative a lot of that stuff exists I mean it still exists of course people live in communities people have friends people still statistically more often hook up through their social networks than they even do through online although of course online has become far more prevalent in the last 10-15 years or so but the realities are it's not that the you know the juice ain't worth the squeeze it's just that the squeeze has changed to what we have to do in order to be able to be confident confident competent to be able to get dates to be able to get a girlfriend or if you're one of one of us someone who wants to date multiple women then okay we have to adjust and shift our squeezing techniques as the times change and if we don't then what are you left with you're left with a statement that is I would say a victim statement and one that just allows you to bow out of the race right it's not worth the effort because the Chad's and the Stacey's because everything's stacked against you because there is this massive disparity in let's say sexual wealth it's not a secret that wealth is not in distributed evenly throughout the planet right some people are extremely wealthy and some people are extremely poor sometimes that's because they work real hard sometimes it's because their daddy worked real hard or their daddy's daddy worked real hard or you know many other factors at play that are not it's not that we're all dropped on the Monopoly board with the same amount of money the same positions and then it's it's only a meritocracy of course there are factors at play that give people advantages economically and this translates fairly well as an analogy over into the sexual marketplace where there are people who you know born with their daddy and mummy's good genes so they're super hot or jacked or tall or of a particular race which is deemed to be more attractive than others and so on and so you know there's certain advantages that the Chad's and the Stacey's have over the normies or the normal guys or as the black pillars would or the incel people would speak of the sub five which I think is a very unuseful definition of men which kind of talks about a number of different factors that if you are not this tall if you are the wrong race if you are not jacked if your jawline is not of a particular way and so on that you are essentially undateable that you fall into this lower 20 to 40 or 50% of attractiveness males and by the ideologies that are that have formed around within the pickup world and the the manosphere at large states that essentially there's there's no way you can move beyond that like you the die is set you are a 5 you are a 4 and therefore you will never be able to date a 7 an 8 a 9 unless you become exorbitantly rich and you can basically buy her attention otherwise the juice ain't worth the squeeze because the juice that you get is unattractive women and the amount of squeeze you have to put in the endless amounts of swiping and flaking numbers and or if you are one of the few guys that goes and does cold approach dealing with the many rejections that are inevitable that all of that effort in order to get some box as I've heard people refer to it or to you know get laid or to spend a few minutes with a woman in bed like these kinds of phrases like why would we put all this effort into it when women are essentially what's that thing from that that line from the Mighty Boosh with like all women strange and evil we'll cut to that one there despite what my head is like no more Mighty Boosh my wife was like all women strange and evil Mighty Boosh before recording this video I was having a look at a bunch of different statistics now you know me and mathematics I'm not the not the guy that you want to come to for all your mathematical needs but you know I'm aware of these stats of like well firstly where are the places in the world where people have more sex and less sex right so if we look on the averages apparently the Turks are the horniest and naughtiest of all of us which is kind of surprised me that they're around 14.5 partners lifetime partners I think for males and then second in place who would have guessed good old fucking Australia 13.3 chicks that's what apparently we get and then you know you've got those Scandinavian countries and they go down in various countries so that there's somewhere between you know 7 to 14 partners depending on which country you come from on average that that most men will have in their lifetime and fairly comparable for women usually a few less now of course who's telling the truth we don't know because often men do inflate their numbers women may choose to not count certain guys I've talked to many girls about that she's like oh no that guy didn't count because the sex was bad or he only lasted three minutes or I didn't like him or I was a bit drunk and so I just kind of forget about it so hard to know exactly how many people everyone is actually having sex with but in terms of self-reporting this is what it looks like and when you look at that you'd be like okay dozen or so partners and so you could say maybe a few of those would be long-term partners and one of them maybe would be the long long-term partner and a few flings and a couple of one-night stands and okay that seems kind of reasonable for an average person to let's assume that they're not only having sex once per person so that it's not that they're just having sex 14 times in their life which wouldn't be enough as far as I would be concerned but okay that they're having multiple sexual impressions with many of those different people and so that blows out to a certain number of sex over your lifetime okay fair enough but it's an average right so what that means I would say now don't quote me on the stats here but there's going to be some people who hoard the sex and so I and I me and a number of men that I've met throughout my career professional pickup artists or guys who are just extremely good with women or guys who put in huge amounts of squeezing have clocked you know a hundred women plus in their lifetime so they've slept with that many women and I know those guys and many of the time often it's not just once either so okay so they're having hundreds of or thousands of sexual impressions in their life and so that stands to reason if there's one guy who's having sex with a hundred different girls but then that's taking away all of the sex from lots of other guys so on the other outlier end there must be lots of guys who have no sex or once or very very little sex now there is a problem with that idea too which is that sex is not a finite resource right a woman doesn't have a limited number of times she could have sex she could be one of the women that sleeps with the Chad or and like Chad doesn't doesn't in no way reflect the guys that I know that have slept with over a hundred women not one of them that I know is like six foot four jacked looks like a GQ model none of them I mean you know some of them of my colleagues skinny bit fat bit short okay looking with a huge nose you know or one ear you know and we're not not like freaks or anything but just like average-looking men if you line up all the dudes I knew who've been with over a hundred women it would be a fairly unimpressive lineup visually maybe the cheerleader effect if we draw dress cool and did our poses which we often did in our photos might affect things but we're kind of average or I mean generally average in terms of visual metrics but it wasn't that okay because any of us slept with many women that that woman then never slept with a guy that hasn't slept with a hundred women right it's certainly I've seen guys who are proficient with women kind of hold together a harem of women over a shorter period of time so let's say that they're dating two three to five women and if you're if you're dating that that means seeing them once ish a week because like for the most part if you're having a casual relationship the woman is gonna want to see you around once a week minimum and if you've spent you know you don't see her for many many weeks then she'll go she'll lose interest and she'll find someone else to either have a casual thing or have a more serious thing with you might be the guy that she's like the occasional popping guy where she keeps you on her on her Rolodex is like not not particularly reliable as a dude but reliable dick when I need it and you know I'll contact him every now and then cool that kind of thing happens but if you're trying to see it you know have a girl in your life you need to see her once a week once every 10 days ish and otherwise she'll get bored so within that time period a player may be juggling three to five women and you know they may be into changing a new girl comes in a previous girl gets sick of it or gets a boyfriend or something changes so there might be some rotation happening but that guy could pull three to five women out of the sexual market for a period of months it's not like the Chad's or whatever they're not like they're not Mughal emperors or Chinese emperors they don't have a hundred women locked in a locked in a palace where that's their exclusive harem they have women that they hold to them is it just by their like excellent jawline no I'd say much more it's to do with what the main purpose of this video is is their sexual abilities right like if a woman is sexually satisfied with a man he is way better than the average man in bed then she will return to him and she will often allow a greater margin of error on the man's behalf so he can be have less good game and he can she will often put up with less commitment or less reliability you know she will see him as like okay he's not he can't be shaped into a boyfriend he's not gonna be a good boyfriend maybe she might dilute herself and the guy might dilute her which is not something I recommend but that this happens but even if she's kind of aware like he's a player or he has a single lifestyle or he's a polyamorous he's a guy that doesn't want to be with just one woman whatever that looks like then she will clock that sooner than later and if she chooses to re-engage with that guy it'll primarily be a sexual thing so she may continue that relationship this casual looser relationship knowing that she's not the only one for a period of in my experience around six months I haven't really seen like open casual relationships I've seen the occasional outlier Johnny Soporno would be a good example he's been with his partner for many many years and they've had an open thing forever but they're like card-carrying hardcore polyamorous like most most casual relationships I've seen last around the three to six months mark which is at the point where usually the woman if she's really into the guy you know decide she would like something else with him he's not able to accommodate it or she's kind of using him as a stopgap you know a good reliable lay but not much else or maybe a friend with benefits until such a time as she finds a guy that's like cool this guy is boyfriend material and wants to do that and cool I'll jump ship from the player jump out of the the temporary harem and then become a someone's girlfriend the problem with the idea that you know Chad's or the alphas or whatever are hoarding all the sex presumes that there is a there is a finite amount of sex that a woman's can only have sex with one man at a time or in general when that may not be the case she may be sleeping with several of those types of guys she may be having a like easing into a more serious relationship with a guy whilst keeping her side piece until the last possible moment and and men do this too right because I like I know when I speak about these kinds of things they can be triggering because it's like it brings up male insecurities it brings up male judgment of women right that like that they're having sex with more than one man and that makes them whatever sluts promiscuous easy the death of Western civilization all of these extrapolations when it's like okay men and women fuck each other when there are you know like in previous generations where there was heavy pressure societal pressure to get married before you had sex right which is existed in many many different cultures whether they were Abrahamic religions or Hindu or various other religions and cultural contexts throughout history which kept control over female and male sexuality actually kind of equally and then the outlet was within socially sanctioned marriages which happened very young right we all know this when did your grandparents get married my dad got married at 23 my grandparents early 20s you know their forefathers early 20s teenage years it was the way it was done young horny want to get laid the only way you're gonna do that is if you get married the end of a shotgun and then okay people got people got into their relationships had their children early and then set themselves up and then okay later on when things opened up with divorce and society changed a lot of those relationships ended and people went out back into the sexual marketplace in their 40s or 50s and started again okay so like these these are demographic realities or sociological realities that we can chart and look at and go all right things change throughout history and as has been like brought up in moral panic at every point in history you can go back to writings in ancient China which talk about society falling apart because men are growing their hair long and listening to music you know like all the fall of the Roman Republic can be blamed on various types of decadence and like all throughout history people were very worried when things changed because by nature humans are kind of conservative in the sense that they find stuff that works for them they settle into it and then things that are outside of that or contrary to that are threats and a lot of people don't want to change this this is what I've seen over the last since like the early 2010s is that within the seduction community which I wouldn't really call it exactly a community but like it's a it's a sphere of ideas there are some communities within it but there's also a lot of competition and fighting and infighting as you would know if you watched any of the red pill dramas on other channels but I remember they like the early days of pickup were completely apolitical like not political in any way they weren't really sociological either they didn't like look at broad trends and place meaning and blame on certain groups based around that it was dudes mostly nerds myself included you know like guys were not the cool guys trying to figure out how to get laid that was it it was like don't get laid or I can't get girls or not regularly or I haven't been had another girlfriend in years whatever what's some things that I can do say be think feel whatever it takes in order for me to be more attractive for women to women and for me to be able to have actionable steps and skills and things that I can do that can change those outcomes did anyone notice the microphone just slowly gradually creeping into shot over the last 10 minutes and if you did I know you were like watching it not listening to me the whole time you just like but the microphone does he not notice we noticed it's gone again never happened it was all a dream so yeah like I remember those times it's kind of an innocent period essentially where it was guys coming in with a lot of enthusiasm because there was this there was this new there was this new change in in our reality we perceived ourselves as undateable to some degree or we perceived ourselves as left out like not part of the cool groups didn't get invited to the to the right parties you know couldn't really get into the cool clubs I remember thinking of what I perceived as like very beautiful women at the time as being like they're inside a fish tank like or I was inside a fish tank like just watching these people go by like I'm there on the street I could reach out and say something but we're worlds apart like there's no way that that girl is ever gonna come into my social circle that girl's never gonna come to a party that I'd be invited to you know I wouldn't want to be a member of a club that would let me in as the men as its members that the old Oscar Wilde quote yeah it was and you didn't feel approach anxiety you just felt like nah that sucks you know I'm left out and pick up was this kind of magical paradigm changer because for the first time in our lives like there was a time before pick up I remember it it was just like women were like Haley's Comet hot girls they would like pass through your social circle once in a blue moon and you know you everyone's jostling over and then no one gets her and then she ends up dating someone from the from the next school who was a cool DJ or something you're like ah damn it that's my now I have to wait for another year to meet a pretty girl through some chance or some something to do with my extended social network the paradigm shift of going well you could just walk up to her and say hello now then all of the arguments and all the debates was always about well then the direct versus indirect and should you you know voice your interest in the girl or not and this this opener versus that opener and that's where all the politics and like arguments happened and I miss those days when it was you know dating coaches arguing about whether which of their openers were better which was cool because it was it was like I think of it like those you know periods in in music like when the Rolling Stones and the Beatles had all this competition right and so they were trying to one-up each other prove who was the better band and as a result both bands made awesome fucking music trying to trying to one-up each other over many years and that was happening in the in the early pickup scenes in the was it like yeah 2006 through to 2012 or 14 or something like that when I was very active in the scene speaking at a lot of events traveling the world meeting all the different players in the scene very interesting funny wild characters you know some of them I would say were total scammers and just grifting off the off the wave of like lonely men trying to meet women but many others were even if I didn't agree with their techniques were like purists like that was that was really important to them was figuring out what works better and improving their craft and then obviously marketing and selling it and it became it became a monetized industry fairly quickly as well but a lot of those early players were sincere in their in their desire to be good at this and their desire to pass on what they perceive to be the best techniques and so you know this started a global movement still I mean small in comparison to I guess many other global movements but it was all around the world there were millions of men who had this in their mind and I don't know how many actually went out and tried but it would be you know it would be a million at least there was a lot of men doing this in those early days and then things started to shift I've seen it particularly in the last four or five years I know a lot of it's been kind of backlash against you know me too movements third wave feminism lots of political things right verse left divide a lot of this stuff ends up becoming ideological and when you trace it back it really becomes right left divide so the the pickup movement got hijacked by gender politics got hijacked by you know all of these let's say sociological themes that were being discussed in the manosphere and the internet in general and a bunch of ideas appeared out of that and one and like I think some of them are you know based in in reality like there definitely is a skewing or an imbalance in the way that beauty pools or how it is distributed to men because we're always talking about beautiful young women right like when when we're talking about the distribution of like guys getting to date women it's not really about like dare I say fives and five six with sixes twos with twos or whatever and that that's that's unfairly distributed it's more that most guys want to date women that they perceive to be very beautiful or that most men perceived to be beautiful in the consensus there's less of them than there is the other types of women and all men are interested in the hot ones and so there's a lot of competition for what would be considered the top 20% of women certainly when I was growing up in the 90s there wasn't like seeing the really beautiful woman was rare and she was usually plucked by the cooler guy within the scene right like she wasn't on a jet in the Maldives she wasn't you know bouncing around the world let's say you know trading her beauty to the highest bidder of whatever type she wasn't having rock stars and rappers and cool dudes from other cities sliding into her DMS and inviting her to come to this after party at this other city and so on that didn't exist it was much more localized right so it meant that the super hot girls which you only ever saw a half a dozen of them in your high school years or in your you know over your college years or whatever they were pretty rare and they tended to be okay paired off with whatever was considered to be the cooler guys within within those those scenes and then there was this distribution down of like okay other different types of women would hook up with the you know it went down the scale right we know what I'm talking about here absolutely with the advent of Instagram only fans sugar date sugar baby websites ease of travel social media in general plus that like people do way less especially like younger generations do way less social things they're not just going out and hanging out in the park or going to to bars or having house parties or you know hanging around at the skate park or down in the city center like we used to we should just go to Civic was the center of Canberra not a cool city but that's where you'd hang out and you know smoke a C and like look at the girls who come to watch the skaters and then occasionally you know you might go over and just or someone might know someone you might go and start a conversation because someone knew someone and you know so you would still meet women out in broad social scenes even if you weren't super cool I was not a cool guy I was just average you know wasn't in any way have high status I was considered average on most metrics but me and all my friends who were the same we just we did meet women weren't the hottest ones none of us got to data 10 but you know we'd hook up because there were things where men and women met up with each other girls and boys met up and we were both horny and eventually people hooked up in some way or another a lot of that has changed yeah there's I mean I deal with men all the time who spend the vast majority of their time in front of screens"}
