Until you're sick of yourself doing this thing. Right, you're just, and it's the rock bottom. Question about breakup. This sounds like a song, like a country song. Some are circumstantial, some because of internal relationship issues. But after the breakup itself, when do we shift from sitting with the pain to taking deliberate steps to process and move on? Well, the first thing is it's important to be with the pain. That's that's something that I've I've learned the hard way. I broke up with my girl. Well, she broke up with me two years ago. And because I was didn't really have a choice because I had to teach the Eurotour the next day, I didn't deal with the pain. And so that pain was deferred, which you have to kind of deal with it eventually anyway. And this goes for not just breakups. This goes for tragedies of, I guess, of any type, right? Like someone dies or you lose your job or COVID destroys your business or fucking of the many tragedies that humans encounter along the way. Grief and mourning is an absolutely integral part of life. There's no society on the planet that doesn't cry. Like individuals may not cry, but but these emotional responses to cry and feel grief and mourning, they're part of the human condition. Particularly men, depending on what society you're brought up in and what family you're brought up in, are often taught that that is not OK to be sad, to cry, to feel grief because that says that you're weak and that's bullshit. It's not correct. In many, many traditional societies and not again, I'm not glorifying traditional societies, let's say pre-agricultural societies, because they certainly have their issues as well. There's all sorts of nasty, weird shit that can go on within a tribal society. But grieving is often ritualized, right? So people would come back from a war or raiding, a raiding party or a small war that would happen and warriors were killed, you know, or the village was raided and people would come together and cry together and grieve together like they would also come and vomit together or dance together or go through psychedelic journeys together. And so the grieving process is really important. Speaking to a number of veterans from Afghanistan, the American veterans that I've taught just happen to be those guys, seeing that the thing that hurt the most or seemed to really intensify the damage was being sent home and just dumped at the at the army depot and going, see you later. Thank you for your service. See you later. And they're like, I watched my friends blown up. I killed a civilian. I went through fucking hell and back and now I'm just dumped out here. And here's some opioids. Right. So and no wonder often veterans become drug addicts or self-harm or, you know, have fucked up lives. So the first point I'm making is you do need to be with the pain and it's OK. And it's OK to be sloppy with it, right? Like don't think you're going to grieve efficiently or you're going to Gary Vee the shit out of your grieving process. It's like mourning and being sad and heartbroken is a sloppy, ugly, pathetic thing, right? You may find yourself on the floor rolling around with a bottle of Jack Daniels clinking your head. But I mean, that's not my way to do it, but I can imagine doing that. Right. You need to actually be raw enough to feel it. And in coping strategies, again, like humans, humans are always using coping strategies, every teaspoon of sugar, every fatty thing that you consume, every like mindless meme and stupid thing that you watch on YouTube. These are all coping strategies for the intensity of of life, right? The rawness of life to distract yourself from uncertainty and fear and pain and obligations and responsibilities and so on. So if you need to use coping strategies initially, OK, whatever. Just fucking get wasted. Go out and bang, bang a bunch of girls in sloppy one night stands. Whatever you need to do. But try to minimize that and then be able to sit with the with the grief. And that will mean for most people reaching out and asking for help. And if you're not good at asking for help, which I'm not, you'll you'll probably need to instruct people on how to give you help because people will be like, oh, how you doing, man? You know, I fucking broke up with Charlene. This is in Australia. Hey, you're right, mate. Fucking. Yeah. Don't worry about the bitch. Just fucking root another one. And you may need to say, I think I need to talk about it. Can you just ask me some shit and kind of coach people? And you may be disappointed. You may find that people, some people that you thought would be there for you just don't really know how to deal with it, don't want to deal with it. And so, you know, that's the thing of like you find out who your real friends are. It doesn't mean that not real friend, that you're really real friends are in those processes. And to just to dump it and purge, to talk about it and talk about what you did wrong, what she did wrong, to fucking call her a fucking bitch, if that's relevant, or to feel ashamed because of what you did or to go through this grieving process. And then if it's really, really hardcore, then then you seek out proper help. Right. So a psychiatrist, I mean, I would say don't go to a psych straight away, because the best that a psych is going to do probably is give you antidepressants or some kind of meds, which there is a time and a place for, for sure. Sometimes people just need that because they're at their wits end and it's too overwhelming and they need to just get medicated for some time. I've seen that happen because they work. They just, you know, they numb you. They keep you on a kind of level bandwidth and they allow you maybe to get through a particularly critical time. But that's if you're in an extreme crisis, because they don't really deal with the issue. They don't allow you to grieve, to to analyze what went wrong, to be able to come to some sort of peace and acceptance of your actions, her actions or the disintegration of the relationship, and then to be able to move on in the sense that you can go into being a single person. I would not recommend jumping immediately into another relationship to compensate, which is a very common thing. But to go into being a man who is single now. And OK with that, right? Because that is a period that most men are not good at. Like they're not good at being single because they're in scarcity. They're they don't feel very powerful. And so it can be quite easy to latch onto the first female that comes along that that's willing to be latched onto. And if there's issues with in the previous relationship, which there were, obviously, you need to have some time alone to be to be a single person and to come to to peace and to be able to be happy or functional as as a as a unit, because that's the time, I would say, for a for a young man who's going through his cycles of in relationships, out of relationships for however long that happens, 10 years or more, 20 years or however long your your seducer cycles kind of keep turning. It's those single periods where where the soul searching happens tends to. Sure, you can it can happen in relationships, of course, but it's those long dark nights of the soul. It's the terror of the amount of freedom, like having that much freedom. But but not exactly knowing what to do with it, not having the support, not having people around you, having your woman with you to to buffer you against the world like it's that's intense. But it is really important. It's a really important part of life. So the question really is, when do we shift from sitting in the pain to taking deliberate steps to process and move on? Shay said something interesting to me. Actually, we were talking last night and we're talking about, as we often do, talking about habits and patterns of behavior and students because we're always trying to fucking knock this out, how to how to fix people. And he said, one one thing was that sometimes you just have to do the shitty thing as deeply and as shittily as possible until you're fucking sick of it, until you're sick of yourself doing this thing. All right. You just and it's the rock bottom. It's it's and you see it as a classic in in in a movie or whatever, where the where the dude is just fucked it up and then he goes into this spiral and then he's in the pills and the drug and he crashes his car and then fucking the hooker comes and robs him and then he's down and he gets caught jerking off in the street and then he's in the lock up and then some transvestite fills him up and and he's just at the bottom where he's just there on the street. Someone steals his shoes and it's like, this is it. This is it. Can't get any. It's either I am obliterated. Basically, I'm destroyed or I have to I have to go up. I have to change. Sometimes that's that's happened and that can happen with a breakup. Breakup can take you close to destruction. That's an extreme case. Or it can just take you to like where you're wallowing in your shit for a while and you and your friends are getting annoyed at you for for keeping on talking about how you could get back with that girl. And you have to get annoyed with yourself and go, all right, fuck, this is a bit pathetic. It was it was OK to do it for some time. That's I don't think that's pathetic. But it gets to a point where it is pathetic because it is rolling continually in a victim mindset. So there is no like six days of mourning. Traditionally, we did six days of mourning, three days of, you know, trances, and then we went off and got married. So so the answer is it's up to you to figure it out. But I'd say those processes are important in the meantime. Coming up on the 9th of April is the relaunch of my most epic program ever, the Lifestyle Design Academy.
