I would really like it. Fuck. Nobody's ever done that. But yeah, that is really hard. Hi, my name is Emily. I'm 20 years old and I'm from Hungary. What would you say are some things that you've maybe experienced or your girlfriends have experienced in bed that were terrible? Like specific things that men did wrong? I would start with the most common thing and that is guys not preparing the girl enough for action. Like it's not going to get wet by itself in like two minutes. Like I've actually had like a guy like this that just kisses you and just like turns you when I puss it in and is just like, um, hello? Like that's just not how you do it. That is like really, really like such a turn off. And you just do not enjoy it because you do need to give a woman time to get into it to, to warm up her body to, I would say, finger her before you put it in or something. At the very least. Yeah. Because, and also actually I was having a conversation with one of my friends and then he told me that his father told him that, um, if you want to be a woman pleaser, you have to make her come at least once before you put it in. And I agree with his father because I swear you guys have to start doing that because without it, it's just not much fun. You know, like you're supposed to, I would say a guy is supposed to enjoy sex if they can see that the girl is really enjoying it. And if you want to put it on another level, you should absolutely start doing what I just said. Good advice, dad. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Any, anything else? Like think of other specific things which were not good. We also do not like our faces touched. Like we do actually like take our time doing skincare and just like our makeup and everything. And just like for a guy to go ahead and like, I don't know, touch your face. Like, Oh no. I was just like, so like almost humiliating. Like do not touch my face. I think there's ways to touch a face that are nice. Like, you know, like this kind of a little on the cheek. When it's like a guy putting his finger in your mouth during sex, if the guy is like that, that can be hot or just like after he takes his finger out of your mouth and just like going down here and just like wrapping your neck or something that can be hot. But a guy just like touching your face, like just like on your forehead or something like, Oh, like do not do that. And then you've had that experience like guys smearing. Yes, I had it. I was like, Jesus. Also sweaty guys. Huge turnoff if the guy is sweating like really, really like a lot. Because if you guys are like having sex and it's intense, okay, you are going to get sweaty and it's like really hot. If you guys are like sweating, like it's natural, it's okay. But if the guy is sweating way too much and you can like feel it dripping on you, that's like, like, no, absolutely not. I think often that happens because men often don't know how to isolate their hips so well. So when they're fucking, they're using their entire body. So they're using their glutes, legs and back. Yeah, they're using way too much energy. And so there's like, yeah. So I think a lot of that's to do with, you know, guys who can isolate their hips, Latin guys, let's say. The hip game. Yeah. You use way less energy so you don't sweat. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I mean, cause obviously like, let's say, you know, you guys are in Bali, it's 34 degrees outside, you're having sex on a beach, you're both sweaty. Of course. Yeah. That's really cool. Have you ever had an experience where the guy thought he knew what he was doing? Like he was, he was really confident, but maybe too confident and wasn't really able to listen to your feedback. Yeah, absolutely. So one of the most common things guys think that is good to do with our clitoris is going ahead and rubbing it really fast. Like, I'm like, imagine that I had your like cock in my hand and I started going like this, like a full force, you know, would that feel good for a guy? I don't know. Yes. No, it would not. If I was, I mean, what's full force? Just all the way. Just like really like going like full force, like grabbing, you know, just like really roughly. That's not it. You want some time, like you want some passion in it. You want to please that person. It's not with the pace. It's not with it. Like, you know, if you just go ahead and you have to find the right spot, I don't know why is that so hard. It is so common that guys do not know how to actually touch it and how to just go ahead and be nice and like gentle with it and then build up the pace. Right. So you have experience with a guy who's like, I got this lady. I know what I'm doing. Yeah, I know. And he does not know anything about, it's not even at the right spot. And you know, you just, as a girl, I just, you don't want to turn him off and be like, I've tried to just like control it. You know, like go away. Like, you know, they were here or something and just make it sex, like more and more and into like his like mouth or something like baby, like there. And then they just don't get it. Like they would just keep going back to the other spot and just like rub it there. Like they know what they're doing. But, you know, you just like go with the flow. You moan and you're like, you make him believe that. Okay, really cool. And then you're just like, okay, let's switch something up because I cannot do this for one more second. Yeah. Have you had experience where a man's like, let's say he's trying, he's touching your pussy and then he says like, is this a good spot or do, have you ever had an experience where a man asks your opinion and says, can you show me where this is? Yes. And that was really hard. Yeah. That was really hard. You guys should start doing that. Absolutely. Yeah. Well we, I mean in this course we do a lot about communication and specifically like because the reality is that every woman's vagina is quite different and clearer size and location and G spot size location is different. And so you can't just do the same thing on every girl. You also have to ask her what she likes. Cause I know friends who do not like men going down on them and I cannot relate to that because I personally like really like it. But there's women who just don't like it. Yeah. In my experience about 20%. Yeah. Which sucks for them. Yeah. Um, well, and I've talked to them and they're like, well guys always fuck it up. So I'm like, well let me have a try. Have you ever faked an orgasm? Of course. Was it convincing do you think? I would say it was convincing. But I think it's a lot of women who do that. We do that. And why would you do that? Because you want to make him feel masculine. You want to make him believe that he's fucking you the best. This is your best sex. I mean it's only when you care about him on another level. If it was just a random guy, I would absolutely not be faking anything. I would just say, okay, like if it's bad, it's bad. But if we have the connection and I really like you, then I do actually want to be like, okay, like I really want to like make you believe that you're my best sex. And it just comes naturally that you want to please him like that. And sometimes he is hitting the right spot and you really enjoy it, but you just don't get to actually finish yourself. And then you just like fake it. That's interesting. So it's like the guy that you do like, you're more likely to fake than the guy that you don't care about. Yeah. Yeah, I am. That's interesting. Yeah. Well, okay. So let's say you did that one time because you like the guy and you want to encourage him. But are you going to continue to do that? Because then he's not really getting very accurate feedback, right? He's not. I only do it actually when he is hitting the right spot. So if it's not a good position and he's not doing it right, I would not fake an orgasm because I do not enjoy it so much. But let's say that if he is actually doing it right and I really do enjoy it, I just don't get to come and it just feels good to say that, oh, I'm coming or something. Then I just like, why not? It makes it more fun. And I personally do not have a problem with pretending once or twice. Not always. Yeah. Well, actually that kind of makes sense because then if the guy's doing the right thing, but you just didn't finish and he thinks you did, then next time he'll do that again and maybe you will finish. Yeah, exactly. Okay. So that is an interesting way of teaching him. Yes. That's cool. Easier if everyone just discussed it, wouldn't it? Would you describe yourself as submissive in bed? I would. Absolutely. I do not like men who are not dominant. And so describe what is good dominance to you. When he actually pays attention to your body talking. Like if he actually goes ahead and listens to you, really tries to learn you and then that turning to something dominant and just like, you know, like grab you on the right spots and just like pull your hair or just like bite your lips or just like, I don't know, like turn you around. Like again, this is another thing that is actually showing so much dominance and it's so underrated. We do not like it when a guy is asking you to switch positions. Like just go ahead and put me into doggy position or whatever you want to fuck me in and just do it and do not ask me, baby, do you want to get on top? No. What is that? But they're like, if he would just like go ahead and like roll me on top and just like start doing it like that and just like put his like hand on like my, my, my waist and just like kind of control there too really hard. I would say that it's, it's these kinds of things that really shows dominance. Also the talking, like talking you through an orgasm or just like, I don't know, like good girl or like something, but just like, you know, like really knowing how to use your words with a girl to make her feel like a lady and just like still like really be dirty with her. Absolutely. Like the best. Right. So, so you've had experiences where like if a guy wants to change position, he kind of asks you in that way. Can you please turn around or that kind of thing? I thought it was like really bad. I was like, it just gets you out of the mood completely like this. And if you combined the physical movement and a voice command, so for example, turn around. Yeah, that's good. That's good. If you do it like that, that's good. But you have to show it that you want it like that. I'm like yours and you know that. So yeah. So we talked about men's mistakes in bed. So tell me about good things that men have done in bed. So for example, like knowing where to touch you or how you like it and just like communicating about it somehow or just like really just like asking you about it like either before in a conversation or just like during like you like that baby or something like just be nice and like caring. I would say that's absolutely a turn on. And then. Sorry, just on that one. Yes. Obviously if he, every time he touched you, he said, is that good? Is that good? No. Not just once. Once maybe. Just checking in with you. Yes. Or just like listening to you moan like that. Like just paying attention. You can feel it when a guy is really paying attention to you and not only doing stuff to please himself. That is absolutely important. That is a really good thing a guy can do in bed. Just like really focusing rather on the girl than on himself, because I guarantee that if the woman is enjoying it, you are going to enjoy it as well even more than you would if you were only paying attention to, oh, I'm just going to go really fast because I like to fuck fast or whatever. But also about this, like building up the pace, like you kind of want to make her take it, but that does not come off with just like going for it straight away and just like pushing it really fast. Like you just want to give it a few strokes and then like speed up. So I would also say this, this is just like something and just like the guys should like pay attention to. And just on that, when you were talking about a guy like immediately sticking it in and fucking hard, how would you, I don't know if you've had this experience, but how would you feel if a guy instead bent you over, put his cock near you and then said, say please? I would really like it. Fuck. Nobody's ever done that. But yeah, that is really hard. I don't know why, but then that is really fucking hard. Maybe it's because beautiful women don't usually get to beg. Yeah, maybe. Right? Like when's the last time you begged a man for anything? I've never, never. Yeah. So if that was flipped on you where you had to be the one that was saying please. Yeah. That is really nice. I've actually never even thought about that myself, but if someone like did that to me, but I would be like, Oh my God. It's really cool. Awesome. Good. All right. What other good things? Other good things? Hmm. Maybe I'll make it a bit more specific. So actually I have one in my mind. If a guy thinks that moaning as a man is not sexy or grunting or something that is so wrong because we love it when guys make sounds. That is, I don't even know how guys had this idea that, Oh, I should be fucking silent or whatever. Like there's just like creepy, like what the fuck are you so silent for? We actually love it. It's such a turn on when the guy is grunting and just like showing his emotions that he's really enjoying it. And then he's all for it and his body is just like, Oh, like fuck. Yeah. So yeah, that is actually something a guy can do really good things with. Yes. Very good advice. Like I teach these classes live, right? So we have guys and girls practicing with each other. Yeah. And we have one class where they have to practice moaning. Right. And it's hilarious because like I'll be like this. Okay guys, we'll do that. And I'll be like, come on, let's, let's let it out. Like I think there's a lot of, I think like shame and embarrassment about that kind of expression from men. I don't think they, they don't feel like they often have permission to do that or they, or they think that the girl will think it's silly. But yeah, I mean the feedback I've certainly gotten is that women love it because it's like, then it's like you with an animal, right? Yeah. Werewolf or fucking, you know, not just a man. Yeah. It is really hard. It's such a turn on. Honestly. Yeah. Yeah. Obviously if he was like. Yeah, no. Okay. A masculine grunting side. Grunting. Absolutely. All right. Good. Do you like to be spanked? I do actually love to be spanked. I do not ask for anything else. And by like, I do not, other than asking him to. I'm actually but like Just like asking him to spank me sometimes feels right because I would say that actually a few guys are really shy to do that I don't know why But because I don't because I think that it's abusive or they don't want to hurt you probably but it does not hurt It makes you feel good. And if you are like really just having really passionate sex I would not say they go ahead and suck me for like a minute straight, which is the few spanks They do feel good. And I would say it honestly turns on like not so much when you ask for it Do you find most men know how to spank or have you had bad spanking for example, oh Sometimes it goes to the wrong place. Yeah, like you have to hit the booty Lower back. Yeah My organs they have to hit me obviously there and you also have to get it to like bounce in the right way I don't know how to say it But even for myself if I touch it, I know where I would want it It's kind of like on the lower parts of your booty. It's not on the upper part of the position Yes, it does. But like, you know, you do want it like yeah under the cheek and then around the pocket Yeah, like you have to hit it right and it's not a hard thing to do You know what because I've taught spanking classes a lot really which are quite fun, right? So we have like six girls lined up six dudes spanking and the girl. Yeah, and the girls like yes, no left, right But that's the one thing that I found guys actually struggle with the most to get correct, right because I've Identified eight different types of spanks. Oh, really? Yeah, and But even the most basic, you know, the most basic spank most men actually are stiff in their hands Yeah, right. So when they're stiff it it's like wood. Yeah instead of being having a slap Yeah, so it's something that yeah a lot of I think Like sometimes guys get away with it if the girl has a bit of a juicier butt Because there's you've got more margin for error then. Yes, but yeah, it's something that most men are not particularly good at Yeah, it seems like most women like yeah, we do. I would say we absolutely do love it Not too much not too hard, but you can hit it right and then it's perfect Does that stimulate your pussy? The spanking Kind of does it kind of makes it pulsates? I don't know how to say it, but it is really good. Yeah. Yeah, because if you do it, right It sends shockwaves through your pelvis if you are in a relationship or you had some casual lovers How often would you want to have sex? Depends on how often we meet but at least three times a week. Let's say that I'm in a relationship We have to have sex three times a week Because other that like without that It's just not fun Because then I will start pleasing myself. I do anyways Top secret. I do not tell that anyone that like if the guys that I'm dating Because I don't know why but men love to have you like all for themselves and they do not Like it when you're doing it without them because then watching you do it kind of seems to like turn a guy on And then them finishing you like fucking or whatever but like If I do not have sex three times a week, I will go for my vibrator Today's video was just a short clip from a longer 90-minute interview with Emily which is part of six long-form interviews which is one of the Extended bonuses one of seven bonuses that I provide for you in the launch of the master lover method coming up on the 4th of March This is the world's most comprehensive Step-by-step guide to becoming a world-class lover teaching you in practical Explicit detail every single technique mindset internal change technology partner engagement Communication strategies and so much more to make you one of the best lovers on the planet If you'd like to receive a free module All you need to do is click the link below put your email in you'll receive a complete free module from the course which shows You how to have perfect seductive touch and how to touch a woman's breasts and nipples Perfectly.
