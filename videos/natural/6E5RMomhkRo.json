Enjoy, bye bye. I'm a married woman that lives here. Wow. Alright, I got my coffee. I'm just gonna go take a very short walk because I actually have a meeting in like 15 minutes. So, I'm just gonna do a quick walk around the block, hoping to see a girl that is approachable so I get the first one out of the way for today. And then gonna have like 2 hours of team meetings and then can hit the streets again. Hola. Hi. Don't be scared. You look wonderful and confused. I just wanna say hi. Do you speak English or Spanish? Spanish. Okay. Instagram? Hola. Hi. You look interesting. Thank you. Where are you from? I'm from Montenegro. Okay. I know it's a bit strange. You seem to be in a rush to your language class. Yes. You're trying to learn Spanish here? Yeah. I understand. I just started. How is it going? Pretty good, I would say. I think maybe Barcelona is a difficult place because people speak English as well. So you're not like forced to learn. Anyway, I just arrived a couple of days ago. Where are you from? I'm from Austria. But I don't live in Austria anymore. I work online so I can kinda choose where I wanna be and now I wanna be here. And you moved to here? For a couple of months. We'll see how it goes. When is your class? Are you in a rush? Yes. Okay. What's your name? Okay. My name is Alex. Okay. Nice to meet you. I don't wanna keep you up for too long. You look like a good student. Yeah. Maybe. I don't know. Do you wanna meet up another time and chat? Yeah. Do you have WhatsApp? Yeah. Sure. Sounds good. You can give me your phone number. Do you have a local one? My WhatsApp is Austrian. I have all sorts of numbers. When did you arrive in Barcelona? 7 months ago. So you got a job here. You settled down here. No. I don't have a permission to work here. You don't? I just submitted my documents to get permission. And I have been waiting for it. So I texted you. Perfect. See you. Bye. Alright. First set of the day with cameras. I did a bunch before. As I said, a girl from Montenegro from somewhere. On her way to language class. In a rush. Not much time. Still tried to share a little bit. My opener was not very creative. You look interesting. She didn't look cute. She didn't look beautiful. She didn't look gorgeous. So I was just like at least interesting. And dressed like a boy which sometimes I like when they're really beautiful in the face. My name is Alex. I just saw you. I was walking down the street. Oh, thanks. No. I was just going. I'm just out of work right now. Is it a half-finished apple? Yeah. I'm trying to eat healthy. That's cool. I think I look like a mess today. No, you don't. Thank you. What is your work? I'm a lawyer. So I work in a law firm. What type of law? I'm doing family law. It's when you get a divorce and stuff? Yeah. Yeah, basically, yeah. Out of personal interest? Like, do your parents get divorced? No. No. No, no. Maybe they should. I have been telling them to, but they are not. I guess old people are afraid to start something new. More than us young people who are kind of used to change. We work mentally different. I think we see divorce less. I don't know. Are you nervous? Yeah, no. I wasn't expecting anything. I was just walking. I'm nice. Don't worry. You don't have to be nervous. I'm not a tourist. That's true. I live nowhere and everywhere. I would love to do this. Come with me. Yeah, but I will go to Prague this Thursday. Prague? You went yesterday? What's exciting about your job? Exciting? Every case is different. It's not boring at all. I know. For example, my mother is a teacher, so for me, it's boring because she's with me. Every day she explains the same thing. Not every day, but every year. Especially to people who don't want to listen. That's the tough part of the job. So that's what's exciting. Everything else is problematic. At least it's easier to give advice to other people than to yourself. I think. I'm really good at telling other people what to do and not doing it myself. I think it's normal. What's your name? Alex. You can do a fist bump if you want. It was nice. I don't know. It didn't happen in my life. Oh, really? That is interesting. How old are you? 24. Today is Tuesday. You're leaving on Thursday for a bit. But then you're back. Yeah, on Friday. Do you want to get a drink tomorrow? Tomorrow? Maybe Monday would be better if you're still here. Just because tomorrow I will be planning everything. You seem very organized. I am. Monday is fine. I'll take your WhatsApp. I'll text you. I can... I'm still... Okay. How much does a divorce cost? How much does a divorce cost for you? When I do one with you. When I hire you for one. It's 1,000. So it's... 1,000? Yeah. That's cheap. Okay. Everything is not for me. A little bit. I mean the whole thing. Okay, you have heavy bags. I'll let you go. Very nice to meet you. Bye. Another cute one. It's interesting. Once I get into the calm flow, which takes a while, I get better and better at putting pressure on girls. Obviously some are easier, some are harder. And you never know which one. That's the kind of thing. You think a girl would react in a certain way and then she reacts totally different. Many times. This could have been her just being like, thanks, bye. But you never know. Instead she was charmed. She loved it. And I can really put pressure on her. I can really get to know her. I can share things about myself. Not just the basics of I'm here and this, but how I see the world. Why I do certain things. To kind of anchor me in her memory. Also the good conversation and good reaction she gave and the fact that she was clearly nervous and charmed gave me the option to already make plans, right? For the challenge, yeah, sure, but whatever. But yeah, why not meet tomorrow? The vibe is good. Let's keep it going. I don't need my Instagram for girls like this. I'm talking about Instagram to seduce girls slowly. I did all the seduction here. I don't need more. She loves me. She's happy. She's charmed. She's saying, Monday is better than this. She wants to see me. Tomorrow? Maybe Monday would be better if you're still here. I don't need to do the whole Instagram thing. I'd rather do WhatsApp there. Madam. Looks great on you. Hello. She's like doing a weird S around you, which looks strange. What's up? You look very elegant. Thank you, but I have to go. You have to go? Can I walk with you one minute? No, no. See you. Thanks, God. You look good. I wanted to meet you. Where are you from? I'm from Colombia. I arrived yesterday. I'm just meeting my friends later. That's nice. I haven't been here for six months because I was doing my exchange. You exchanged? Yes, because I studied. I was doing my exchange for my university and I'm only staying here for two days and I'm leaving tomorrow. Wait, where did you go and where were you? I was doing my exchange in Milan and I'm going back to Milan because I failed some classes, so I still have to... You failed some classes? Yes, so I still have to keep studying there. That's my plan. What made you fail? I never went to class. That's probably one reason. I was partying a lot. You like partying? Yes. That's why I didn't go to class and I failed. I guess, whatever. I mean, I can retake it three times. To be honest, I don't even remember how many classes I failed, but if you're in the mindset of I can just do it again, you probably have this inner confidence that you will do it at least a second or third time. I don't care. Last year I also failed classes, so it's fine. Now, I don't care. I'm about to graduate, so I can just do it fast. Bad, bad party girl. How old are you? I'm 20. And you? 29. Is that old? Well, my old sister is 24, so... How old is your ex-boyfriend? My ex-boyfriend, he's 26. Ah, so... You're leaving tomorrow? Yes, tomorrow in the morning. When can we meet and have a drink? Well, I would say today, but I'm meeting my friends because I haven't seen them in six months. I'm Alex, by the way. Yes. Beautiful name. Thank you. It fits the dress for some reason. I don't know why I think like that. That's cool. We should still just be friends on Instagram or something. Sure. You can add me. So you're going for a drink with your friends? Yeah, I'm gonna party with them. Clubs or bars or pubs? I have no idea what we're doing, but they're taking me somewhere. Alright. So... Maybe I'll be out with my friends later. To be honest, I'm not a big party guy anymore. Those days are over. I understand. During your time, it was different. Yeah, I get that. My sister's boyfriend is the same. I'm so boring now. It's fine. Three drinks and I'm like, oh, what did I do? It's fine. That's being old. Thank you. You're welcome. Alright. You're lovely. Thank you. See you. Have fun. Bye-bye. She was lovely. You know, that's often how it goes. She just came here. She's leaving tomorrow. She was clearly into me. She gave me a hug in the end, which I invited her into. Usually, I'm pretty careful with touching too early. I think it has more risk than benefit. But in this one, I just felt good and she sunk into me. That's nice. But she's leaving tomorrow. Not much I can do. If I really want to push it, I could try to assemble guys and another girl and go out with her and meet there. But that's not the game I'm playing anymore, really. Then, if you look closely on that one, if you re-watch it, I was very still. And kind of the first times I could really put pressure on her with the topics of bad student and how dare you and da-da-da. Bad, bad party girl. But then I relate later by saying, yeah, I was not a great student either. I failed some classes as well. I get you. Don't worry. I don't even remember how many classes I failed. And we kind of related on that vibe and it made her a little nervous and giggly and then I released the pressure. So it was a good example in that one of me putting pressure and then releasing the pressure. In other news, our lovely lady from the train station responded for sure confirming that we're going to meet today at 7. We're going to meet in 1 hour and 30 minutes. Sorry. Hi. It's green. You look awesome. Oh, thank you. Alright. I don't know what to say. Thanks. You don't look bad either. Thank you. What's your name? Okay, let's stand here a little bit.
