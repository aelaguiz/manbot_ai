I've done 10 a day for a good two and a half months and it feels like other human beings are not interested. Okay, well, one thing James talked about. Just so you know, I know Ran well. Why didn't you ask me that last week when we were spending all week here? He's a guy that did work with us recently and has been grinding like a motherfucker. He's been on it. So he's putting in the work. So there's the back. And he's very good too. He's got good skills. He's got a really interesting style of seduction. Mostly when I'm teaching guys, it's very clear that they're kind of initially copying you and just putting the Lego blocks together. But he's straight out of the gate, but quite a unique twist on things. So he's got a cool style and feel and he's doing the work. So what do you feel then? Why does he feel like people aren't interested? I think it's good. It's good. If you ask answer because you don't because you don't know him, maybe you get a different perspective. Well, one thing is, is, you know, we're going back to being childlike, clear your mind a little bit, knowing everything. Right. And also maybe you're this is an important thing. Like you just said, he's grinding. He's doing his work. He's out there doing it. And after a while, it does become a bit. It can become a bit algorithmic. OK, if I do this this many times, this happens. If I do this this many times, this happens. She looks like that. She wears this. She's a basic bitch. She's a you know, you start categorizing and doing what minds do, categorizing and classifying. And, you know, there's always truth in all those categories and class, but not all. Not the whole truth. And so it's really looking at each person. If you can remind yourself. And I'm just saying this for myself and you because I've been there and I understand it. But it's like looking at each person as their unique soul. And also maybe you're in a place yourself where it's like you're on a certain frequency. You're on a certain level that you're not meeting enough people like yourself. Enough women that match who you are, where you are. Because when you meet that woman, she will be endlessly interesting. And when you meet women like that or you explore certain facets of women. Like James is a master at exploring the woman's sexuality without wanting to know the rest of it. I'm kidding. Okay, goodbye. What did you say? Goodbye. No, I'm kidding. But it's exploring. So really going in with this explorer mindset. Like I want to know. And don't assume. And I'll give a funny story about Sasha. Way back in the day, James and Sasha came to New York. And I don't think Sasha spent much time in New York at that point. And he was running around. This is early Sasha. Early days for Sasha. We couldn't walk down the street with him without talking to everybody, right? Even though he was staying with James and him were staying with my young, beautiful girlfriend at that time. He had to do it in front of her. So anyway, long story short, he walked up to a really young, like maybe 19-year-old. Very like, if you can imagine, like girl with the pearly earring. Very like young model and very fair and innocent. And he came in and did his jokes. And she was like, you know, like didn't know what to do with it. And he just walked away and said, she's boring. And I said, no, she's, you just did not disarm her. You're just like, you're looking to make a joke. You're looking to do that. And she's not going to come back at you with that full force. You didn't really get to know her on her level and the frequency she's at. And it may be much more fascinating than you think. He understands that now, but, and he just really would rather have made the joke and got laid. So that's the truth. It's like, wait, you've got to be able to connect with people on their level. And yeah, I don't want to know everyone. I don't want to eat at every restaurant. In fact, I'll walk five miles before I find the right restaurant for me. I don't want to date every girl. I could date all kinds of girls, but I can't, I only have so much time. And also, you know, hanging out with bad energies, worse than hanging out with bad food. So it's like, you want to be curious about people. Really genuinely curious, not as a matter of strategy, although that's important as a matter of strategy. But generally like, hey, who is this person? What is that person? And some people you're just not going to connect with. Many people you will, and some you'll connect with on a really deep level. So it's just like, I think you got to the point where you realize there's an algorithm going. And then the other thing I do for myself, like it is an art and you are an artist. And you're in this art connection. Maybe you have to reinvent it for yourself again. And as a coach, I've had to do that. I've been coaching literally since 2007 and really at full speed since 2009. And that's a lot of years. And there was times when I would get, oh, I don't want to do this. And then I realized, wait a minute. I invented this. I invented my business. These guys are coming to me for what I invented. Reinvent it. Because if it ain't fun for me, then it ain't going to be fun for my client. It ain't going to be fun for any girl. So I constantly reinvent the way I do things, going with my flow so that I'm bringing in this brand newness, the brand new excitement of what we're doing together and not something like algorithmic stock thing. So it's the same thing. Reinvent the way you're doing it. Find a new way to approach it. Find a new skill to add into your repertoire. Like, for example, I'm going to start conversations in this new way. Like we're big friends already as if we're great friends. I'm going to really in every conversation on this day, I'm going to make sure I really qualify them, really challenge each girl. I'm going to make sure I do that three times throughout each conversation. I'm going to make sure that I validate the hell out of each girl I meet all day today. I'm going to make sure that I make them guess about me instead of ask about me. I'm going to practice cold reading today. So you can take what's cool about it when it stops becoming a big haze in like, what the hell? There's girls and there's all these people. And you can just focus in on it like a musician and say, I'm going to practice this part of the song today. I'm going to play Let It Be by The Beatles, but I'm specifically going to focus on, you know, 30 seconds in on this chord progression. I'm going to keep playing that. Even though I'm going to practice the whole song, I'm really going to focus in on that today. So you look at it like that. How's that? That is excellent. Yeah. The only thing I mean, that really is excellent round because it's like I know your skill level and I know that you're well past the beginners like just trying to do the thing. Right. You have all the you have more than enough components to start playing. And also, I know that you're not in the danger zone of if you stop, you'll still stop. So early on, whether it's coming out of a workshop or whether it's a guy who's starting on his own, you need to maintain certain levels of momentum. Because if you stop, it's very easy to just do nothing. So although that's that is only the beginner, I don't know, period, because you reach a point like I don't I don't go and do 10 approaches a day anymore. I don't need to when I rock up in a city. I generally will try and talk to someone quickly because I want to just get the first one off. So I'm like, oh, yeah, I'm out there doing that stuff again. And then I just pick girls when I feel like it or the girls that really that I really like to look off because it's an it's an intimate skill set. So in the early stages, you need to nurture it and you need to do your numbers. And it's a grind and the beginners hell is real. And, you know, you get way more rejections and you get numbers and so on. Like that's that's why most guys never get good at it, because the first bit can suck as well as being amazing personal growth. But it's a grind in some sense. And most guys never get through that, unfortunately, because they just don't have the resilience or they haven't. It's I understand because it's sometimes hard to maintain a practice where you can't yet see any results or any there is always results. But like the results you want, they haven't unfolded yet. So I know that you are past that position. So it's something you're not going to never do again. I mean, sure, if you just didn't do it for six months and then maybe it would fade. But it's that's like you're at the point where you can maybe be a bit more choosy. So it's like, cool, I'm going to go for a walk and I'm going to go and pick up a croissant because you're back in France. And if I see someone I like, I'll talk to them. And knowing that if you do see someone like you will talk to them. The other thing is also you can develop a bit more of your being magnetized by a certain girl. Like to be to read because you're talking about how it's like now it's like every person is the same. And I know that feeling. I remember I went through that phase where I was just doing it too much. And I did and I had a break like I've had back in my early days. I just had breaks from like not talking to any girls for a week, knowing that I would go back to it and that it was the skill set was stable. But that it was just like, I'm going to recollect. I'm going to go and spend some time with some female friends that I'm not trying to fuck. And, you know, just get into that other type of feminine energy. You know, it's like this has been great being here for the last two weeks. No sex, but Virag has been here and she's amazing feminine energy. And we've been spending time together as men and women. The only one woman here, but like loving each other in a very different way. That's non-sexual and that we have a like just getting her having cuddles and, you know, being with her as an energy of feminine. Because the whole sex thing has been out of my head for two weeks. And it hasn't been exactly out of my head as you can see I'm texting nudes. But that's what I've been doing. Taking dick pics under the table here and sending them while Keegan was talking. But that's just rejuvenated me in a different way. Not just with her, but with the nature and everything just being away from that stuff. And I'm ready now to go back into town and be like women again instead of like another woman, another woman. So yeah, listen to yourself. It's like listening to your health. It's like listening to when you need to stretch, when you need to lift weights, when you need to when your body craves salt or vitamins or whatever. It's like it's not necessary nor is it healthy to approach 10 women a day for the rest of your life. Like that's not why we learn this skill set. We learn it so and that you may need to do that early on or somewhere around that five or whatever. So that it becomes installed so that you get enough reference experiences to actually understand what's going on rather than making an opinion based on three approaches. And then the skill becomes yours and you can pull out that piece of craft or that tool as and when needed. And then you can work on being re-enchanted by women in general. So maybe that means today I'm going to sit and I'm going to watch women. I'm just going to find myself a corner, put on my dark sunglasses and I'm going to sleazily just watch women and drink them in. And like watch every like wiggle of her hips, the flick of her hair, the way she speaks, the curl of her lips as she talks. Yeah, I'm going to be re-enchanted by that divine, you know, mystery of the feminine without needing to run up to every single one and run my game. So in that way, you can oscillate between these different things and feel free to take breaks, go and do a meditation. You just did. You're just out here for two weeks. You had a break. And then it stays fresh because yeah, it gets anything gets stale if we just push it all the fucking time. It gets boring if we just do the same thing all the time. So we take a break and go do something else or we spend a bit of time with one woman, even though she might not be a girlfriend thing. But it's like this week, I'm just going to focus in on this girl and developing our lovemaking into something weirder and wonderful. Or I'm going to reconnect with female friends in a different way where I get a different sense of female energy. And then I get the hunger back and then I want to hit the streets again. Good day, gentlemen. Now, if you watch that video and you thought, well, I'm not burnt out from approaching too much because I haven't been approaching at all or certainly not enough.
