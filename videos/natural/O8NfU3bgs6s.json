Hi, how are you? Sorry, what? I said, how are you today? I'm fine, thanks. You look a little bit dreamy. Yes, I slept two hours. Two hours. Well, you look great for two hours. Thanks. Yeah, I bet with like eight hours you look spectacular. Was it worth it? Sorry? Was it worth it? I'll speak slowly because I know you're... Oh, thanks. No. It wasn't worth it. Okay. Is it so bad that you wish you can't remember it or it was just average? It's just average. It happened. Yeah. Was it something to do with the football or something? Football? There was some football match or something, I don't know. No, I don't follow football. Oh, good, good. I'm glad. I don't like sports. Oh, you were studying all night? Studying, yeah. Oh, well then that's worth it, right? Uh, how for what? Sorry. One thing I learned from a friend the other day, you know ice baths, right? Yeah. Okay, I don't like them, they're too hardcore. But what you can do is just get a bowl and then put ice and then stick your face in it for like 20 seconds and that's a really good thing to get for a night of studying. I am the Ice Lord. Nice. Try it or not sometime. Okay, thanks. Yeah, what's your name? James. James, how do you do? Thanks. I like your butterflies. Thanks. Oh, this is the, uh... Yeah, so that's... The wave from that block print, Japanese. Yeah, exactly. But why have you got... Sorry, can I have a look again? Why do you have these over the top? Um, those are older and I didn't like them anymore so I wanted to have a coverage but like I didn't care. You're like, now I've got both. Now I have the regretful tattoo and then I have the cool one over the top. Exactly. Ah, look, you were young and... I'd say the same but changed. Yeah, yeah. You're like layering on top your different personalities. I'm sorry but I have to run. Sure. Because I have to study. Okay, would you like to swap Instagrams? I know we just met but you seem pretty cool. I can give you my Instagram. It's fine. Okay. Cool. Now, I don't have Wi-Fi right now so I'll write it down and I'll add you later. So do you remember my name? James. Nice. And you were... Sorry. Alright. And what's your... Thank you. Maybe write the... Just write it there. Sorry. This is right? Okay, cool. I'm the James Marshall. Okay. Good luck. Okay, so the thing to take from that one was this girl was a bit shy. She hadn't slept very much. You could tell she was a bit like this. Now, it was a quick interaction. She wanted to leave. Maybe I could have asked to walk with her, maybe. But I didn't ask for like a solid number. Let's go out on a date. I said let's exchange Instagrams because I just didn't have enough time to build rapport. She's like hovering on the maybe yes, maybe no side of things. So in that situation, generally, I'm going to just get a simple contact, Instagram. And then, you know, then she can check me out and see my like badass posts or whatever. And then maybe she feels more comfortable and then maybe we can build something in the future. So you can't be attached to the idea of like always go for numbers or always go for Instagrams or always take them on an instant date. You need the art of calibration. The first lady was, you know, strong and powerful and confident. And so... And we had a good long chat. We had enough rapport. So asking her out on a date, making, you know, a proper exchange of details makes sense. Whereas this one, in my personal opinion, it's better to do it like that. We'll see. Hello. You're walking with extreme purpose. Are you late for something or you always walk like that? I always. You always. You walk at a New York pace in Budapest. Yeah. Do you mind if I walk with you for a couple of minutes or you're in such a rush? No, I'm granted. Alright, do your thing. It's easy. Excuse me. Hi. How are you doing? Fine, thanks. But I do have an exam. You have an exam right now? Yeah. Okay, good luck. Hi. Hello. How are you? Good. Good. I can see you're about to ride away. So I thought I'd better, you know, stop you before you because I can't keep up, obviously. Yeah. Yeah. What are you doing right now? Going home. I just finished work. Do you work in here? Yeah. There's a cafe restaurant down there. Uh-huh. Are you a Hungarian? Yes. Ah, you don't have such a strong accent. No, because I lived a long time abroad. But you don't have an obvious, like, so somewhere not English speaking, right? Like not, like Germany or something? No. Where? I lived in London and Austria and the Netherlands. Okay. The efficient countries. Yeah. Are you Australian? Yeah. Could you hear it? Yeah. It was that obvious, right? I have a good ear for Africans. Yes. Very good, because I'm trying to speak clearly, not like in Australia. Okay. It's obviously not working. What's your name? I'm James. I'm James. How do you do? Good handshake. Yes. Yes. And, uh... Are you tourist? No. Okay. No. I lived here on and off, between here and Portugal. Here and Portugal? Here and Portugal, yes. Okay. That's cool. Yeah. Yeah. No, I'm not one of the football hooligans. Sorry? I'm not one of the football hooligans who've been here for the weekend. Ah, yeah. A lot of tourists. Yeah. Like shouting a lot. Yeah. And wearing inappropriate things. Why Hungary? I had a Hungarian grandmother. And I came here, I don't know, 10 years ago, just passing through. I liked it. And it seemed like a good place to set up my business. So it's central. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's central. Like, it's not, like, I'm sorry, but it's not my favorite country in the world. But it has, you know, it's a good hub. Yeah. You don't speak the language? No. I tried a bit and I gave up. It was very difficult. And I thought maybe not that useful outside of Hungary. It's not useful, but it's very beautiful if you understand it. But it takes a long time. I know a lot of people who tried. Like, I don't know anyone who moved here. Even guys that are, you know, getting married to Hungarians, like, no one really managed it. It seems to be very difficult. Do you know Austratom? Austratom? What's that? It's a guy named Tom who's from Australia. Why do you say Austratom? Because this is how he says it. He's learning Hungarian. Oh. He says Austratom. What does that mean? Like, super Tom? Tom from Australia. Oh, right. Okay. But in Hungarian. No, I don't know all the Toms in Australia. I'm afraid. No, he has a YouTube channel. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, he has a YouTube channel. It's very funny. Ah. What kind of things does he do? He's just speaking Hungarian. And that's funny in and of itself. With an Australian accent. Yeah. Right. Oh, well look it up. So, like, Austro is in Austro-Hungarian. A-U-S-T-R-O Tom. Austra means Australia. Spell it for me. Can you spell it for me? O-U-S-T-R-A. Oh. Oh, good. I'll write it down. I will check it out, because that does sound funny. All right. Let's start again. O-U-S-T-R-A. I don't know if he's still doing stuff. Austral Tom. Right. A-U-S-T-R-A-L Tom. What's your name again? James. James. A-U-S-T-R-A-L Tom. So, you're Austra James. Austra James. Zzz. You should check it out. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It means that you're Australian. Austra James. Yeah. I will say that one day for sure. All right. I'll check him out. Thank you for the recommendation. Serious talk Austral Tom. What's up y'all? How's it going? Which hold on again is that after my video went, we're going to keep it cool. Sure. Yeah, cool. And what else is going on in life? You look like you might be a bit of a hippie. Yeah. Yeah. I am. This is oak. Well, they're fake oak leaves. Yeah. I'd be... Depends. Yeah. That's like an English oak. I'm really into oak trees. Trees? Oak trees specifically. Yeah. Why? I grow them in Portugal like about six different types. Yeah. I like ecology. I like growing forests and fungus and wildflowers. It's very easy. You just go like this. I've got a machine and it just spits seeds out. I do that in the winter all over the place. In the spring, there's wildflowers. It's cool. Yeah. In Portugal, where? North. Like inland from Porto. It's like in a valley. Okay. Kind of in the middle of nowhere. Nice. It's gorgeous. Very chill. Very green. Like lots of sun, lots of rain. It's perfect microclimate. Very nice. I've never been to Portugal. I was supposed to go to Boom Festival this year, but... That's a cool festival. I have a job lined up, so I can't go. But it's okay. There's a lot of cool festivals. And Portuguese are really relaxed and very welcoming. Like the Spanish can be a bit more abrasive to tourists, but the Portuguese are not overrun and they're very amiable people. I can recommend it. You know. Cool. Alright, I should go. Do you want to hang out sometime? Yeah. WhatsApp or something? Sorry? WhatsApp or something? I do have WhatsApp. Alright. That's usually how I communicate, because I change SIM cards a bit. Right? Spell like this? Exactly. Okay. Right? Yeah. Because I'm Magyar. Magyar is Hungarian in Hungarian. Yes. Magyar. The great old tribe. And Astra or James. You can put in all the other bits. Don't ride away with my phone. I have a bad ankle, so I won't be... You won't be too fast? No. Alright. Cool. Well, I'm off tomorrow, but I'll be back in some weeks, so I'll send you a text. That's fine. Alright. I'm quite busy always. Alright. Good. Not stressed, though. Good and cheap food. Where? Like behind that little brick? Behind, there's like a door which leads down. And it's the buffet of the university. Okay. This is the film university. Good to know. And the coffee is cheaper than in the area. It's a hidden place. Thank you. Yeah, exactly. Maybe I'll get a sandwich there soon. It's really nice. Alright, thanks for the recommendation. It's a good recommendation. Alright. See you soon. Take it easy. Bye. Excuse me, stop for a moment. Okay. I was very impressed with what you were balancing it on your head, right? Thank you. Are you practicing for something? No. It's just my way of walking. I like this. It's cool. You'll have very nice posture. What are you reading? What am I reading? I'm reading this book. Saman Rushdie's Shame. Ah, yes. Excellent. Is it good? Is he overrated? I just started it. It's like 150. I read 150. That's enough to have an impression. It's nice. It's not bad. I like the author. I like this book. Yes. This book is nice. He writes it very well. I've read bits of the Satanic Burst to try and figure out why the Iranians hated him so much. What? I said I've read bits of the Satanic Verses. You know, the one that he got the fatwa over. Yes, yes. Okay, I haven't read that, but I know that. Yeah, I just wanted to know why. It wasn't really justified, I don't think. Are you Latin American? If I'm Latin American? No. What are you? I'm Italian. Uh-huh, cool. Are you from here? No, I'm Australian. Okay, I see. Visiting. No, I live here half the time. You live here. Okay, that's nice. And you? That's nice? That's nice, yeah. Cool. What, you're studying or what? No, I'm working. What kind of work? Office. Alright. What's it like? I've never worked in an office. It's, I, I, I do, like, marketing stuff. But is the... Mail, phone calls, clients. But is the, what's the, is the dynamic fun? Like, because, I mean, I imagine the work's just average. No, it's not fun. It's not fun. I don't like that. So that's why I want to change job as well. To what? Let's do that. It's life. Alright. Cool. See ya. Ciao. Hi there. Are you coming or going? I'm standing. You're standing? Yes. You're just claiming this spot? Yes. But did you just arrive or are you about to leave somewhere? Uh, I'm leaving. Oh. Why? Oh, because I just thought I'd say hi. Why? You look like... Don't be suspicious. I'm not trying to sell you anything or take your bag or anything like that. Just thought you look cool and nice. Thanks. Are you an athlete of some sort? I was, yes. I can see your shoulders are strong. Thank you. No, they're nice. I'm a dancer. Yes, because your posture is also good. Like a ballet dancer? Yes, I did ballet. But modern and temporary, I was a gymnast as well. How are your bones? Your joints? What? How are your joints and bones? Bad. Yep. That's always the way with ballet dancers because they're cruel to you, right? Yep. And your name is? I can't hear you. I know. I can hear it in your accent. It's very obvious. And can you guess where I am from my accent? I'll try. I'll do it properly. How you going? My name's James. You can't... Oh, Australian? Yeah. Yeah. I had to adjust a little bit. So... That's a nice name. Is it spelt the same with an A or with an O? It's just... Oh. Okay. Well, I haven't heard that one before. Is it common? No. I thought not. Yeah. I'm not a tourist. I live here, so I've met Hungarians before. What? I'm not a tourist. I live here. Yeah. Did you deliberately match your nails and your top and stuff? Well, yes. My favorite color is yellow. Yeah. It works. Match, match. And even a little bit on the bag as well. No, it's not mine. It's my friend's. Well, that was an accidental match. Don't...  You clearly do like yellow. Do you want to ask me a question before I go? Am I speaking really softly? It's just very noisy, I guess. My hearing is not that good. Did you go to too many raves? Maybe too many raves. I wasn't. One or two. One or two. This is a very noisy street. You should wear earplugs at raves. You should wear earplugs at raves. I'm not going anymore. Okay, you're over it. You took your hearing damage and now you're done. So, anyway, what I said was, before I leave, which I must do soon, would you like to ask me anything? Or, you know, have a chat? Hello. Hello. She's not taking your earplugs. What are you? Where are you from? From Georgia. From Georgia? All right, cool. I'm James. How are you doing? Nice to meet you. Excellent. Cool. And what's the plan now? We are going home. All right, excellent. Cool, all right. Nice to meet you. Take it easy. See you. Excuse me. Hi. Don't be sorry. Are you okay? Oh, good. I don't want anything. I just thought you looked cute, so I thought I'd introduce myself. Thank you. You can stop looking suspicious. I already explained what's happened. Okay. Has this never happened to you before? Sorry, what? I'll start slowly and I'll start again. I'm James. What's your name? Is that a handshake? Yes. It doesn't count. It's like just a... Which country is that from? Russia. Right, okay, cool. See you later. Now, is James Marshall a racist? No, absolutely not. Just because I choose not to fuck with Z doesn't mean I'm a racist. I just choose to have preferences. So when she said she was a Russian, that was enough for me. Excuse me. Yeah, sorry. Oh, cool. Sorry. That's alright. I was walking that way, and then I didn't have any real reason to be going that way, and I saw you and I thought you looked nice, so I came back to meet you. Oh, thank you. That's my story. Oh, okay. Sorry, my phone is still ringing. Is it okay? Oh, yeah. See you. I'll be there soon. I'm already here, so I'm just waiting for you. Yeah. The name? Yeah, I don't know. Here, come. Thank you. How's mum doing? We are going to a demonstration. I'll walk with you for a minute. Okay. What's your name? How you doing? Well, we missed that. James, good handshake. I guess it's a demonstration. Something against Orban, something. Yeah, exactly. I probably wasn't a pro one. What's he done now? I mean, I know he's done a lot of things. We are demonstrating for the teachers and for the students. What's more information? Yeah, so there were demonstrations before, at the... And there was a demonstration where the young people, also the kids were demonstrating and the policemen were brutal with the kids. Right. They used... Pepper spray or something. And they hit them and everything. It was very brutal. Wow. And after that, the whole thing just... Snowballed? Yeah, this was a big moment, but also a very sad moment. And... Was this for the Central European University or the one they were closing down? No, this is just general. For the school system to reform it because the teachers have very low... Salary. Yeah, exactly. And the whole system was just very old and very old. And we raised children in the, I don't know, 16th century. So it's absolutely not necessary. And the government always raise stupid people who can't actually... Who vote for them when they're told to. Yeah, exactly. Like the sheep. Like a sheep, right. I see. Yep, yep. Often the government's prerogative is to try and sheep people. And what's the outcome you're after? Something specific or just generally everything's fucked? Everything. Everything's fucked. Do the opposite of everything you're doing. Yeah. Where are you from? Where did I come from originally? You mean from the country? Yeah. I'm an Australian. But I live here more or less like half the time, let's say. Why are you here of all the places? Well, it's like a good base for my work and for travel because I travel a lot. I had a Hungarian grandmother so I have some roots here. But I live mostly in Portugal these days. But I come here... My team's here so I come here when I need to do work stuff. What do you do? I'm a life coach. I mean, I do different things but one of the things I do is life coaching. In Hungary? I mean, I think it's... Not with Hungarians, no. Yeah, I think because in Hungary it doesn't have any base of life coaching and stuff like this. No, I mostly deal with, let's say, Germanic people, Northern Europeans, Brits... Germans? Germans, yeah. Ah, okay. I don't really... I don't speak German but they speak English, so that's fine. That works. Yeah, so I was just here doing some whatever, filming stuff with the team and I'll head to Portugal tomorrow. Yeah. But summer's finally here, which is nice. Which way is the protest? Yeah. That's called protest march. My mum does that too. She protests out the front of the Russian embassy in Australia every Saturday. Yeah, in Australia. Ah, against the war in Ukraine. Because we're... Yeah, yeah. Yeah, they don't do anything. Yeah, I've been to many countries and everyone else is supporting them and the Hungarians don't give a shit. I mean, I'm ashamed because I'm Hungarian and everybody's saying that I am... I agree with Orban and the opinions that he said about this whole situation and I really don't think that this is the right way we could communicate about this war and we are actually supporting the Russian people in Ukraine and this is awkward I don't want to be a part of it. Well, no, I didn't mistake you for that at all and, you know, a lot of metropolitan Hungarians are definitely not like that. So, awesome. And what are you doing in life in general? Oh, this is your mum? Cool, I'll say hi and then I'll leave you at it. Hello. I'm James. I heard you're going to a protest. I support you in this endeavor. Awesome. Alright, have a good day. See you. Bye. Hello, how are you? Good. You look elegant, lovely. Do you mind if I join you for a minute? Sorry, I'm going to a protest. Bye. Excuse me, hi. Hi. How are you? Fine, and you? Good, very good. I just saw you walking by, you looked very elegant and nice. So, I thought I'd come and meet you. Okay. Is it alright if I walk with you for a minute? Not for long. What? Sorry, I'll speak slowly. Is it okay if I walk with you for a minute? Oh, yes. And then I'll go. Why? To see what you're like. To see what your personality and your uniqueness. I think you should go your way and I should go yours. What if my way was this way? But mine is this. Oh, that's your way, but then you should go your way. Yes. Alright, let's say hello first. I'm James. What is it? Yes. You're a Hungarian? No, I'm Slovakian, from Slovakia. Okay. And what are you doing here? I have a trip. Oh, you're on a little holiday? Um, yes, something like holiday. You're traveling with family or solo or what? I'm with boyfriend. Okay, cool. Where is he now? You lost him? No, he will come later. Okay, excellent. And are you enjoying it so far? Yes, it's nice, it's big and so much people. It's much bigger than Bratislava, right? Yes, you know Bratislava? I've been there, yeah. I've been most of Central Europe. And what's the question? You were about to ask a question, and what? Yes, um, what are you think about Bratislava? Very cute. Cute? Yeah, it's a cute little place. Like, yeah, it's a nice little city. I don't think it's nice. You don't like it? No. Why? I think both. Right, okay, well in that case, that's two strikes. So do you plan to live somewhere else maybe? Maybe, yes, I don't know. I will see. You will see indeed, cool. Okay, so... Yes, you go your way, I will go mine. But thank you for... Yeah, you look wonderful. Thank you. And I hope you have an awesome trip here and enjoy your time with your boyfriend. Thank you, enjoy your time. Thank you, see you. Bye. Um, excuse me. Hi. You look lovely. Thank you. Yes, what are you doing today? I'm going home, I have to study, I have final exams. Oh, are you ready or are you procrastinating? Procrastinating as hell, but it's fine. Right, so you're going to get it all done at the last minute? Yeah, that's my style, kind of. Yeah, that's how I did it too. It works as long as you actually do it, even at the last minute. Yeah, I have some problems with that, but I'm trying my best. What, ADHD problems or... I'm sorry? Like ADHD problems or just a little bit on the lazy side? Kind of ADHD problem, cannot really focus, so it's just trying to drag it out and get it down as soon as possible. Right. But I have a month left, so, and then I'm out of here, so... You're out of the country? Yes. Where are you going to go? The Netherlands. Oh, cool. So you're obviously not super nationalistic and tied to your country. No, not really. You're not the first person that's told me that, the first cool person anyway. Thank you. What's your name? That's lovely, I'm James. How do you do? Why are you here today? Well, I live in Budapest sometimes, so I'm here at the moment, and I thought it's the first day of summer today, so I would go and enjoy it before I have to do some boring office stuff. Oh. Well, not really boring office stuff, just, you know, do some work. Yeah. And I just got here a few days ago, I was in Barcelona before that, which was awesome. Have you been? No, not yet. I think you would like it. It's got very funky, cool, interesting people. Yeah, my friends were there and they said that it was really awesome, so I'm looking forward to it. If I have money, I will definitely go. Yeah, just like, you know, you get a very cheap Ryanair flight and then figure it out. Yeah. That's how I did my first travels. Yeah, but I don't really like just going headfirst into something, especially if I go to a foreign country, because if I were a man, it would be fine, but I'm a girl. Right, so you have to be cautious. Yeah, and not really a strong one. So, you know, you have to be... You're not trained. You're not, like, you couldn't fight. I'm sorry? You're not trained to defend yourself. Not really. I'm trying, but it's kind of hard with the exams and, like, a lot of mental health stuff going on. It's just hard to make myself do anything. Yeah. Well, step by step, you have time. I'm trying that right now, but we will see. I'm kind of sure that going to university will help me a lot, because what's going on here is not really nice. You're stressed out. Yeah. It'll change. Hopefully. I'm not really sure how Hungary will change. No, Hungary won't change. It will, for the worse. Probably, yeah. Yeah, you can't change the entire system, but you can change yourself slowly. Yeah, that's the plan. It's kind of sad, though, how so many of my peers are going abroad. They're an exodus of people who don't want to be under the thumb of Orb\u00e1n, basically. Yeah. Like, I talked with the head teacher of my school, and she said, like, it was a record this year how many people asked for English certificates to go abroad. Like, she said that a few years ago it was, like, three throughout the 100 or something student, and now it was, like, 30 or something. Well, everyone wants out. Yeah. Well, it's probably going to be for the best, because there'll be a diaspora of cool Hungarians who leave and do interesting things with their lives. Yeah, and many of them come back after a few years. Yeah. Once they're qualified and cashed up, they can come back and change things. Hopefully that will happen. I don't really know. I'm not really planning to stay here or come back at all. Yeah, I had the same feeling with Australia. I left. Oh, you're from Australia? That's cool. Yeah, what do you know about Australia that's cool? Kangaroos. Yes, we definitely have them, and they're pretty common. Like, it's not hard to find them. Yeah, I really wanted to go to Australia when I was smaller, but, like, I'm deathly afraid of spiders and snakes. So, when I saw, like, a few videos on the internet on how many of them... We need to fix this problem, because, thanks to TikTok or whatever, everyone thinks that there's just spiders in every toilet and snakes, like, crawling in your window, right? It's not like that. Like, we do have those things, but you have to go and look for them in the forest, usually. Yeah. Having said that, my mother, I talked to her the other day, and she said, I was just finishing cleaning, and there was a big spider on the wall, so I just cleaned around it. Because she's a badass, and she just lets the spiders stay there, and then when they move, then she cleans that bit. So, that's kind of normal there. But, those ones aren't poisonous. So, we have way more stuff than just poisonous things, and if you went there, you probably wouldn't see anything poisonous. Yeah. Yeah, but you're like, yeah, you say that.
