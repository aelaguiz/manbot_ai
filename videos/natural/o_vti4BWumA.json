I'll be here for a while. You're very friendly. Obviously, you're also sexy, but I do understand you have a boyfriend. It's crazy, right? I do drink coffee. But now I'm in the mood for a tea. Hello, Starbucks ladies. Hi, excuse me one second. Yes. I also have Starbucks. Oh, what is that language? Hungarian? No. Okay. You really stand out because you're so well dressed. And I got really curious about you. Why are you here? What are you doing? Because I just arrived in Budapest as well. I'm traveling. I'm on vacation. Yeah? Where are you from? Israel. Israel. Do you like Israel? I don't know. Would I like Israel? Do you think it's cool? Very cool. Where are you from? I'm from Austria. Oh, I've been there in Vienna. Yes? You like it? Is it different to Israel? For sure. Very different, right? Yes. What is Israel like? It's beautiful, right? Israel, there's a lot of people from all the countries. Kibbutz Galileo. Yeah? I heard good things. But I know I have some friends from Israel. I like them. They're very direct, very charming, very charismatic. Why but? That's it. That's the whole sentence. I love them. No, but... They're also very... They can be manipulative. Yeah. Right? Sharks. They're sharks. In business. The men, the men. They're like, bam, bam. You okay? You're cold a bit, yes? I'm dying. How long are you here for? We are left... Thursday. We are going home Thursday. Thursday, what? Thursday. What's today? What? What is today? Yes, today, today. Sunday, Monday, Tuesday? No, no. What is today? Sunday, Monday, Tuesday? Thursday? Friday? Monday. Today is Monday. Ah, three more days. Cool. Tomorrow, me and friends, because I lived in Budapest for a while. So I have friends here. Yeah, then I lived in Ukraine a bit. And now I live kind of nowhere, but a little bit Dubai as well. And we're doing a little like house party, social, men, women. If you want to come by, you seem very friendly. You don't know yet. You didn't talk much. No, no, no. Yeah, of course. I'm just joking. If you want, you don't need to decide now. You can give us your Instagram. Yeah, can you add me? But I don't have a SIM card. Oh, you don't have internet? Oh my God, how do you survive? I have a phone, but I don't have Instagram installed. You tell me... Well, write down my username and I'll write down your username. Who is using Facebook? Ah, you don't use? In Israel, people use? Yes, in Israel, Facebook. Yes. The best, all right. TikTok. All day long, TikTok, yeah. So what's your username? What is user? In Instagram? Yeah, Instagram. If you use... Yes, Instagram. You type it. But you don't have Instagram before? I have, I just only use it on my other... Whoa, be careful. I know the new iPhone just got announced, but it doesn't mean I want to break mine. What is your name? My name is Alex. Alex, my name is... Nice to meet you. Yes, nice to meet you. And your name is... And the other one left. All right, cool. So what's the plan today? What are you guys doing? We don't know. We don't know. Ah, we go to the shant. Yes, yes. The yacht. Yacht? No. Like a little boat tour. Yes, the boat. Okay, nice. Yes, and then we sing. You should drink hot stuff if you're cold. Yes. All right. Bye. See you later, bye. So there's three ladies, looked like tourists, just coming out of Starbucks, which is a bit of a touristy thing. I thought, okay, does one or two of them look pretty cute? Will I be able to get one of them on a date? And I think the answer is no, out of my experience. It's three girls in Budapest for maybe two, three, four, five days. You know, if they're on holiday, two or three girls, they don't just let one of them go on a date with some random guy from the street, and then the other one waits alone in the hostel. So you need to come up with a different solution. I call it the social approach, right? Most of my approaches, especially one-on-one, they're like seduction approaches. I'm telling the girl she's beautiful. I give her a compliment. I try to get her number. I try to set up a date. But with groups of girls, especially if they're tourists, only here for a limited amount of time, a social approach can work way better. So for the purpose of the video, I made up that I have a house party going on tomorrow because I have friends in Budapest. We're doing a little like house party. If you want to come by, you seem very friendly. You don't need to decide now, which I could. I mean, if I meet enough girls today, I could actually do a house party tomorrow and invite all those girls. The point is that's a way easier offer for them to say yes to. They are in Budapest. They want to meet friends. They want to make social connections. They want to have experiences. They don't want to necessarily go on a quick date with a guy and get laid really quickly. They might want to get laid if the party is really good. You set the mood really well. There's other cool friends of you there to talk to their friends. There's other girls which gives you social proof and so on. This is an offer they might say yes to. And we can kind of find out. I will add them on Instagram and kind of experiment with if they would come and we can put that in the video. The point is don't get too hung up on only that one seduction approach. Some of you guys are even more extreme. It's like if I don't get laid by tomorrow with that girl, then she's not even worth my time. Or if she has a boyfriend, I don't even want to spend one more second with her. You know, if she's not ready to go on a date with me, even though she's there with friends, then I don't waste my time. Like have a bit of a broader view on that. So try out social approaches the next time. And obviously, that includes that you should have a social circle to do parties with, right? You want to have male collaborators. You want to have other dudes on the same path. You want to basically, if we talk about my seven levels of the social pyramid, you want to not only get stuck in the level three soldier phase, you want to move up to level four, prince, level five, king, and so on. And yeah, want to be a guy who has a social circle that women can get invited into and are drawn into. That's a way more exciting life, a way more exciting social life. And believe me, will result in you getting way more attractive women as well. Hi, excuse me. Uh, you seem very busy. But you look super elegant and I'm just having a walk. I wanted to say hi and find out more about you. I know I'm very strange. I start, so it's not so strange. My name is Alex from Austria. What's your name? I'm from Hungary. Is this strange for you that a guy just comes up to you? A little bit. It's very kind. Sorry, my English isn't very good. Okay. Can I sit two minutes and then I keep walking and I find out more about you? I just sit down for two minutes. Don't worry if it's okay. Yes, don't worry. I'm not gonna steal your stuff. No, my story is I just arrived today, but I actually lived in Budapest for a while. And I'm re-exploring everything. I'm remembering how where I was. I lived in like the fifth district and I don't know. I'm just chilling a bit bored. What did I interrupt you with? I just studied because I'm a student at the university. What did you study? I want to be a teacher. Teacher of French and grammar and literature. Wow, that's a complicated word. I'm impressed you say interpret. I cannot even say this word. Inter... what is that word? Inter... You said vocabulary and... Vocabulary and pronunciation. Pronunciation. Very good. You're very good. So you want to teach young people grammar and literature. Not so young, in high school. That's pretty young. And they choose the course or they have to learn grammar? The people you will teach. Oh, this will be difficult. Grammar and literature together. Module or course. Yes, yes. Yeah, okay. I don't know if I would be a good teacher for this. I think I can be a good teacher for other things. But I think I want to be a teacher for people who come to me to learn. Not who have to learn it. I think that's very difficult. What do you think about this? It's very complicated to say my opinion in English. Okay. So, sorry. No problem. It's a secret. Because I didn't speak too well English. I will forever be curious about the answer. Maybe you call me in two years when you're English improved. Yes. You tell me. Hey. Hi. Hi, it's me. Remember me from the park? You said hi, hello. I was studying. Then you talked to me. Yes, okay. And what are you doing here? It's a little trip. Yeah, both. So, I work online. So, you can travel English. Yeah, exactly. I help with marketing. I help some people with social media. I help create online courses as well. So, it's all online. Even my team, they live in different countries. One guy lives in Bali. One guy lives in Budapest. One guy lives in Ukraine. So, it's my life always like this a bit. Like I spend maybe three months per year in this place, three months per year in that place and so on. So, but today I'm a bit tired. I worked very hard the last four weeks in Barcelona and my brain is a bit fried. You know this word fried? When you make a hamburger, you fry it. So, my brain is like a hamburger today. What do you like about Budapest? It's a good question. Do you like anything about Budapest? Yes, I like it a lot. I think this city is beautiful. Not all the cities, but there are some places that are my favorite. For example, this shop. Very nice, yeah. Yeah, well-kept, right? Like not dirty, very clean. Somebody manages it. So, you like being outside? You're a nature person. Yes, for sure. My morning routine is to get up and go outside even though it's just 20 minutes to get sunshine. Yes, it's important. Um, very nice. You're cute. A bit shy, but you open up like a flower. I'm an extrovert person, but... In Hungarian. What? Just in Hungarian. Yeah, just in Hungarian. English is a little bit complicated for me. I understand. I'll keep walking. Um, this is nice. I'll be here for a while. So, I would love to take you on a drink or a tea one time when you're not studying. You look at me like you have a boyfriend. That look is very telling. Very like, oh no, I have to tell him that it's okay. He's Hungarian. How long you been together for? Cool. Don't worry. I am not heartbroken. You don't need to worry. Then we should just be friends. I like meeting people. I travel a lot, so it's good for me to have friends in different cities, you know. Also difficult to make friends in different cities. So, I appreciate meeting nice people. Do you want to add me on Instagram? Sorry, but you know, I'm not such an open person. So, you are kind, but... I understand. Would your boyfriend check? Of course. Would your boyfriend check if you follow new people? He's not jealous. Okay, cool. Well, it doesn't matter. Then it's just been a moment in time. Yes. Okay, have a good day. You too. Lady on the bench, very shy. The language is giving her a little bit of resistance. I almost have to teach her how to talk to me, which I did. There was clearly like tension and pressure. Beginning you probably don't see it that well on video, but her eyes were like, what is this? Is this a scam some weird thing and I'm constantly relaxing her. It's okay. I'm checking in with her Oh, it's a strange to you. I'll start. I know I'm very strange. I started my name is Alex from Austria So when you see that a girl just cannot handle it is very surprised Probably she's the type of girl who doesn't get approached that often I also obviously caught her in the middle of studying so she's been in a totally different brain space when I opened her So yeah, it's okay. Did you go in very slowly? Then I asked more Gently than I usually would if it's okay to sit down next to her I really made sure she's comfortable because clearly her signs were like this is strange. This is weird I'm not used to this. So I had to be extra gentle. It's another example of Calibration is very very important and you cannot just run the same lines and same game and same approach with a completely different Set of girls in different environments in different situations again presence is the key being aware of how you affect her and How to react in return of that Hey Hello, one second. You have a lot of power. You just rushed past me. You look very cool. What's up? To work Is To your work, but yeah, that's why in a rush. Yeah. Okay. How do we have two minutes? Okay, perfect. My name is Alex Yes, you have not a Hungarian accent Sweet what brings you here then? You went back yeah, you feel at home here or in Ireland I Just came back here I did spend quite some time here. I'm Austrian but uh spend some time here spend some time in Ukraine now Re-exploring the city. Yeah, nice day. Just arrived back. And yeah, how do you look sexy? So What is your job that starts at 6 p.m. I'm not working today, but I work about us what is that? It's like a restaurant kind of thing, okay Seems like a busy job. Is that you're running up and down your waitress? No, not easy busy. Yeah Remember when I work at Starbucks that was fucking rough like now my work is more intellectual. So I just have to focus online marketing Like online courses or helping companies or social media and doing my own thing as well like building my own brand Yeah, it's hard when you don't have a boss who just tells you what to do or when there's no clear structure you really have to be disciplined You know the discipline person I don't know how disciplined I am, but it depends on my mood, it really depends on my mood. You like go with the flow? Yeah, that's how I'm living right now. Yeah, that's that's how you seem like. All right, um Let's hang out another time when you're not rushing. Okay. Yeah Do you have whatsapp? Yeah, I have whatsapp But I usually just text on iMessage Oh, I never use iMessage I use either whatsapp or Instagram Instagram Okay, you add me on Instagram All right So you live here? I don't live anywhere. You don't live here? That sounds fun. Can be Yeah It says Oh That's a friend of mine. She's like you late? Why are you late? You're like I'm sorry Alex stopped me Yeah It says only three posts, but I have more Must be some bug Does this mean posts? Yeah Yeah, it's a bug. Anyway Thank you for talking to me You're welcome My pleasure You're welcome Have a good day Bye bye All right, she rushed past me With amazing energy So I had to stop her And I did call that out straight away Clearly heading somewhere So I want to establish Her situation really quick I want to know what's going on Again, it's in the category of Calibration, I don't just want to come in with a chill vibe And then you know maybe she's Already late and then I'm kind of Annoying her. No, I'm telling her oh wow You're rushing, you're heading somewhere What's going on, where are you going? You have a lot of power, you just rushed past me You look very cool, what's up? Not even in a like oh can you please talk to me But like we got two minutes right that kind of vibe And she's like yes And still drawing Investment out of her, I'm still challenging Her, I'm saying oh you're not a disciplined person Yeah it's hard when you don't have a boss Who just tells you what to do or when there's No clear structure, you really have to be disciplined You're not a disciplined person Even in a very short period of time showing That I have standards, that I Am picky in a sense That she is cool but it's not Enough to hang out I'm going to kind of stick to the two or three minutes That we gave each other because I want to show Hey I still remember, I know you're Heading somewhere so let's do this later But you're cool, let's hang out another Time when you're not rushing I'll make sure she understands Hey I want to see you again because of this And a closer and that's it So super quick, again Calibrated and Cool girl Hi, sorry, did I scare you?
