This one is from Maverick, and he says, as a guy, I'm always confused about one thing on a date. Who should pay on the first date? Is it 50-50, or does the girl always expect the guy to pay because of social programming? Good question. Now this is a topic which is discussed at length, both in the mainstream media as well as in the seduction community. And it's a question that does not have a definitive answer, right? So just saying, okay, it's 50-50 always, or the man always pays, doesn't take into account many of the different variables that are involved here. I remember back in the early days of seduction when I was reading material, the seduction community was militant about this. Never pay for a girl. Never buy a girl a drink. Never pay for dinner. Never pay for coffees. Always force that bitch to go 50-50. Make sure you don't spend an extra cent, otherwise she will disrespect you. She will not ever see you as an alpha male. She will just be using you for coffees for the rest of your life. It's I feel much to an extreme position to hold on this and it doesn't take into account many other factors which we will now get into. Now on the other hand, I remember when I was 15, I went to America. I went to Idaho as an exchange student, Idaho of all places. And I went on my first dates in America because Australians don't really date in the formal sense and please excuse me as I fiddle with my hair throughout this video because I'm having a bad hair day and the wind is blowing in my hair in a way that's irritating me slightly so you just have to put up with it. So I remember going on my first dates when I was 15 and it was 100% expected. You had to pay and I had to call my dad and ask him to wire me some cash because I couldn't afford to go on dates with girls. It cost like 50-60 bucks because you'd have to get a cab because I didn't have a car and you have to go on these weird things where you bought them a dinner like 15-year-old kids buying them dinners and then at the school dances, I had to buy her a corsage and take her out to teppanyaki and all of this nonsense. And so yeah, I ended up spending a lot of my dad's money on trying to get laid initially and it didn't work. So you know, what's the lesson there? I don't know. But the thing is that North America has a very formalized and structured dating culture and traditionally, it was expected that men would be paying for the first if not all the dates. Whereas in other countries like in Australia, it's kind of rare for a guy to ask a girl out on a formal dinner date, to ask her to come out with him and to sit down over a dinner opposite each other and discuss things politely. It's just weird. Australians don't do that. They just fucking get drunk and wake up next to each other and go, oh yeah, I guess I'm in a relationship now. Whereas in places like Germany and Scandinavia, it is expected that everyone, male, female, whatever, always pays for their own shit. I've had very strange experiences where I've been out to dinner with a bunch of Germans and at the end of the bill, people are just like pulling calculators out and you know, there will be exact amounts, not a euro cent more will be spent. My Austrian cameraman's like smiling knowingly behind the camera right now. It was straight down the middle. And that's in part to do with the fact that these countries have more of an egalitarian, like there's feminism is much more strong there that's considered that the sex is going to be equal so that they're going to both work, both earn and both pay. So you know, I mean that's cool in some ways, it means you don't have to pay for anyone's dinner. For me, I found that quite strange because I'm quite happy to buy someone a coffee or have someone buy me a coffee. I don't feel that that's weird. I kind of like that actually. So I find it a bit odd that everyone has to strictly cut things down to the cent. Then you go to a place like Eastern Europe where it is certainly expected that if you're going to take a girl out that you will be paying, but the reasons behind that are different to the ones that exist in North America, right? So I already the guy who's asked these questions like, ah shit, well now I'm more confused than ever. Well, okay, you just have to deal with that because there are so many variables involved. So the first thing that I would say is if you're living in a country where and you're which is reasonably economically stable, where you and the girl that you're going on a date with are roughly the same age and of roughly the same earning power, then it would be unreasonable for her to expect that you are going to pay for everything forever. And the thing is that girls themselves have very different attitudes about this. Some women absolutely do not want a man to pay for them because they perceive and rightly so that the man then feels like he has some hold over her, that she has, because she has accepted gifts, financial gifts of through food and coffee and so on from him, that now she is beholden to his desires, right? And so if a guy takes a girl out and tries to buy her affection essentially by spending lots of money on a fancy dinner date and a bottle of wine that was put in a bottle decades ago or something, with that implication that he's like, okay, I'm giving you all this stuff. So you know, I kind of earned the sex tonight. How does that make her feel? Well, it makes her feel like a prostitute essentially and not a very expensive prostitute either, right? Even if you spent like 150 bucks or something on a dinner, hookers cost more than that. Good hookers, good hookers cost hundreds, if not a thousand a night. She's like, what I'm worth way more than that. So if the guy is really trying to impress the girl with the resources that he has and he's being a bit pushy about it and putting them in a formal situation where she doesn't really feel comfortable, a lot of girls won't like that. On the other side, certainly there are women out there who use men for free food, absolutely. And I used to use rich women for free food too when I was broke, so I have no judgment about this. It's like, okay, if you're a hot young gold digger chick and you're dating much older guys and then, okay, cool, you're swapping resources, I think that's fine to do. But for a man who's dating a woman like that, you need to be aware of the fact that certain women are involving themselves with men not just because of their emotional or physical attraction to them, but also because of the resources that that man has. Is this, again, necessarily a terrible thing? No, it's just that you need to be aware of that. I've certainly in my time gone out with girls, particularly in poor countries who have, I know, partially come out with me because the experience that I can give them, even if that's just simply taking them to a simple lunch or, you know, to a movie or a show or something, is something that she wouldn't really be able to do commonly, so it's part of the attraction and part of the appeal. I don't take that as a personal affront. I just accept that, okay, cool, women are using their resources, beauty, charm, sexiness, in order to attract men, and men are often using their resources, which may be financial or status or connections, in order to draw women in. This is part of the seductive economy that I often talk about in terms of the way that men and women, or people in general, trade physical, financial, and non-financial currencies amongst each other to do deals, essentially. So how does this relate to you? All right, so let's say you're a university student or you're a guy who's starting out in life and you're earning a basic wage or just enough to pay the bills, pay your rent, and try and just get by, and you're dating girls in a similar situation to that, then no, it would be outrageous for the girl to be expecting you to take her to fancy dinners which are going to hurt you financially, right? So if the case is like you feel expected or you are expected to take a girl to experiences that mean that you have to live on lentils for the rest of the week, or you have to go into credit card debt, or this is like a really painful decision for you to make, then absolutely no, you shouldn't be doing it, all right? So in general, the easiest way to deal with this who pays for things is to keep dates cheap and cheerful, all right? So many of the dates I've gone on throughout my life, when I was a totally broke musician through to now when I'm a successful businessman, cost almost nothing. Many of my dates, even still today, I'll meet a girl, we'll grab a juice, and yeah, I usually pay for the juice, and then we'll go for a walk, all right? We'll go and sit in a park and go for a bike ride, go and play Frisbee, you know, like go up to that castle up there. There's all sorts of things that you can do in this. Go wandering around the thrift shops or the weird bookshops or galleries that are open for free or break into the neighbor's complex and jump in the pool, like there's so many dates that you can have that don't cost anything or cost, you know, 5, 10, 20 maximum dollars, and they can be far more fulfilling and enjoyable than going out and spending hundreds of dollars or more on some expensive dinner that you don't feel comfortable being in, right? So the lesson for men is it's never a good idea to try and impress a girl with a date, because even if I do something, like who's seen that movie Hitch, which is an awful representation of a dating coach and awful advice, and I watched it years ago, but I remember Will Smith like to get the girl does all this really impressive shit, like takes her on a jet ski out to an island to show her great-grandfather who turned out to be a rapist or something that didn't quite work out, and you know, guys do this. They find out what is exactly her favorite food or they take her on some ornate adventure and they buy a bunch of roses and all of this extravagant expressions of affection or of grandiose like stuff, you know, it's like I'm trying to impress you, I'm trying to show you how much I care, I'm interested in you and how much I'm willing to do for you. This is never, ever a good idea. Doesn't matter if you're a millionaire, you shouldn't be doing that, because what does it say? It says, I am trying to impress you with things that are external to me, right? All the bells and whistles and shiny things are the things that I'm trying to draw your attention with, and in a way, I'm trying to draw your attention away from the fact that I'm just this guy underneath all the bling, all the bucks, I'm just me, and I don't feel like that's good enough. I don't feel like that's good enough. It's kind of funny when you talk like that, I like it. Oh boy, I'm never going to get laid. So you're showing the girl, okay, I'm trying to impress you, therefore she decides, am I being impressed or not? Maybe if you do some amazingly spectacular thing, she'll be like, wow, okay, he put a lot of thought into that, that's kind of impressive, but that doesn't really arouse attraction in the same way as a guy who says, hey, let's just climb over that fence and go into that garden. She's like, what, what, are you crazy? I'm like, fuck it, let's just do that. That's what bad boys do. They just climb over fences and take girls on the back of their motorcycles, or in my case, the back of my push bike. I used to do that. A lot of my dates was get on the back of my shitty bicycle and we'll go for a ride somewhere. And like the cool stuff that takes a little bit of imagination, okay, that's more impressive actually because what is that's impressing her with the like, oh, this is how I am. This is the kind of personality I have. This is the kind of risks I'm willing to take. These are the kind of interesting things that I like to do. She's saying that, okay, hanging out with this guy, even if he happens to be broke right now, he's going to be fun. I've dated a lot of women and I've talked to them a lot about their experiences with other men. I'm always, I'm always interviewing women about their experiences and many women have told me about excruciating dates, which were very expensive, uh, but not fun at all because the man was tense because the man was trying to control the situation because the man was trying to impress her with his cash and therefore he wasn't able to relax and be himself. He didn't have anything else to offer other than the external representations of his wealth and status. Okay, so it's not that having heaps of money or having being able to do extravagant things with people that you like is a bad thing. I certainly do that. Now that I have money, I do splash it around more than I used to and this is something to take into account. I'm 37 years old now. My girlfriend's 23 and our girlfriends that we hang out with are around that age, right? Much, much younger than me, students, girls from countries because we're in Eastern Europe where the earning power is pretty low, right? So I live in this area and I earn first world money and I earn really good money these days. So if I want to eat out or I want to go skiing or I want to do something interesting, uh, or anything other than just going to a student cafeteria really, then it would be unreasonable, outrageous for me to expect my girl to try and afford that, right? Because what is, what is the equivalent for me of five minutes of Skype coaching call for her could be literally weeks of wages, right? So you do need to be aware of that, that if you're an older guy dating younger women or a guy who's much more economically stable than the girl that you're dating, then yeah, it's rude and weird to expect her to pay for stuff. And the thing is a lot of girls who are in those situations will be quite proud and I found that especially in Serbia and some of the Balkans and Eastern European countries where girls are aware that the idea is that those women, women from these countries are gold diggers, right? There's actually, there's a kind of meme that thinks that, okay, all women from this part of the world are trying to marry the first Western that comes by and run off to the West. This is absolutely not true. And in fact, my experience has been that girls in places like New York and Melbourne and Sydney were far more likely to, uh, be sitting there at the end of the coffee, uh, without reaching for their purse. Far more likely than the girls in the more economically disadvantaged countries who didn't want to be seen that way, right? They would be the ones that would be trying to spend their meager money and I would have to force them to say, Hey, listen, look, look, how about I just grabbed this first one. You can, you can grab me an ice cream next time we see each other, right? So be aware of that. Yeah. If you're an older, more rich guy, then okay, pay for the fucking coffee. Don't be a stingy prick about it. It's not about a power play where everything needs to be divided down the middle. What it is about is showing the girl that, okay, I'm just doing this. I'm doing this out of my generosity and I'm not expecting anything in return. I'm, I am a generous person. I don't just buy lunches and coffees for girls. I do it for other people around me because I'm better off than most of the people around me and I like doing that and I don't expect anything back. I don't even expect appreciation back, right? I take that for a moment. If I buy someone a coffee and they're a cunt about it, right? And they, and they, I don't know how you could exactly be a cunt about it, but they don't even say thanks or whatever. I'm not going to be resentful on that, in that moment, however, I won't do it again, right? So I will be aware that, okay, I gave something and I didn't expect anything in return. and it's nice. What usually happens is that someone shows a basic appreciation and I see that there's a reciprocal respect here, so I'm more likely to start a relationship of some sort with this person, whereas other people who take things for granted, who are used to using people, very, let's say, very entitled, attractive women who are used to using men, if I notice that they don't even say thanks for something, I'll be like, okay, cool. I won't extend that offer to that person again because I know that person is taking advantage of me in a small way and I won't let them take advantage of me in a larger way. You need to be aware of this stuff as you're starting to navigate the dating world. Typically the way I do it is if I ask the girl out somewhere, I will keep it cheap. It's a juice, it's a coffee, it's a snack, and I don't recommend going and sitting down having formal dinners with girls on the first dates anyway, regardless of the money. Why? Because it's formal, because it's scripted, because it's predictable, because sitting opposite somebody and eating is stressful and awkward. I hate doing that personally, and many women I've spoken to literally will never say yes to a dinner date because sitting opposite a man in this situation where we're talking formally, where we're eating, where there's no way to touch each other because we're far away from each other, where we have to spend at least an hour, depending on the level of service. In Eastern Europe, it might be two hours. In America, it might be faster. But you got to order, you got to wait, you got to eat, you got to fucking deal with the bill. That's a long time to be sitting with a stranger and just staring at them and dealing with this situation. If I'm going to eat with a chick, I'll grab a snack, right? Or we'll go to the supermarket and pick up some stuff and go and have a picnic somewhere. Or we'll just drop into a place which has a hole in the wall, ramen place where you can sit down, have a bowl of noodles for 15 minutes, sitting next to each other, watching the passersby outside, bumping our knees, accidentally spilling a little ramen juice on her finger and then licking it off. Don't do that. Don't do that. That'd be weird and creepy. But you get the idea, right? It's just fun. It's easy. It's simple. We're walking along. Hey, you hungry? Yeah, cool. I know this dumpling place. Let's drop in and get some dumplings. Okay, cool. We can do that. And if I want to buy it then, it's not a big deal. That's cool. I got it. I asked you out. You can grab me a coffee next time, right? Or if a girl is absolutely clear and she's like, how much is it? Okay, I'll give you half. If she's really adamant about that and I know that it's not a big deal for her, right? Because it is just a ramen place. It's not, even if paying the like eight bucks for her is like a shit, that's an hour of my time that I had to spend in the coffee. All right, working in a cafe. All right, fine. I'm worth an hour of a girl's time. I'm not worth like four weeks of her time. As awesome as I am, I don't want her to have to work for four weeks to pay off the lunch. But if it was an hour or something, in my head, I'll be like, okay, cool. She wants to pay half. That's the kind of chick she is. Cool. All right. I respect that. Let's do that. And I'm aware of that as we're dating. This girl is proud and she doesn't want me to try and give her stuff. So, all right. That's the way we'll run that. Or she just accepts my simple, generous offer. Sometimes I'll do that thing where I say, okay, next time you grab something and other times I'll just pay for it. But I never make a big deal about it. You never want to do some ostentatious thing of like showing the bill or like taking your credit card out and just being like alpha about how much money you're spending. If I'm ever paying for dinners for myself or a group, I will just usually go off and quietly do it by myself. And then people at the end are like, oh, where's the bill? And I say, it's all right, I got it. And then people are like, oh, thanks. I'm like, nah, forget about it. That's just, that's what the boss does. Like because I'm doing that out of my own personal generosity. I'm not expecting something in return from it. And I'm not trying to define myself by my ability to buy people's affection. I have some clients who are very, very wealthy. And when I hang out with them, I will reach for my wallet and I'll say, James, and I won't fight. I'll just be like, thanks for dinner. And then they pay because that's what they want to do. So you don't want to be in those situations where people are fighting over the bill, trying to prove like if someone really wants to pay for you or you want to buy the person dinner, then let that person do it for you. Whereas if the girl is militant about it, okay, back off and just pay half. So the answer to that question, if we're like trying to boil it down again, is it is case by case. The times when you're going to get fucked by this is when you walk up to a girl in a bar and she says, Hey, uh, and you're like, hi there. Or you said hi and she said hi. And then she's like, so you're going to get me a drink? No, you are not. Right? If a girl's asking you to buy her a drink within 30 seconds, that's the girl that left her house that night without her purse. And girls do that. Many girls do that. They don't go out. They go out with an ID tucked into their bra and that's it. And then mobile phone tucked into the other side. Uh, because they know that if they go, hi, so you're going to get me a drink? They can get drunk real quick and easy, right? They can get the stuff. Cause the guy's like, Oh shit. All right. I'm buying three minutes of her time. And she's like, I'll have a cock sucking cowboy. Nope. You just bought three seconds of my time. Bye. Uh, and like, is that so bad? I mean, would you do that if you were a cute little girl with perky tits and people just gave you stuff when you asked it for me? I would. I'd be going around asking for all sorts of things. I can do that. I could walk up to a guy in the bar and say, Hey, so you want to buy me a drink? And uh, you know, in certain bars, I might, I might get something, but I, it's going to cost me in the long run. Um, so that's the kind of girl that, yeah, of course, that girl is just trying to use you for your resources, right? Or if you, or if you do it, you got to go and you're chatting to her for like a minute and you say, Hey, can I get you a drink? You're really saying, can I buy five minutes of your time? Because I don't feel like my presence here is enough. However, let's say I'm, I meet a girl in a bar and we're chatting, we're dancing and we're getting on or whatever. And I say, Hey, you want to go grab a drink? She's like, yeah, cool. Then it will be, it will be kind of weird for me not to pay for it then. Cause I'm like, okay, I'm now I'm offering, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm inviting you to have an experience with me based on the fact that we're already having a good experience. I want to get a drink. Uh, so I'm going to just give one to you as well. That's fine. Right? You can see that there is, it's a subtle difference, but it's, but it's a major difference in terms of mindset and in terms of the way that the girl's operating. In one case, the girl is simply going out to take advantage. In the other case, the girl is having fun with you and then she's accepting something that you're offering. And I've had many times where in those situations where the girl has offered to get me a drink, right? Because it's not a, it's not a power play anymore. It's just like whoever decided to offer the other person, it's a generous offer. I will happily accept, you know, a free drink from a chick. Uh, and in this way, cool, we're, we're starting to bond and we're having a shared experience together. Right? So the other thing that I've done in the past was when I started dating one girl, uh, in Eastern Europe who was very beautiful and very, I guess, let's say entitled, she'd been with very rich men and she was used to just having stuff given to her. And I don't even think she really even thought about it so much. It was just, it had always happened and we, we certainly liked each other a lot. We were getting on very well. We'd, we'd slept together many times and I noticed, uh, after a while that like I was, and I was doing cheap stuff but I was paying for everything. And at that time I couldn't afford to do that. I simply did not have the resources to maintain two human beings on this planet. And, uh, you know, after a week of me going, oh shit, we've been together traveling around and having a great time and falling in love, but I'm paying for everything. I, I stopped her on the street and I said, hey, listen, um, I don't know how you do things or how you used to doing things, but for me, it feels really uncomfortable to be constantly paying for everything with you. Uh, it's, to me, it just says like, this is not an equal partnership. Also, you know that I don't have a lot of cash. I know you don't either, but what I would like us to do is to just more or less split stuff down the middle and let's just do it super cheap, right? Like it's like, you know, if with that means kebabs and ramen noodles and tea bags snuck taking into cafes and putting in hot water, let's just do that because, uh, you know, I just want this relationship to be something that's really equal. And she like threw her arms around me and cried. It was a really bizarre experience because she had never had an experience like that in her life. She'd never had a man actually show her that there was a, that he wanted an equal contribution and an equal relationship. It was the most respectful thing that I could do to her because all other men felt like she is an object that I purchase in some way, right? Of course there was other aspects about her that they liked and she liked back. It wasn't that she was like a prostitute, but it was just like, okay, I'm the, I'm the wealthy older man. She's the beautiful young girl. You know, she will do roughly what I say depending on how much resources I put onto her. And in that moment, she, she recognized that, that I was really into her for her, right? And that I respected myself, that I was honest, that I was not ashamed of my position at the time. And therefore our relationship was strengthened instantly. Now this brings us to the slightly bizarre situation that you will find with Western girls, particularly North American girls, uh, to some degree Australians and Brits who, and this is definitely not all girls because within, within those countries, there are large groups of girls, particularly hipster and hippies and alternative and feminist. And you know, these kinds of women who are like not at all interested in a man's resources or who are not trying to play that game. But I've certainly been on dates in America in living memory where the girls certainly expect you to pay. And there is definitely an attitude. Like I watched an interview with my friend John Keegan, a dating coach who was asked on a show where they talked about this very specific question. And so, you know, should the, should the, should the guy pay for the first date? And the girls were like, absolutely he should pay because I'm worth it. And yeah, because you know, he's got to show some effort because, uh, you know, he's got to prove himself to me or because I expect to be treated like a princess. Like these kinds of things were coming out of modern women, modern career women, right. Which I find really bizarre because sure, like let's say previous to the world war II when almost all women were dependent more or less a hundred percent on men, whether it was their fathers or on their husbands, then, and, and, you know, I mean, they didn't have an opportunity to create income then, okay, that makes perfect sense that men paid for stuff, right? There was clear, there was very clear roles. Women did the house stuff, men did the earning the money stuff, men paid for the women, women looked after the husband and the kids and you know, you know, that old story, right? So, okay. So that made sense. Uh, coming into the modern age where men and women have similar earning powers, depending on what, what their jobs they're earning. And if men and women are dating within roughly the same age group and the same kind of demographics, then I feel like this kind of attitude is really outdated. It doesn't make any sense. Like you can either have equality, uh, or you can have the old patriarchal stuff. You can't really blend the both and try and get the best out of both worlds, ladies. So if she's expecting to be treated completely equally, except for when it comes to paying for the bills and then she has a severe entitlement about that. Well, I would question that with a woman, right? So it's like if a woman is clearly operating from that position, I will either just remove her from my life or I'll gently talk to her about it like I did with the girl I just spoke to you about earlier, right? So it's not that I was, I didn't go on some men's rights fucking tirade at her and like, you know, try and scream her down for being a gold digging whore or anything. It's just simply, I said, look, I'm not sure where your position is, but the way I see things is this, and you know, this is you, I'm a graduate. I'm earning a graduate salary. I'm living in an expensive city. I'm trying to get by. So you, uh, I can't afford to buy girls dinner every night. So it's like, if you want to hang out with me, we're going to just have to do this Dutch, uh, or, uh, you know, or we're going to just have to do cheaper stuff. Like that's, that's the way I want to do things, right? So you can do that. And that's perfectly, perfectly reasonable. And I think you'll find that many girls will go, oh, okay. Yeah, that, that makes sense. And if they don't, she's like, I'm worth it. You should prove yourself to me on the first date. She's literally saying, I'm a $50 prostitute and you need to pay for me. In which case I would say, probably don't go on another date with her. Maybe pay the bill to just get out of it, um, in a way that's graceful, but you know, you don't want to be seeing that girl again. Right? So I hope that that answer has created a whole lot more confusion in your life, Maverick. Now, I hope that that's given you some other perspectives to start thinking about. So in conclusion, it's like, be aware of the dating culture. There are certainly some places where it's just expected that the man, like, let's say with Ukrainian and Russian girls, this, this is an interesting thing I noticed is that if a Ukrainian or a Russian girl accepts a date with a guy, it generally means unless he fucks it up, that he's got a good chance of getting laid. Right? I've found those girls are more difficult to get numbers off and more difficult to get on dates with, but they typically, when they do decide to go on a date with a guy, you know, they're, they're definitely considering, all right, if he's a gentleman, if I like him, if this goes well, then yes, okay, we're going to start something physical. And I remember some years ago, it was actually here. There was a, there was a boat club on the other side over there. We were teaching a Euro tour. A student had met a Russian girl in the bathhouse earlier in the day, Russian, a Russian girl in the bathhouse and invited her out to the club that night. Right? So he had invited her to come out to meet him. So we're out with the, with the group and we're out approaching and stuff. And then suddenly this girl walks in by herself, just dressed to the fucking nines, absolutely stunning. And she'd, she'd arrived to see him. Right? So she, and so she came and he's like, Oh, well, we'd love to see you. Gave her a kiss and, uh, you know, walked her over to the bar and, and, and she said, uh, I would like a gin and tonic. And he said, I don't buy drinks for girls. That's just not my thing. And I was, I was standing next to him when he, when this happened and she just goes pig and walks out of the venue. And he's just like, what? I thought that I'm like, dude, you come on. Let's just be, let's just use our fucking brains for it. It's like, but the seduction guys say, yeah, like think about this dude. That woman expressly came out by herself to see you. She, she accepted an invitation from you. She is from an older, more formalized culture. She would have fucked you tonight if you bought her that gin and tonic. But because you were trying to be militant about it, she called you a pig and went home. And he's just like, you could just like see like tears forming in his eyes. I'm like, all right. Okay. It's all right. You didn't know. Now, you know, you're not going to make that mistake again. Right? It's like, I remember talking to one Ukrainian girl. I was asking her, okay, well, what do you think about this? Like if, if you were dating a guy and, uh, and he wasn't paying for stuff, what would you think? What'd you think about it?"}
