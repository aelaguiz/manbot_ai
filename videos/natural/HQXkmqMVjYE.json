That's what you want to be aware of especially as you get older. Every stroke I have to use my legs, squeeze my butt, use my back. I'm already tired after 10 strokes as opposed to this. We're going to look at sex positions, how to maneuver between a variety of the ones you're most likely to use, and we're going to look at informal tantric. How to start applying some of the tantric exercises that you've done in that formal setting with someone that has no idea what you're doing and I don't even need to tell her. We're going to integrate both moving into different positions and then I'm going to demo some ways to get into informal tantra. From doggy position, if she's turtle backing, tilt your hips down, breathe in with me, breathe out, sigh. Now things to note, look at my body, what am I doing? So am I doing this? Recognize this? No, in this situation I'm undulating, so I'm undulating. So look, this is what I'm getting here, rolling in my hips, like so. So if I hold her in tight, I hold her around her hip bones, I've got her tilted in the position I want, and then I can start doing this where we're leaning backwards and forwards, but you see I'm getting that curve in, curve out, like so, because what's happening inside is my cock's going in like this, which is then touching the top of the G-spot, massaging the G-spot. So this is different from, this is me pumping, that's a thing, definitely a thing. So here's how this is looking in action, right, so here, don't move, don't move, breathe in, breathe out. Okay, so now I've gotten into this position here, alright, so let's see how I do it, so, because I was a bit far back, so if we're here, alright, so now from here, I'm outside and I can tell her knees what to do, alright, and then here, alright, so, awesome, from here, because we can do this, here, alright, so from here, I can do the, and I want to hear these growls and moans, and so do they, but not this one, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out. So from this position here, what I want to be mostly aware of is how I'm distributing body weight, alright, so, right now, I'm leaning, sorry, right, I'm leaning hard on one side, alright, or if I, like, lower my entire body weight on her, like, this is cool if I do a compress, right, so I do this, I'm holding my body weight down, elbow and hand, knees, basically, and then I'm, like, lower down on her, so she gets that feeling of being pressed, but I'm not, but I'm still holding, like, 40% of my body weight here, right, because that's full body weight, this is, right, so she gets what it has to feel when I come down and press like that. Feels good, soft, you know, safe, really, contact whole body, it's, like, really intimacy, like, really cool. So you like it? Yep. Alright, so from here, okay, so here I've got my elbows where I've got my body weight here, okay, and so I'm getting this action going here, now I can get her to, tilt your ass up, alright, so here I went and popped her ass up, right, so in here, so same thing, we can build up some, oh, and maybe this is where we're doing just slow intro breathing. Alright, so I might, we could just stay there for some minutes doing this, it's beautiful, and that'll help me, you know, if I need to calm down and we're getting this intimate space, okay, so from here, what can I do, I'm taking my body right up here. Okay, now from here, if I take, hold her underneath the hip bone here, so I'll be able to stay inside her, no problem from that, right, so once again, I just take, and I hold the hip bone itself, and then I, like, I glue her to me, and then we roll together, okay, so from here, alright, so you see, if you see the way my spine's moving, right, it's not just this, alright, it's getting that undulations in there with the different strokes, okay, now from here, what I can do is this, okay, and if I, up like this, I should be able to stay inside as well, and my left knee, up like this, and here we are, like so, right, so this is great, I'll hold onto the hips, or maybe I'll, like, put her down, or some, or, you know, she might be open, right, put her down like so, this position here, okay, and then from here, how we're going to get into missionary, okay, so now variations on missionary here, this is where she, I'm actually underneath, right, so from this angle, my cock will hit the top of the g-spot more easily, like this, right, if I increase, generally, this is not a good idea to keep the legs straight, and then do that, because that's that heavy stretch, right, I mean, you guys think about that, right, like, putting a foot there, she'll be super flexible, so in that case, I'm keeping the legs bent, so the flexibility is going to be in the hips there, as opposed to putting a hamstring under heavy pressure, right, so in this position here, you can see she's locked in nicely, my body weight's such that it's quite comfortable for me, I can also open out one leg, right, that's hot, right, she can touch herself from there, and grip, and spank, make the tits open up to get heavier, like, intensity, like so, I can cross the legs, cross the ankles, and that makes the pussy tighter, right, so if we're over to one side, and then I'm in like so, coming down, now, with inexperienced girls in bed, they have their legs like that, can't get proper purchase penetration, so I run my hand under, and scoop up, like so, and then I could be holding under at the butt there, you know, I can reach under and spread open the pussy, but that's a good purchase and grip from that position as well, oh, that's a nice one, yeah, okay, now, girl on top, I don't bother trying to stay inside with girl on top, it's a mess, yeah, so all I do is this, yeah, and I say these famous words, sit on my crotch, sit on my crotch, sit on my crotch, sit on my crotch, sit on my crotch, sit on my crotch, yeah, and I say these famous words, sit on my cock, that's how you say, you don't say any other poofy things, sit on my cock, right, and she will, now, what you'll find is often the girls have their knees too wide, right, so tuck the knees in, so knees are close into me, because that's going to give her the ability to get this roll, okay, so hop off again, sit on my cock, all right, so I'll guide, I'll assist, but I'm not, she's doing it, right, so I'm just helping her settle in, maybe I tuck the knees in if it's a position, or maybe she was in like, she was too far back or something, right, so then I tuck her in the right position, and then from here, I'll start to see what I'm doing there on her hips, so I just started undulating like that, so you can guide her hips in these rotations, some girls are really very bad at being on top, smaller girls are usually way better, right, they've got less to carry up, and so then you can do anything, I'm breathing, and maybe I'm just still getting some, get some undulation, right, I don't have to be static, and this is where, this is the kind of thing where I can do those rotational, right, where my hips doing these rotations, because I'm not trying to like heavily stimulate, I'm just inside and maneuvering it all around the pussy like so, okay, from this position here is a great one to grip, and then I can just pump by tilting the hips, right, so I can get like super fast, girls go crazy on this one, yeah, now sit up, now this is another one that doesn't work for every girl, depends on her flexibility, let's see how it goes, lift your knee up and put your foot down, lift your knee up, put your foot down, cool, right, so now, put your hands on my chest, so now what we're doing is where she's leaning her weight into my chest, all right, and then she's going to start to bounce, but I will help her, all right, see I'm taking some, actually taking some of her weight, and then to ruin her, I'll hold her and I'll go like this, and they go insane, I'm going to drop down, okay, so that's what we can do as well, all right, so do all that, yeah, well, yes, I can, but also this is Lego blocks, right, so that's an order, right, so let's pick a different one, what did I start with, started with doggy, okay, okay, I might start like this instead, all right, so, because what I want you to, what I want you to do, if we think of our three primary positions, doggy with all variations, missionary and girl on top, because pretty much everything else is a variation on that, more or less, so if we've got our missionary, what have we got, we've got tucking her up, all right, so she's sitting on me, so I've got that penetration, what's going up towards the g-spot, right, I've got knees up, I've got over shoulders, I've got open one leg, I've got cross ankles over the shoulder, never what, yeah, sure, sure, yeah, like for sure, like this, right, but that's, this is a cool one, because you can get, like, I can get this really, like, positioned onto the g-spot here, and I can fuck hard without effort, almost any effort, right, so that's what you want to be aware of, is like, especially as you get older, right, it's like, if I was doing this like a normal man, it's in this one before, so every stroke, I have to, like, use my legs, squeeze my butt, use my back, it's, I'm already tired after 10 strokes, right, as opposed to this, oh, no, long, baby, no problem, right, so that, that, that tilt there, okay, so you're going to move through, and what, like, I want you to, I mean, I know I start speeding through at the end, but I want you to, Move into a position, get it to breathe with you, do it either slowly, or breathing, or you can build up a bit of fibre in. You don't need to do 50 reps and do whole huge cycles each thing. I just get into that position, and what I can start to do is I can coach you a little bit. Breathe in and lift my hand. There we go, you've just instructed on Tantra. Breathe in, lift my hand, up into the chest. Keep the eye gazing. Okay, now she's got it, she's been instructed, and it can be as simple as that to get a girl to follow your breath. Turn around. Did you see that? Move. Okay, so that's a mixture of guiding and, well I didn't even use the verbals, but it's to turn around, turn around. I just give her those guides. So, same thing, we do here. Breathe in and push my hand out. And we're away. Right, see how simple it can be to get her in that space. Remember this one? This one, nasty. Breathe in. This is so good. You can even do it over without, you know, it will create friction. Okay, cool. What else do I want to look at? Oh yeah, so then moving from either, because in this situation it needs to get her sitting up. I can have her in this position here. Holds, holds, holds. You've seen all those things before. I could even put her into a bit of restraint there maybe. This is a cool position. And then from there, when we start to get really in sync with people, bend over. It's just that, I just leant into her in that situation. So, I'm going from here. Okay, now right now I can see she's a little bit low. Remember that? So let's say now she's too high. So open the knees or lift up. Cool, so we're in here now. Because, you know, she's got short legs and I'm a long legged so I have to figure out, okay, what will work for us. Come back. Okay, now we're locked in. Cool, I can move and stuff from here. Then coming down with her. Outside, outside, pull together. Undulations here. Alright. Get up to here. Oh yeah, also this. Yeah, that's a good hard fucking position. Yeah, right, obviously. All this. No worries. Here, here. Like so. Like so. Here. And then. And if, you know, my cock fell out or whatever, so what? Put it back in. Cool. So what? Put it up and around again. Alright, so. The sequence is, there is no sequence.
