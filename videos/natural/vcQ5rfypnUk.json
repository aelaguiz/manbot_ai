James Marshall here for The Natural Lifestyles with an Ask The Naturals. From a fan says, I have a question which is very important to me at the moment, where do you see the place for settling for mediocrity? I get the impression that you, like most other self-help out there, I'm just a part of the self-help aggregor, scoff at the idea of settling. Oh no, we would never settle. However, I have increasingly come to believe that any man can learn to be happy and fulfilled in his mediocrity and that this is a healthy and necessary aspect of self-acceptance and developing a high self-esteem. After all, by definition, most of us are mediocre. Isn't it much better to learn and accept that and be happy with it rather than constantly be struggling and grinding in order to achieve a standard you have set way too high for yourself? Does this really make you happy? I feel constantly torn between, on the one hand, wanting to settle and embrace my current social reality, which includes lots of close friends and usually an awesome girlfriend, not bad, and on the other hand, thinking that I'm only experiencing the curse of the guy who gets lucky sometimes and should approach more. The tension between these two views makes me unable to commit to either. Thanks, Julian. That is a complex and interesting question. And no, I will not be scoffing, although I'll do like the fact that I have the opportunity to scoff, which I don't get to do that often. No, settling is for no. I'm of the self-help. We would never do that. This is a complex question and it is one that every man will need to consider at some point in his life. And I think what we want to do here is look at the definitions of what it means to be mediocre or to settle. I think, really, we live in only the last, like the last two generations were the first two generations of men that got a choice at all. Settling was not a thing that people did out of, you know, giving in and like, okay, well, I'm just going to have to accept, you know, getting married at 20 and having eight kids and, you know, tilling the land until I die or going off to war. Men didn't really have a choice about whether to settle or not. It was just part of what you did was that at a marriaging age, you were married off or very early on, even my parents' generation, definitely my grandparents' generation. Settling was the thing you did. You finished your education, you found a woman, you bred, and then you spent the rest of your life dealing with whatever fallout comes from your choices there. The idea that you can really manifest and choose your own destiny and that you can live a life that is not ordinary, right? Because that's really what we're looking at here. Mediocre, obviously, has a lot of negative connotations to it. No one wants to describe themselves as mediocre. You're not going to see that on anyone's Tinder bio. But really what we're looking at here is what is average, what is normal, what is the status quo of how people tend to move through life. And we, all of us alive on the planet at the moment, live in a different time where there are choices, right? So if you put in the work, if you are lucky, I mean, there's definitely, there's elements of luck and privilege and where you were born and what you look like and, you know, what kind of formative experiences you had and the social circle you're in and all that kind of stuff, which definitely has a powerful effect. But if a man or woman chooses to forge their own path and design a life, which is unique, right? Let's say it's not the standard one of study, children, mortgage, and so on. Then you can live a truly exceptional life, right? One that is, one that script writers would have a hard time coming up with inventing the things that you get to live. And this is where, you know, as a self-help, I think he meant to say self-help guru or self-help man, as where I come in, obviously this is what I'm promoting all the time, right? I don't, to a certain extent, this channel is for the elite. It is for people who at least wish to achieve abnormally amazing lives. And so I don't, I don't speak to the lowest common denominator. I'm not speaking to the most average person in the sense that I'm not a specialist on how to have an average life. I don't teach those things. I teach, okay, here is, here is what will be allocated to you. And that's really, I think, really important is because if you're unconscious and unaware of how your life is being kind of slotted into a groove, then of course, it's just going to follow along the track that is most obvious in terms of your socioeconomic situation or your education level or your intelligence and so on, that you will just be put in a lane and you'll stay there more or less your entire life. And the danger is thinking that, like, let's say lifestyle poverty mindsets. So people who have poverty mindsets financially are the kind of person that is going to go and buy a lottery ticket, right? Or the person that is waiting for a big break, right? So that, or is, you know, like he's waiting for external circumstances to create a situation where they can finally make it. And if we transfer that over to lifestyle design, then the same kinds of attitudes can exist where it's like, okay, I'll do my thing and I will wait. Wait for what? Wait for the girl of my dreams. Wait for that big break. Wait for, you know, this opportunity. Wait for someone to find my music and make me a star or whatever. And this is the, this is, I think, the most insidious, dangerous part of settling is settling unconsciously with a vague hope that the universe or whatever is going to sort it out for you, which will not happen. And there is a lot of mythology, especially in like kind of woo-woo spiritual corners, which I certainly know, you know, I'm, I'm guilty of living within those at some points, but there's just, there's often this attitude that the universe will sort it out. All right. It's like, if I, if I just project to the universe and I believe, and I have faith or whatever that it will, the universe will deliver, which is as absurd to me as going into a church and praying to an invisible man in the sky to fix your shit. Right. So it's like the universe doesn't care. Hippies out there, the universe does not give a fuck about middle-class, Western people's dreams about whether or not they become a, you know, a great traveling entrepreneur or a fucking musician or whatever. It doesn't care. Nobody cares. You are, you are alone in the world. You have family, you have friends who will support you in various ways or not. And then you're going to have to make your own course. So my attitude on settling is I am, I've never done it. All right. I've never, I've never settled for anything for very long. Okay. And there'll be periods in your life where you will need to settle into a groove for a specific purpose. The, the common like entrepreneurial or lifestyle design statements that come from a lot of self-help gurus will be along the lines of follow your passions, follow your dreams. You know, if you commit a hundred percent to something that you really love, that you feel deeply at the core is part of your mission, then you will eventually succeed. And that's true and not true. It's true in the sense that any person I know that has made an exceptional life did that, right. They, they projected into the future. They crystallized, uh, ideas about and, and really internalize the feeling of what it would be like to be that person doing that thing, living that life. Uh, and then of course they have to chunk down a lot of action steps, right? Anyone who's just sticking photos of hot chicks and cars on a vision board and staring at it for five minutes and hoping that that is going to somehow manifest your reality is delusional. And if it, even if it does happen, it is just coincidental. We have to take action steps and there will be, uh, especially if you're a long way from a goal, right? You want to have some kind of rockstar lifestyle or you want to, uh, work remotely or you want to be able to date freely and have different types of open relationships, all these kinds of things. These, these are achievable, but they take struggle and they take years. I'm, I'm 40 years old now. I started working in earnest on lifestyle design when I was about 26, although I experimented with it quite a bit before then. It's only in the last five years really that it's paid off huge dividends. Okay, so I got, I got incremental benefits along the way. At first I was able to unplug from the wage slave lifestyle, which I'll talk about in a moment. I was able to free up time. I was able to five to 10 X my income power compared to other people of my age and skill levels. And then I, I put a lot of effort into creating networks using seductive economy and networking is not going to networking breakfasts, brunches and handing over your card. That means nothing because if you're a person in power or you're a person that has something that a lot of people want, uh, just going and handing your cards to them or sending them an email saying, is there a job opening, which I get a lot by the way, I get lots of badly grammatically put together, uh, Facebook messages that say, I want a job. Uh, and that's someone trying to manifest their reality. Okay, good. You're in the right direction, but I will not be replying because I don't need you. You haven't offered anything to me. You don't understand how reciprocal trade works. There is a, there is unfortunately like one thing, weird thing that develops when people get into self-help or in seduction is they quickly often develop a very high level of entitlement based on a very low level of, of skill or experience. And that's, that's the fault. I think primarily of the industry in terms of the marketing. If you're told that, you know, you just need a millionaire mindset to become a millionaire or, uh, you know, if you just learn this one approach trick, this little, this cool line, then you'll be able to date supermodels tonight. Uh, you know, you want to start a business online, cool turnkey, just read the four hour work week and start drop shipping fucking fidget spinners. Don't do that. No one wants fidget spinners anymore. A lot of people bankrupted themselves and have a garage full of fidget spinners. So there's, there's, there's this idea that, okay, you're sold this idea that an exceptional life is available if we just adjust some internal keys and project out into the universe to manifest in some way. And maybe you take some, some rudimentary steps in the direction. This is nowhere near enough. And this, this ties back to when I was talking about the idea of following your passion. If you believe it, if you really want it, it will, it will become true. You have to recognize that we live in a finite planet. There are finite resources. There is finite attention. Uh, there are certain things people just don't want, even if you are desperately want to give it to them. Take music. For example, my throughout my twenties, my dream, my passion was music. I wanted to be a famous musician. I was a good musician. I had a good band. We had good songs. Uh, we were working really hard on it. I put all of my time and effort into it. And after about 10 years, like I did that for a long time, it was not the only thing I was doing, but after 10 years, I reached a point where I recognized that this was not like, it didn't matter how much I believed. It didn't matter how much passion I had. It didn't really even matter how good I was as a musician because at that time in place in Australia, it was not fashionable. No one was interested in weird funk, soul, reggae, drum and bass, mashup music. I mean, some people were, but there was only 200 of them and they were in the room. Uh, it was, it was not a bankable commodity. Uh, the, the reality was I could have then spent another 10 years intimately. I spent my thirties and there's nothing more depressing than, you know, a guy in his late thirties, uh, still trying to make it as a musician, nothing wrong with being a musician. And you know, if you're playing in a band on the weekend or, you know, recording your tracks and stuff, but if you've got that, I am going to be at Coachella drive after some time, you have to recognize that, okay, there are systemic limitations to the environment. The zeitgeist of the time or the fashions of the time mean that it's not relevant. Or I'm in the wrong place. Maybe if I'd, you know, been brought up in some other part of Europe and Spain or France where people were into more eclectic music, maybe it would have been a different situation, but it wasn't. So I think it's really bad advice to actually say, just follow your passion, follow your dream, and then it will happen. Uh, it's, it's a good starting point, but you need to then add reality into this. Now I'm not a big fan of reality. You know, I'm someone who bends it often. Uh, I recognize that most people live in, in a very rigid conception of what reality is. They don't, they don't, they see walls where there are none. Uh, they see societal, uh, patterns as strict rules and they just have attitudes of like, it's not done or that can't happen or it's impossible. So sure, if you, if you carry those kinds of poverty lifestyle mindsets, then they will mean that you can't get out of your box. But just having this sense of like passion and drive and that's enough. It's not. Let me talk to you about the way that I started to unplug and it wasn't particularly glamorous. Uh, I recognized when I was in my early twenties that I was not going to be a technically skilled, uh, worker that was in high demand, like someone who's in it or engineering or finance or medicine or something like that. I didn't have the mind for it. It wasn't something I was interested in. I was not going to be that person. So success for me was determined by one major metric actually, which was freedom, right? So I didn't want to get up in the morning, go to an office, work five days a week for somebody else, have four weeks holiday a year, uh, you know, pay my health insurance and do all that normal stuff. I didn't want to do that. I wanted to free up time at that time so that I could work on my music, my martial arts, my, my actual passions. But I recognized that music wasn't making me money. Sometimes the band would play eight guys and we'd get 500 bucks and split that between us. That was kind of how much we made out of music, uh, martial arts, the same. So I learned a skill that meant that I could six X the earning power that everyone else my age with my skill level hat, right? So I was 21 or whatever. I went and did a two year course on massage. I learned to become a good massage therapist and I started working as a massage therapist. I got paid 65 bucks an hour, whereas everyone else was getting paid 10 to work in cafes. So I could work 10 hours a week and make more money than most people my age. And then I had complete freedom of time, uh, and movement as long as I came back to where my clients were enough. And this is what set me up for my initial of real lifestyle design freedom. I like massage, I like helping people, I like healing, I like touch, but it's not my passion, it's not my, it's not my, I don't have a massive drive to, you know, to be a massage therapist. But it was something that I liked and more most importantly is it freed up my time so that I could then invest time in music which I knew was probably at sunk cost in terms of, you know, making it big, but I love doing that and that was my actual passion. So I think that's important for anyone who's looking at like, especially when they're they're thinking about, okay I work in a job of some sort, it's okay, but I want to have some degree of this lifestyle freedom I see these these guys living, whether that's mobility, whether that's time freedom, whether that's working for yourself, working from home, collaborating on side projects with people, like all this kind of stuff. And I highly encourage that because those are doorways out, right, and you will need to, if you want to live an exceptional life, you'll need to find a doorway out of what is what you've been allocated unless you're born stupendously rich and was sent off by your father on a grand tour of Europe and everything is sorted for you, not me, probably not you. In that case we're going to have to work out incremental steps or stages to unplug. So I could talk about this all day in terms of lifestyle design and this is an area that I'll be focusing in on a lot more in the times to come. As you guys know I'm not focusing so much on seduction anymore but more on holistic men's change, on spiritual development, on moving through traumas, on male initiation, stepping into your grounded powerful masculinity. So these are areas that I think a lot about and I just want to give you another tip here for guys that want to unplug. And that is that you don't need to do it yourself. You don't have to be the boss if you want to live a, let's say, a four-hour work-weeky entrepreneurial traveling lifestyle, which why the fuck not, because you can at this time and place in history if you're smart about it. But you don't need to build it all yourself. I didn't. I mean I'm the CEO of this company, I founded it, I developed most of the teaching methodologies, the structures, the workshops, all sorts of stuff. But I had really good people with me throughout the course of this career. Whether you see them in the back or not, they've been there. I couldn't have done this by myself. And I think there is a bit of a myth going around that you can just do it all yourself. You know, you can do this dropshipping four-hour workweek business which I know of a tiny handful of people that do just that. They are one-man operations, but for the most part they're not. And collaboration, if it's with good people, of course is a great multiplier of effect. And one thing I've seen is that there's been a lot of people in my social network who've come in later, joined the team, and then got to leapfrog 15 levels overnight because they didn't have to do what I did, which was start from the very beginning back in Australia, scratching around on the internet forums trying to make a few hundred bucks and make a contact here or there and gradually build my empire. If you can leapfrog onto somebody else's empire, particularly one that's like in its early stages, like when a corporation is solid and the structure is all in place and the hierarchy is very, very rigid, then it's hard, much harder to jump up levels. If you get into a startup or let's say like a kind of a family business type of structure, which is what my business is, it's not a corporate structure, it's more like a mafia or some kind of extended family business based on a lot of trust, a lot of personal, you know, like a lot of personal support between all the characters. And I choose people not only on skill but also on how well they're going to connect and fit into our life because we travel together. But the guys that have come to me and were able to go hi, and then within months they're living that life, they're traveling, they're getting paid to do something that they love doing, and they're getting all of the, obviously, social benefits and lifestyle benefits of being around excellent lifestyle engineers. Now, so I highly recommend approach mentors, approach the people that you that you wish to work with. However, you've got to know, and this is, there's some correlation to seduction here, if you're after a hundred thousand K follower Instagram model that you met on the street, the reality being is that you are way down the list of prospective males. You might still get through. I encourage you to try. But a woman of that, let's say, popularity has so many options that you're gonna have to really stand out. You're gonna have to really offer something or be something unusual in order to get her interest. The same goes for if you're approaching a mentor or business owner or someone you want to work for. You need to understand that, and you need to be really humble and understand, I don't have what, they don't need me. They do not need me, otherwise they would have found me and they seem to be doing fine without me. So if I approach a mentor, and I get this all the time, I get every week emails, mostly they're like this, hey man, I heard there's some like internships going on at TNL, where do I sign? Or, you know, where can, when can I start? Like this kind of shit, which is a hilarious because that then taps into this idea of this entitlement. I think of like the kind of cloistered generation, what's the one after X, Y, Z, you know, Millennials and all that. This idea that, okay, if I just like, I ask for things that I'll get them. No, you will not. You must be able to offer something, right? So the guys, the guys that got into this company, one of them is behind the camera right now, did so by first coming and offering me something that I didn't have or that I needed, or that I didn't know that I needed, but when I look at it, I'm like, hmm, yeah, that's, that's, that's useful. All right, so they came to me with a proposal to do some work for free or to do some videos or to, you know, offer, to help in all sorts of ways and not just say, hey, I can help, but like the, the, if you really want to be smart about it, look at the person's business or their life and figure out what do they need, what's missing. I had a guy recently who came on as an intern as a trial and within 24 hours he'd figured out the best way to bribe me was at 10 a.m. when I had to get up and go and coach to be there with a nice hipster cafe prepared cappuccino and say, there you go boss, and then like run away from me before I snarled at him. Smart, because it's, you know, that cost him two bucks or whatever, but that's something where I'm like, yeah, that kid is solid. He provides me with my drugs in the morning and so he can stay. It's not the only thing he did, he did a lot of, a lot of other stuff, like stepped well outside the bounds of what was asked of him and then so within a week of me watching him and saying, okay, cool, all right, now you're on, you're on payroll, he's still under trial period, but he's proved himself in the sense that he's made my life a bit easier, given me stuff that otherwise would be irritating for me to figure out, right? So keep that in mind is if you want to leapfrog up levels, which is a smart thing to do, don't have to do it yourself, approach people, but make sure that you're offering and the other thing to keep in mind is it's often better to approach from the side, not in seduction. So what that means is if you're going to approach me, it's not that I'm cruel or nasty, I just don't like replying to emails unless I don't have to. I have so many random people contact me every day that I can't, I can't answer them or I'd spend all day doing that and I just don't like living online, right? So, and I'm a bit grumpy, you know, there's various reasons why it's harder to approach me than it would be someone else. So smarter people recognize that there is usually a gatekeeper within any, any group, sometimes more, but there's often one person who is very socially gregarious, is a connector, likes to connect people up, is always looking for a way to include somebody if they have something valuable to offer and so that's, in this organization, that's Liam, right? So because Liam is always like, he will, he will spend the time to figure out if a guy's got something to offer, he's very chatty, he likes digging into people's lives and finding out what they're about and as a result, it's better to go through him to get to me than it is to go directly to me and this will exist in many different hierarchies where, you know, you won't be able to email the person because their PA is the, is the gatekeeper and my PA only sends me emails if it's, if under certain circumstances that I've said pass these ones on to me. So figure out the gatekeepers, figure out in what way you can help, what it is that you have to offer and it doesn't necessarily have to be an amazing technical skill. It can be, you know, it can be this, this kind of thing. Listen, I see that you have trouble getting to the gym and sorting out your diet when you're on tour. This is, this happened recently for us and so a girl we know who's an amazing personal trainer and nutritionist proposed to us that, well, she could come on tour with us and make sure that we eat healthy and get our workouts done and make sure we get up in the morning and just be a kind of general ass kicker and we're like, yeah, we need that because when we're on tour, we, we end up eating shit food and not working out as much. Okay, let's do that. So keep the, keep these steps in mind. Yes, you can follow your dreams. Yes, you can live an extraordinary, extremely amazing lifestyle, but you have to be realistic about it. You know, just because you believe in something and have a passion for it, don't expect the universe to give a fuck and deliver it to you. You are going to have to go out and make extraordinary decisions, unusual requests. You're going to have to swallow your pride. You're gonna have to drop your, your ego and be humble. All of these things, like I did that all throughout my life, you know, when I wanted to become a musician, when I wanted to go to Shaolin Temple. You know, when I arrived at Shaolin Temple, I wasn't there with an invitation. I kind of jumped the queue and I had this rare moment where I was put in front of this monk that I deeply respected and wanted to learn from. And I just, I'd come from the other side of the world. I turned up at the doorstep. I presented myself and I said, I'm really sorry that I don't have an invitation letter, but I know this and this person. It would be my great honor if I was able to study with you. Is that okay? And then the monk went, okay, tomorrow 5am, let's start. And then he kicked my ass for a day to see if I could handle it. And then I was allowed in. That wouldn't have happened if I'd sat at home dreaming about Shaolin Temple. Like I've saved up the fucking just enough money to get over there. I went to the temple, put myself at the doorstep and then I didn't go, well, I'm here. I made my way here. So I want to learn Eagle Claw Boxing right now. I was still very humble because I knew that like, they did not need me. There was no reason they had to teach me. Just because they're Buddhist monks doesn't mean they have to teach everyone. And so I applied with humility. So please keep that in mind. There's a really powerful mix, audacity and humility. Because just humility means you stay in the background. You stay in the shadows waiting for someone to notice you, waiting for your skills to be recognized. And that's a very frustrating position for a lot of, let's say, less assertive men in life, is that they will find themselves in an office structure where someone else will be getting promoted much faster, who has less skill but is more of an arse kisser or is more socially gregarious or who figures out that the boss, you know, what kind of coffee he wants and slips the coffee to the boss. And then you have a person who is extraordinarily capable, works really fucking hard but stays in the background and doesn't ask for anything. That person gets overlooked. Is that fair? No. So what? Universe doesn't care. We are living in hierarchical societies. People help people they like, that help them, right? It is nepotistic for sure. And so in that case, figure out what the people want and then you can slot into their lifestyles. Now if we relate this back to Julian's original question, I think he's talking more specifically in terms of should I settle for having some cool friends and a nice girlfriend, is what he said, or should I go out into the cold and keep approaching and keep smashing this skill till I reach the mystical, mythical point where I am satisfied and I'm a master. And he's saying because of this internal conflict of like, well should I live the life that I'm living, which I'm enjoying, or should I be living this very uncertain life which theoretically offers to yield a lot more and he's finding it hard to then commit to either one of these things. This is an important question because yes, being a cold approach master seduction dude is not the end goal in my opinion. It may sound hypocritical coming from me, but I did that for a long, long time, right? Like I've been cold approaching since I was 26, so whatever, 15 years. It's been an obsession of mine. I've studied it as much as any human being can really, but it's not the end goal. The reason that I studied it so deeply, partially, is because it became my business and so I took it further than I needed to because I needed to understand not just me, but all other patterns of men and all sorts of other types of scenarios that I wouldn't necessarily encounter, but my students would. So there's that part. So unless you are going to be a pro pickup teacher, then you don't need to take it that far. And secondly, because I was always interested in living in quite an extreme sexual life. I've experimented with long periods of monogamy and various types of relationship paradigms and I've generally, over time, I found that it works better for me to be in a more open scenario. So then the question is why do this at all? And I think cold approach is one of the fundamental survival skills that a man needs in this day and age. You need to be able to feed yourself, put a roof over your head, and then you need to be able to meet strangers and make connections. So you need to be able to meet women and make romantic connections. You need to be able to network and create collaborations and do all sorts of other reciprocal exchange relationships with different people. Learning to bowl up to a stranger on the street or in a bar and a club or at a party or a networking event and make a good impression quickly is one of the most vital skills that you'll ever be able to learn. It's the thing that will mean that you will get the girl of your dreams at some point because she's walked past you today a number of times. Different faces, different slight shape changes, but the girl of your dreams, a girl that you could have an amazing relationship with, she exists in this city. She's not a mythical creature, unicorn that the universe will deliver to you at some point in your life when you're least expected and when you're most ready, that the ten of your dreams will walk in the door and do what? Go, here I am. You don't need any skills to seduce me or charm me because destiny has foretold that we will be together. That is bullshit."}
