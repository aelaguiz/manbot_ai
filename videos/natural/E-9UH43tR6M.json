So what's your thoughts on semen retention? I think it's propagated that men lose energy in essence when they ejaculate. And I think that has created a neuroses for practitioners. If you have a vasectomy, for example, you reabsorb your sperm all the time. So that's one thing, so the sperm can be reabsorbed. So if you don't ejaculate, you will reabsorb that sperm. Your body will know how to do it and create new sperm. If you are ejaculating, it's telling the body to make new sperm. Either way, the body's making new sperm. So I don't really understand this loss of essence. And also sometimes it's actually healthy. So some of the tantric lineages actually believe in ejaculating. So not necessarily every day, five times a day, but that is a conscious choice to do that. And I actually agree with that. I think there's a nice rhythm to it. You have to find your own rhythm. And I think as men get older, maybe they're interested in doing it less and less. As you say, for you, James, the recovery time is a little longer now, so you wanna do it less. But there could be moments where you're coordinated with a partner. I call it the peak hormonal moment where you can feel it. And if you did ejaculate in that moment, you would feel nourished by the experience. And then there's just kind of the unconscious, I can't help myself, I have to let go. So I think the seminal retention, the way it is good for guys is learning choice. So I prefer to recall ejaculatory choice. And now you're choosing whether your body releases or doesn't release. I don't believe in the million dollar point. I think it's harmful. You're basically ejaculating into your bladder, which can sometimes even lead to certain infections. So kind of best not to do that and really instead learn pelvic floor breathing, strengthen your ass. You need a really strong ass. If your ass is weak, this is not gonna be a very easy practice. And I'm gonna say something a little edgy, but men need to de-armor their anus. You need to actually, at least with your pinky finger, get in there once in a while and relax that area because excess tension in the anus will also cause you to ejaculate too quickly. So it's really important to do that. And many of the practitioners, I know they actually have a little sex toy they use just for de-armoring, just for relaxing all the tension that they're holding. And when they do that, they notice their cocks actually get a bit bigger and fuller with blood because now all that area has less tension and the blood flow is able to move a lot more. So in general, I think in the old days, it was done to give the young men something to do because young men often want to come up to their, like 10 times a day or more. And they would start training very young. In martial arts school, you can start as young as five. So they were training very young. How do you harness this energy? I think that's more where that comes from. And then if you have issues where you're inside a woman and 30 seconds later, you're coming, that's not very nice for your confidence. And so I think a lot of the techniques were also to help make sex last longer because the longer the sex lasts and the more relaxed you are, the more nourishment you get and the less fatigue you will have even if you do ejaculate. So quick, hard, fast sex where you're ejaculating is depleting over time. But I don't think it's horrible. I mean, your animal's so, they're designed that way and so improper. But anyways, I have an issue with the psychological tension that arises from being a bit neurotic around male practice. I think that this is really fascinating points because yeah, there's the whole no fat movement, which is really like, you know, X number, you know, you want to hit 30 days, 90 days, and it becomes, yeah, it becomes like a very strict workout routine, which yeah, it takes the fun out of it. And I mean, I'd experimented with that stuff back in the day. I was, you know, a hardcore Buddhist slash Taoist. And so I had that mindset of the essence of the Jing being depleted. And I felt regret when I came, like I'd lost the battle. And these days, I do what you've, basically what you've said is that I do listen to myself. There's the sad, regretful jizz, which is the one where you didn't want to, or like the girl really wants it and so you give in. And then those ones where I'm like, I shouldn't, I do have a sense of like, not morally, but just like my body was like, no, that wasn't what I should have done. And then there's other times when it's this really hot encounter and it just is supernatural to do it. And then, yeah, I mean, I might be sleepy afterwards, but it does feel quite nourishing. And for the woman, you know, women have different relationships to seem in with different men and different times. And sometimes it's, you know, when it's like, it's this fountain of amazing male energy, as opposed to, gotta get this stuff off me now. That's, yeah, I've had those experiences. And so, yeah, I would agree with you definitely that it's about being militant about it. It's not gonna do you any good, but definitely, I'm glad I did all that training early on because yes, that did give me the stamina and the choice. And just for the guys who don't know what SEDA means by the million dollar point, that's between the butthole and the balls, the perineum, basically. And there's this technique, which I remember trying that twice and it felt fucking really not right. Like, it's like, you press that point really, really hard and then come and nothing comes out your dick. And there's this very strange feeling of like, that shouldn't have gone down that pipe. So, yeah. It's nice to see you came inside the ladder. It's not very sexy too, trying to like hold to press this weird point really hard while you're about to come. Go pee out your semen later. You'll see it's very foamy pee. So, the men who are on these regimes where they're very strict, again, here's my pet pee with the sexuality in general is I think that we're just, we create neuroses very quickly. If we wanna learn to have choice around our body and how we function and our pleasure, that's one thing, but we do need to have a relaxed psyche. If we're doing it to resolve inadequacy or we just, we think something's wrong with us or we're trying to attain something but we're neurotic about it, that neuroses will be worse than who you become through that practice will be a really neurotic and obsessed and uptight person versus the guy who you were prior to like trying to control your ejaculation. So, that's my only pet pee with it is I actually, I ended up at some point going, I never wanna have a Taoist lover ever again. They're so technical and boring. I'd rather have a guy with a wide open heart who knows me at home because it's way more fun. So, learn because you're curious and you want to be a good lover, not because you feel neurotic about a relationship with your cock or a function of some kind because that you really need to look at on a psychological level before you do practice. And we don't do that in the West. We're very irresponsible with how we work with these techniques. It becomes like a biohacking thing where it's not really human anymore. It's like trying to reach optimized perfection in every area, which makes you not fun.
