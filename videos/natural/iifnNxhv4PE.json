It's a Hollywood bullshit lie because there's fucking three and a half billion of them out there. There's one more thing I want to do with you guys here. And that's to have a look at how we are going to walk around the world. Most of you, pretty much all of you actually, are very square in your hips in the way that you walk. I'm going to shift from that kind of tension and then I'm going to drop into what is my natural walk. And you guys see if you can see where the differences are. The walk that I'm doing requires the minimum amount of work. I'm using the mechanics of my natural body, I'm using momentum. And so it looks loose, it's upright, but it looks loose and natural and relaxed because it is. It's not an affectation, it's not me pretending, it's just like, cool, yep, I allow my spine to swing. And so when I walk up to a girl, she's like, whoa, who's this guy? He's got something. It's not magic, I'm just like, yeah, I got something, I understand my hips, I understand my spine. So let's have a play with this. Yeah, sexy motherfuckers. We have a general idea that when a girl says, oh, sorry, I'm busy. Well, we've seen that before now. So we know that there's a technical way to deal with that. But there's an intentional way to deal with that, which is that you don't need to worry. I'm not a danger to you. In fact, I'm a gift. Because I'm really present in my life right now. And that's about as good as I could be. And I can help you to be there too. That's what makes a man really, really fucking seductive. I'm not the best conversationalist. I'm not someone who's really, really witty and on the ball all the time. I'm quite introverted and I can be a bit grumpy. But girls fucking love me if they love me. Many of them are like, yeah. But if they like me, they fucking love me. Because I bring them into a space where they get to just relax into themselves, to experience their woman-ness, to experience their now-ness in a way that they don't seem to be able to find with many other guys, if any. And that makes you addictive to women. You don't have to have the best, cleverest thing to say all the time. You don't have to have the most exciting, crazy lifestyle with all the VIP things and the drugs and the glamour and the fast machines. I've never had a machine. Certainly not a fast one. We've saved you possibly years of trial and error. It took me several years of doing this a lot by myself and making a lot of mistakes and going, eh, dead end here. Eh, dead end here, to be able to build this system. And then to be able to figure out how to teach it took another several years. So there's so much stuff that you now logically know that you shouldn't do. There's a whole bunch of things that you now are catching yourself in when you're talking to the girl and you're like, ah, I should have pre-framed because she didn't know what was going on so she ran off. So you have a lot of technical knowledge now and you've seen it in action so it's not just like book learning. It's like, OK, learnt from the book, went out, tested it, saw the effects of doing it or not doing it and then you believe it because you're like, OK, cool, that works or doesn't or when I don't do that, it doesn't work and so on. You don't need to do thousands of approaches. You need to do lots, you need to do hundreds and you need to be able to make sure that each time you try and learn something from that approach. As you've done in every infield session here, every approach, a coach was like, OK, here's what we can do with this and give you some form of advice on every approach pretty much and you now need to be able to self-coach. Please don't get lost in the, I go up and I go, excuse me, I saw you from over there and I think you're beautiful. Excuse me, I saw you from over there and I think you're beautiful. If I hear that bloody line one more time, I'm going to shoot myself. Even though I'll probably say it again too. It's always the how, how is, like, why did I say that? It's because of the principles driving me there and then the way that I express it is going to be different in many ways, if not every time, most times. And then each interaction becomes alive, a living moment, a real moment between two people. The highlight for this course was just getting out of your head and getting out of your way in a way. In a way like Shay told us to do. And yeah, you can just see amazing things happen before your eyes. And even this morning, which was the first non-coach day, no infield, no nothing, I just saw this girl walking by and I thought to myself, like I usually did, I thought, oh man, she's probably, I'm not going to talk to her because she's going to reject me. And I just went to prove it to myself, like, let's see if I'm right. And she did give me her number. So it just goes to show that just making, like, identicates of people walking in the street is a waste of time. If you want to know someone, just go there and talk. So yeah, that was a big revelation. Just don't think about it too much. And, like, you still need a purpose, you still need an intent and you need to project that. Like, don't make a big deal about it. And yeah, that's the other big thing. If you just free your mind, amazing things happen. I've approached, it must have been like close to a hundred women. And it's very easy now for me to approach. It's also easier. And that was one of my goals that I set. I want to be able to approach women when I'm not in state. You know, not like in a super good mood. And I just did it this morning again, where I'm like, didn't feel actually like talking to anyone. And I approached the women this morning, even though I was in this state. And it's okay to be in that state. And I don't have to be like, I can really just be even in that state and talk to strangers. You've been living much more life during this week than you have in most weeks. Because you've been conscious of so many more of the moments and because so many more of the moments have been really unusual outside your comfort zone and intense. If any of you thought you were coming here beginning of day one to get me or these guys to fix you and then you'd go out on the other side and have to not think about it again, you'd probably realize that that's not the case now. That this is a very life-changing event, but it is essentially the beginning of this next phase in your life. The ability to communicate with a woman is a symptom of being able to communicate with yourself. As opposed to, yeah, you were like, okay, here to learn the thing, do the thing. You're like, okay, well, if I learn to really connect with myself on many different levels and you guys have, we've taught you about many different levels of yourself this week, from down to feeling little sensations in your body to exploring emotions, to being thrown into the field and having all of your old stories and your fears and your prejudices and all sorts of things pop up to having girls point things out in you that you may be hiding, to your voice tonality, to the way that you walk, talk, dress. Yeah, I mean, almost everything. And you start to see that this is what really what self-improvement is, what self-help, all of that stuff, which many people are interested in and they think that it means going, I love myself, I love myself, or lots of intellectual masturbation or going from course to course to course to book to book to book to get that little hit of like, oh yeah, that sounds good, to real self-development down to the atomic level, the emotional level. I think everyone who comes to this course at some point in their life, they try to learn for themselves. And the thing is, and this feeling lasted up until yesterday or the day before that. You kind of think in your head, maybe I could have done it, but life doesn't work in maybes. It works in you came here and now you know, so it looks easy. That's the main concept behind it. It always looks easy in retrospect. Doing it without coming to the course, I don't know, maybe with some online coaching, maybe, yes. Like at least getting down the right mentality and going through the approach and the different techniques. Yeah, it's definitely possible. It just makes it a lot easier to be here. It was, I think, was it the first day in field or the second day in field? James pointed out something very, very basic that I would have never be able to get by myself, I think. You talk about your issue being escalation. And I think you probably think that that means certain points down the line that you're not getting involved in. And I suspect that it happens much earlier. And listening in, I'm pretty sure it is. You are releasing pressure, a lot of pressure. You're overly friendly, overly accommodating. I'm just giving you a bunch of stuff. You're not going to fix it all right now, but these are the things to start being aware of and start to work on. It goes back to my inner issue of not being so comfortable with expressing my sexuality and also wanting to release pressure, always releasing pressure. And I did it in several ways. I did it by nodding. I did it by talking a lot, talking fast. And there were a few more things when it was pointed out. So I have this, I'm doing these things to release pressure. And I would not have been able to there was like, because I went out beforehand, before the course, like for several months. And I understood, okay, I'm learning even if I'm going out by myself. But that simple feedback on the first day already or very specific feedback I got, that alone actually would have been worth to do the course. And obviously, then so much more feedback and learning followed in the next few days. Pretty much the day or the days that I started going and talking to girls on the street was when I really started to see the holes in myself, my real fears, had to face my ego instantly in ways that sitting and meditating for 10 days in a row hadn't quite scratched into. So on the other hand, it can be a mask. Guys do it where they just put on a false bravado and they're doing it to prove themselves and get revenge on women and compensate for lack. You can use seduction in that way and it will make you worse. It will make you someone who is more and more disconnected from yourself and from others. But the way that we've taught it to you from the ground up, from the internal out, from sensation, feeling, true, true interrelation and intimacy means that it will be, if you follow this path, a vastly accelerated way to know yourself. Getting slapped down on the street by dozens of girls, eventually, maybe not right now, but eventually you'll look back on with great gratitude and you'll start to reference those girls that caught you in a moment of your bullshit and shut you the fuck down as, oh, okay, thank you, because that woman gave me a chance to really see where my bullshit was. Or the one where it's nothing to do with you and it's her and to recognize when someone's really projecting something onto you and it's not your fault. And it's not even necessarily her fault. It's just like she reacted or she's having a shit day or you look like that guy that was pushy with her the other day or whatever it is. But to recognize, oh, that's not my thing, that's someone else trying to push through my boundary or be antagonistic or be unreasonable and then that's a great lesson in not taking on board somebody else's shit. And we've said this many times when you've been out in a field like the experiences that you're getting are worthwhile. Even if it's a rejection, it's not wasted, all that stuff. And you're like, eh, but I don't want that stuff. I just want to get to the, she loves me and gives me a number and we all have sex and live happily ever after. That's all coming to and it's happened in smaller and greater degrees to many of you on this week. But truly understanding and not just intellectually but from a visceral, real, atomic level that each one of these experiences is a valuable thing because they're moments that you've chosen life. It's moments that you've chosen your own direction, where you stepped out of that little rat maze that you've been walking around in, bigger or smaller, more comfortable or less comfortable but still a maze, still a prison. And now you keep cracking out of it and outside of that is potential, is amazing experiences. You really have to think apart from the money, aside from the money and everything, what it means to you in terms of personal change because if you come here and you think the coaches will fix you or it's not going to be that painful or that big of a deal to change, it's not a very good mentality to get into one of these workshops. It's really a commitment and the money required to come here is just a reflection of that commitment. So it's like you're putting effort in all aspects and we have a student here who had to save up a little to come here and it just makes it much more powerful in a sense like you're actually doing this, you can't back out. Yeah, I think the Natural Lifestyles is, since they are so real and in depth of the content they give, I think that's the best address to go to. I chose them after like years of learning. pick up and game and then being out of it because I didn't get the results and I came back and I was very very cautious like who who am I giving my money to and who am I investing in and which course I'm gonna do and actually I wasn't really I wasn't really ready to do another course I thought I had everything I have to know I I know already and I just go out and learn by myself and when I watch the natural lifestyles then I thought okay well that's that's different than what I had learned about before in like the earlier days of the game of the pickup world and yeah I just wish I would have discovered them earlier to be honest there's the potential for men and women to be attracted to each other all the time it's it's not a force that we need to alchemically create out of zero it exists I'm attracted to women women are attracted to men not usually and and we just need to pull apart the veils and the masks that separate those things which is often just a look in the eyes and then the attraction flows your intention is I got I meet girls every day and oh there's the girl I'm gonna meet I want to meet you hey here we are sharing a moment okay we go through our we do our pieces we learn do the things we're trying to do we see if we can see her again see if we can get her into bed all that great stuff but the overall intention is that this is part of my life now and it's like brushing my teeth I do it every day and whether I'm in a good state or bad state is irrelevant you don't have to come out of this being perfect in order for it to be effective it's that you've got a lot of information you've got a lot of experiences now and you're gonna go and do it and many of the approaches that all of you guys do will be incompetent they will not be great they will be clunky that's fine but if you're if you're thinking okay my focus is more about opening my emotions and my heart then use approaches to do that and then yeah I mean like if you if you combine all of that as your this is my general roadmap for approaching girls and that means you'll be meeting ten plus girls a week which means you'll be meeting three to five hundred to six hundred girls in the next year which is a fuckload of hot girls to be meeting and out of that you're gonna be getting dates you're gonna get laid you're gonna find a cool chick to start some kind of casual thing with and over time as you have some casual things with a bunch of girls and figure out more about what you want out of women and what you where you're growing that at some point then you'll be able to go all right it's a it's a good decision for me to have this girl and make her my girlfriend if that's what you want. In terms of the coaches everyone has a different personality and a different style of teaching and picking up girls James obviously is like the master and I see him as like the technique guy he he really gets deep into technically what you might be doing wrong Shay with his like historical rants about civilization and how the brain evolved that's really useful as well to primarily like not beat yourself up with with how you're feeling he explains all the mechanisms that are triggered in the brain and and why why they're triggered. So now the real work begins now I have this tool set that needs to it needs further work and further adjustment to my own personality and I am very excited to go out there and to meet women to connect with them to apply the things that I've learned and to create real connections with women and since since it is about creating real connections it's something that I feel very comfortable with like I'm not I don't have to pretend anything I can just be I'm you know I have I have a sexual intent I have my balls and I'm I'm totally comfortable with that and and that's that's what we are we are animals we have this animal instinct that that most of us repressed by society the way we are brought up and it's very liberating to go out there and to express it and to be okay with that. Once you've seen through the veil right once you've seen what's possible and both of you have seen at least glimpses of what's possible for you right yes and you've lived and experienced things that perhaps you never thought you'd do or thought would take much much longer than it did and you've seen the responses that women have given you that okay strange strangers on the street can like you very very quickly and once you've seen that kind of possibility how can you ever go back to ignorance how can you ever go back to accepting scarcity or to just going oh yeah I guess that's the way things are like most guys who are living in that veil of ignorance they protect themselves with the with their ideas that only certain types of guys can get those girls or you can only meet girls through social circle or any of those any of those limiting beliefs which maybe you had at some point and most of the rest of the world has you guys know the truth now you know that there's infinite numbers of women out there who are looking for guys and if you go up and you going with a good intention and you acknowledge her through your preframes or through your demeanor you make an effort to connect with with a girl very quickly you'll find someone who wants to connect with you going back to sitting in complacency and scarcity that's the thing you're going to really regret if you ever let yourself do that so don't confidence happens when you do something that's a confident thing as opposed to preparing for confidence or preparing a lot of guys do that they spend weeks months sometimes years studying in preparation to go out and do this and that's just kind of wasted time because you can learn you can learn things and memorize stuff and kind of be mentally prepared in some way but it doesn't really mean anything until you do it and your state is so dependent on the actions that are happening so if we sit in a state and we tell ourselves I'm in my closed down non-social state and therefore I can't be well then of course I'll prove that in my little solipsistic bubble but the moment that I go alright I'm just is it is it mean all these things is it really like this big encompassing state or is it just like I feel sort of me and now I'm just going to say hi anyway and then before you know it in 30 seconds you are a social person you're like I'm such an introverted insulated and then this chicks talking to me and hey she's pretty nice and now it turns out I'm not and this other thing as well because women respond really well to authenticity as opposed to perfection or slickness seriously you're really friendly and thank you for talking this long you're really brave I was surprised whereas the guy that's trying to prove himself or trying to pretend that he's in perfect harmony or perfect expression all the time girls can see that often that's false this seduction journey certainly doesn't just go up like this you guys have seen that over this week it's on any given day you've gone from I remember that a couple of days ago you're like James I'm hating you right now you know to like the next an hour later or 20 minutes later to like I love this all these girls I am with this girl yeah it makes you feel really like when you don't know what's going on it makes you feel really weak like I have no consistency with my internals and emotions it's just how it is yeah and it's like that's not that you're particularly unstable or anything it's that most people stay away from they constantly retreat from stresses they constantly retreat from the things that trigger them until they fit themselves into a comfortable box and so then they can kind of move through their life unless they have severe anxiety they can move through their life going alright everything's fine I know how to do this life thing and then any time something comes into their comes and puts pressure on them they again readjust and back off and we created a container for you guys over a week where you can't escape from it yeah that's how it feels yeah yes for 7 days you're our prisoner and so it's designed that way to make you just ping up and down and to see how volatile you can be but also that under that volatile circumstances you still survived and you did really well both of you like even under extreme pressure or even having your ego battered and having to question so many things that you are actually far more resilient and flexible than you maybe thought you guys know what you've got to do? yeah if you could say quickly what is it you know what to do we've talked about what to do many times what's your kind of updated reason why now I don't know first of all like the primary reason is because it's fun and it feels good and once you get like the hang of not beating yourself up over the reaction it's actually really fun and constructive what you can do to improve yourself after each approach Michael sharing with women experiences, sex, events that's what drives me alright well I don't know about you but I'm gonna go and have a bath or something Andrea come here thanks James absolute pleasure thank you James you're welcome alright school's out how much you enjoy life, how satisfied you are, how much intimacy, life, love, expression and joy and passion you have is so much determined on who's hanging out with you who you got your arms around, who you're kissing, who you're fucking, who you're staying up late into the night and talking about the meaning of life with I help people to not fucking settle and live mediocre lives Liam says go and do this weird thing and you're like fucking I'm scared and you're like are you scared or are you activated will you marry me please fuck that's I have to talk to that girl and you go and if she rejects you there's a there's an amazing liberation because you know you did your job it's like you don't have regret the world now needs strong integrated fucking embodied men to start to say enough enough is enough these are the boundaries this is what's meaningful and I'm gonna stand for what I believe in thank you for talking this long you're really brave it doesn't matter how wealthy or successful or whatever you get in life if you don't have the people in your life that you want and you're not able to have effective and fun and lovely and sexually fulfilling relationships you can't be happy unless you're gonna be a monk which maybe you're gonna be happy then not ready for that yet what's up gentlemen I hope you enjoyed that series back when the world was a different place and it was like over a year ago it seemed like a decade ago but believe it or not people are still people and women still want love and we have started coaching again that's right we just finished a 10 day workshop here in wonderful Budapest as you can see the streets are alive for better or worse people are just walking around we've been macking on girls and they're loving it actually because they're bored and they can't go to Ibiza and Mykonos this year so they're stuck here which is good for us which brings me to an announcement I am running my final infield workshop for the year and until who knows what from the 25th of October until the 1st of November here in Budapest 7 days of round the clock mayhem with myself and the TNL crew you may have heard that Hungary is in lockdown it's theoretically it is but there's definitely ways to get in here we've proven that so if you'd like to join myself and the full TNL crew as we take you through a complete transformation internally externally in your seduction lifestyle and inner game world then click the link below and come join us why the fuck not what else are you going to do?
