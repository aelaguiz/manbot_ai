You will never feel satisfied with your life. You can't get no satisfaction. Why is that? Because humans are never satisfied. That is that part of our nature is craving towards things that we don't have. Andrew says, One thing I've noticed when trying to envisage the ideal lifestyle is that it's mainly about obtaining things rather than forming meaningful connections with people. I feel that I've maybe missed the point. When trying to relax, I feel guilty about this. If I'm not hustling towards goals, I feel like I should be. What is the best way to get around this? So you bring up an interesting point here, Andrew, and you're not the only person in that situation. I'd say the entire capitalist Western civilization is kind of built to make you do that, right? Which is that the lifestyle that you're sold by Coke, by Gucci, by Rolex, by Maserati, by fucking anything that's trying to sell to men. And then the female version is trying to sell you items. Like, I can't believe I'm even explaining this. Listen, man, did you know that marketing, they try to sell you shit to make you feel good about yourself? Like, yeah, obviously, right? It's like, buy the car, get the watch, get the fancy house. And then that's your lifestyle, right? Because then what do you get? You get to sit on the boat or be in your badass car. And then the woman is usually an accessory placed in there, right? Like, the implication is if you get the hot car and the boat and the whatever, that there will be a girl sitting in the other side of the car or the boat. It doesn't work like that, really. I mean, it can if you're extremely rich. And then in that case, you're just getting girls who are kind of trying to take advantage of your richness. There's ways around that, too. But this is not what I mean by a lifestyle, like an epic lifestyle. Now, I would be hypocritical to say that it's not about stuff at all, right? Obviously, I've collected stuff. I'm quite interested in aesthetics and beauty. And I like antiques. I like old shit. So I sort of surround myself with old things and I'm building stuff in a physical sense. But that's in conjunction with because partly the way I look at it is physical things. I don't have a watch. I don't have a car. I don't have like those status symbols so much. You know, I have some. I have a house and an apartment or whatever. But any big item that I've worked towards buying has been used as a lifestyle leverage point for me. Except for the Chinese swords. That's because I like Chinese swords. Just getting stuff doesn't make you popular. It doesn't make a great lifestyle. And the truth is that your lifestyle, your happiness, your sense of worthiness and mission purpose in life will be determined in large part by the people around you. So you can have a solo mission. A lot of my missions throughout life were kind of like going to Shaolin Temple. That was a solo thing. Not many others though, right? Like music was a group thing. Even going to the jungle was part of a group thing. Business was tribal. Parties was tribal. Getting laid was tribal. Even though everyone had their own individual self-interest that they're trying to get laid individually, it meant that when we combine forces and work together, then we all got laid more. It is really important to, I'd say Andrew, to reassess your priorities. Because this sense of like, if I'm not hustling towards a goal, then I'm wasting time. I used to be like that a lot. Like, I mean, in my own way, in my own hippie way. But it was always this sense of when I finish this album, when I play that big show, when I get this amount of money, when I bang this amount of girls, then I'll feel satisfied with myself. I'll feel satisfied with my life. Let you in on a little secret. You will never feel satisfied with your life. Can't get no satisfaction. Why is that? Because humans are never satisfied. That is that part of our nature is craving towards things that we don't have. It's a big part of our survival mechanism. Every time you feel hungry or cold or horny and it drives you to go and get something you don't have, it's a part of your survival instinct. However, just this yearning and hustling and moving towards goals, by its nature, means that you miss the process of getting there. To a greater or lesser degree. And the larger the degree that you miss the process, the more of your life that you've essentially wasted, or at least in some ways, the more of your life that you weren't really present for, that you weren't really experiencing at the vibrancy that you could have been. And it's not an easy juggle. I understand, especially when you're a younger guy trying to make your way in the world. You have this sense of I need to prove myself because I do. I need to make my mark on the world because I do. I haven't done it yet. Or I'm in the process of that. Or it's my hustle phase and I'm hungry and I'm trying to achieve something. Good. I understand. On the other side, I've met people who just go, man, just chill. Just go with the flow. Which is a nice sentiment and a good way to live in some periods. But I've seen people do that for decades and end up just very broke. And after a while, their compromise of choosing to live in the moment, in a hedonistic grasshopper and the \u2013 what was it? The grasshopper and the \u2013 you know that story? The old Aesop's Fable? The grasshopper just played all summer whereas the squirrel was collecting nuts or whatever. You know that one. You don't want to end up like the grasshopper in the winter, do you, when there's no food around? So, yeah, man, I would \u2013 and for anyone, everyone will be affected by this in some degree or another. I think all of us feel this at points. I still feel that. I'm like, when I build the garden, when I \u2013 something, I'm like, what? And I have to remind myself, I'm already there. I've been here for decades. I'm already there in the sense that I'm living a cool life and I'm enjoying myself and I'm \u2013 yeah, I'm getting shit done and there are goals in the future. But I keep trying to remind myself, this is the best day that I'm going to ever have today. The construction of the ultimate lifestyle is a bit of a tricky thing because unlike how most people in the wealth creation industries would describe it, it's not just about getting bank, which is something that's important. It's important to create financial and time freedom in your life. But just as important is your art of living, how it is that you're living day by day, the relationships that you're forming, the felt sense, subjective experience that you have day to day, whether you're enjoying yourself, whether you feel good about yourself, whether you feel loved, heard, respected, attracted, and people are attracted to you. These are vitally important because at the end of the day, your satisfaction, your happiness in life comes from your tribal bonds, your creative networks, and your sense of accomplishment as a human being, as a man, as opposed to just what's in your bank account. The Lifestyle Design Academy attempts to hit all of these metrics over a 12-month period. So I work with guys, yes, on their location, their career, their work life. But more importantly, what I'm looking at in this course is how to build networks that work for you, how to multiply your effects, how to be able to be nimble, lean, move to the right countries, the right cities, the right locations, the right opportunities to take advantage of what is a very complicated time in history, and a lot of people are getting crushed under this, while some people are succeeding hugely. And that's what I attempt to do with my LDA dudes and will be doing over the coming year. So stay tuned for the launch coming up this Sunday. That's right, Sunday the 14th of March. I'm opening the doors for seven days only. And after that, I'll be teaching the course live. We're going to be getting straight into it to make 2021 a kick-ass year. So you can check out a free video by clicking the link in the description and put that date in your diary, in your calendar. It's coming up this Sunday. It begins. See you in the next video.
