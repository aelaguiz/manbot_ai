What advice would you give to approximately 25-year-olds having some success and ending up in a quarter-life crisis? Questioning if they're making the right moves. So what I get from that question is a young guy looking to explore his potential and his place in the world and he's had some success. But at the same time he wants to know how far he can take it or what kind of choices he should make. And obviously there are a whole range of offerings that might come to people, especially in their young age, in their 20s. Like do they go to a university or they follow a particular career path or should they focus on making money, should they focus on having social development. Ultimately I think it's something that the individual needs to look at in their situation. Because he might be isolated in a way where it's better for him to focus on doing some other development than trying to be some kind of social guy. But for example if he's in a situation where he's got a lot of social things going on then maybe that's a great place for him to start and build foundations in his life. I think ultimately everybody has to make a choice about are they doing things that are developing them in a well-rounded kind of way. And like anything if you do it too much it's going to become a problem, if you don't do it enough then that's going to become a problem. So it's kind of finding a balance there. In terms of making the right decisions, well that's going to depend on making assessments of your choices and understanding your resources and your capacity. So really that's going to be more of a process of looking at what's actually going on in your life, what do you really want, what's possible. And to a degree what can you get away with and what sticks and what really starts to get you traction and effectiveness. And you might start out with a bunch of things but then realise that some of them don't really get you where you want or they're not really what you want so then you become more specialised over time. Yeah I think that's a particular thing to keep in mind around that age range is you don't yet know who you are when you're 25-ish. For men we tend to kind of come into our own and figure out who we are, what we want, what we're willing to give, what our boundaries are in our late 20s, 30s, if at all. Some men never really figure it out but in your 20s you're still really in experimental phases. And that works kind of different for women because women tend to get moving faster and earlier in their social worlds and reach their peaks earlier than men do. Whereas men tend to kind of tread water or take some years to really figure out what it means to be a man, what they want out of life. And so I think it can be a mistake to try to find your passion or your calling or your one thing that you're going to do forever in your 20s. Because the advantage of that time is ideally you have more time, you have more possibilities, you can take more risks, you can start something, a complete life. Start a business, start a social world and it can do something and then completely collapse and then you can start again and that's okay. Whereas when you get later on in life you have less time to recover and maybe you have more responsibilities and so on. So I think in your 20s it's normal to have a quarter life crisis or some kind of sense of identity crisis because you're coming out of being a teenager, an adolescent, a young man and now you're trying to find your place in the world. So it's normal that you would be, maybe you've finished a university course or some field of study and then you don't really feel it anymore. And that can lead to this kind of identity crisis where it's like, oh well for the first 10 years of my adult life I've been this and now that's no longer relevant to me so that can call my identity into question. But that's a good thing to do, I think being able to throw yourself all in on something, try it on both internally and externally, whether that's a particular type of lifestyle or friendship group or meditation system or whatever. And then to know that the tools that you start with probably won't be the tools that you end with. You're going to be going through many different evolutions and you have to go through that kind of scary process of letting go of the old you at 25, at 35, at 45, at various points in your life when you kind of reach pivot points. And that can be scary because you might be letting go of your old friends or your old sense of who you are. But the advantage of that chaos is that you have the opportunity to constantly reinvent, particularly in that era of your life. And I would say it's better to be more of a generalist because if you only focus on your career, we've seen that with many guys who come to us at 40 after just pushing it hard only on money and career. And they don't have many friends or their dating life sucks or they don't really feel like they have any passion or purpose in life even though their bank account might be looking healthy. So whereas in these earlier stages, you get the opportunity to go, cool, maybe I'll spend a year studying a particular thing or going traveling or setting up growth houses and being a digital nomad or testing different side hustles and business opportunities. And importantly, getting good with women because that's not something that you should leave until your 30s. You should be someone who is dating and having women in your life as and when you want to more or less throughout your peak young years. Otherwise, you're missing out on all the fun. So I guess to add a little bit to the end of that, I'd say that being somebody in your 20s in this time that we live in is also tumultuous in general because culture's changing, technology's changing, crisis everywhere. So I guess the older idea of some kind of romantic fantasy where life can be plotted out and can have some more security and reliability is different. But not unlike many periods in time and history where there would be all kinds of crises and variables that made people's lives difficult. And on the general spectrum, we're in a very good position as relatively well-off modern people. So we don't have to fight tigers or drop dead of infections or whatever like we used to not so long ago. But having said that, there's still a lot of instability to deal with. So I think it's healthy to feel a sense of uncertainty and to be, let's say, on edge about who you are and how the world works and what's going on. And it's kind of part of the setup of becoming an adult these days, I think, is learning to make decisions, learning to assess things with clarity and critical thinking. Learning to do your own research, which should be done with discernment and understanding. And in some sense, digging into multiple layers. Don't be afraid to look at things from multiple angles and explore stuff, which doubles down on what James was saying to a degree. I think using your 20s is a time of exploration and optimization of the things that you are passionate about or the things that make sense to move your life forward is good. But at the same time, recognizing that we live in this time where there can be a lot of variables and change. So don't be too stuck on one particular position necessarily. It might be good to be dynamic with what you can focus on and what's possible. So yeah, that's the thing. All the 20-somethings out there, there's your solution to all your crises. Start to reframe it and see it as an opportunity. Start to explore it as a stage in your development. And also make decisions based on your best intuition and understanding of the time. Yeah, and in the modern age that we live in, you've hinted at this, that there were periods throughout lots of history where you could kind of plan out your life in the sense that you knew what station in life you'd be, what industry you'd be in, because it would be family-orientated. You would probably get married and have children fairly young, and then you would set into some kind of static identity and role, which would give you a sense of purpose and place and understanding, which was good or had whatever effect it had. But the flip side of that being that you didn't have much choice. You had to be pretty much 100% conformist if you wanted to stay within your society. There were far less choices, and life didn't last as long. So we have to take the pros and the cons and the advantages and disadvantages of what we have at play. And the strong disadvantage is that it's chaotic. No one's going to plan it out for you. There is no prescriptive way to do things, I guess, unless you join the military or something like that. So it's chaotic and dangerous in that sense that people can easily slip through the cracks. Men can spend their teens, twenties and thirties only trying to find themselves and ending up just kind of bouncing from thing to thing and never actually committing to anything. Or they can find themselves specializing in something early on and then finding that that's kind of redundant because the industry has changed or the economy has changed or something that they have invested a huge amount of time and effort and hoping to may not yield results. So being able to diversify your investments in all areas, your social, seductive career and so on, in your twenties means that, okay, if you can pick up certain skills that are bankable, if you can create networks, which is like\u2026 Especially for a young man, having people who want to help you is vastly important. It's the thing that so often means you get a leg up, someone gives you a job offer, someone that's a friend recommends you to someone else, someone hooks you up with a contact where you have complementary skills and so on. So the tribe building, which we used to have kind of out of the box for us, right? We were born into a tribe of some sort and you had, for better or worse, you were part of that with its support structures. Now we're not born into that mostly at all, so we have to go out and find our own. And that's where guys that are dynamic, that are either mobile in the sense that they can move to where opportunities are or they're really good at connecting with different types of people who have complementary skills to theirs, can then create multiplying effects because you not only have the effects of your skills and your knowledge, but the people that have your back and care for you. So that's why I'm always pressing on about this or emphasising this aspect that trying to do it all alone, whatever it is, trying to go through your identity crisis and figure yourself out as a man and succeed with women and with business and so on, is a really, really hard, if not impossible thing to do completely solo. And so much of hustle culture kind of ethos and philosophies are really around the individuals only. Now, of course, we are individuals and we need to create our own lives, but at the end of the day, you are going to be lifted up, bolstered or pulled down by the groups and the networks that you have around you. So that's another aspect that is really important to invest in, especially in your 20s when people are much more open to that. People are still open to meeting new types of people. They're social. They want to go out. They're not saddled with debt and with mortgages and children and so on yet. So it is a really amazing time to spread your spider web of influence as far as you can and then consolidate it and figure out how that's going to be actionable and create results. Coming up soon at the start of April, 9th of April, I'm going to be re-releasing the Lifestyle Design Academy. So this clip here is taken from one of the many live webinars that I do with various specialized guests during the LDA where you get to ask us questions on all manner of areas from sexuality, lifestyle to finances to how to get over a quarter life crisis and much, much more. This is in addition to the 8-week accelerator program where you get to spend every Sunday afternoon with me as I, in real time, teach you the fundamentals and the practicals of how to build an epic life, incredible social circles and how to create leverage so you don't have to do it all alone. So if you'd like to join, stay tuned for the launch on the 9th of April and you can get a free snippet, a free little video that goes into detail on the seductive economy by clicking the link in the description. Put your email in, you will receive that immediately. See you in the next video. Peace. Transcribed by https://otter.ai"}
