In this mini-series I want to talk about the different ways to meet women in 2022 and beyond and the first part I talked about online dating like dating apps versus Instagram and so on second part we talked about social circle all pretty standard stuff you know that's usually what people think about when they think about how can I meet women either online which most people kind of convert to these days or out of my friends out of my circle maybe going out with my group and then finding a girl that way today it gets a bit more tricky a bit more triggering maybe and I want to talk about approaching approaching women in daylight straight up you know it might be a challenging thought for many but I want to talk about it now if you're new to this channel my name is Alex Leon I've helped hundreds of guys over the last couple of years improve their dating life improve their lifestyle and just become overall more complete more happy men so I do have a little bit of experience when it comes to this topic because I've myself approached thousands of women sober on the street in bars and so on and I've helped many many guys do the same and yeah find really beautiful relationships and real connections that way now let's talk about triggers because let's be honest when I talk about this topic called approach a lot of people get triggered maybe you have the same experience or maybe you are triggered right now just thinking about it I think there are good reasons for that and there's different reasons why it's a touchy topic let's start with guys why do guys get triggered my guess is because growing up as a young guy you usually don't have like a role model or somebody who teaches you this stuff you don't really have a person who explains you growing up this is how you approach a woman in a respectful way this is how you come across as confident and masculine this is how you're gonna have a good conversation that is interesting that makes her excited this is how I'm gonna take your number and everything that follows after you know I for sure know I didn't have a role model growing up that way not blaming anyone it's just how it is and my guess is you didn't either growing up in school and you know having friends in like social so social circle in like Western countries it's kind of frowned upon doing it like imagine you as a 15 16 year old and it's very young approaching a girl on the school campus would your friends cheer for you or would they have cheered for you or they hope secretly that you make fun of yourself that you embarrass yourself so you come back to them and they can make fun of you and it's a whole big joke and that's sad of course there we see it's such a trigger for guys because inside why do they make fun of you because it's a hard thing to do and you doing it challenges their ego and nobody likes their ego being challenged ever the other trigger on the female side is yes a lot of women let's be honest have had negative experience being approached a lot of guys just did it in a very uncalibrated way even being drunk being rude you know maybe getting their advice from the wrong sources which is like yeah just push through just stop her just grab her and they put that advice into practice they're totally not even aware of their surroundings they just like taking taking taking without the attitude of giving which is very important when you do approach on the street and yes of course that leads to at the minimum irritating experiences for women or can even be slightly traumatizing if it happens several times or some really bad examples you know or you just catch a woman at a really bad day you know what if she just fucking had a big fight with her boss or her boyfriend or you just lost her job and then you're like here and you don't read her signals at all it's kind of understandable that some women after a bunch of those experiences give the whole thing a bad reputation and talk to their friends about it you know come home or have coffee with their friends and being like oh guess what happened today fucking idiot you know it doesn't happen as much as you think but you kind of have to develop empathy for women when they do get triggered when it is about that kind of thing so it is important to understand the female side always because that's the real way to be good at seduction is to understand the other side it's a dance seduction is a dance between the male and the female and if you think masculinity means to grab something and take it without thinking how it affects the other side you will not get very far now let me set one thing straight women do love getting approached I've been doing it for many many years six seven years across different countries different cultures and I got amazing results with it all the time is it tough yes it is do they love getting approached badly absolutely not of course not you know the problem is most guys approach badly I don't blame them because as I said at the beginning of this video when you're a young guy going out for the first time you know doing your first approaches standing in front of a girl being like oh you're very beautiful you know and it's kind of awkward it's kind of cringy nobody taught you I can't really blame you you you're amazing it's amazing what you do and it's amazing if you even try even when you take a step out of the house with the intention to approach that's already growth that's already your brain rewiring to becoming more of a hunter more of a guy who goes for improving his social life that's amazing so I don't blame you at all and I get it it's tough to do it you kind of on autopilot on blindness you didn't have mentors to do it you know except from maybe my youtube channel the natural lifestyles YouTube channel and so on getting approached well on the other hand is wonderful women love it they do like they talk about it you can see when you do it how it lightens their mood how they will talk about it to their friends do you think women love swiping on tinder getting the same text all the time doing the same texting getting ready for a day to talk about the same four topics like University do you have pets what do you do as a job blah blah like it's boring for them as well it's an amazing kind of alternative to just like being surprised positively by a good confident masculine approach and the thing that bothers me a lot when I think about it is like how narrow-minded society became when it comes to approaching like as soon as somebody thinks oh I want to have a girlfriend or I want to have a boyfriend they kind of revert back to tinder you know and like suddenly as a guy when you try okay I want to have a girlfriend I want to have girls I want to have sex I want to have amazing sexual experiences your whole masculinity goes into like this tiny screen it's horrible it's not masculine it's not powerful so I guess that's the number one reason why I am very passionate about approaching and going out because you can present yourself as your whole self in daylight how you look how you talk how you stand your posture you can share your humor your charisma so many things that you can do face to face sober during the day that all of the other methods that I've talked about so far you cannot really do of course in the journey of a young man's when he kind of gets into approaching there are phases where you take it really hard you know you maybe even book out a time out of your week where you try to approach a lot of women and get numbers and so on but then it might slow down and if it can become like a part of your life and you know there's then suddenly many ways to just approach during your daily life cafes waiting in line at music festivals just on the street at the airport you know there's no better feeling than arriving in a new city that you've never been to you're a total stranger you feel a bit like a tourist but you see a beautiful girl at the airport you say hi to her you have a cute little chat maybe she's a local you get her number it's like wow you immediately feel more home what a beautiful thing to have that skill to be able to approach to draw people into your life and now I'm not even talking about only women also men sometimes men are totally like worthy of being approached you know it's cool to make male connections just as much as getting cute sexy interesting females in your life how much is that skill worth because it's a skill that's gonna be with you for your whole life how much is that worth to you just try to answer that question for yourself but I get it it's a grind not an easy process it's definitely not a quick fix becoming good at this this as in seduction approaching everything that comes with it is a long process it's sweaty it's cringy crushes your ego it's definitely not a PDF that says how to get the women of your dreams into your bedroom by sending that one text that has a ninety seven point four percent response rate works every time it's definitely not that you know and you have to be ready for it it's a kind of a warrior's path it's not for everyone some people just want to marry their high school sweetheart and forget about everything else and that's okay I respect that I think different people are different I've seen that over the years but some people just wanna experience what's out there before getting married you know I'm not even against monogamy I'm not against marriage but I'm definitely for exploring figuring out what's out there using your potential that's very important to me in life for my own life I think I have a lot of potential and I get angry at myself when I don't use it for me as a coach my job is to see the student's potential and make him realize his potential and make him push himself and me pushing him to his potential so that's why approaching is valuable for me because it kind of pushes me closer to my potential and your potential there's so many things in there when I talk about approaching I'm talking about inner confidence social freedom awareness understanding your reality inside and outside you know do you understand what's going on inside you do you understand the world around you are you calibrated do you even like yourself do you love yourself do you feel worthy that question alone is probably takes 10 years to answer are you very outcome independent how can you change that then grooming style conversation skills sexuality are you good in bed are you flexible can you move do your hips rotate you know so there's a lot there's a lot to think about when it comes to this aspect all of those things I just mentioned are like endlessly exciting to me so I'm happy to just work on it for my whole life and I'm happy to pay for coaches to improve certain aspects of that and listen videos and improve myself for me the reward is worth it once you kind of get a little bit into the flow of it you don't have to be a seduction master to get the first kind of bonus points and rewards the world opens up it's a new reality you you walk out your apartment and suddenly your whole mindset shifts from scarcity to abundance your world is a playground you open up the door and there's people and they're all approachable because people love getting approach trust me and suddenly every new person you meet is a new opportunity to train your skills to practice to make a connection and to simply put a smile on someone's face and that's the beauty of it for me it's interesting because you know I have different types of clients some are like the young kind of hustler they just you know want to get going they're excited they don't have much to lose and it's kind of easier for them to approach and to get their ego shattered because they didn't spend a long time building their ego in the first place because they're younger but I also have the CEO kind of guy the businessman the established leader where people look up to them and they have obviously through that fair enough developed a bigger ego and it can be very challenging to get it crushed by some 21 year old girl on the street who is just like yeah those kind of guys I even respect even more when they come to workshops because it means they really want to take on that aspect in their life and understand that it's not about you know always approaching on the street and always young girls but just taking on a skill that I talked about will be endlessly kind of beneficial for them in their business life in their future seduction life even in their marriage you know being good at seduction being good at communication and everything I've listed before will help you in your marriage enormously as well and in the first place make you choose a better wife let me know what you think and in the next episode part 4 I'm gonna talk specifically about those guys who maybe have a bigger ego because they you know spend more time building wealth building status which makes it a bit more difficult to approaching but the benefit they have they have wealth which can be leveraged I want to talk about using money and wealth to create leverage because again leverage is huge in seduction the person who uses leverage better online offline with money without money will have better results so more on that in the next
