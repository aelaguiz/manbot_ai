Yeah, it's the first podcast we've done with some ladies, like we're like a men's channel but we really wanted to get the opinions of the girls and you know get some feminine energy on there and yeah it's an honor to have you here. Let's do a circle and maybe you can like introduce yourselves and your name and you know a bit about yourself or something like that. So you want to go? Yeah of course, of course. So my name is Lilla, I live in Budapest, I'm Hungarian, well actually I'm 20 years old and I'm a university student. And what do you like doing for fun? Oh, well I have a lot of hobbies, I like singing, playing musical instruments maybe. For example? For example, well when I was in middle school I had to play a lot of instruments, so I used to play on the violin, guitar, on the flute and also on piano. Yeah, so these are the interesting facts about me, I guess. Beautiful. You also do modeling, right? Yeah, I do. Interesting. Lovely. Guys, thank you so much for hosting us tonight, it's a pleasure and honestly it's been a topic that I wanted to talk about for a while. My name is Hadisha, but you can call me Disha, I'm a model myself, I'm a stylist slash creative director and yeah. So I love fashion, I love beauty and just to create anything that I can visualize about it and all around, that's my passion. Wow. Hi guys, I think you know me. I'm James Marshall and I know I look like shit today, I just got a flight from Rio, I haven't slept in multiple days, I think I had yellow fever and then I accidentally took some very psychoactive substances earlier today because it said on the box that they're for sleeping, so I had the trippiest dream of my entire life, 10x on any ayahuasca trip I've ever had. I also run The Natural Lifestyles, the world's greatest seduction coaching company for men, I'm also a sex teacher and an olive farmer and a flute player, oh yeah. And many other things which I can't remember right now, good to be here. You look good. Thank you. Hi guys, so thank you so much for hosting us and it's a pleasure to be here. I'm Shaba, I'm 23 years old, I'm a model myself as well for 10 years now and next to that I'm an account manager in, well basically in the camping industry, so I'm really intrigued about today's topic. And yeah, what I love, everything that is fun, I'm a hazardous myself, so anything that makes me feel good, I love it. Nice. Sweet, yeah we would like to start the topic. Hang on a minute. Oh yeah, hello, yeah my name is Son, hanging out with Son is fun. Well I live life, I breathe air, life is good. I'm happy to be here, thank you for accepting the invite and coming here. Right on. I'm Harry, Mr. Harry, I also play the flute now, I've got a Banzori flute. Oh that's hard to play, like you've got to use like your pads. Yeah, yeah, yeah I'm gonna, my shirt is on point, but you can do half notes on it, but I've got like an Indian flute player now, so like do my video calls, I'm learning like Indian music. I'm a musician, I do all sorts of little businesses, and I do all sorts of different things. I'm an adventurer, I've not been on that many adventures recently, but I did travel a lot, and been to a lot of temples, and traveled around India on a bike on my own, and I've lived a very interesting life so far. And yeah, like it's really, it's really good to have you guys here, and have like a nice mixture of people, and like a big panel, and I'm really looking forward to this as well, so. So we're gonna start a flute trio, right? Yeah, finally, finally. That's a great band. We're finally gonna make it, there's definitely a market for that. So like, we brought you here James, we know you've been working. This is my house by the way, so. Oh yeah, this is James's house, welcome. We'll give you a tour later. Thank you to the house, and James. So like, we brought you here because the sex class is super interesting, and we wanted to also find out a lot about what you've been up to, why you created this course, kind of what gave you the ideas, and where you like got the experience from, and could you like give us a little like introduction to what you've been working on, and you know, what you do in regards to the sexual education, kung fu. Yeah, okay, sure. Where do we start this one? Well, I've always been a freak, and a pervert, since I was a young boy. Very, very curious about women, and sexuality, and wanted to learn everything, and have always been really focused in on understanding individual women, and making their experiences as uniquely amazing as is possible, because I'm a top, I'm not a dom, so I'm someone that is dominant, but who I guess I get off on female pleasure. I've never said that before, but yeah, I think that's basically it. What's a top, and what's a dom, just for like newbies out there? Right, well, okay, we'll get straight into that. Well, in the BDSM world, which I'm not actually a kinkster, like I'm not someone who particularly likes dungeons, or any of that kind of thing. I've learned a lot from those kind of people, because they have extremely good skills, and really good communication, and consent, so I learned a lot from them, but I don't like the aesthetic of it. I'm not a fetishist, I'm not someone who is really part of those kind of scenes, but I've learned a lot from them, and so you have different types of, obviously, different types of sexualities, and a massive broad spectrum of it, so dominant and submissive does not in any way cover all the types of sexuality out there, but for simplicity's sake, we'll look at that. So there are different types of dominance, and there are different types of subs, and there are switches, and all sorts of variations in between. So you, just a few options, you have an authoritarian dom, who's the stern one, who barks orders, and is, and it's about force, and impact, and power, let's say, and then you have more kind of sensual dominance, which would be the type that I'm generally, I guess I'm pretty adaptable, which is taking command, taking the lead, holding space, and creating context for females, or your partner, or whatever gender, to experience what they want to experience, and that being the paradox of the dom-sub relationship, is that the dom, if it's clean and healthy, is serving the submissive. So it's the sub that actually sets the limits, and, you know, creates, like, within the context of communication, creates the variety of things you're going to play with, and then the dom is in charge of activating it, let's say. And then you would say a top is someone who is dominant, but is not a sadist. Like, I have no sadistic tendencies at all. I have no hatred or anger towards women at all. I've burnt that out of me many years ago. So, yeah, if you were watching it, it might look the same. They might be, it might look super authoritarian, you know, they might, in terms of what the play is happening, but the intention and the vibe is different, right? So it's like, yeah, as I said, it's like, I don't actually get off on any of this shit. Like, it's not my, it's not like, I have no fetishes at all, except probably that, to serve women's pleasure in some kind of way. And it's not selfless, by the way. I get a lot out of it, because when you activate a woman, she feels safe, she feels, she has trust, and she can express herself, and you're going to get the best out of her. What was the question? And then that was like the side tangent. And then, like, back to the question was like, you know, you just explained how you came up with the sex class and like, what got you there? That was just a preamble. And you can expect quite a lot of that today. Well, so I've been teaching dating and seduction courses since 2009, eight or something, started in Melbourne, Australia, moved over to Europe 2012. You know, got kind of big in the scene. And with a highly specialized and professional team have been bouncing around the world for years teaching these workshops, inevitably, you know, because essentially, it's like for guys that don't know how to go and talk to girls, teaching them how to do that, how to get on dates, how to have good dates, through to the bedroom, and then whatever happens after that, good luck. And so inevitably, guys were like, well, what happens after that? And then I'm like, well, I know quite a bit about this. And so I started informally kind of adding at the end of workshops doing like little sex, like tutorials, let's say, and just, you know, I'm like, all right, guys, what do you want to know? And they give me a list of things. I'm like, all right, we talked about this. And then, you know, and there was a girl in the house. I'm like, hey, come over here, can we just demo this one thing on you? And then, and then eyes light up, and then over time, myself, this wasn't just me, myself, Shea Matthews, and Sir Dominic, who is Australia's highest paid professional dominant. So he's paid by women to make to do horrible things to them. And he was his buddy of ours. And so I learned quite a lot of like, more of the extreme kink stuff of him. And eventually, the three of us got together, I don't know, some years ago, five years ago, six years ago or something, and decided to build the world's most comprehensive and detailed and hands on sex course, which we did. And then we sold it to a bunch of our like VIP clients to be to test it tested out, we brought a bunch of bunch of attractive and super open girls that we know quite a lot of that type of lady in and paid them well. And then the guys got to practice everything not not not penetrative, well, except on some specific context, but you know, lots of stuff they got to actually practice hands on. And so this, we found will turn a guy who was completely vanilla, has no idea how to have sex beyond three positions, and you're supposed to lick a girl or something to beast in a week, because they actually got to practice it in real time. And so we're like, okay, we're on something here. So then I've been we've been running that unfortunately, because of the pandemic and the lockdown in Australia, Dom was locked in Australia for a couple years for me and Shea took it over. And then we've been doing that for private, like 1% of groups. So we get a lot of like super wealthy guys hire us to, we're about to do that this week, with where we have to sign NDAs, because they're, you know, some big fish. So we do those kind of private groups. And then we do one for our clients once a year. It's very expensive, and most people can't afford it. And so recently, I decided to turn it or adapt it into a digital product, which Adam and I spent the last eight months locked in this house with girls. Adam, guy in the back. Yeah, shout out to Adam. Some things that I'll never forget. Yeah, we're locked in this house for months filming this course, and recently released it, and it's kicking ass. And dudes are fucking loving it on the chats, because I've never, I've never had clients that were, they were always single, all my clients, and I'll shut up in a minute, guys. But for the first time ever, we've got a whole bunch of married guys and guys with girlfriends signed up. And so on the chats, they're like, so cute. So it's like, had a great fingering session with the missus last night. Thanks for that, James. I'm like, Oh my God. Wow, that's so weird. Cool. So yeah, it's having incredible ripple effects. And the guys and the ladies are having awesome sex as a result. So I'm very pleased. There you go. That's it in a nutshell. Saving marriages from divorces. That's great. Totally. Yeah. Do you girls have like any questions like to James about the course or anything? I just have a question about the top. So what is the top again? I didn't quite get that. Well, it's essentially that, like, often dominance, it's really part of their sexuality, right? In the sense that like having authority and power over someone, and maybe with like, an aspect of sadism in it, which doesn't necessarily mean that it's a bad thing, because there are masochists who like sadists, right? So someone who gets off on causing pain, right? Or gets off on humiliation, right? It would be more of the sadistic side of dominance. So I'm not any of those things, although I can absolutely play that, you know, if a girl wants to play with it, I can, I can do it. But it's not actually within me, it's more of a role play. So it's like, I'm, I'm 100% dominant in terms of the actions and all the things that I do. But it's, it's not coming from some, like, really integral part of myself. It's like, I enjoy that it's, it works with my personality with my, with my sense of masculinity. But I really am doing it. As I mean, as I said, it's not selfless, but it's like, I really enjoy, let's say, opening woman up and unfolding her so that she can experience aspects of herself that perhaps she hasn't had before. And then of course, you see aspects of the woman that no one else has seen before. So it's like making them vulnerable, vulnerable and more aware of themselves, like what they really want, and how they can find pleasures in different type of things, right? It's something like that. Yeah, because I mean, opening up. Yeah, because large numbers of women have lots of latent fantasies that they have shame, guilt and fear around. And there is obviously a lot of judgment on women for their sexuality in general, and especially if it's like a little bit kinky. And so and yet, there is there is boiling in the subconscious of most women, like far more complex fantasies than most men ever have. Because men's fantasies is like, I'd like to have sex with a hot girl easily. And maybe two at a time once in my life. That's it. Whereas I'm probably being a bit reductive. But whereas, you know, women have like complex fantasy structures, often like zoning with childhood conditioning around around taboo around things they're not supposed to be doing, yet they yearn for. And so like a good Dom has the ability to create a like a safe container for that to be explored in a way where there is no judgment, and there is no danger, and there's no consequence. And so you can play through the sequence of the scene or the fantasy or whatever. And at the end with if with proper aftercare, it's it's it's sealed, let's say it's finished. And then she goes back to being herself, right without any residual like, Oh, did that guy think I was a slut? Or like, should I have done that? or that kind of thing, which often women do experience. I would say, I don't know, I'm not a woman. Okay. Okay, then I guess that would be a first starting point to ever try anything, because for example, I don't know if I'm dominant or sub, but I think the experience with top, there will be something to know more, what I like more, because that's something interesting. I think so, sorry, but so far, like how have you ladies, how does this conversation make you feel? Is it something you're interested in? Are you like, do you wanna find out more? Do you feel like you relate to that and you wanna express an aspect of that in yourself? Right now, you all look like you're really enjoying it, so what do you think to like the? It's really interesting, I think. What's interesting to you? The way you talk about it. Yeah, it's safe to say that I'm like a newbie to this topic and I haven't heard a man talk like this about this topic, I guess. Like this really open up and really full of imagination and everything, so I really like it. Because would you, like you've obviously heard of BDSM. Yes, yes. Right, so what would you say, what is your thoughts on what do you think it is? Like just forget what I just said. Yeah, like as I came here, like really without any experience to say, I would assume that, oh, it's just a sob and dominant and that's all and it's just getting hurting or get hurt and something like that. Yeah, but it's, I'm really interested in hearing it in another aspect, maybe. Actually, I like the topic so much because I don't think that there is enough open conversation about this. I'm not really a newbie to this topic with my work and with my private life as well, but it's so hard to talk about this because a lot of people are so ashamed to talk about so natural things. So yeah, I'm really intrigued and excited to hear more. Also, they just can't talk about it, I guess. Yeah, what do you mean? Like don't have the knowledge or the experiences and also they don't care, I guess. Yeah, well, certainly a lot of men don't care enough to like figure this out. Cause I mean, it does as a man to like try and actually understand women. I don't yet, I'm working on it. Is, it takes a lot of empathy. It takes dropping your pride and your ego. It takes actually listening and being able to draw things out of a woman when she may be like more reserved or defending herself against the, let's say the world at large in terms of the judgments and fears that she might have. So yeah, a lot of men, well, firstly, they just don't know that anything exists. They're just completely ignorant of it or they've heard about it and they judge it. Or they've heard about it and they're like, that sounds like too much work. So there's unfortunately not that many men who've put in the work. Good day, good day. Gentlemen, it's a Portuguese olive farmer, James reporting in after Budapest sex teacher, James had a bit of a chat to you about some awesome stuff.
