So I received this question. It says, when I'm out and I've had an awesome interaction, it is really hard for me to then approach another girl because I'm still emotionally invested. Is that bad? All right. Well, firstly, it's awesome that you're having great interactions, so that's very good. There's two ways to look at this. On an individual day-by-day basis, okay, so you went out to do some day game and you met some girls and then you meet a girl that you have a great connection with and it's awesome. Do you have to then keep gaming for that day? No, you don't. It's totally fine to decide, all right, that was a really good moment, I've had a good experience today, you know, I'm going to call it quits for the day. That's totally fine. However, it's a bad habit to get into long-term in terms of, what happens is when you are first going out and doing a lot of this, you'll have a lot of average interactions, things that don't go so well, things that are okay, you get a kind of flaky number or the girl's sort of interested and then sometimes you meet a girl where you really have great chemistry and that's why we're doing this, right? We want to be able to find girls that we have great chemistry with. However, in your early stages of this, it is a very common mistake that men make is they meet one girl that they have a good connection with and then they stop approaching other girls and they put all of their investment, emotional investment, time investment into this one lead and that's dangerous because if the moment that you start to invest everything into one girl, it puts you in a very weak position. It's very difficult to mask and hide your neediness because if you are really into this one girl and you really want to make it work and if it doesn't work, it's going to be really painful, then she's going to sense that. There is this balancing act of being able to show that, yes, I am affected by a girl, I am truly interested in her, this girl is very special to me. At the same time, as I'm not putting my entire life on the line for her. So, and this is interesting, you'll see this in my book, which is coming out very soon in Natural History, where I have these experiences where I meet one girl where it is special, right? She's very interesting to me or particularly attractive to me and sometimes these interactions or these seductions are very challenging and they take a bit of time, longer than it would normally take. And if I was in that situation only working on that one girl, then I would have become resentful, frustrated and needy. But the reason I was able to maintain and continue with that girl that was special was because I was also out dating other girls. And this goes against the kind of conditioned storyline which men are fed, which is that, and women too, which is that you are looking for the one, right? And so once you find a girl that appears to be different from other girls, that you should just put all your focus and energy into that. And I don't think that's true. I think when you are learning about yourself, learning about seduction and women and learning to have choice, well, a big part of that is learning to find out what it is you actually want to choose. And you don't know that straight away. You don't know what the one is until you've had a lot of them, until you've dated a bunch of girls, until you've had different types of relationships. That's when you start to realize, okay, what I really like is a girl who is whatever, or who makes me feel a certain way. And it's very easy to mistake a bond, an initial chemistry with that being your soulmate. You learn to become ready for your soulmate. It's simply not the fact that you are just there waiting around, she's waiting around, you're not just doing your normal humdrum lives and suddenly you bump into each other. And because of some cosmic fate-driven scenario that you're supposed to be together, that this is the one that you've been looking for, that suddenly you're both going to become amazing human beings, become completely self-actualized and have an amazing relationship. It doesn't work like that. Relationships are a skill. Love is a skill. Of course, it's an emotion, it's a feeling, but it is something you learn how to implement, that you learn how to negotiate with, that you learn how to open up properly without being too needy or possessive. And yeah, I know for myself, I met during the period where I decided I'm going to get really good at this, which is covered in my book, I made a vow because I broke up with a girlfriend at the beginning of the book and I made a vow to myself, I will not get into a serious, monogamous, one-on-one relationship for at least two years. I don't care who comes into my life, I need to make sure that I am progressed enough and have had enough experience that I am ready to then step into a relationship. And during that period, I did meet a number of girls that were awesome. There were girls that previously I would have just gone, yep, there's my new girlfriend, she's way better than the rest of the girls I know, so that's it. But I didn't. I deliberately just kept those relationships at a certain level and decided not to progress further because I knew that I was not yet ready to become somebody's one or to find the one. And as you'll see in the course of the book, I do step into that power where at some point, then yes, I do choose a relationship. So in answer to your question, sure, go out there, go to the club, go out in the street, meet some girls, you meet one that's an awesome interaction, you want to leave it on a high point and she's really affected you, cool, go home, have a bath, think about it. Of course, follow up that girl, but don't ignore all the other leads and all the other girls in your life. You need, that's all practice. That's all part of the learning how to be good at this. And it's going to make you more appealing anyway. She's going to see that you want her but don't desperately need her. Women are turned off by men who are really needy. In the same way I'm turned off by women who are really needy. It's not attractive because someone who's needy suggests that what they're looking for is somebody else to fulfill their life, somebody else to fill the hole of loneliness or insecurity or whatever they have. And for the only person that that is going to attract is someone who is codependent and needy too. And then you find people who are needy, search out people who are needy and then they squash together in some codependent relationship, which is very typically destructive and not healthy. So become autonomous, become happy and okay with being alone, with being out in there in the fray, meeting girls, trying things out, having it almost, almost succeed and slip through your fingers, all of that. Have the experience of meeting the girl that you're like, Oh, this is the girl of my dreams and finding out you're not ready yet. She is out of your league in the sense that not because of some inherent problem in you, but because you just don't yet have the ability or the confidence or the self belief to be able to get that girl. And I had that, you know, early on I met girls where I'm like, Oh, I really like this girl, but she's just a bit too advanced socially for me right now. And that's good. Those moments were also good wake up calls for me to think, okay, I need to keep going. I need to keep getting better. Not so I can go back and win that girl because she's gone off on her life and she's at her own stage. It's never about, you don't learn seduction to get a specific girl, right? There is, and we have guys contact us all the time saying, Hey, there's this one girl, you know, can I get on a Skype call and pay you guys to help me pick her up? And I usually say, nah, man, it's a waste of your money because if it's fucked up, it's probably already fucked up for a reason. You want to take the lessons from it, learn from it so that you don't make those mistakes in the future or that so that you know which direction you need to move in to become better, you know, more open hearted, more confident person and thank that girl for presenting you with an opportunity to say that and then let her go. There will be more. There's, there is always more people who believe that there is only one soulmate, um, are living in scarcity. They're, they're living in a position where they don't have many women in their life. So anytime they meet a girl that they have a connection with, they go, Oh, this is so important. I have to hold on to this. No, there are, there are plenty of people out there. It's not everyone. You know, it's not even 30% maybe it's, maybe it's only one in 10 girls. That's fine. Go and meet 10 girls today and you'll find one that you have a great connection with. Maybe it'll work. If it doesn't, cool. Take the lesson, move on tomorrow and go and approach some more. So yeah, there you go. James Marshall signing out. Gentlemen, James Marshall here with a very important announcement. I am finally, after 10 years, releasing my first ever book, which is going to be called A Natural History, The Seduction Journals of James Marshall. If you want to find out more about this and to be on the VIP advanced list, then click the link to the side and to the below, put in your email and I will be giving you lots of updates and behind the scenes exclusive material. Back in 2006 when I first started on this game of learning about seduction, personal development, lifestyle design, I meticulously documented my experiences. So I kept journals through the two years from 2006 to 2008 when I was doing this all the time around the clock, going from a novice to becoming very, very good. And so in this book, you get to see me as I transform from being a guy who's just starting out cold approaching girls on the street, trying to figure this out to at the end, managing a harem of five girlfriends, eventually finding the one girl that blows me away and sends me back to square one. It's an awesome ride. There's lots of amazing adventures, crazy seductions, rock and roll, mayhem. You get to be introduced to a whole range of characters that have influenced me, mentors and other guys who are great with seduction, who actually are kind of underground figures now, but certainly helped me to get to where I am today. It's all in there. It's dirty. It's grimy. It's no-hold-barred. I reveal all my insecurities, all my triumphs, all my challenges. It's a great fun read. So, if you're interested, put your email in the link below to find out more about natural history. That's the journal of me, Dirty Young Man. See you soon."}
