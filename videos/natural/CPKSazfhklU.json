I do like that, but sometimes, certain times of the month in the female cycle, you want more beastly awareness. A lot of women are not brought up to have healthy aggression. So I think that for me, I'm fascinated with healthy aggression. I'm fascinated with the beast in the man, not the unclaimed beast, because that's very scary. I don't like men who say they're nice men and they haven't claimed their beast, because to me, that is a form. I don't even want to use the word toxic, James. We can go there, but just think it's a stupid word. Maybe immature masculinity or something. It's just unclaimed. If you don't claim it, it's got you, and it can act out at any time, and you're a lot bigger and stronger than me. So no matter what I do, I was violently raped at some point in my youth, and there was nothing I could do. He was such a big guy, and the position that I was in, it was impossible for me to do anything other than bite his fucking hand, which I did. So something changed, but I think I left teeth scars on his head. But anyways, when it's claimed, however, and you know that you can be violent and horrible, and you choose not to, everything in my body relaxes. And then when it comes to sex, the beast is available, because I don't always want sweet romantic stuff. I do like that, but sometimes, certain times of the month in the female cycle, you want more beastly awareness. Beast is available and on call. Exactly. Yes, I like it. And when I actually met my partner, he had been with many women who didn't appreciate the beast, let's say. So he had never really fully come out, and I think it was maybe our third or fourth time together, and I grabbed him by the throat, and I was like, bring him out. Just bring him out, because if you don't, I can't trust you. And then his beast arrived. What's that like as a woman seeing a man's transformation? Because I love when I meet a girl and I'm like, one day we're going to have sex, and right now she's a lady there, but there's something in her that's going to come out. I'm going to reveal that. What's it like on the other side when you're like, okay, there's a nice man, being a nice man, and then you know, but there must be something that you can tell that guy's claimed his beast or that guy hasn't, or maybe a feeling or something. But what's it like to see that transformation, that Jekyll and Hyde thing, when done well? It's not even Jekyll and Hyde when it's claimed. It's Jekyll and Hyde when it's unclaimed. So because I asked for it, he was already consciously in contact with it, but he never felt it was appropriate to bring it into a scenario, because a lot of the ladies just didn't want that. So when it emerged, I actually, like I said, I deeply relaxed, and a huge level of trust rose in my being, and I surrendered more than I'd ever surrendered to any other man at that point. And that's why we're, you know, 13 years later, it's still amazing. So that's because there's this place I can't tame in him. I can't touch in him. It's his wildness, and it's his. I could never claim it, no matter what I try and do, because the second you claim it, you jail it. Seduction is about so much more than just the approach, just what to say. It is about masculinity. It's about accessing the true core of who you are meant to be, and projecting that to women, as exemplified in this clip by the amazing Dr. Seda Desilets. You have to learn how to release the beast. Stop being such a nice fucking guy.
