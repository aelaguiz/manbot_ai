I have this evening a very special guest, not here with me, but there with himself and about to join me through the power of technology and astral travel to discuss many a thing, the one, the only, Zan Perrion. How are you doing, Zan? I'm fantastic. We're not allowed to say that. We can't say we're fantastic. Okay, I'm fairly middling. All right. My very first question to you is, why have we never hung out? I don't know. We just, you know, like in all our perambulations, we never landed in the same city at the same time. I mean, there's one time in Miami, was it Miami? No. I've been into Miami. Yes. There was some time in Miami. Oh, that's right. We were there at the 21 convention, but we just didn't see each other because we were doing something else. Yep. Life as it is, yeah. Life, extraordinary lives. We really need someone like Vince Kelvin to create the perfect thing where those paths can cross. Facilitator. Exactly, he is. So the reason I, I mean, for you guys out there, some of you will be Zan's audience, some of mine, some will be some random guy who's just bored and goes, who are these dudes? Both Zan and I have been in the seduction dating coaching industry, plus if you want to add on the life coaching, spirituality, and many other associated fields of coaching for a long time. And can I tell you what my first memory of knowing that you existed was? Yeah, I'd like to know. Okay, cool. I think it was around 2006, 7, maybe 8, because my memories are all a bit hazy, but it was the, it was the early days of, of seduction on the internet. And I was doing my thing because what I've discovered is that there was these pods of different guys around the world who were independently coming up with natural game like the, and by that, I mean, just, you know, going and meeting women without any weird shit. And so I was doing my thing in the, in the early days in Melbourne, you know, posting on little forums and, and back then any material that was coming through was being downloaded on some kind of torrent site. And so at some point I got my hands on cliffs list, some like conferences that was held way back in the day with some of the early movers and a bunch of dudes who you'd, who'd then vanished. I think Mystery and Tyler and Ross were there and you were there. I was there. Yeah. Although two years, 2005, 2006. Right. Okay. Yeah. Right. So maybe I saw it in 2007 or something. And I remember that you were wearing like a button down, not very cool shirt. You had like a, a bit of a nineties Bob and you were the only dude I remember speaking and going, Oh, that guy's not weird. Oh yeah. Like, wow, that's nice. Hey, they got it. They got a guy out there who wasn't doing some really weird stuff. And I don't remember exactly what you were talking about, but I remember the gist of the themes of being to do with more, with being an attractive person that women wanted to be around as opposed to necessarily learning a whole bunch of things to try and get them to like you, I guess. So that's, that's my very first memory of you. And then I was aware of you throughout the years. I remember at some point when we were doing our redoing our website for the second or third or fourth time, I remember looking at yours and like, you know, printing it out and showing the guy going sort of like that. Oh, wow. You know, like he's got the, he's got like the girl, but she's not a stripper. And, you know, there's a bit, there's some smoke and stuff, that kind of thing. So you, that's cool. That was, uh, one of the, one of your earlier designs was, uh, was used by man, long memories there, you know, like it's been quite a, quite a, quite a journey. Incredible. I had short hair back then, wearing a little suit. Well, yeah. Yeah. Can you tell me, can you tell me in the audience a bit about like, cause I, I like to be honest, I've known all of you throughout the years and anytime anyone mentions you, they're like, Oh, Zan's fucking awesome. And I'm like, yeah, I've heard good things about him. Should hang out with him sometime. And that's kind of how it's been over the years. Um, but can you talk a little bit about your background? Obviously you're not Romanian, you live in Romania now. Yeah. You've been doing this a long time. What's the story in a nutshell? Well, I'll make it really short. I'm Canadian and I grew up in, in, in the North, in Northern British Columbia in Canada, uh, basically in the wilderness, mostly without electricity, running water, this type of thing. And, um, and I, I, I moved away from home when I was 13. I basically, my last formal education is 13 years old. Right. And, uh, and I moved out into the, further into the wilderness and I helped a man, you know, a mountain man with his trap line. And I basically was, I was this wilderness teenager kid, you know, like, and I had moccasins on my feet and, and, uh, I learned how to survive in the wilderness and catching, you know, hunting and fishing and, and trapping and this kind of stuff, you know? And, and, um, and when I was 18 years old, sorry, what, what was a slap? Uh, what kind of line was it? A slap line? Uh, you said you went, you went into the trap line, trap, an old trap line. I'm like, what is that? That sounds way too wilderness boss. Very wilderness. And this guy made his living. He was a mountain man for years out. And it's cliche, but it was, it was two hours away from civilization on a gravel road all the way out there. And he lived in a Valley called the Wolverine Valley, which is, it sounds like he made it up from a movie, but it was pristine and untouched. And I moved out there and I lived in a, in a log cabin with, you know, sod on the roof and grass growing on the roof. And I helped this guy for, you know, uh, a period of time. And, but then, so I didn't, that was my schooling, really. I didn't, I didn't have social grace in that. I didn't go to high school. I didn't go to, you know, you know, to a certain level and I didn't go to college or university. So I didn't learn those types of, you know, like who's the jocks, who's the cool kids, who's the nerds, you know, I didn't have that kind of social energy. Or have you been socialized into the class system? No. And when I was 18, 19 years old, I came out of that because I realized, man, there's no girls out here. So I came into the cities of the world and I was completely, when I was 19, 20 years old and, and, and, you know, I'm not exaggerating at all. I was the most clueless, uh, needy, insecure, weepy, poetic, uh, uh, uh, available, nice guy that you could possibly imagine. I had, you know, I had no education in it, right? And I spent my 20s in confusion and, and frustration and trying to understand it. But I loved girls. I loved, I loved women more than anything I could ever possibly imagine. You know, I just, I adored women and I, and I would, and I was so needy throughout my 20s, this is my short story, uh, because I never had this social energy or, or grace, right? And then in my 30s, because I never quit and I kept trying and I kept going on dates if I could and, and in all the massive rejection and all the massive frustration I ever got, I never gave up. And in my 30s, I started to get some light bulb moments, go, wait a minute, hmm, really? And I would go to the bar by myself for years, by myself, trying, trying to look cool, uh, with it, with this, you know, trying to, trying to be like, uh, aloof and cool, lean against the bar and act like I have no, you know, I have many options and I am not needy at all until the lights come on. Yeah. And, and so my, in my 30s, I started to get, wait a minute, I heard, you know, this girl just said this to me and I heard that a hundred times before and, and I learned over the course of time that it meant something different. So I started to piece together this thing and remember, this is pre-internet, roughly, not really, but you know, back when you, all you would do is send an email occasionally and, you know, you had to get a phone number. You had to get a phone number because there's no other way of, of contacting it. Right. So I, so my thirties, I started to do this synapses started firing. And then my forties, I, I thought, you know, after, after that decade, I really had a sense of understanding and I, and I quit my corporate job, which I, you know, that's another story and I hit the road and I traveled for 10 years and, and wrote, wrote the book, The Alabasta Girl on, on my experiences of my youthful neediness. So there's, so there's nothing a man who's listening to this is going through that I didn't go through. I understand it deeply. I know, I know the heartfelt gutshot feel of when you feel like you did your best and you're still alone and you're lonely and I get it a hundred percent. So. That's a, that's, I think in some ways that's like an integral wound that, that a man kind of has to have, you know, when someone like Iron John talks about that from receiving your original wound from your father, which, which sets a man off on his path to, you know, to essentially heal and go through his warrior's journey and eventually reconcile with his internal father and then transcend him. But I think that, that also exists in terms of women. It's like all of us have got one or two or a series of, of women that we didn't get, you know, that we, it was a disaster and really heartbreaking and, you know, really difficult to go through at the time, but without that would not have set you on, on the path. Now I've got a question about that because many, many men have had their wound, but they have then interpreted that in ways that led them to resenting women or to wanting to conquer them or to retreating, retreating from them altogether, uh, you know, or, or creating a buffering ideology that kind of explains away why things are and means that they don't have to have responsibility for it and so on. So I'm wondering why you didn't do that and how it was that you recognize that the issue was you in some ways, right? It's like there was things you had to change and, and parts of your pride or ego you had to drop. What was that process like? Was it easy for you? Was it really difficult? And where did that fit into your journey? That's a great question. You know, like, um, I was so lost and alone and I mean, I've got some horror stories I could tell guys for, for weeks about those days, you know, tell one, tell one quick, tell one quick knee knee jerking sob. Sorry. If you saw the movie Hitch where Will Smith is this guy and you know, he's this dating goat sort of thing. And then he flashes back to his college days or his university days and he's this dorky guy and he's dating this girl and, and, and she gets into a car and with this cool guy and he's crying with his braces like this and he's crying, I'll be there for you. I understand you have to go and see, but I'll be there for you. I watched that in movie theater and I was like this, I could, because I did the exact same thing. It's like the girl that I was dating. And that's embarrassing to say it, but it's true. She's getting on the back of a motorcycle of this cool guy and I'm there weeping. Okay, here you go. I'm in like 20 years older than that. And I'm weeping and saying, I understand, but I'm, you'll recognize, go with this guy, but you'll recognize, you'll come back because I'm the good guy. And, and I will always be there for you and I will never let you down. And I'm weeping and, and the guy in the motorcycle is going, who's this loser? He's just like, I don't know, just go, go, go, go. Is that your little brother or something? Okay. Oh my goodness. By the way, I'm going to fuck you in a minute. She's like, I know, cool. It, it was so brutal, man. And that was my, my whole thing. So I got, yeah, there you go. There's one sob story. Okay. So how was it that that didn't turn you into a bitter woman hating or jock hating dude? That's a good question. How was it you processed that? You know, I got asked the question a couple of years ago, which kind of set me back on my heels because I'd never been asked before. And the question was this, I don't know why I was never asked it, but the question was this, in all those years of massive pain and insecurity and loss and loneliness, pure loneliness, like, you know, did you ever think of giving up? And I'm like, wow, wow, what a question. And I never once ever, ever thought of giving up. I said, no, if other men have got this figured out, I have to figure it out too. I'm going to. So I became the student, you know, the student of life and student of observation. Like one of my highest skill sets is I really know the way a room is about to flow. It could be a club. It could be a party. It could be a lounge. It could be whatever. I know who likes who. I know who's about to position himself over there, who's going to go and talk to that girl. The girls are going to migrate this way. So you position yourself like a chess game. I can see it all. It's because I stood in observation of these social scenes for years and just watched and watched and watched and watched, went home alone. But I watched and said, you know, this guy straightened his ties and go talk to that girl. But what is the energy? What is the, what is transpiring here? I want to know, you know, you have your seduction spidey sense on. And the thing is, in order to, in order for that to work, you actually have to drop your own ego because as an observer, you become scientific about it in the sense that you see that it's cause and effect. And is it the words that caused or is it the demeanor? Is it the posture? Is that, okay, you start seeing that one thing leads to another and then it can't be about you anymore. It can't be about like, Oh, it's my, you know, my feelings. She should have, why do they always get to? And it becomes less of a personal thing. That's why as like you, I never, there was never a choice of whether or not I was going to do this. I felt like, yeah, it wasn't like a destiny so much, but it was just like, it was like, I must do this. There is no alternative because I know the alternative is regret. And that's the only thing I can't live with. I can, I can live with a lot of mistakes, but I can't live with proper chunks of regret. I can regret certain actions, but like looking back on a period of my life and going, Oh, that five years was a waste. I can't deal with it. Um, so then, and, and I don't know about you, man, but like, and I'm sure someone's going to do it. I'm so fucking sick and tired of answering the question, how do I get over the fear? Like, how do I get over the fear of going to talk to a girl, right? Because I've answered that question in every way possible from every angle, from the psychological to the physical, to the fucking deep childhood traumas. Now, what, you know, just every single angle. covered, but it does come down to that there is just some men who the answer is obviously like well I will talk to her whether or not I do it today or now or I do it correctly, I must and that's the answer of like how do I get over my approach anxiety, it's that you know you must. What are your thoughts on that? You know the thing, you're a hundred percent like you have to take action. You know Woody Allen said that 80% of success is just showing up and what we're not doing is showing up. You're standing there in awkward silence, but you showed up you know and you know like people said well you had this traumatic childhood, you know you grew up poor in the forest and no education and you know women are rejecting you in your 20s and you know, but my saving grace I think was literature. Like I would read stories, like I read Casanova's memoirs when I was young, I was like wow this guy just you know, like he took off into the wind you know, with no safety net. Like people say oh yeah, like I stretched myself and I backpacked across Europe, but what you really did is you went from ATM to ATM, you know. It's a start. You can call mother and mother's gonna make sure you're safe, but you know like and nowadays like you know 300 years ago, men like us who grew up with this childhood of like longing would go to sea in a wooden ship and there was no medical insurance, they didn't have a savings account, they went out into the unknown and said I have to go and see what I'm made of and we've lost that today because we have safety nets and comfort all around us. So we have this. Even now when a plague is blitzing through the planet, everyone's like oh I better hunker down in my very comfortable room. So we have this abundance and yet we're poor me, we look inward you know. Like nobody in history, like people say well yeah I'm this way because my childhood was my father was this and my mother blah blah blah and so I have to resolve my childhood which is this entire you know volume of what we're trying to construct today and nobody in history had a nice childhood, nobody. We had famine and mother you know died and sister was dragged away and you know nobody had a happy childhood and yet we're the first generation that has to resolve it and deal with it you know. That's very interesting. Others. And when you think about it, at other times and places, you never got to have your 30s and 40s to think about it. If you made it to your 30s, you were doing amazingly well. It's like, isn't that interesting like you had your childhood, your father was probably going to die by the time you were 15, 20, 25, you know, you had to get on with it, right? So father dies, okay you didn't have time to then sit down and on his deathbed and reconcile things 30 years later. I think that is a really interesting thing and I've talked to soldiers before because we've had a probably statistically higher level of like US Marines than we should in our work. I don't know, engineers by far the most, but then we've been in quite a lot of soldiers and I've talked to them, you know, I don't want to try to do it in a tasteful way, but talk to them about that process of going to war and also about very, what I find interesting is integrating back into societies. And I remember one guy who was very fucked up from his time in Afghanistan, but like I met him in the Peruvian Amazon actually when we were going out to do ayahuasca and he'd come down from America searching for something, bumped into our crew and we took him into the jungle. It was kind of, it was a surreal apocalypse now, acid trip. But he was saying like the thing that traumatised him much more than warfare was coming back to, in his case, America and having no way of being reintegrated into society, no way of mourning, no way of processing what he'd done, of what he'd seen and then of being you know brought back into now it's his peacetime duties as opposed to his wartime duties. And I think that's, it's really interesting when we look at, obviously in the post-globalised world we don't have discrete tribal units with clear initiation processes from father to son that you know have gone from time immemorial. But even like our grandfather's generation, even though there was more globalisation than there was in a traditional society, they didn't have what we have, which is this soup of potentiality, which has, which I think has some amazing, amazing potential benefits. The primary one being you get choice. And then also like previously you didn't get any choice. If you're born in this tribe, you're part of that tribe. And that I'm sure that gave you an amazing sense of purpose because there was no questions like I am part of the sun tribe or I'm part of the whatever tribe. I believe what I'm, I believe this. We have a long lineage. It makes sense. I don't have to question my, you know, my reason for being all the time. I go through my processes from boy to man to warrior to king, et cetera. And now we have this like, you could draw from or ignore all or any of those at any one time. Any cultures, any influences. So what's your thought on that? Thoughts on that in terms of, I guess, modern masculinity as a, and particularly for younger guys, I think coming up guys who are in their teens, twenties, late twenties, still figuring themselves out. What are your thoughts on that in an era when you don't, you can choose whatever it is to, you have to, you do actually have to figure it out. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know, it's like, I'm a product of Canada, which is very much the Western culture, you know, and it's, it's very conservative British, British, you know, based in history sort of thing. Right. And so, so the idea, yeah, right. It's like the idea is to be reserved and to, and to not celebrate the spirit of your sexual nature. Right. And I think that's a, that's a complete failing. And you know, if, and I think you can agree with this, if, if there's one thing that guys can learn to understand, it's that their sexual nature, that they love the feeling of the attraction they have to the opposite sex, to women is a divine thing. And in this modern age, it's, it's toxic shame. If you're a man, well, you know, like you're one, you're, you're one step away from being a rapist. And if you walk by a playground too, too slow, you're, you know, you're, what are you a pedophile? And that's a sin. That's a sin that society has, has perpetrated on men and we're crusaders against it. And our sexual nature is, is, is to me, it's divine. It's the way we are. We love that energy. We love it. And we're, and, but we're taught that it's wrong, that it's, it's, it's shameful. And so we learned to hide it from Canadian kid, you know, you learn to hide it, your eyes front, you, you, you, you just mask it. You mask your, your, your delirious love of life and wanting to bend the world over and that's wrong. Right. Yeah. It's, and, and I guess not politically correct, you know, that's not politically correct and, but it is what, that's what it is. Yeah. Well, we'll come and get us. We're, we're over in the East. It's weird. You can't get us now. Anyway. Um, I guess like the repression of sexuality, whether it's been the male or the female or both has been like a characteristic of many different authoritarian societies throughout history and through, you know, today in order to, because, because it is such a dangerous force because it's creative, because it's related to freedom, because it's emotional, uh, because you can't stop it, you know, even, even if you do repress it with the most horrendous fear, like let's say with very hardcore religious conditioning that makes you literally think that you will burn for eternity because of your sexuality, if you indulge, it still doesn't stop it. It's like, uh, the soft and the hard machines have tried throughout the ages to compress, you know, human sexuality. And now I guess we're seeing in, let's say in the modern Western age, we're seeing a different variation on that. It's not, it's not the Victorian Puritan, you know, uh, stop it or you will, thou shalt go blind. Uh, it's not, it's not so much a moralizing about religious things, but there are, there's different types of moralizing or different types. Now it's looking at the, that the male essence is dangerous and it's a wrong thing and society saying it. I mean, it's, and, and, and if anything's human dangerous, then yeah, it is in the sense that the human potential contains dangerous things. Of course, you know, we, we men, men and women contain the potential for violence and genocide and all sorts of dangerous things. But the, the, this in the creative force that it all comes out of can't, you can't separate those and, and neuter the sexual energy in order to try and, uh, you know, spay the man, I guess. Yeah. And you know, it's like, you get this too, I'm certain men ask me all the time, how do I, how do I start to express my, to, to open up and, and, and, and embrace and express my sexual nature? Like how do I open that? And I'm thinking, you know, you watch porn all day long. You can't tell me you're not sexual, you're not a sexual being, but you, but it's, but it's because you're so ashamed. We hide and hide and hide. And, and the idea is that, you know, like you, you touched on it. Men are afraid of their darkness, you know, of their, their danger. And this is, you know, their, their, their, like I said, the desire to bend the world over their desire to create, to go out and enforce and to go out and, you know, and, and the problem is this, male aggressive or male aggression, or how do I, not aggression is the wrong word, but male's passion, yeah. It's beautiful when it's outward cast to protect home community family, you know, because you're protecting the loved ones and that's, you know, in the, in the cave for instance, right? And so that, that, that passion goes out, thus far shalt thou go and no further. Where it turns toxic is when that turns that, that, that, that, that darkness and that fierceness turns towards the loved ones, you know, or internally back on themselves. Yeah. So, so there's a, there's a, there's assaulting women for instance, or there's, you know, pedophilia for instance, that's, that, that, then it becomes toxic because it's aggression going inward, but going outward, it's a beautiful energy and, and it's because we're protecting our loved, you know, our loved one. And this is what's mixed up. It's like, it's all been cast into the same thing. And I'm not a sociologist, obviously, and I'm, you know, and, and someone well, I would say we, we, we are, we are actually, we're, we're street level sociologists who study society by maneuvering within it and reporting back on it in real time. So you know, maybe not. That's true. And I went and did six months at university in sociology. So you know, I can add that studied sociology, studied sociology at a university once. Like you, I, I, I did actually, I did actually go to college, but only for a year and a half. So college, college, I know, I know very few college, college educated, oh no, very few college educated, very few college educated millionaires. Education. Education, that's where we come from. But you know what? It's, it's a fantastic thing that you know, that you're trying to create in this, in this world, James. What's that I'm trying to create? Well, the, the, the, the impetus that you're trying to give back to men. You know what? It's, I think it's, I think it's God's work. You know, it's like trying to say a good message, trying to get men to stand on their feet again in this broken world, you know? And I think it's a, it's a necessary and there's very few messages for men. That's the truth. Yeah. That's, there's very few. What, what I always try to do is I try to, as much as possible, not, not have an overarching ideology. Like that's, and I know I fail, like we all do because we all, we all can't help but fit into belief structures, but I try to stay apolitical and I don't even mean that in a partisan way or whatever, like, cause I do have a partisan, I do have partisan biases for sure. But in terms of like, and I don't want to talk too much about red pill or stuff or whatever, but just in terms of like, I, I've certainly taken the red pill in the sense that, you know, I don't, I don't just see things the way I wish they were. I'm not, I'm not living in a fantasy fairy tale, but I'm also not looking to apportion blame on groups or on, or on, on major structures if I see that that effort is wasted in, and in my, in my opinion, um, a lot, a lot of it is wasted when, when you're railing against something instead of going, well, if I understand the truth, which is as you discovered way back in the day, as she rolled the steamy window up on the, on the, what was it, Toyota 85 or whatever, um, you know, the truth that comes out there is one that can easily lead to an ideology of blame or an ideology of, of victimhood for the man, for the man, uh, or it can be one of going, hang on, I don't actually understand the way men and women operate obviously, like she likes him more than me. And that doesn't mean I'm worthless. And that's, and that's something I want to ask you about in a moment, the sense of worthiness because that's, that's something that has come up in every client I've ever had, I would say, except for the ones where it should come up, but they don't notice it. Um, like that sense of like being able to look at it dispassionately and be like, it doesn't mean I, my genes are worse or that, you know, I'm less alpha as a human and, you know, all that. It's like, she likes that man better than me because he's operating in a way that's making her attracted to him because he's exemplifying certain characteristics, which I've repressed or I haven't developed or I don't know about yet and so on. So what are your thoughts on like looking at seduction as, as a catalyst or, uh, for or a crucible for actual personal metamorphosis, right? Because I think most guys come into it looking at it as a, as a toolkit, right? They, they would, they like, I don't know how to do what to say, how to look. I learned those and then it should be okay. And I think we're long, many years past the old, like which one's better is direct, indirect or whatever. That's like kind of just academic stuff, really. It doesn't really matter. I think the, the, the real importance is when a man realizes that it's not just a toolkit for a function, it's not just utilitarian, it is actually transformational. You know, it's like, it's interesting because you hit something on the beginning of your comment here, your thought, you talked about this idea that, um, we're not going to get "}
