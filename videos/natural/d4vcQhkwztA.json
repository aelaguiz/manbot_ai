It's really wild. 15 days retreat in the jungle versus 15 days in Europe, both with a cool crew. What differences did you find between shamanic practices in South America in the jungle versus ceremonies in Europe? Is context just a small detail? Jungle tends to scare me. Should I push the comfort zone there? Okay, so yeah, I've done long-term retreats in the jungles of Peru on my farm. And I've done, the ones I've done in Australia actually, I actually have not done any in centers in Europe, but I did them in Australia with the same teacher that I did in Peru. So I did them in the Australian bush in like a nice kind of, with a nice farmhouse and running water and like not tarantulas. And people are like, but the Australian bush. No, the Australian bush is nothing. Everyone's so terrified of it. Oh, spiders and snakes. Nah, it's like, no. Like I will happily walk barefoot in the Australian bush. I won't do that in the Amazon jungle. Way more scary, way more dangerous shit. Maybe not, maybe it's just because I'm an Aussie and wherever you brought up, you're not scared of. But there, okay, so is there a difference between doing it in the Amazon, in the jungle jungle, jungle, like real jungle, or doing it in a nice farmhouse in the Czech Republic where you do it on a grassy lawn? Yes, there is a difference. What I would say is more important is the crew and the teacher. So yeah, if it's a fantastic teacher who cares, who knows their shit, and that's gonna be really hard to know because there are a lot of people who think they know their shit and do know how to do the ceremonies and they do know how to prepare the medicines. But these are really tricksy kinds of things because they give you, if you become a competent medicine person or shaman, it does change you and you do become quite charismatic and powerful. You do have insights, but you can also be twisted by it and I've met some teachers where they, yeah, there is a dark side to it and it's a bit trippy because it starts to enter into the realms of like spirits and possession and like dark wizardry and stuff like that, which most people were like, yeah, right. And as I was, I was like, yeah, right. But when you've been there and you've seen enough, like I trained with one guy who was extremely powerful, really, really charismatic, but had some really weird thing going on. And Sasha had extremely bad nights with him and took him months to get over it. Many hours later. How are you feeling, Sasha? I almost died last night in the ceremony. I almost went eat shit. So I'd say it much, much more matters that if you have someone who is caring, who is not doing it for their ego, and a lot of people do, like they have an ego attachment to being a shaman or being a wizard and they have all the, like they all, you know, guys, someone that always wears their messer, like wears their, sorry, their, you know, their voodoo clothes and they're a Westerner. Like that's a bit weird to me. Cause the ones I know, like when they walk on the street, they just wear clothes and they, and you wouldn't necessarily know that they're always like in the spiritual plane or whatever. They're not super invested in being heroes or like being on social media about it. It can be hard to know who's who. So it does matter who you go with. It does matter how many people are there. Like more is not better, right? Cause it's harder to control the space. Like I've been in groups that were up to 80 people and that was extremely, like you're on your own then. Really, you really are on your own. And that was, I had a good night, but I saw lots of other people having awful nights and there just wasn't enough facilitating to look after them. And there's so much psychic energy bouncing off each other. It's probably too much. Groups of around 10 to 20 are good groups that, and most of the time I've done them in smaller groups, somewhere between five and 10 to 12 people. Although we did on the farm last year, we did a 20 person San Pedro ceremony, but we'd all been there together for a week, preparing, meditating, cleansing, purging. We were all in alignment. And so that can be a big difference as well. If you just randomly arrive and there's like a bunch of people from all over the world that you haven't never met before, some of them carrying psychosis from war trauma or someone dealing with their childhood rape issues or someone coming in really angry or someone who's on medication and shouldn't be there. Like you don't know who's gonna turn up at a lot of these centers. And then you see it and then people go have freaking freakouts or really, you can really feel, like you do become like an antenna and you really can feel what's going on in the room and often outside. So that can be a bit hit and miss. So if you've got a group that you know, or you've done some preparatory training together where you've gone and done a diet at first, where you were just dieting, drinking the herbs, doing plant baths, whatever the various, there are various treatments that different schools use so that you become kind of a group and then you prepare and then you do your ceremonies later in the week, for example, that's also much better. That's a big part of why we do that at the Natural Warrior Training is we spend five days first preparing, not just for that, we're doing lots of other stuff, but part of that is preparation for the ceremony so that everyone is in alignment, everyone is, the shaman knows people and knows, okay, if there are any issues and he knows how to look after or be more aware of some person if they may have some trauma or they may be more volatile. And then it's a better experience. So, but in answer to your question, is there, is it better to do it in the jungle? Yeah, fuck yeah. Like doing it in the Amazon or there's like people, other jungles and it doesn't have to only be the Amazon, but jungles where the vine, the yage vine and the chacruna leaves, which are the two elements to ayahuasca grow and doing it in the middle of the jungle where you are absolutely cut off from electricity, from internet, from 5G, man, from all of that. And there is just this density of life in those jungles, like billions of creatures, so much life, so much more than any other, like in the European nature, how many species are in a nice field? Like if we didn't include every type of insect, it'd be like a hundred species or something, I don't know. Not that many species. When you're in the jungle, it's like per square inch, there's fucking 15 and like per square kilometre, there's just thousands and hundreds of thousands of species and individuals just humming with life and all interconnected, right? Because the jungle is such an interconnected ecosystem with only this much layer of topsoil keeping the whole thing going. It's so vibrant with life. And as you start to cleanse, go on a proper dieta, basically starve yourself, you eat almost nothing, right? And the idea being that the plants are sentient and they don't like the smell of humans. Take it or leave it, that's just what they tell me, right? And they are also jealous, take it or leave it. They want you to come with respect to their land, to receive teachings and to cleanse yourself of your humanness essentially for that time. You become more plant or more jungle than human or the human that you are is another organism within this ecosystem. And that was my experience really feeling like when I first go in the jungle, you're like, shit, there's fucking, and you're under this mosquito net tucking everything in and you're like fucking, because there is, there's tarantulas, they come in from the rain and they climb up and there's fucking centipedes this long and there's mosquitoes this big that do have malaria in them. And there's Bushmaster snakes that will kill you. And there's pumas at night going, like, it's real, right? There's, the jungle is full of fucking deadly shit. But I found like after the first few nights, because I would go and do, if you're doing a five day, a 15 day, probably they're giving you at least seven doses or maybe less, depends. Some people, sometimes they do them every, usually they do them every second night, sometimes less depending on the teacher. But after your first couple of ceremonies, I just started to feel like I'm just, I'm part of the jungle. And I did walk around barefoot in the campground, not out right into the jungle, but I would walk around barefoot and I didn't feel scared. And I saw, and the animals just, the insects and stuff didn't seem to bother me. I didn't get bitten by anything. I did wear, I definitely wore long sleeves and I definitely put on only natural mosquito repellent because you can't use the DEET stuff because you can't have chemicals on you when you're doing dieters. So you just have to use, you'd basically need to cover yourself and use mosquito repellent. And getting malaria, depending on the area, is definitely a thing as well. Shay got malaria once, not in Peru, in Colombia. But yeah, doing ayahuasca in the jungle is fucking so intense because the jungle speaks to you. The elements speak to you. All of the animals and creatures get involved. It's really wild. And highly, I recommend it if you want to go down this path, but doing one in Europe, which will be much safer and you'll feel, you know, it is nicer that you get to go and sleep in a bed at the end of the night, instead of you're on the hut, in the hut, under your mossy net with tarantulas on the walls. But that's fucking awesome too. Like, it's such an adventure. So yeah, there's my thoughts. Well, that was a little bit out of left field, right? For new guys on this channel, they're like, what, what's this about taking crazy drugs in the jungle and should I do it in the jungle or should I do it in a farmhouse in Czech Republic? So if you're new here, welcome to The Natural Lifestyles. Yes, we are very well known for our skills and teaching in lifestyle design and sexuality, and of course, dating with the ladies. But a big part of our personal success and also a big part of what we pass on to our students is to do with spirituality. And not in a woo-woo sense, but in a very practical sense. So learning to understand embodiment, breath awareness, focus, intent, practical meditations that allow you to be calm, cool, collected, and direct with your presence. So we actually have a different type of training coming up very soon. It's called The Natural Warrior Training. And this has nothing to do with women. Well, in broad scope it does, but this is really about taking a deep dive into masculine initiation. I know for myself and for most men of our generation, we weren't brought up in a very traditional way where we had some kind of initiation rite that took us from boyhood into manhood. We kind of just had to figure it out ourselves and cobble it together with this post-structuralist crazy world that we live in. And as a result, often there are different aspects of ourselves that are not truly developed into manhood. So we put this workshop together with the aim to create a modern initiation for men. It's not religious, it's not based around one singular tradition, but it draws from a whole range of traditions, including movement, meditation, shamanism, spirituality, so that we can help guys to really understand themselves at a deeper core to resolve traumas and issues that we all definitely carry, to work through our baggage, as opposed to just hustling towards being workaholics, which is often how most men would deal with that. This is a really deep and beautiful experience. And yes, we will be taking the jungle juices, right? So referring back to this video here, is it better to do it in the Peruvian jungle? Well, sure, if you can get there at this time in the pandemic and you understand where to find the right teachers and you're able to go through the diet as correctly, then yes, that's what I personally did, but we've made it easy for you. So we have an incredible shaman that joins us here and you get to experience these truly life-changing and once in a lifetime experiences for diving deep into your psyche and understanding yourself at much deeper levels. And plus I'm pretty fun to trip with, to be honest. I play my flute when I get really high. And that's not just it, that's on the last two days, we cover a whole huge range of technologies, which you can check out by clicking the link below. The next Natural Warrior Training will be held here, which is in the North of Portugal. And it starts on the 1st of May, 2021. Yes, it will be happening. And yes, we have ways of getting you in, except if you're an Australian. So Europeans and Americans, we can get you here. And what a better way to deal with this insane time in history than to get out of your city, come to join me at my farm and go deep. All right, check the link below. See you in the next video. Peace. \u266a\u266a\u266a \u266a\u266a\u266a"}
