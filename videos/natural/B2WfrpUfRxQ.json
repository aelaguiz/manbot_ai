And then there's something about it that grew upon me, right, because in order to really want a woman, I need to know her. Yes, I could wanna fuck a billboard, you know, some random like female form, right? But to actually really desire a woman, like to be really hungry for her, I have to know something that's unique to her. And that is what I would say most, or if not all women are craving, is to be seen, not by all men, but, you know, the men that she's into, as a unique sexual object. \u266a\u266a\u266a Do you wanna switch from friendliness to, let's say sexual projection, that low energy? Don't worry about low energy, high energy. Like. Okay, like a sexual, I mean, how do you switch from that friendliness vibe you're starting with to that sexual vibe? There's a number of things, but primarily it is in the intention and the eye contact. Okay, so let me do it to you, all right? No, no. You have to say yes, so it's consensual. All right, good. So, I'm at a friendly vibe and it's the, I'm seeing you as your human self and I'm, I like you and you've got a cute scarf and that's lovely, all right? And then there's a shift where I, yeah, I did, and you felt it, right? I go into the black of your eye, yeah? And I lower my center, like my awareness comes down to general awareness. Like my awareness comes down to generally here, yeah? And I'm not deliberately trying to change the tonality of my voice now, but it's changing, right? Because now I'm in seduction, yeah? It's a choice. It's a choice to shift into a particular type of phase. And then the way that I speak, my gesturing, my tonality will tend to follow, right? Sing, all right, yeah? So, it's something, that's something that's practiced for sure, right? Like, and at first you try that and you'd be like, sex staring, am I doing the thing? Okay, yeah, this is also about embodiment. This is also really about, you know, I've done a lot of meditation, a lot of work with tantra. I've gazed into many women's eyes and I've had, you know, sex with a few. Um, so, yeah, like, it's something that, like one thing maybe I'll leave you with is that, for the majority of women, their sexuality, like their imminent, present sexuality is not activated until, is activated in response to the masculine, right? So it's like, I'm very unlikely to say some clever words that will turn her on. Gareth might be able to, he has, he's able to. But the, it will be the rawness of the male that tends to then activate the female, right? Do women get, you know, horny alone? Yes, you know, it's, can they go out on a night and be in a state where they are frisky? Yes, but so much of the time, and this is especially important to know in longer term relationships, right? Often the sexual spark or polarity can dissipate over time. And that can be for a variety of reasons, but one of the most common ones is that she doesn't feel his hunger anymore, right? She doesn't feel the rapacious, almost aggressive sexual desire coming from him. That is the thing typically that triggers a woman, and it will, it'll trigger her in one of two directions, the noop, right? And that's good because then she, it means that if you get solid rejections, it means that your messages were clear, which is really good. I mean, it doesn't always feel good, right? But the ones where you're having the pleasant chat, and then we exchange Instagrams because we might stay in touch, is not, I mean, it's not a good thing to practice, right? It's better to have situations where women go, oh, well, no, I've got a boyfriend because she felt the rawness and the realness of your sexual desire. Now, of course, this all has to be calibrated. Again, I'm not suggesting walking down the street, like leering and blazing sex eyes. We are gentlemen after all, right? My standard, well, let's say a common narrative thread is it starts with warmth and friendliness and appreciation, and then there's something about it that grew upon me, right? Because in order to really want a woman, I need to know her. Yes, I could wanna fuck a billboard, as some random like female form, right? But to actually really desire a woman, like to be really hungry for her, I have to know something that's unique to her, right? And that is what I would say most, or if not all women are craving, is to be seen, not by all men, but the men that she's into, as a unique sexual object. Not only, right? All sorts of other things to do with being human, but to be actually seen from that perspective, right? So when I drink her in, when I eat her with my eyes, you know, when I'm really, really present with the touch of my, just the touch of the hand on the inner wrist, you know, and that sends tingles up both our spines, right? This is the realm of the actual lover, and women gravitate towards that type of man, because there are so few of them, right? There are so, and there are many, many who wish to be, they just don't really know what, they're just artificially putting, or they have had them put all sorts of blocks and checks on being able to release this rawness in a calibrated way. Women need it, right? And we're not here as charity workers, but we are here as empathy workers, right? Because we're not going and sacrificing ourselves at the altar of women. But there is a lot of pain individually, and on large scales between men and women, lots of trauma, lots of misunderstanding, lots of disconnection, and are there global issues at play within this? Yeah, but we can't, you cannot fucking change those things, and it's pointless. Like, in 20, 30 years time, if you look back and you think, I spent a large amount of the 2010s and teens being angry about some gender wars shit that was only being fought by the most extreme ends of society, you will have wasted parts of your life, because no one will give you any medals, and you won't feel good about that. You'll just be like, I should have, it would have been better to just been fucking watching TV. It's like, it's pointless. We have the ability to heal between individuals. We have the ability to understand her and for her to understand you. All right, we have the potential ability to create beautiful love affairs and to have heartbreaks, and to, you know, yes, to have experienced the shit that comes along with that, because that's part of it, right? We are like, I do not envy the guys that grew up in the like Red Pill, this, you know, the young dudes now thinking like, ah, all women are strange and evil and I'm gonna boycott them. Dude, you just stole your chance to be heartbroken, to write shitty poetry, yeah? To whinge and cry, to pick yourself up, to go, I'll never love again, to, you know, become tough and work out, and then to like meet a girl that's actually quite nice, and then to start something else. You know, all of that. Don't rob yourself of that over an ideology, or over this is the way hard men and women are, this and women will always, and men will always, fuck that, yeah? Have your own stories. Huh? The Red Pill never teaches how to build connection and also emotional intimacy. No. No, because it's adversarial, right? Because it suggests that we are at war. I mean, sure, we like, you could say that we're all at war, you know, all sides against all sides, yeah? It's dog eat dog, you know? Law of the jungle. Yeah, it is, but it's also laws of symbiosis, you know, tribal affiliations, love affairs, all those things exist. Choose where you're gonna put your focus, because we only got one shot, probably.
