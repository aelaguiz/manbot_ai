Hi. How are ya? Good. Good. I'm just here because you look fucking cool and I want to say hello. Thank you. Yes, I'm James. Kate. Kate. And you matched your nails with your dress. Do you do that every day? You have a different colour of nail for every dress? No, no, no. Oh my God. No. It's just for one month, yeah. Where are you from? You don't sound Czech. Russia. Right, right. Where do you think I'm from? I don't know. Some England? Australia. Australia. Australia. I'm speaking more clearly than the average Australian. Otherwise you wouldn't understand me. Of course, yeah. Every time I have problems with the Australian. You have problems with Australians? No, I have problems with understanding Australians. No, I understand. I have problems with Russians, so. So it's Katya, right? Mm-hmm. All right. What are you doing here? What's going on in life? You mean in Prague? Yeah, in general. I'm living here. I'm studying here. You like it? Yes. I'm living here for 18 years already, so. Oh, really? You only look like you're 18 years old, so. I'm 23. Okay. Come on. That's good. It's better to look younger, right? Except if you're a boy. If you told me I looked 18, that wouldn't be good. Yeah. Well, I live in Budapest, but I'm just here for some business at the moment. And I am a very shy person, lacking self-confidence. So that's why I decided to come up here and test myself and just meet you. Oh, sorry. You have to go. I know you got a phone call. Are you meeting somebody? Right now? Okay. Would you like to go on a date with me later or tomorrow? We can, for example, do a Facebook. Yeah? What are you going to do with it? Just add me and then never talk to me? Just have some contact. Ah, yeah. We can do numbers instead. I don't like somebody's numbers. Why not? Because... I don't know. Just... I don't like... Is that because you've had situations where you gave a number and then the guy texts you 20 times in a row and you have to change your phone number? Yeah, for example. Yeah. Well, that's... I totally understand that, but I would never do that because I don't have too much pride in myself. So if I text you once and you don't reply, then I won't text you again. So for me, Facebook is better. It's like a buffer zone. It's a buffer zone, like Ukraine. Between the West and... Yeah, something like this. Did you get my geopolitical joke or not? You want to create enough distance that it's not dangerous, but it's a buffer zone. Okay, I understand. I understand. All right. And what's your plan for the week? Are you busy studying and stuff or what? Now I have... Today I had the last exam. Did you do good? Yes. One... I failed one in English, actually. And so I will have next term in one and a half week. And now I'm waiting for one result. And I hope it would be fine. But else I have... I have to make it good. Okay. You're under... It's under control. Okay, Jamie. J-A-M-M-I-E. Yeah. And then next word is Marshall. Marshall? M-A-R-S-H-A-L-L. Yeah. Not him. Not him. Not that guy. None of those people. If you wonder, you can find me because I'm the one with a name like this. You're the only Katya. Yes. All right, you just write it down there. I don't have data right now. Yeah. Probably better. I like this. That's an odd name for a Russian. It's a German name. Yeah, yeah. Is there an interesting story behind that? I didn't notice your green highlights before. That's awesome. Thank you. Awesome. It was blending in. Obama. All right, get out of here. You're in a rush, right? Mm-hmm. All right. Okay. Well, I hope to see you again. Okay. And if not... Bye. Hey, fuck you, buddy. That girl's hot. Yeah. And I'm jealous now. Yeah. Not that I was the guy who gets chicks. I'm the guy who got the elves' umbrellas. All right. Hi, are you James Marshall? No idea what you're talking about. Yes, how are you doing? I saw that at some video or something. Uh-huh, probably. We do videos. Hello. That looks like an interesting text. You've got a cheeky smile there. I'm waiting for someone, so... Are you on a date? Yeah, kind of. First date? Yeah. Good. Well, that's good because when he arrives, he'll be a little bit jealous, which will make him want you more. And then I can pretend to be the gay friend and confuse him. Who are you? Who am I? I'm James. How do you do? Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you as well. So, is it actually... Are you here alone? What do you mean, alone? I'm here with you. Oh, is that weird to walk around on a date while you're filming? Yeah."}
