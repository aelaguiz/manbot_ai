So in this video, I'd like to demonstrate to you and teach you how to do the correct and also show you the incorrect ways to stop a girl so that she's most likely to not freak out and to give you a chance to say hello and get the interaction started. So the next primary way that you're going to approach women on the street is if you see them walking towards you down the street. This is my preferred way to do it actually because it doesn't give me any time to think too much about it or worry about it and also I can see from the distance if I'm into her and if she happens to be looking around, I can actually catch her eye contact earlier which means that if I'm projecting good intention and I've got good posture, she's more likely to stop. So I call this the Jedi stop because there's a little move in there that you'll learn in a moment that reminds me of Luke Skywalker waving his hand and confusing aliens. But first, let me demonstrate how to do it very badly. Alright, so the first thing I'm doing incorrectly here is I'm getting directly in front of her from a distance where she can see someone's in front of me in my way and then I'm putting my hand out in pretty much in any way is bad because if you see someone walking down the street towards you and they look like they're going to bump into you, you're going to naturally move out of the way, especially if I start waving my hands weirdly. So that's definitely not the right thing to do. Mistake number two. So in this case, I'm not getting in her way at all, I'm just trying to putting out my little limp hand and mumbling something to her. Again, if a girl's busy or she's got no interest in particularly talking to a stranger, she's just going to sweep by. And now, let's look at the correct way to do the Jedi stop. What I need to do first is when I see the girl down the street, I need to come in and line up my outside shoulder with her shoulder, right, so that she's going to be walking past me here. As I said before, I don't want to be in front of her, I don't want to be too far away from her, so I'm trying to reach out. I want to line up so more or less our shoulders would brush as we walk past. Now I'll show you in very slow motion. So as I'm walking towards her, at about here, I place my hand out and then I step in. Okay, so just stay still. So what's going to happen is I bring my hand out to around stomach height, again, not breast, not face, confrontational, creepy, fine. It's an open gesture and I'm not doing some strange karate kid move. I just place my hand out and at the same time, at this distance, I make eye contact because naturally she's going to see, okay, there's a hand, then she's going to look up at me and at that point, I want to be smiling, giving her a nice look, not weirdly staring at her. And at that moment, most likely she's going to come to a stop. Then I just take a side step and then I just let my hand drop. Okay, so showing you again from here, I place my hand out, I look at her, step in, I let my hand drop and then I can say hello. Okay, so let's show you again in real time. Excuse me. If the girl is walking much faster and let's say she has her headphones in and maybe she's looking down, so she's not really aware of what's going on around her, then I need to give her more space. So that simply means that I'll be putting my hand out much earlier. Excuse me. Now hopefully with the amazing power of my perfect Jedi stop, every single woman that I do it on is going to stop and talk to me. The reality being that that doesn't always happen. Sometimes you try and do it and the girl just walks around you. Excuse me. So is there a way to deal with this? Yes, there certainly is. But first, let me show you what not to do. Excuse me. Excuse me. Hey, do you mind if I... So very important. Do not ever do this. If a girl turns and walks past you and then you start following behind her, this is really creepy. Girls get very upset if a dude starts chasing them down the street. No. Mistake number two. Excuse me. Hi. Look, I'm just trying to... Do you mind? Could you just hang on a second? I just think you're cute. So similar effect. If I try to block the woman in any way, the moment that I step out and block her once, she's already feeling very uncomfortable. I do it twice or three times, she's being harassed. So absolutely never going to work. Don't try and block a woman from getting past you. So you might be asking, well, how the hell do I deal with this? Let's deal with it. So as usual, she's walking towards me. I place my hand out to stop her. Now I can see at this point, pause, she's not going to stop. So instead of me following her or trying to block her, I literally just turn on my spot and then as she walks, I always start to walk next to her. But you can see here that I'm actually a little bit in front of her. And of course, as I'm doing this, I'm saying, hey there, I can see you're in a rush. You look amazing today. So what's your name? I'm Theodora. Lovely to meet you. All right. So as I'm walking along, I'm not behind her because this is creepy and weird and I'm not trying to get in her space. I just turn and I walk on my line. She's walking on her line. So it's just two people walking down the street. I'm just fractionally ahead of her so that in a weird way, she's following me now. And then I can have a conversation. I can make eye contact with her and I can get her attention. Sure, I may find out that she doesn't want to talk or it might just be that she was startled and she swept past me. And within some seconds, she decided it's okay to talk to me. Now let's show it in a realistic pace. Excuse me. I can see you're in a rush somewhere, but you look amazing today. Thank you. And what's your name? I'm James. I'm Theodora. Nice to meet you. You're not always going to see girls walking down the street. Often they'll be in static position. So the girl will be waiting in line somewhere, leaning against the wall, sitting at a bench or at a cafe. And so we need to be able to vary the way that we approach to do these scenarios. Usually they're quite simple as long as you keep in mind this one general rule. What does it feel like for the girl? In this situation, we have Theodora leaning against a wall on her phone. So here's what I would not want to do. Hi there. Hey. In this situation, her back's against the wall. I'm bigger than her. I've got a leather jacket. I look dangerous and I come in and I stand directly in front of her and also too close and I've sometimes seen guys leaning in as well. All right. So right now, how are you feeling? Bad. Bad. Yeah. She's trapped essentially, right? So this is not a comfortable position for a woman to be spoken to in. Another bad way to do this is for me to walk up and kind of, you know, hang here for a bit. Great. Yeah. And after some seconds, then go, oh, hi. All right. So that would look like in, without me talking about it, would look like this. Is that the, is it the new iPhone? Yeah, it is. If you're going to approach a girl, then make sure that you actually open your mouth and do it all together. Otherwise, it starts getting awkward and weird if you wait around to do it. So the correct way to approach when a girl's leaning against a wall or whatever is like this. I don't make a beeline for her. I just act like I'm walking by and I notice her and then I just come in at this diagonal angle. Excuse me. I get her attention. If she's looking down at something, I'll wave my hand to get her attention and now this distance is fine. Maybe I can come a little, little closer if she seems comfortable and I start the conversation from here. This allows her that psychological space all here. If she feels like leaving, she can leave. She doesn't feel trapped. I'm just chilling and I'm actually leaning back on my back foot here. And then if after some time, the conversation's going well, maybe I'll come in and I'll lean against the wall like this because this looks comfortable. This is two people who know each other having a conversation from a comfortable position. Next, if we see a girl who's sitting at a public bench or some kind of public seating, this is a great opportunity to meet a girl, but I need to be very careful again of the angles that I approach and the impression, the effect that I have on her. So if I walk in here, hi, excuse me. Now I'm having that same problem as with the wall. I'm blocking her and I'm looming over her and also to the outside world, if she's worried about what people think, which most people are, this does not look comfortable. This does not look like two people who know each other. This looks like a strange man coming and trying to get something out of a woman. Very bad. So what I actually do is more or less the same as if a girl is standing up and leaning against something is that I'm walking by and then at this angle, I'll come in, wave at her. Excuse me. Hi, how are you? Hey. You're looking wonderful today. Thank you. Yeah. I'm James. Hey, I'm Fedora. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. So this is a good way to start. However, if I then continue the conversation from this position, this is a little odd. She's sitting down, I'm standing, and we're having this conversation where one person is stable and the other person's floating around. So I don't want to stay in this position forever. Now if it's possible because there's space next to her, I want to sit down next to her. And the way that I'll usually do that is maybe after I've introduced myself, said hello, then I'll just say, hey, do you mind if I take a seat with you as I'm taking the seat, right? So I don't do it like this. Um, is it, is anyone, is that seat taken or? No, it's not. Oh, well, is it all right if, I mean, I don't know, do you mind if, I don't want to do it like that, right? Because now she's feeling awkward and it's easier for her to say, oh no, or I'm busy. Instead, I just assume that it's okay. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Do you mind if I take a seat? And as I take a seat, what I don't do is I'm not sitting down like this, face on, right in her face. As I take my seat, I actually open out the psychological space, sit down, I'm looking anywhere in here, this area, so that it's comfortable. And then I'll turn and talk to her. Not leaning in. I might even lean back a little bit to give her some space until she feels comfortable with me sitting there. Excuse me. Hello. Are you okay? Oh, cool. Uh, do you mind if I sit with you for a second? Okay. Cool. You were just frowning, so I wasn't sure if you were having a bad day or not. No, I'm okay. I'm eating to myself. So they have all of the technical details that you'll need to be able to stop a girl pretty much anywhere in a way that is effective and doesn't freak her out. It's very important that you go out and start to drill this in almost a mechanical way, figuring out your distances, figuring out the way that you're going to use your movements. However, the thing that is also really important to keep in mind is it's not just the technical movements that makes this work or not work. There is so much that is sub-communicated through my posture, my body language, my eye contact, and of course the expression that I have on my face. I can do a technically perfect Jedi stop, but be staring at her like a serial killer or have like really weak body language, and it's not going to have a very powerful effect on the girl. So you always want to keep in mind, what is the impression you want to give the girl when you meet her? What is the intent that you are going to project? In my mind, the simplest one I want to project is warmth, friendliness, and a curiosity to meet the girl. That's how I want to feel inside, and that's what I want my body language and my expression and my smile to communicate. So make sure as you're practicing your stops, that yeah, sure you're aware of, okay, how do you do your stepping, your physical movements, but at the same time, you need to be able to project a powerful and positive impact on the girl. Otherwise, she's going to see you and go, just subconsciously in a moment, she's just going to have a split second decision where she's like, it feels weird, I'm going to leave. So keep that in mind as you're going about doing your approaches and practice approaching girls from behind, from the front, girls who are hanging out, leaning against things, sitting on things.
