Well, I work in a company that does like different workshops in different cities like meditation lifestyle design Confidence dating and so on and it's pretty cool too because I do it a business side and I do the coaching side Enjoy Why Barcelona Because there's a lot of people and it's a cool city like that's basically I'm from Austria Where are you from? Very nice It's cool that you're married us. I understand that I'm not gonna try to influence that But it's very interesting to meet people who have businesses because I actually want to do a business next year here a matcha shop Have you been to New York? No, okay. Do you want to exchange Instagram? Yeah, do you feel like Barcelona is a good place for business, yeah Why? because we have We open our business three years ago and now have three shops here. Amazing.

No, but for real Interesting said she was a bit like, okay. Yeah. No, thank you You don't want to talk to strangers. No, and I thought oh, maybe he's Spanish. So I switched to Spanish a little bit Maybe she doesn't understand my English. Okay But turns out English was perfectly fine She was just a little bit yeah, it's not in the mood, you know, like married girl strange guy with a Hippie style when she's investing 20k in her shoes But then I kept persisting in a really friendly way I wasn't like reactive I wasn't pushy I kept the distance the same and I asked like basically I called out the little awkwardness of stranger meets stranger which is always going on by saying oh either you're like Very shy and friendly or very polite and friendly like basically like yes, please. No, thanks, basically And then we got into a conversation and she's like no, but I'm married. No, I cool and as soon as I hear that I'm basically turning off all seduction switches, you know, I'm not running away But I'm also not like arguing with that. Like she has a husband There's zero chance that I will seduce this girl, but she's a cool girl. She is fashionable. She was friendly She talked to me. Hey, why not make a friend turns out she runs three barbershops here turns out She's thinking about scaling the business I want to do a business here. I'm scaling TNL, you know like why not make a cool connection with a person that you're not trying to get into your bedroom and she have left with Super happy feelings and she will remember me and maybe we keep in touch later very cool I'm miss Barcelona.
