So yesterday we covered not lasting long enough, being a three minute or less man, and being too rushed, not allowing both parties, but particularly the woman to be aroused enough to get into sex. So today we're going to look at two more primary issues and how you can solve them. The big issue that comes up for a lot of women is consent and aftercare. Now this is a big topic particularly when we're looking at consent and there is a whole lot of grey area. You know there is ideas out there that you should be asking for explicit verbal consent at every single step of the physical escalation. Can I kiss you? Can I take your bra off? Can I squeeze this boob? Can I squeeze the other one? You know trying to do that through every single point of the escalation. Obviously it's not particularly realistic and it can certainly take people out of the present moment and very commonly a woman doesn't want you to check in on every single step of the sexual escalation. However, it is really important that we have consent and that we understand that we definitely have it and we also need to be aware that consent for a woman can be something that she feels like giving and then she can change her mind. So she may want to actually stop the sexual experience completely especially if it's the first time you guys have gotten together or there may be particular sex acts or things that are happening which suddenly is leaning outside of her boundaries of things that she wants to do and so we need to make sure that we have ongoing consent as well. So this can be a complex issue to look at but let's look at some of the primary ways that we can make sure that it's clear that we have enthusiastic consent. Obviously this goes both sides for the man and the woman but primarily it's the man who's making the moves, escalating, who's penetrating, who's shifting and changing into the next position or whatever else. So it's primarily your responsibility as the man to make sure that you've got this tight. We have two primary types of consent, basically verbal and nonverbal, implied and explicit. Often it will be implied or nonverbal consent will be all of the consent, right? So it's like she feels aroused and horny and she wants you to get inside her so you kiss her and she kisses you back. You touch her, she touches you back. You know, you go to open her legs, she opens them, you know, she guides you in, right? So there's all these nonverbal cues that it's a yes and a continued yes and more yeses and a fuck yes, right? So a lot of it does come down to this but we want to look at this as a type of dialogue, right, as a communication, as a conversation as opposed to I'm doing things to her and she lets me do them, right? It's that I'm making an offer or making a request, right, or opening the conversation and then I'm seeing how she responds in the dialogue, right, in the same way that if I'm in a conversation and I just randomly talk about topics that I want to talk about and I don't notice that she's looking bored or confused or uncomfortable or she's not really there with me, then this isn't a conversation. It's a rant or an interrogation, right? It's not something that's where both parties are putting in fuel into it. So the same as if I'm grabby, rushed, you know, fumbling in my own head just kind of fiddling around with a condom or like, you know, trying to get the clothes off and it's like she's an object that I'm dealing with as opposed to a human being that I'm having a physical dialogue with, then that can make her withdraw or feel consent or feel tense and not want to continue. And you'll notice this kind of thing when you start getting guarding signals, right? So not all women will vocalize and say what they do and don't want, okay? Should they? Well, in an ideal world, yes, but often they're worried or they, they don't know what to say or they're hoping that it's going to get better, um, or they're concerned about the guy's pride and his ego. And they had experiences in the past where they tried to give feedback or instruction and the guy, uh, you know, got a reactive in some kind of way and, and was moody or aggressive or, uh, made her feel bad about it. Right? So if you're aware of things like you're penetrating too hard and she places her hand on your hips, for example, or tries to, tries to grab you in some kind of way or put some blocking hand on your chest, right? Or you've noticed that there's tension in her hand or in her face, right? So she's expressing this, this discomfort in some kind of way. We want to be really aware of, of these reciprocal signals that we're getting from the woman in real time and being able to adjust. If that, uh, means that we need to pause and say, are you feeling uncomfortable or do I need to adjust something or can I, how can I make this feel better for you? All the better, right? Because this is taking little signals of not necessarily withdrawing consent completely, but, uh, trepidation or slight discomfort or that she's trying to, um, adjust and throttle the pace of what's going on in a way that's nonverbal, then I should be able to pick up on that. I can do that nonverbally, right? So it's like if she's guarding her hips, for example, she tilts her hips backwards or forwards in a way that means I can't penetrate as deeply. She puts a hand on me in some kind of way. She locks her ankles over my ankles, right? So, so that I can't penetrate as deeply. And then take that as a signal to back off a bit, go slower, go smoother, don't go in as deeply, don't grasp as hard, right? So basically to become gentler and more relaxed and do a little bit less and then see if that then relaxes her, then, then, you know, she releases that grip or her breathing opens up or you start seeing, you know, her cheeks flush and she gets back much more into the moment, right? A lot of the time we can figure out like where is this ongoing level of consent to pleasure, right? So it's that she's, she's feeling good and she wants this to progress as opposed to like a hard, like I, I want this all to stop or I, or I want this to go all the way, right? It's, this is happening moment by moment and so we need to have this ongoing awareness. When it comes to verbal consent, there are different ways to look at this. There are kind of formal ways that were developed basically in the BDSM scene because, you know, people are submitting to do often quite extreme, potentially, you know, painful things. And so, you know, being tied up and flogged or whipped or having candle wax dripped on you all the weird and wonderful and awesome, cool, strange things that people like to do in bed. No judgment at all. People like what they like, but in those kind of high voltage situations, it's really important that there is a way for us to modulate the intensity, right? All right, so, you know, the classic, maybe you've heard this, but the classic stoplight system of consent is really, really valuable to know, which is you can say to a partner and this, you know, even if you're not going into some intense dungeon scene, it's just that you want to actually practice with verbal consent. You can let your partner know if there's anything that you feel uncomfortable with at any time you want me to stop, just say the word red and I'll completely stop and then we can talk and see what's going on. You know, there'd be a, there would be a really formal clinical way of doing that. Okay, so let's look at these consent forms and, uh, you know, outline this as this one, this and this, this under this circumstance, you do this under this circumstance, you do that. Okay. That's, that's pretty formal and it takes the fun out of it, but you notice the way I delivered it, it's sexy, it's smooth. You can do that with a new partner, no problem. And she will absolutely appreciate and love this because that's different from, you know, is this okay? Is this okay? Is this okay? Every single time we make a move, which can get her out of the flow, this one in advance gives her the option at any point she can stop it, right? So, and often that's enough because she knows then that she can trust you so she doesn't have to monitor you, right? And if she's monitoring and saying, are you getting too rough? Are you leaning on her hair? Are you not really aware of what's going on? Are you becoming kind of selfish and aggressive in some kind of way? Then she has to be in her head checking in on that constantly or often, which gets her out of the sexy flow, being in her body, enjoying being a sexy lady, having good sexy times, right? But when she has that in the back of mind that she can say red and it stops, cool. Often that's, that's enough for her to actually completely relax and let go. As long as you are then, you know, taking care of her with your, with your awareness moment by moment throughout the session. Then we have the other option, which is orange or amber for the Americans, um, for the Americans, which you can say like this. And if there's something where you'd like it, but maybe it's a little bit too intense or you want me to back off a bit or slow down in some kind of way, just say orange, okay? Or amber. So this instruction gives her the ability to not cut the whole scene and just go, all right, it's over. This is all, this is too much. That one, that red is really used kind of as an emergency. It's like if something has gone wrong and things can go wrong and will go wrong in sex sometimes, right? Or they get in their head or they get triggered or some traumatic event is kind of reignited or something was painful or uncomfortable, uh, or they suddenly felt like the woman feels like she's being objectified in a kind of humiliating way, even if that's not the intention of the man. Well, the man uses a trigger word of some sort, my sexy bitch, and she hates that word. Uh, and it gets her out of the moment and she needs to stop for some reason. Or she just, maybe she's had such a huge orgasm that she's feeling really tender and vulnerable and she needs to chill. Right? She needs to recover. Right? So for all of these reasons that, you know, you could put a, put a, a stop or at least a, you know, a clear pause on what's going on to debrief and figure out what's happening next. But, you know, in my play, even though I've given these safe words to many, many women, I think I've heard red a couple of times. It's been from, from an impact, from a spank or from a flog that was just too hard and she needed to stop and I needed to rub it, rub it, rub the butt to like, you know, get, get feeling back in it. But it's been very, very rare. Orange, on the other hand, is something that is really very functional tool and I've heard many times. Right? Because it's like, cool, I'm grasping her and it's good or I'm spanking her, let's say, and she likes it, but it's just 10% too much. Right? So it's, it's like pleasant, but it's, there's a bit of an ouchy sting to it and if I backed it off 10, 20%, it'd be perfect and then she'd be loving it. Right? So in that situation, her giving her the permission and actually, you know, encouraging her to give you feedback means awesome that we can, we can go from being almost on point to being absolutely on point. Right? So we can, she can help me navigate through what it is that she really likes and then we can, I can start to map and monitor and go, okay, cool for her, this level of impact or this level of intensity or this speed, right, or this position or whatever is, is almost working and then I can readjust it and it can work awesomely. Green we don't need to say, right? Green is, green is the world that we want to live in, which is where everyone's having a good time. Consent is enthusiastically given and given again and given again. So she's not going to be screaming out green, green, green, uh, better that she's screaming out your name or fuck yes or something else. So that's kind of our formal way to introduce, uh, consent into the bedroom. Now it's not the only way and it's not the only thing that I ever do. There are other ways, let's say less informal ways that I can show the woman that I am willing and happy to take feedback, to change and adjust things. That alone can open a woman up where she can then express, right? Because the reality is many women have had experiences sexually where the man was doing something she didn't like and she tried in some kind of way and maybe it wasn't the best way. Maybe she said, that's not good or ouch or don't or, oh, can you do it better? All right. It's not, that's not great feedback. It doesn't really explain what I need to change, but maybe that's the best she had and best you could say, uh, or maybe she was really explicit and said, Hey, listen, I really like it when something, something, and the guy ignored it or got frustrated or judged her for it or his ego was aroused and inflamed in some kind of way. And so the message was not received by the guy, not well, maybe it wasn't communicated well, maybe it was, but it certainly wasn't received well. And so therefore she's like, I don't know how to tell guys. So what does a woman do in that situation? If she has that habit of like, uh, guys don't really care or take feedback and that's a generalization and it's not the truth, but it may be her, her lived experience and it's quite common. So how is she going to be able to express this? Well, maybe she won't. And so what will she do? Maybe she'll endure it or try and stop it or get it over with, fake an orgasm or whatever. Uh, and then go, okay, I don't want to see that guy again. All right. When that could have been fixed quite easily by using these kinds of statements and questions to give her permission, saying things like, if there's anything that you do or don't like, feel free to tell me at any time or show me what you like because I love to explore your body and want to give you more pleasure, right? Just that alone, opening up the avenue for communication saying, not only can you do this, but I want you to do this, right? Because I want to increase the pleasure that we have together. You know, other ones where I've done kind of micro versions of the, of the stoplight is if I tell her what I'm going to do, not, I don't want to give it all away, but it's like I want to take you tonight or you're going to be my good little doll or, uh, I want to give you, or I want you to lie back and I want to give you pleasure. Or tonight I want to, or now I want to learn more about your pussy. So what I would want to do is lie together and, and touch you and you show me how to touch you. Do you want to do that? Do you like that? How's that sound? You ready? Like any of those combinations of statements there. So again, I'm not saying you say all those things at once, but you know, any one of those given things, yeah, I want to, I want to take you tonight. You're going to be mine. She says yes. If there's anything that's too much at any point, you just say mercy. All right. So that's another version of that where I've taken out the stoplights. Now I will do that kind of thing. And it's say a newer, a newer partner. And I have no real intention of taking this into anything extreme in terms of BDSM or dominance or, you know, power play, for example. It's that we're going to have sex and I'm going to lead. I'm going to be the dominant partner, right? But it's going to be more in this sensual kind of dominance. So I know I'm not going to be pushing her, her limits to anything crazy probably. And if I do by accident or if that happens or I misjudge where her limits are, she can still use that word, mercy, or you replace that with please, sir, or let me breathe, or, you know, allow your submissive to relax, please. You know, anything where she can say in a cute and sexy way that she needs a break or she needs things to change, right? This can work really, really well as well. So there's some of the basics in terms of consent. We have our nonverbal consent, which relies on you being aware of your own body, being aware of the interplay with the woman's body, reading the nonverbal cues, and then mixing that in with your verbal consent, either on the front end, well, often on the front end, where I let her know that she can give me feedback in those either formal kind of BDSM stoplight system ways or in a more informal way, which is just like, show me at any point if there's something that you like or don't like. You know, I really like to get feedback so that I can give you more pleasure and we can get more out of each other, right? Feel free at any time to put your hands on me and show me the way that you want me to touch you, right? Any of these kinds of things. And then we can add those in during the play as well for this kind of ongoing consent and adjustment, right? You like that, you need more, or is that enough? Right, so something like that during whatever it is that I'm doing gives her the options to improve it. She likes it, yes, fuck yes, keep doing that. Do you need me to change it in any kind of way? Do you want more? Do you need a break? Sometimes, you know, if I've been fucking a girl hard for a while and I see that she's kind of, maybe she's had an orgasm or she's really breathless and then I'll slow down, I say, my little girl needs a break. And then I've had the variety of answers of what, like what, no, no more, or, hmm, which is like a yes where she's not sure how to say it or yes, and then I say, okay, lie down with me, let's relax, let's breathe together. Or, you know, she's like, no, more, okay, cool. And I keep going. So, you like this, do you want more? Can you take more? Show me what you want me to do next. Move your, put my hands where you want me to touch you. Right, and, you know, do, like, usually I will be the one that makes the decision on things like changing of positions and so on, right? But I will, in the play with a girl at some point, often say, do what you want now, or come on top of me and use me or ride me, right? Or you take over. So I'm from behind, I've been, you know, pumping and undulating. And then I slow, I say slow. Okay, now you take over, show me what you like. Right, so instructing her to, you know, take the active actions of that moment, right? That's, don't worry about that being like a loss of power or you losing dominance or whatever. Firstly, technically it is very dominant to instruct someone to take command, right? I'm delegating, basically. And at the same time, it doesn't matter, because it's just that now I'm just shifting the who is active and passive, who is moving and not moving, who is, you know, taking the lead in this particular moment or not, right? So overall, I'm gonna be doing that, but I'm giving permission and encouraging a girl to do that as well. Please keep this really firmly in mind. Of course, sex is high voltage, has charge, can cause terrible trauma or, you know, awkwardness or problems with self-esteem. Like, you know, there's so many issues that can come up when couples get together, especially when they're getting together for the first times. And we're not mind readers, neither of us. And for better or worse, often women won't feel able to or just do express exactly what they want in any given moment. They will hope that you know and hope you'll be able to communicate in some kind of way. Some will be very expressive and tell you exactly what they're into. Awesome, many will not. So it is your job because it's dangerous if you don't, right? We all know what the consequences of this could be in terms of harming someone, in terms of legal consequences. We're not always gonna get it in writing, but it's, you know, this is about protecting both of you in different ways, but it's ultimately about opening much better lines of communication of like improving the connection and the flow and the pleasure between you two. And it's something that can and absolutely will become sexy and fun and instructional for both of you in a way that makes, you know, sex so much, so much easier. Now, if we look at the backend, what happens after sex, we move into the area of aftercare. Now, this is something that a lot of couples and men in particular don't even consider at all. What happens when you finished having sex? Does that matter? Should, you know, don't you just go and have a shower and make yourself a sandwich or move on with your life or fall asleep or something? Yeah, often people do, right? So they've had this intimate connection to humans being as close as they can be. They've gone through a journey in a narrative, emotionally, physically, sexually, and then it finishes for whatever reason, someone came or they're having a break or whatever. It's really important for, especially for women, for there to be some kind of almost ritualized separation. Right, so it's where we've taken this woman, especially if we've taken her into like an intense experience, dropped her into some kind of trance. She's had really powerful orgasms. Maybe I took her through some kind of, you know, intense role play or dominant submission kind of experience that she, and ideally you too, have gone through like a broad sine wave of emotions and experiences. And they're impactful, they're deep, they're quite profound, and they have an afterglow and a lasting effect. And so if we just completely break the connection and leave her on a bed and go off and do something else or fall asleep or, you know, roll over and look at our phone or whatever, then this can lead to the whole experience being rewritten in her mind as being one that's kind of unpleasant or disrespectful, or she feels maybe that she's been used, or she just doesn't feel looked after at the end. And, you know, if you wanna have good sexual experiences for you and for women and you want them to come back, and especially if you're having relationships where, you know, your sex life is an active part of the couple, then it's important that you understand, and also for, you know, she understands about you as well, what is it that you need after the sex itself is finished to resolve and conclude that journey together, right? Now, there's not just one way to do this. Different people respond in different ways. Like when people think about, okay, what do you do after sex? Well, I guess you're supposed to cuddle the girl, right? Maybe people think that, and they're like, okay, how many minutes do I need to cuddle her? Absolutely, this will often be, you know, a primary kind of aftercare thing, which is just to spoon or cuddle together, snuggle up together, but there can certainly be situations where, you know, you've had hot, sweaty sex and both people are very satisfied and you roll off each other, and she doesn't want you to come over with your big sweaty man body and wrap her up. She wants to catch her breath and kind of come back into herself, right? So there'll be ways to intuit this because often people just, you know, roll off and then she might roll into you and wanna cuddle, okay, pretty clear that that's what she likes, or she's on her space. Usually what I do in those situations is I just place my hand on her leg or on her back, on her butt, just so that there is some physical contact still, right? Even though we might be lying next to each other because we're both catching our breath and it's not necessarily appropriate to like have a cozy snuggle right now, that there's just some kind of touch. I'm holding her hand, you know, I caress her in some kind of way. I place a, you know, comforting hand on a leg or on the back and maybe that's it. It's like, there's just like this some minutes where we're just in the zone together in this afterglow, ideally, and then, you know, it melts at some point and then I move on, get her a towel, get her to the shower or whatever and we clean up and we kind of continue from there. Or I say to her, do you want to cuddle, right? And she's like, gives any kind of, mm, yeah, yeah, so all right, chill. Or she gives an enthusiastic yes, then wrap her up. If you or her are both really sweaty, then it's good to, you know, go and grab a towel, wipe yourself off or put one between you or wrap her up in the sheets or in a blanket or whatever. So she feels the following things, clean, cozy and comforted. All right, those will be the kind of primary things that you want to be aware of after the event. And look, sometimes this is a matter of 30 seconds. Sometimes people do have just kind of an intense, quickie or kind of sport sex or recreational sex, which maybe doesn't go below the surface too deeply, is not so emotional, especially if the woman, you know, it was a disappointing experience for her. Often she doesn't really want to be connected to the guy because it's like, okay, that wasn't great, right? So there'll be situations, you need to read that as well, where, you know, people just separate or she gets up and goes to the shower or whatever. Okay, fine, like that's, you know, there'll be times where there is not the necessity for like formalized or lengthy aftercare, but there will definitely be situations where it is. And it really helps to conclude the sexual session and bond you, right? Where especially her hormones, oxytocin, dopamine, these things are like firing because of she's been flushed with them from you activating her sexually and giving her powerful orgasms, hopefully. And so she feels bonded and intimate and she wants those things, clean, cozy, comforted. Be aware of clean. Sex is messy and dirty sometimes, right? There can be period blood. There can be, if you had anal sex, there can be what comes out of butts. There's jizz, there's sweat. There's all of the things that are, you know, parts of being messy humans. And that's all fine when you're in the heat of the moment, you know, sweating and fucking and whatever. But afterwards, maybe you've come on her or, you know, you covered in sweat or whatever. Again, there'll be different ways that people respond. Like I've certainly had partners who like having my cum on them and they just kind of rub it in and leave it there. But often it's something that, okay, I wanna clean up. So being aware of like having tissues in the room and clean towels at the bare minimum and knowing that, okay, after this scene, we can relax and we can chill, catch our breath for a bit. But it's my job now to, especially if she's in my house and she's a stranger there, to help her get cozy, clean, and comforted. Cool, I'll go and get her a towel, get her tissues, help tidy her up. Say to her, do you wanna go and have a shower now? All right, wrap her up, take her to the bathroom. And when she comes back out and she's all fresh and clean again, then words of affirmation. Oh, then this can happen at any time. Words of affirmation, words of comfort, all right? That was so hot. You're such a good girl. You're so sexy. Fuck, that turned me on so much. That was amazing. You look so beautiful when you cum. Come here, give me a cuddle. Breathe with me. All right, so these simple things of like reaffirming connection, reaffirming to her that the experience was amazing, that she was awesome, that you find her attractive, that she's a good girl, all right? All of these little phrases, and you'll find that different women have different trigger phrases in a positive way. They like being called a certain thing. You're my little kitten, my girl, you know, my sexy baby, whatever. Some girls will hate one and like the other. You figure that out as you go along. And you can also, in conclusion to this, you can also, and I highly recommend it if you have a regular partner, talk to them about what is their after sex love language. How do they need to be treated afterwards in order to feel good about themselves, to feel like that was an amazing experience and that they feel respected, comforted, cozy, and clean? All right, so you can say, so after sex, do you like to cuddle straight away or do you like to clean up first? Do you like me to touch you gently? You know, do you like to breathe with me? Do you like to sit and have a cup of tea and have a chat? You know, do you wanna roll over and go to sleep? Or do you feel like you just need some separation, some time to yourself? All right, all of those things could be the thing that she's into and it might vary depending on obviously the depth and intensity of the type of experience as well. So please keep this in mind on the front end, being clear, responsive about your consent, and on the back end, resolving the situation like a gentleman, making sure that at the end of it, she feels like you respect her, she feels comfortable, you know, she feels sexy, she feels like she's yours, you know, she feels like she belongs there with you. Yeah, because of course, what's that gonna mean? Well, it's gonna mean that you're imprinting extremely good sexual experiences on women. You become the model of what positive masculinity is in her life, all right? So you're leaving her better than you found her, right? You're improving her self-esteem, you're making sure that sex for her is an incredible experience, and on the other side for you, like that stuff is amazing as well, right? We don't wanna think of sex as like pumping and dumping, right, getting my rocks off, you know, getting it over with, and then, you know, so that I can have my release and then kind of relax. Well, yeah, have your release and relax with her, be together, and of course, the effect of this is going to be like any of these aspects where a man takes the time and gives a shit enough to learn what his woman needs and wants is that you will be rewarded for that immensely, right, she will be devoted to you, she will fall in love with you, she will wanna fuck you, you know, she will see you with respect as a real dormant, right, as a real gentleman, as a real powerful masculine man because you have the ability."}
