Shay here, and I just want to answer one of the questions from our channel. And the question is basically, when you're out and about and you're doing your thing and you start to feel bad, how do you come back to a place where you can start to feel good again? And the answer to that is lots and lots of different ways, but I'll give you a few different techniques that are really easy. So the first thing to do is to start to remember that you're on a mission that's taking you somewhere that you really want to go. So learning to be a social guy, learning to be good with women, learning to build the lifestyle and the kinds of changes that you really want inside yourself is a long-term process. It's a journey. If you get too attached to the specific things that each step of the way is if they're the most important thing, like it's really important that every girl likes you or everything always goes right, then you're going to have a really shitty time because reality doesn't work like that, gentlemen. So you're going to have to come to terms with that. The way in which you do be more effective is get happy and fall in love with the fact that you're transforming over time and that the fact that you're facing these challenges means that you're growing and you're learning and that every time you go through them that you can become stronger. Now part of that process is to learn how to reframe things. You start to look for the positive meanings in everything that happens. So for example, you have an interaction with a girl that doesn't go the way you want it to. What's the moral to the story? It doesn't mean anything about you. That's a good start. Or maybe she was having a bad day and it's got nothing to do with you. Or maybe it's really good that she disqualified you or didn't go so well because she's obviously the person that you don't want to spend your time and energy on and now you're free to go and create the connections and the kinds of things that you really want with the girls that you do match and that do work out for you. So recognize once again that that's a part of the process to have a lot of positive reframing always working for you. Part of positive reframing is also to project positive outcomes. So when you see a girl that you want to go and approach, I want you to start to expect and start to feel good about the fact that when you go and talk to her, it's going to go well. And if nothing else, you're going to walk away with a smile on your face feeling good about the fact that you've made a choice to go towards something that you wanted to do on your own terms. It's important also to start to condition yourself to the expectation that things are not always going to be easy. Go out expecting that you're going to face challenges. Go out expecting that girls are going to try and push you away or not talk to you or that things are not going to go so well because if you go out expecting that that's going to be the case, then it's not going to be such a trauma when it happens. So it's better to expect the worst and then conduct yourself in a way that creates the best possible outcome than it is to kind of live in a delusion that it should be perfect all the time and then be somehow shocked that it wasn't exactly the way you expected it to be. So there's three very simple things that you can do to stay in state and to start to reconnect. Remember your long-term outcome and start to fall in love with where you're going and why you're really doing this. It's really important to have a strong why and a big vision of why you're doing this. Number two is always positively reframe things. Make sure that you're finding the positive meanings in everything that you do. And number three is making sure that you project for positive outcomes that make sense. Positive outcomes that make you feel good about why you're doing things and that are making it inspiring to move forward. The last thing is also to expect challenge and to learn to embrace challenge as part of the path. There's plenty of other ways that I could tell you, but for now that's three simple things that you can work with. Go for it. I want to hear some more feedback. Give me some more questions. Until next time, this is Shay, over and out."}
