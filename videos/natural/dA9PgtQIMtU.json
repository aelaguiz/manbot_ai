In today's video, myself and the wonderful Maria will be demonstrating some of the common mistakes that both men and women make in the bedroom. So I'll be showing you five common mistakes men make sexually. And five mistakes ladies make in the bedroom. That's right. So, the first common mistake that men make is completely penetrating, basically immediately without any warm-up or foreplay. Why is that a problem? Because there is no anticipation, probably I'm not warm enough, and I feel like you should do something more first. Right. So we can build expectation and arousal with a woman by taking our time on that first penetration. So think of your cock like a joystick, right? Or a paintbrush. So we can take the head of it, no matter what your size is, and start to paint, dividing between the lips, doing circular strokes, putting it around the entrance to the vagina, which has a huge amount of receptor cells for pleasure, right? For stimulation. And often those are ignored. The men just go straight in towards the back of the vagina, right? So take your time, put just the head of your cock in. You can even like do little circles or up and down stretches, because when we actually stretch side to side or up and down within the vagina, this creates engorgement, right? This is where lots of blood flow comes to the area, uh, and the nerves are stimulated so that it means that by the time you're starting to penetrate, it'll be as if she's sucking you in, right? So she might actually push back on you or you'll find that she's just more engorged, wetter obviously, and you can take your time. So that first penetration, like that first stroke, let's say, take up to a minute, even if you're kind of in like rough play, right? And it's kind of dominant and aggressive. We can still build this anticipation, this sexual tension, this excruciating need for her now to be penetrated, taking my time so that by the time that I go completely in, she's engorged. Her body has shifted to the shape of my body and now she's ready to fuck. Mistake number one for women is when they are twerking too much or moving too much when the man is trying to take control. So the problem here is if the man is trying to get a rhythmic stroke going and then the woman is jiggling around and moving, even though she may have awesome twerking skills, the problem is that our rhythms are not synchronized here, right? Now, if we're, let's say, really skilled or we know each other really well, then okay, we can get a rhythm where both of us are moving at the same time. But in general, you want one person stable and one person moving. So it's either I don't move and now she bounces and twerks in which enjoy that, right? So I'm holding a line basically, or I hold her hips and maybe I need to say, don't move, don't twerk, even though it's fucking sexy. And then I take control like this. Okay. So it's basically got to be one person active, one person stable, or you know, if we're extremely in synchronization with each other, then yes, we can get this kind of movement. But in general, one's held or the other is taking over. Mistake number two for dudes is related to their stroke control. Now, most men only have one type of stroke, which surprise, surprise is this pumping, right? Slow maybe or fast. Uh, and this is typically what you see happening in almost all pornography where the man is just jackhammering away indefinitely. Now, it's not that you would never pump or pound. It is certainly a thing, but if that is your only stroke, it can also have the effect of desensitizing both you and the woman because you're only making contact with small areas of the body, which can lead to the man losing his erection over time or both of you basically getting bored with the sex act. So instead of only pumping, we want to be aware that if we lock our pelvises together and then start to get these rotations or undulations through the pelvis, this will create a completely different style of stroke, right? As opposed to just in and out, in and out of the pumping, pounding variety, we have all of this extra undulation, which means that your cock starts to paint internally inside the woman, right? So I can hold her hips in and then get still very deep penetration and undulations. And it doesn't necessarily mean that that's always going to be slow lovemaking, right? So absolutely it can be from this kind of intimate space. We can have these rockings and undulations either holding her steady, right? So then I can push in deeply or we're both rolling our hips together for this intimate synchronized kinds of strokes. Or if I accelerate by tilting and squeezing my glutes, then I can still get hard fucking, let's say, but it's going to have this effect internally, right? As opposed to just the stabbing, which as Maria mentioned earlier, if we're hitting the end or the back of the cervix over and over again, it can bruise it. It feels really uncomfortable. Although the cervix really enjoys having these kinds of circular motions or rubbing motions, which is what this type of stroke is going to do. So remember this gentleman, not just pumping and pounding, but differing your strokes as well. Mistake number two for women is being an unresponsive starfish in bed. If you want to get the best out of your man and create more intimacy and passion, make sure to touch him sensually and make him feel wanted. A very big mistake that many men make, and this is almost unrecoverable if you do it, it's really going to ruin the sexual experience, is the way that you distribute your body weight over the woman's body, right? So the problem comes if I'm plonking myself down and then leaning my body weight into her uncomfortably. And that can happen in many different ways. So for example, you know, here with my forearms squeezing into her inner arm and elbow, if there's hair there and I lean my elbow into the hair and so it's pulling and tugging uncomfortably, it doesn't really matter what other amazing stroke control or dirty talk or tantric breathing I'm doing, she won't be able to concentrate on that if her hair is being pulled, right? So especially with a lady like this who has lots of big voluminous hair, there I lean down into this, not right. So I'm aware that if I need to, you know, move the hair out of the way whilst placing my body weight down that I do. And then I'm aware that I'm lowering my body weight in an even manner. Problems occur when, for example, I lean my pelvis in over on one side, I've got a bony hip bone and I stab it into her inner thigh, not comfortable. So I want to be aware of that I'm squaring my hips up, even if I'm, let's say I'm leaning over onto the left side now so that my right hand is free to caress and touch and, you know, put my finger in her mouth or whatever it is I'm doing. Cool. But now I'm aware that the body weight is leaning down into my left hip. So I want to rotate my hip to square it up so that the hip is straight, even though my upper body is a little bit twisted because I want to be able to touch it. All right. And then as I'm shifting body weight from side to side or into different positions, I'm aware that, you know, going from here that I don't drop my weight into my pelvis and then roll across over her stomach, right? Because that's going to feel uncomfortable. Instead I'm aware that, okay, here I'm retracting my pelvis a little bit, shifting the body weight back to center, then drop the weight back down in the pelvis like this. And in this way, then I can transition between, you know, whatever positions I'm maneuvering her through whilst being aware of where I'm going to lay my body weight, right? So now I'm coming down into spooning, same problem here. I can pull on the hair, you know, I can drop my weight too heavily down with my chest. So instead I'm aware that I take weight here in the forearm, shifting over so that there was a smooth transfer of weight in this situation. Or if I'm going back the same kind of way, I'm holding my body up like this. Hands go down as I lower down in. Now sometimes it's nice to compress the woman, but that's different from a squash, right? So if I lie relatively flat, so there's no particular area that's stabbing in, and then I literally lower my body weight like I'm doing a slow push up until she feels a compression, which feels like what? Cuddly. Cuddly and cozy and nice, intimate, as opposed to this, sorry. Squashing her and then sweating on her face. So be extremely conscious of this, your body mechanics. You know, from the beginning as I'm laying down on her, opening her legs up, putting my positions, choosing where I'm shifting in. Okay. And then I come to penetrate and then lower myself down. That's awesome because then we get this slow first stroke. She gets that sense of me sinking into her as opposed to, you know, what a lot of men do, which is awkward, like hands getting locked in up in here. Not good. And the other thing to be aware of on this is how do I maneuver her body, right? So let's say her hands are in the space where I want to go, so I can maneuver and adjust her hands or put them around me or whatever I want to do to create the space, moving hair out of the way, sliding down, shifting into square on position and then sinking into her body like that. That's a really sexy first entry, right? Which certainly sets the tone for a very saucy and intimate sex. Tip number three for women would be the way they angle their hips during sex. For example, in doggy position, if I roll my hips forward, it won't be good. As Maria was saying, if her hips are tilted forwards, this means that I can't really get penetration properly and also it doesn't look very sexy with this turtle back. So this can happen for a couple of reasons. One, that the woman is just really stiff in the hips, in which case she's going to need to practice stretching and squatting and doing the splits. Or she's trying to protect herself from too deep penetration, right? So if you notice that the woman's tilted her hips forward, especially if you're doing that like hard pumping, often what she's doing is creating a guard, right? Where she's trying to limit the depth of penetration that I have. So what I'll do is I will adjust her pelvis. I'll take her by the hip bone, put my hand over the top of her sacrum and then say, lift her ass up. All right, so that, that cue of feeling the guide at the same time as giving her a clear instruction will generally be the thing that fixes it. You may find then that she just doesn't have a lot of mobility in her hips, which we can't fix in real time. That's something that really requires her to do some yoga, but most women are able to rotate and articulate their hips. So let's say I'm noticing I'm pumping hard and she's starting to guard. Then I can say to her, is that too deep? Okay, so it's a little too deep. So then I'll say, all right, just relax your hips. I'll pull out. Now I'm just going to penetrate half for example, right? So now I'm going back to just half strokes only, you know, putting in the first couple of inches of my cock for example, and then I check in with her. Is that depth okay? Okay. Can you take a little deeper? And then I go in another 20% maybe, and then I'll notice like if she kind of involuntarily like tilts the hips back again, she's guarding. Okay. Or she winces or she's like, in some kind of way, then it's too deep. And then that case, I just adjust. Now this may mean depending on your size and her size that that's it, right? That this is, she can only take half your cock from this particular position because this one is, tends to be one where the vagina gets shortened. And so I'm more likely to bang the edge of the cervix. Okay. In that case, maybe that's the penetration length that's going to work for this woman at this time. But the vagina is extremely flexible, right? And over time, if I give her time to relax into it, and then I can tell her and you push back to where it feels good for you in this way, then, then often she will engorge and stretch and then you will be able to get deep penetration perhaps, you know, sooner or later. So keep this in mind that you can train the woman to adjust her pelvis by gripping the pelvis, moving, maneuvering from the sacrum. So from here, rotate, lift your ass. And then if she guards at all, then I check in with her, see if the length is too, the penetration is too deep, readjust, and then you'll get that nice positioning soon. So this becomes a problem when worst case, the woman is like locking my ankles, and her legs are down, which makes it very difficult for me to penetrate. So instead, we want her to open her hips. If she's got any tension in the pelvis, then I'll just go on the inside of the leg and say, just relax your leg, run my hand in underneath the back of the knee, lift your knees. All right. So that simple instruction of lift your knee, which is easy to follow, makes sense, as opposed to me trying to explain like open your pelvis and relax your legs or something, which won't make as clear sense as just simply lift your knees. All right. Then I can go over, lean my body weight, make sure the other one's open. And then in this way, we now have the pelvis rotated up, which means that I've got easy penetration from here. So there's no barriers because her pelvis is open and that makes it much easier for us to both lock in and get a rhythm. Mistake number four for men is related to the way that they vary their strokes. So as I was saying earlier, most guys are guilty of the only pumping and I've given you some alternatives in terms of undulation. But then we want to start to think about how do we create, let's say like a musical phrasing or some variation in the style of penetration that we're doing. Because as I mentioned before, if we're only doing the one thing, pumping, then this gets fatiguing and boring. Same thing can be the case where if I'm only doing these kind of undulations and rockings at this slow pace, this will add a lot of variation sensation will be interesting and different, but if I'm only doing that for 5, 10, 15 minutes, this will also get boring. So you want to start to think about what is the different shifts in intensity that I can take the woman through. So let's say early on I put in doing slow penetration, maybe I've tilted her hip back here to allow me to get these rocks, remembering that I don't want her to be jerking around or bucking against me, so in this case I'm taking control, so I might be doing this for some time to engorge and open the pussy, and then at some point I grip in to the butt and I start to elongate my strokes. So then the variation here is still the same slow pace in this case, and think of this as Lego blocks, there's no specific sequence that I need to follow, but there's lots of options. So I can go from these longer strokes, and I've still got this rotation, which means the end of the cock now is maneuvering in circles or these waves near the entrance to the pussy, I can pull her out, I can start to do stretching strokes where I basically rotate my cock like a spiral in and out, then putting in a deep stroke and pulling her into me for example, so that she's had all that suction created, this expectation because I haven't been fully penetrated, and then I give her a slow long one, then maybe I grip in to a secure hold position, gripping around the hip, gripping around back muscles, gripping around the front of the pelvis, around the neck, so there's these different holds that I can get into for these dominance moments, and then I can start doing more of these bouncing, and sure, there'll be a time when she's open and wet and ready for it, and I am doing long pumping strokes or hard jack hammering, but again, that's something that I'm going to be doing for an intense moment, whatever that is, 30 seconds or so, maybe if we're building her close to orgasm for example, but I'm still alternating here where I'm doing long hard strokes, deeper, let's say less movement, but still heavy strokes, and then I might again shift back into some more of these undulations. Shifting into different positions, different positions work better for different types of strokes, so lying her down, transitioning smoothly here with my body weight, as long as I have some flexibility and rotation in my hips, which is very important for a man sexually, then there's lots that I can do from here, because I can get these drop strokes where I'm basically dropping my weight into her, pumping hard, I can come in, get these rolls, I can intensify things by for example tilting her hips up, so being aware that I can maneuver her pelvis in pretty much any position to make it deeper penetration for example, so lie flat again, reaching in underneath, lift your ass up, tilting up, so now I've got this deeper penetration, shifting up onto my knees for example, here, this doesn't work as well for my undulations, but it works extremely well for these kind of hard fucking moments, and easy for me to have dominance holds as well, whereas if I take her down into spooning, putting my hand under her pelvis, locking her into me and rolling with her, this tends to then work for opening the pussy out and then I can get these deeper, longer strokes here, or I can, you know, gripping hard and do more of the hard strokes, shifting and alternating. Now in this demonstration I'm speeding things up, you can certainly spend a lot more time with each of these strokes, but what you want to be really aware of is what are the waves of sensation I'm taking her through. I'm taking her through hard, intense moments, and then I shift more into my intimacy, frequency, rolling with her, maybe then I get her to undulate her hips with me, then shifting smoothly into whatever position from here, into this side scissors, also a really good position for this kind of hard fucking, but because I'm upright, my body weight is stable over the midline, it means that I don't have to use very much effort at all, right? There's none of this bad kind of calisthenics or this extra movement that's unnecessary. Instead, my body weight's here and I've got these tilts getting deep penetration or, you know, slowing down, taking these wave-like strokes like this. You start to blend all that together, you'll have a very happy lady. Tip number four for women is criticizing instead of encouraging. Is that it? Yeah, that's it. Just know how you do it. Ow, that's annoying. Men are often very sensitive about their sexual performance. If I criticize him harshly, he will lose his confidence and probably his erection. Instead give me what is instructive, sexy, and supportive. I love it if you go slower and deeper. Like this? A little slower? Yeah, that's it. Let me show you how I want to be touched, soft and gentle. The final mistake that both men and women can certainly be guilty of, but mostly men are the ones doing this, is being the silent ninja assassin of the bedroom, right? So that looks like, even if I'm doing like crazy passionate stuff, I'm just completely silent, which means my breath is shallow and I'm not vocalizing and expressing myself. Trust me on this, that women love to actually hear the man. So the way you can start to introduce that, if you feel like this is a bit cheesy or lame or you're a bit embarrassed about it, is just by increasing your breath to start with, right? So if I just take deep breaths in and breathe out through the mouth, right? So a sigh, essentially, this is a certainly better than the completely silent. And then I can build that up by adding a little bit of a moan or growl or hum on my exhale. And women love this. Why? Uh, because it makes me feel like you're enjoying my body, like you're an animal. Like I'm a bit of an animal. And this is what it should be because sex is animalistic, right? It's not formal. It's not something where we're trying to be as polite as possible. It's where we want to express our animal sexual nature, right? So taking control and I don't have to do it every breath, right? It's not the, in the porn movie where the guys, every single breath, cause yeah, that does get cheesy and uncomfortable. And often the woman doesn't want to vocalize that much either. But I just need to think of it as a, as a part of my awareness of the whole sexual experience, especially when, you know, let's say I've built up to a heavy moment and then I hold. All right. Letting her know that she's giving me pleasure is highly validating for the woman. Same for the ladies. Letting him know that he's turning you on. Men love to hear sighs and moans. It makes you feel like he's a sex god.
