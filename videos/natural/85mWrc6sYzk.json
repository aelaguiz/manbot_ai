Now today, as part of the exciting promotion for the launch of the Marshall Meditation Method, which is out now, I decided to interview my lizard Vince on what it's like to be living in a pure Zen state of bliss all the time. And I also decided that I was going to invite my real human friend along, Shea Matthews, to discuss some of the finer points of meditation, its interface into your lifestyle, sexuality, relationships, worthiness, and a whole bunch of other stuff. Really, we just had some ideas and we thought we'll just chat about them and see where they go because once Shea and I start ranting, it gets deep. So let's begin. Shea, how you doing? I'm good, man. Thanks for having me. Looking forward to a good old chat? A good old rant with Shea in our shorts on a hot summer's night. So we were having a chat earlier about like meditation in relationship to everything other than being a monk. So meditation that is functional, practical, and how that works with being a man who has ambition, who is worldly, who wants to pursue women and possibly wealth and fame and success and other things like that. And so I thought it'd be cool if we chat about some of your ideas in terms of mission, purpose, the alignment of your spiritual practices with your worldly practices. So I guess my first question for you is, what is the function in your opinion of meditation? Because there's a lot of buzz about meditation. People say you should do it, you know, do 20 minutes a day. And I think a lot of the time people think, well, why do you do that? Well, it's to kind of be calm, right? Or it's some religious thing. So what in your opinion is the effect, the function, the purpose of meditation for a guy in the modern world? So it's a good question. I think that meditation provides an opportunity for turning your awareness back upon yourself. So then you can transform the typical kind of process of your outward focus that is engaged in the world, your senses, your mental and emotional kind of frameworks, which we'll get to are a necessary part of your experience. But to also bring your awareness back to what is the underlying function of your perception itself. And of course that has many different tones and many different functions. Like on its simplest, most mainstream level, it's like, you know, just use mindfulness. Be in the now. Bridges and breath awareness. Very functional, very useful, but you know, I think it's very powerful to be able to do things like using awareness, using relaxation, using breath to be able to shift your state into a more calm and functional kind of mental state. Usually by essentially shifting the points of concentration, right? So instead of having your concentration into like an agitated idea and holding tension in your body, you're shifting your focus to, okay, to my breath or to relax my body. And it's often really, it's just moving the focus of the mind, which can produce profound effects. Absolutely. Absolutely. So if we're looking at it in terms of on a fundamental level, it's really a focus shifting tool. And then as we get more advanced with it, then it starts to become a focus shaping tool. So it can take on more of an advanced function. So perhaps after you learn how to be mindful and to settle the mind, then it might be more about directing focus for a particular kind of intent. And as we talked about, you addressed that, I mean, there's often either the kind of, you know, the easy stereotype kind of views of meditation, that it's either like something that you do to like look Zen and, you know, tick off your 10 minutes of meditation for the day, or it's something that you do because you're a religious fanatic or you're into some kind of voodoo or whatever. Whereas the truth is that there's a lot of gray zones in between that in, if the fact is that meditation is obviously very functional, it's very useful, it's very scientifically grounded. And, and it gives the user a range of, yeah, positive like feedback and, and useful kinds of insights depend no matter where they're at on the level of their path. And it very much sort of depends on how you're directing yourself towards the practice. So I guess you could say it's one of these practices where what you put in is similar to what you get out. It's a lot about how you're setting yourself up towards the frame of the meditation, so that you're approaching it with the right kind of attitude. Because say, for example, as you know, it can be, can be easy to go and do meditation because you think it's the cool thing to do, or because you think you need to do it, or because you've been told to do it or whatever. Whereas there's very big difference between, you know, going into an experience as a kind of a, I guess a passive tourist trying to like do it because you think it's what you need to do, as opposed to an engaged adventurer or someone who's curious, who's really like has a curiosity and a desire. I think when you talked earlier about the insights that you gain, and you said that there's obviously a vast array of levels of what that insight might be. I think really when people see their first glimpses, they get their first insights, that that's usually the first impetus to lock meditation in as something that you see, okay, this is a lifelong tool. And like those first insights might be really simple, kind of gross, like, or like obvious things such as you hold tension in part of your body. And then because you've been so stuck in your head and not consciously aware of it, you've held pain and tension for years. And then changing that totally changes your life. The difference between this and this is pain and relaxation. So, you know, that can be one simple but profound insight. And then, you know, as the layers go deeper, it can be starting to have the function of stepping back from what you perceive to be your identity, your ego, your opinions, your personality, and starting to look at yourself from a more objective perspective, which I think is something we'll talk about in a little bit. But yeah, I think it's really important to see that when you meditate, it's not just a thing to basically just calm the surface level of how you're feeling right now. It's like, you know, if I'm a bit angry or something and I meditate and I feel a bit less angry, that's good. I mean, that has that, it will have that function, but there's many more benefits to this. And it doesn't pay dividends years down the track. It pays them pretty much immediately and then continues to stack them. And some of them are not obvious too, because some of them are things like dealing with pain or dealing with boredom or frustration or distraction, because those things are common when you're meditating. And it's very easy to think, I'm a bad meditator. It's like, I'm bored and I hate this, so I'm shit at this, so I shouldn't do it. So I think the insights come, some of them are like, oh, that's really pleasant or that really affects me in a good way straight away, and some of them are unpleasant. But learning to start to be more objective and understand that, okay, this is a lesson, not just a, it's not just something I should be angry at or reacting to, it's actually a lesson in becoming less reactive. Absolutely. Well, I mean, it's a, it's a, an incubator, an amplifier for experience, you know. I mean, in many ways, it's one of the oldest and most trusted devices for that. And it's interesting because, I mean, once again, we could go off into a lot of conversation about, you know, the dissatisfaction of the ego and the desire for the self to be like constantly engaging in various levels of, you know, desire and fulfillment and worthiness and engagement and significance and, you know, various levels of needs and stuff, which is very biologically founded and in many ways socially supported and has its kind of place within the grand ecosystem of existence. But at the same time, as we're talking about that, there's also this kind of deeper thing of really engaging with, yeah, what is, what is the underlying essence that's behind the system and then also to be able to functionally work with it in a, in a useful kind of way. And I think that, that that can really set up a foundation for so much more in your life over the long run, of course, like you said, and I very much agree with what you said, like it's like a fractal, a fractal practice that through the practice will show you so many aspects of your own microcosmic dealings with the world and can unravel, it's like a lot of things and in many ways it's a very patient practice in the sense that, and I'm talking about more traditional meditation in the sense of like mindfulness, vipassana, kind of like bringing your awareness into the body and opening yourself to the pure state of mind. It's a very forgiving and a very patient practice in the sense that if you wish to partake in the stubbornness of your own suffering and the difficulty of your own ego, then you can sit on the cushion and do that as long as you want, in the sense that it's, you know, nothing necessarily bad is going to happen, you just, it's kind of a way to like calm the ego by just tiring it sometimes, you know, by observing it and being with it, and I know, for example, and I'm sure you can relate, some of my, well definitely, most of my best sits were my most uncomfortable sits in the in the sense that, you know, of course it feels, I feel like a hero when I sit and I'm comfortable and I'm just in the zone and I'm having fun, like I'm in this kind of like Zen Star Wars state of perfection in my like, in my stream of consciousness, connecting to masterful threads of awesomeness. Yeah, I want that. How much does that cost? So yeah, sometimes, sometimes I have those kinds of sits and other times you have the sits where, I mean, I'm itchy and I'm like uncomfortable and I don't want to be there and I'm sweating or whatever and I just like, I'm thinking about a million other things and I have to constantly bring my mind back and settle myself and calm and like practice, practice, practice, and if I'm sincere in my practice of really just trying to stay there, even though I'm feeling unsettled, then I'll find that there's definitely a really positive compounding effect of settling that then echoes out of that practice. So even though the hour that I might sit or the half an hour that I might sit might feel really like agitated, the three, four, five, or even day after three, four, five hours or a day afterwards feels much more like soft and open and relaxed typically. Right, and I guess within the Vipassana tradition they talk about that as the unraveling of sankaras or reactions, so that something like sitting there and feeling frustrated, so frustration is not like a biological urge so much, it's not like things went in my liver and created frustration, it's that frustration is my mind's expectation of what it wants to do or be right now and it's not getting that and so there's agitation within the body and it's a practiced response and it doesn't just happen when you sit cross-legged for 40 minutes, it happens you know in traffic or whatever, but the point being in meditation is like it's not just for that 40 minutes or hour or whatever that you're supposed to feel like bliss and then you go about your day, it's that you're going in there like a mechanic and like tinkering around and scientifically observing what are you like, what is it that you actually do because I think one of the you know most profound things you get from meditation as I said before is that perspective where you step back and observe the thing instead of you know being inside the character, you step back and go okay that's my character playing out, it's repeated habitual patterns, the location might change, the violence of it might change or whatever but okay that's met my frustration and so within the seat you get to observe the process of how your frustration appears, what it does and then what it effect it tries to have on you, it's like okay you feel the stuff and then it makes you want to scream and shout or jump up or you know do whatever frustrated thing you do is which then kind of releases that frustration and then it then you change the situation you get up and walk away and then it calms down and then you've repeated that, you've reinforced that so now that's okay yeah that's how I deal with frustration every single time whereas when you're doing those deep sits and you're in the pain in your knees or they're like fuck this I don't want to be here or I'm never going to get anywhere or any of those frustrations that are playing out in your mind and even if it's just for moments where you step back and like you see you know it's like a ghost coming out of the body just watches this thing shouting at itself and then you let it do its thing and it starts losing power and dissolving even a little bit and so the frustration was a seven instead of a ten uh and in that moment you you're in there as the mechanic and you change the direction of where this energy flows yep and I mean there's a huge amount of things that are positive uh that that come about from those processes like rehabituating thought rehabituating focus rehabituating emotions re-establishing different foundations for potential neurochemistry um because I think the thing that is often misunderstood and it's something that's important to bring into the conversation is this is the idea is not just about being mindful it's about being uh resourcefully mindful because it's one thing to be aware that you're that you're shit you know or that you feel shit or that life is shit okay and that okay that may be one step removed from just being like the pure you know in the gutter you know experience of it but then the next level is to recognize your position like you say to recognize that you're you're able to observe your position but then to be able to see it from somewhat of a resourceful light so it's kind of like this position of like and that's the whole point in my opinion in terms of like one of the real jewels or virtues or you know benefits of meditation practice is that as you really start to yield the benefits from actually doing like true practice rather not just like sitting there trying to look like you meditate but like really doing the self-inquiry you will start to reveal increasing amounts of evidence of the transparency of self you'll start to reveal increasing factual felt sense knowing inside your body that this story of self and this engagement of thoughts and feelings and all the karmic patterns and all the rest it will start to become unraveled even if it's just for a few moments when you're able to kind of see it clearly before it catches you again and then you're back in the trigger of the of the machine getting pulled around for a while but the point is that every time you kind of step out and you observe the nature of your suffering and you kind of get it just even if it's for a few moments like i said the more you start to catch these uh little sparks of of choice and liberation then that can start to move the mind in a different direction and of course then we start to open up the conversation of like okay you've learned how to sit still for 10 minutes you've learned how to breathe and relax and calm the mind now you've learned how to kind of observe your mind now you've learned how to observe your mind with resourcefulness now let's move towards liberation whatever that is like if that means like uh you know for some people that's cultivating some level of power in their body for example so it might be like cultivating some chi pathways and opening up channels of health and well-being or like as you know with qigong like working up working the alignments of the different aspects of self so that you can have a kind of an opening of higher capacity or whatever so that's one aspect of a meditation practice or even think of it even more simply it's just like it's a machine where all the pieces work together right just like you know because if your body's doing one thing your mind is doing the other thing then your focus is split so you know good qigong on one level i mean it has many levels is is simply like okay everything is is is together right now thought feeling movement uh breath focus and so therefore you're getting like this full immersion experience of being present and here right now absolutely synchronizing and it's like synchronizing self you know and because once again it's one of these side effects that i i perceive it from my practice and i've seen in other people that practice consistently as you as like i said you yield this uh increasing knowing of selflessness Self, selfingness, you know, so you move away from this notion that self is a static object or that there is some like little man that lives in your head who somehow like keeps all the script of your story and pushes all the buttons and pulls the levers and knows who you are because, you know, that's yourself. So there's that kind of notion as we're moving away from that and more into the realization and the direct experience of I am change. Everything is changed. My thoughts change. My feelings change. My emotions change. The assemblage points of my identity can shift. The assemblage points of my perception can shift. My experience around me is shifting. And then starting to go into more of an engaged openness to that relationship. And once again, there's different tones of that. I mean, there's kind of like a, there is a kind of an intellectual way of doing that, which is also, I mean, that's a good way to break things down sometimes to see the kind of emptiness of things from an intellectual position. But then there's also the feeling place of that, of like noticing the interconnected emptiness of things. And there's an interesting, yet again, it's an interesting kind of space to start to enter into and opens up once again, a lot of big conversations. But the point is that I think as people go into more of that direct sense of spaciousness, the direct feeling of the true knowing of who they are, then the potentials and the dynamics of changing your basic, your paradigm of operating who you are and how the world works can start to become very different. Because you start to realize things like, oh, I exist in the idea of somebody who has to do these things to get these things, but I'm not actually that story. And therefore, if I'm not actually that story, even though I might have to abide by that story now for a period of time, it is actually okay for a part of me to kind of detach and go exploring and see what else is possible. Because maybe I can be something I've never been before. I've just never considered it, you know? And I mean, obviously that has very, very practical applications. We see this with students all the time. They come in to learn how to pick up girls and then come out meditating and quitting their jobs or suddenly realizing that they need to shift some aspect of themselves or they need to go and explore something that they've always thought was not them. Because even just giving someone the internal, not just intellectual, but as you've said, experiential permission to be other than they've always been, to realize that, ah, okay, so you've practiced a whole bunch of patterns for your entire life and you got really good at them to the point where you've convinced yourself and everyone else around you that that's what you are permanently. And the only thing that changes is you get older or get richer or get, you know, know a few more things about that thing that you already are. And then, and that's like, that roadmap locks people into a lifetime of whatever that is. And it might be good. I mean, sometimes it locks people into things, which was a good life, but it wasn't really a chosen life. It was one that was conditioned and scripted to them. And then they practiced it enough that they didn't need anyone else to help them to remember the lines. And then they do that forever. And really what we are, you know, this company has always been about is acknowledging that conscious change is really difficult because when you practice stuff, breaking, breaking very deep seated old patterns that have all of this extraneous stuff that's points back at you and says, you are that. And deciding to let whatever percentage of that go, and then start to stretch out and experiment with different lifestyles, different relationships, different career paths, different ideologies or lack of ideologies, like being able to just go, well, maybe I don't need to have a, like a all definitive ideology that describes every aspect of the world. I can just like start to explore through the world and see what mindsets might be useful as opposed to ones which are rigidly true and all others are false. You know, so all of these things and it starts to just pull a plug out of one thing and often creates a cascade where people start to then go, okay, well, it's a question everything because then you become, then change becomes something that is almost, well, once you've opened that door, then it all becomes inevitable because all you can do is either try and shut the door and go deeply back into your ignorance or your one solsticistic viewpoint, which is pretty hard to do when you've seen outside of it, or you have to follow that rabbit hole, I would say. Well, I guess, I mean, there's two, there's another interesting way to look at meditation. Like you can, you could do meditation practice from the perspective of, of it's like ego directed meditation. So you could say like, I'm meditating because I want to refine my ego. I'm meditating because I want to achieve a more perfected ego. And there's definitely truth to the sense that like, you know, if you want to be a disciplined, focused, willful person, sitting, meditating, emptying your mind, like, you know, directing yourself with intention towards certain contemplative aims and doing things, I mean, that can be very beneficial to helping develop character, helping develop your egoic process. But then there does also come a point in any true meditative practice where you have to go beyond that ego structure. And that is definitely like, it's like a quantum leap in perception, especially the first few times that you do it, because it's a very, uh, seemingly foreign, threatening and alienating, um, uh, understanding to start to take on board because it doesn't exist in, doesn't exist inside the egoic construct. So maybe it's almost like you have to allow yourself to lose your mind, but keep your sanity in this process. And as you allow yourself to lose your mind, but keep your sanity, then you start to reinforce this feedback loop of, it's okay for me to operate in this place that it, it is not founded on the mind's, uh, possession or control or domination of reality. It's undefined. And it's, and so you, you don't have control in that space, but learning to be kind of exist within a chaotic space allows for all these possibilities. And I think what can start to happen exactly is, is you start to get these kinds of fuzzy edges in the sense that, uh, and, and I would say it's, it's almost like a sense of resourcefulness. Like you start to open up a lot of these subtle pathways of exchange and understanding and feeling and trust and, uh, and it also very much depends on what you start doing with your practice. For example, if you're doing a very like cold, rigid, simple kind of like empty mindfulness practice to just see the pure like nature of your mind, then you may have some very deep and clear insights about the nature of yourself, but you may not necessarily have very rich heart opening experiences because you might not be cultivating that particular aspect. And that's certainly, I can relate to that. That was most of my practice in my twenties was looking at, I wasn't really interested, I wasn't interested in happiness or bliss or like tantric connection or something. I was really interested in truth. And so like all my sitting was Vipassana and Zen and it was focused in on emptiness, observation of reality, trying to break through into a like, yes, an ego-less or self-less understanding of everything. Yeah. Yeah. So it's like, it's a very, it's a very austere and kind of lofty goal and it doesn't take into account a lot of humanness, which is something I was interesting to me as I explored different types of meditation because I was often fairly rigid with my styles early on because I was a purist. I was like, okay, you follow a tradition, you commit to it and you follow it to its conclusion. But as you and I went on different adventures around trying out different methodologies, we came to see that there are different ways of meditating that have very specific functions in opening communication or opening your heart or sexually opening. So yeah, there's a lot of functions. But I think in order to reach those points, you really need a solid foundation in all of the, I mean, you need to be able to concentrate and you need to be able to have enough quiet in your mind. It's not that you need to have totally empty mind for an hour, like good luck, but being able to like step back from the noise and direct your mind to do certain things or to focus on your breath for long enough that you can create a rhythm and so on, which then builds the stamina and the integral skills that you need to then take these things further. And ideally we'll set up foundations in your ability to sit and to be stable and to be able to maintain focus and to also to have distinction in your mind between, you know, there is thought happening, but I don't have to be engaged in that thought. There is the emotion happening. I don't have to be engaged in that emotion. So then there can also be this, uh, this new thing which starts to happen where your will starts to be liberated from the experience of the thoughts and feelings and the feedback. And then you, because, because once you separate that will or that observer, that kind of creative aspect of your perception, then you can also start moving into, well, what do I want to do instead? That's actually like the resourceful part. So it's kind of like, cool, I can, I can, I can see that I'm suffering now on some level, but there's a part of me that sees that I'm suffering and a part of me that sees that I'm suffering is also resourceful. And as I'm resourceful, what would I like to give the part of me that is suffering or how would I change the situation from a position when I'm suffering? And you do start to get into some very interesting ideas because in many ways, if you want to start to explore deeper philosophical concepts or metaphysical concepts, um, or other kinds of practical spiritual systems that are, that are more about, uh, directing consciousness for purpose for whatever that is, whether it be to make belief changes or it means to like trying to create effects in the world or to have influence. Yeah, well you get more, yeah, you got the more extremes, like, you know, people seeking to kind of do, um, you know, extreme acts or whatever, but there's a lot of subtle levels that, uh, that are very real, like for example, uh, learning how to enter and work with your own landscape, your own inner landscape, like an understanding what is your own inner landscape. And if you've never done any of that kind of work, then it'll be just kind of a bit of a mess of unstable kind of imagination. But as you start to engage with your imagination more and you start to understand more of these internal frameworks, then you do start to engage in a different kind of language and internal languages, subconscious language, and you can get to points where you are able to shift things inside yourself quite profoundly from another sort of place. So instead of like, instead of looking at the world in the terms of like what a lot of people do, which is like, I've got some problems in the third dimension, so therefore I need to arrange a bunch of things in the third dimension to like fix my problem. Instead, what if I go into the root of what's the, the underlying kind of reflection of it on the higher dimension or the fourth dimension or the fifth dimension or whatever. So I'll go into myself and I'll work on what's my, what's my relationship to this, this expression and it's happening in the world. And it's kind of running on this theory, which is an interesting theory that in some how, some way thought and consciousness and human experience is like some kind of holographic projection. And that's not a new idea, man. That idea has been around in Tantra. It's been around even in Zen. This is kind of notion of there's an emptiness and even in the notion that there's a kind of a godliness, you know, like there's this divinity, this connective principle, this loving principle, this abundance principle, this resourceful principle. And I'm a particular fan of the Taoist, yes, definitely. But also like the Tantric kind of view of it's a kind of interconnected emptiness. Like there is a, there is a whole series of very, you know, densely packed, conscious, rich frameworks that are underlying our experience at all times. And when we sit and we meditate, we can start to go into those fields to a degree. We can start to resonate with those fields and different people are ready at different stages. Like some people sit and they really don't have much of an experience. Some people sit and they have like some crazy experience. It's the same with, uh, you know, working with other things like psychedelics even. Some people have very profound experiences. Some people have very calm or subtle experiences. So some people just kind of built to kind of go and some people need to like fire up a little bit more slowly. So you need to just work with what you've got. The point is what I'm saying is you want to get connected to this resourcefulness and then yeah, then we can start to work with our liberation a lot more. We start to work with a lot of these different other faculties and then you can do a lot of different things. I mean, really like the potential of what you can do with consciousness is, is limitless. I mean, you can be working with, like I said, anything from psychological work, for example, like I'm going to rearrange my emotions and my psychology and that's very much like an NLP kind of approach. And I can say that definitely like meditation benefits any NLP because you're able to stably focus your mind and direct things and pay attention. It's very difficult to work with yourself or with anybody if your mind is unstable and can't hold onto concepts or be able to create and conceptualize feelings of concepts. So that's why, you know, sitting, meditating, working with the mind, body frame and the felt sense feedback loops of the mind, body frame with awareness. It's just like, it's so, it makes sense. It's like you're developing skill of your instrument. You're developing like awareness of the glove of your, it's like the body and your mind is like the glove of your soul or your spirit or your awareness or whatever. But it's like, we've got to understand how does that thing work. Yeah. Let's talk about it in terms of the more specific effects in relationship to relationships, men and women. Obviously we're dealing with guys who have levels of fear or anxiety around expressing a sexuality, meeting people, connecting with people, connecting with women. How is it that you think, or everything you've talked about, because we're talking about things from a micro level of, all right, adjusting my breath and adjusting my focus. And now on this big macro levels of what that means in terms of your consciousness, consciousness in relationship to the universe. So now let's boil that down to what does that look like in terms of choice points, adjusting emotional reactions, say dealing with talking to hot girls or being with, being with women that you find intimidating or being in situations where your ego is a defense as in like your bluster or your arrogance or your need to prove yourself overcomes you and ruins things for you or in the opposite end where you shut down completely and hide. How is it that you think these tools of objectivity, of resourceful objectivity of, okay, being able to go, all right, this is what's happening to me, but now what am I going to do with it? How does that interrelate with those topics? Well, it's a good question also, I think, because obviously being a non-reactive and resourceful is a positive in any situation, especially in a context where we're talking about socializing. And there's so many interfaces also yet again, because first of all, we need to talk about the fundamental thing, which is we've already addressed in the sense that you have a perception and an experience of self. And that is something that you're always carrying around with you. And obviously that interfaces with people, that interfaces with women. That is the thing that you use to create relationships out of. So to be working on the understanding of self, refining yourself, improving yourself, like getting calmer inside yourself, becoming more resourceful inside yourself. In some ways you could say, like, it's a kind of a weird paradox of learning to simultaneously see the transparency and the emptiness of self yet simultaneously building the belief in self. So it's like this kind of bizarre thing. And really what I would, and there's no, there's not actually a juxtaposition there. In my experience, it's more like you release the notion of a limited self and you embrace the belief in an unlimited self. And you start to actually directly experience that, which is very difficult for the limited sense of self to kind of understand initially, because it's so used to having."}
