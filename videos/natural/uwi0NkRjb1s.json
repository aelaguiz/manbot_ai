It's amazing chick. I have had one in Kiev just recently and something happened. Like the number just was gone. This one's from Yannick. Hey Yannick, how you doing bro? Yannick was one of the guys who came and did the Warrior Workshop. Was it a year ago? It's time is weird. It was a year? It was last one. It was last one, yeah, yeah. Okay, he says, John, we're meeting a lot of new people. How do you manage and find time for all the follow-ups? That's great. Very simple. Number one, you have to honestly look at when you're actually out there doing it, you have to look at it as a new job because you're actually, besides learning new skills and going out and connecting, it's actually takes up space. It's not just, I met her. That's it, we got it. It's all done now. Now you've opened up a channel, a potential channel, a new connection. New connections are like plants. They need to be watered and all that. And then there's this whole modern world we live in where we have to continue the connection via texting, social media, things like that, so that we can continue the connection to meet again that has a physical connection yet again. So number one is, for me, there's different techniques for me. I'm not Mr. Organized. I'm not that tech savvy. So for me, I just take a screenshot. As soon as I meet someone, I take a screenshot on my iPhone and that time stamps it for me. Okay, so let's say we're really going crazy. We're out here. Today we went out five, 10, whatever, two, three. And then it's like, you think you'll remember their names, but you didn't. So you take the time in that moment to put their name in the phone, screenshot it, whether it's, if you take an Instagram, screenshot it. And then let's say 20 minutes later, you meet someone else. Same thing, screenshot it. Maybe if you really are forgetful, you can write down two or three things about them. And I'll do this when I save the phone number, like Johanna of such and such place, or Johanna who loves yoga and has beautiful blue eyes. Now I got two things that I can bring in the first text. So I might have already an idea for the first text comes to me based on something we talked about or connected over, then I'll bring it in, right? Johanna, the crazy belly dancer. I never met her, but that sounds good. So you'll maybe make a couple of notes about the girl. And then you just have to continue following up. Now, the truth is some days you'll have home runs and almost everybody will get back to you. And some days nobody will. And most of the time it's somewhere in between. So part of being someone who connects with a lot of people there's people coming and going all the time and some things stick and some things don't because there's just so many reasons for that. So, but your job is to meet them, follow up with them and get them out again. And then prioritize them. So if you're really doing well and you have multiple dates per week, and that is the idea is that you have abundance like crazy. Then you start to become the chooser. And now you're not just the guy who's chasing around tail, but you're a guy who's playing his part in nature, taking the risk and getting his reward. And now you can say, you know what? This girl's really hot. This girl's really hot, but a girl A has similar interests and she's really easy to talk to. And we just have a good vibe. And girl B is, you know, she's hot, but she's kind of like, we're just not connecting. Then all of a sudden you prioritize girl A. And now it's like, I'm gonna- And also who's more down to fuck. You're like, well, this one's awesome, but this one wants to bang now. Yeah, exactly. And I'm only here for three days or whatever, right? So, but let's say you're wanting to get your, like getting to that point where you're like, you know what? I actually want to get a relationship. I do actually want to have kids. I do actually want to do that. Then you would start to say, well, wow, like I'll give you an example of there's a guy named Bill who we went out, we worked together. Bill was young, handsome, and rich. And he just hadn't been social his whole life. And so we unlocked those doors. And then next thing you know, he was, he met a really hot Brazilian girl in the Whole Foods. Whole Foods, if you guys don't know, it's just a cool, or used to be a cool organic place to shop, right? Now it's more of an Amazon warehouse. So at the time, in a Tay Day, he picked her up in aisle four. She had the greatest ass anyone in the world has ever seen. And they started dating and fucking and having great sex. And then he met another girl who was more, you know, more like beautiful and cute and adorable, but more of a mother type. And Bill, who was a great mathematician, did the math. He crunched the numbers and he came back with, one girl is going to be the girl I'm going to have a family with. And the other one's just going to be, we're going to bang, and then she'll probably end up banging somebody else. So he went with the one girl and made a family. And that's because that's what he wanted to do. And I tell his story because so many guys don't want to do that, but so many guys do. And you don't want it to happen to you. He created so much abundance that he chose. I don't know, seven, eight years later, he literally has five kids and that wife. And he has a lot of money, like I said, some nannies and things like that. And that's what he wanted to do. It's not like my parents and maybe your parents that they just happen to have kids because society told them, or they got knocked somebody up and now they have to go to work. He, and this is the kind of guys we all want to be in this room. He chose the life he wanted to live. So, so that's just, I kind of took that to another level, but ultimately that comes down to the priority part of connecting with them based on qualifications. What are you qualifying for? Am I qualifying for banging tonight? Am I qualifying for banging in two weeks? Am I qualifying for an actual girlfriend? Or am I qualifying most of the time? Let's be honest, we're qualifying for all three and we'll take the one for the night and the one in three days. And if there's a girlfriend material and I'm open to that at this time in my life, I'm gonna do what I can to plan that too. Yeah, I mean, from my perspective in terms of like time management with contacts, like I, and that screenshot thing is really important because I've had a number of times where you got the number, it's amazing chick. I have had one in Kiev just recently and something happened. Like the number just was gone. No, you just- A nightmare. Yeah. And if she was, ah, I don't wanna think about it now cause she was so, yeah, it was just gone. So yes, screenshot every fucking, every number on Instagram you get. In terms of the time management stuff, like when you meet many, many, many people and especially someone like me is a bit of an introvert. I don't wanna hang around people all the time. You can't keep all contacts. Whether they're networks or friends, you're all like proto friends, could be friends or lovers. When it's with girls, yeah. When I'm going to Kiev today, I'll write a list of like my girls that I know that I'm banging, the girls that are works in progress. And then I prioritize them. Like I put a, whatever, a tick next to the one with the ones with the biggest tits and the hottest ones. And then the one that's, and then I might write some note. Okay, this one definitely wants to have a threesome. So we got to prioritize her. And then, yeah, like by hotness and availability and so on. So I do a bit of that just so I've got a note of like, keep some basic track of it. When it comes to like my business contacts or whatever, I try to, and I don't always do this, but it's like when the person, when I remember that person, I send him a message. Now again, I don't do this all the time, but that is a habit. That's something that Liam really kind of instilled in me was anytime we'd be talking about something and someone would be brought up and we'd be like, oh, we should do a something with that guy. He's like, let's call him now. It was always now. And I'd be like, well, hang on, we need to think about, let's just call him and see how he's going. Liam would just have that habit of the moment something came up, he'd call the person or we'd get started on the thing and you get the person on the phone and often something would come out of that or it was just a good, it was good we had a check in, you know, how to catch up and that person's still in the loop. So yeah, if you keep that in as a general thing, sure, like if you're a meticulous networker, then you would totally, and especially when it's talking about lifestyle design or business career stuff or breaking into social scenes and so on. If you're in the early stages, like Keegan and I can afford to be pretty lazy with this stuff now because we will always have too many contacts. We always have too many opportunities. We can't deal with them all. So it might be a bit more like, oh, who's the one I'm thinking of now? Or what's the one I feel like doing? But when you're trying to build your social world, yeah, I mean, I remember back in the early pickup days, I had, I would write lists of girls and I would track each lead until it disappeared, until I got her or I didn't get her. You know, I was aware of, very aware of the people I was trying to, with music for me, it was music, like I had the list of the band bookers in town. I'm like, okay, I've got to contact that guy and then write a note to call him in a week and see if he's got the CD. And so those things where you don't have as many opportunities as you need, then you need to be more meticulous with it. And we've covered this at length in the LDA course about how to make contact, how to follow up with people. That one phone call is just, that's just a start. We need to build relationships. We need to maintain them. And then if you keep that general thing in your mind, it's like, when you think of someone, send them a voicemail. I was at that restaurant where we were hanging out the other day and I remembered something we did. I just want to check in. How are you doing? What's going on? For me, I've been doing blah, blah, blah. You know, let's do a call. Let's do a call in the next two days, right? And punch back. And sometimes a person does and they don't. And then you make a time and you actually get on the call with them. So yeah. What's up, gentlemen? I hope you enjoyed that clip from mine and John Keegan's webinar.
