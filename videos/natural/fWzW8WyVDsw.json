I'm so fucking sick and tired of answering the question, how do I get over the fear of going to talk to a girl? I think in some ways that's like an integral wound that a man kind of has to have. Someone like Iron John talks about that from receiving your original wound from your father, which sets a man off on his path to essentially heal and go through his warrior's journey and eventually reconcile with his internal father and then transcend him. But I think that that also exists in terms of women. It's like all of us have got one or two or a series of women that we didn't get, that was a disaster and really heartbreaking and really difficult to go through at the time, but without that would not have set you on the path. Now I've got a question about that because many, many men have had their wound, but they have then interpreted that in ways that led them to resenting women or to wanting to conquer them or to retreating, retreating from them altogether, uh, you know, or, or creating a buffering ideology that kind of explains away why things are and means that they don't have to have responsibility for it and so on. So I'm wondering why you didn't do that and how it was that you recognize that the issue was you in some ways, or it was like there was things you had to change and, and parts of your pride or ego you had to drop. What was that process like? Was it easy for you? Was it really difficult? And where did that fit into your journey? That's a great question. You know, like, um, I was so lost and alone and I mean, I've got some horror stories I could tell guys for weeks about those days, you know? Tell one, tell one quick, tell one quick knee jerking sob. Okay, I will. Knee jerking sob, sorry. If you saw the movie Hitch where Will Smith is this guy and you know, he's this dating goat sort of thing and then he flashes back to his college days or his university days and he's this dorky guy and he's dating this girl and, and, and she gets into a car and with this cool guy and he's crying with his braces like this and he's crying, I'll be there for you. I understand you have to go and see, but I'll be there for you. I watched that in movie theater and I was like this, I could, because I did the exact same thing. But I love you. I love you. What did I do wrong? Just tell me what I did wrong. Dude, you're doing it right now. The girl that I was dating, and that's embarrassing to say it, but it's true, she's getting on the back of a motorcycle of this cool guy and I'm there weeping, I mean like 20 years older than that, and I'm weeping and saying, I understand, but I'm, you'll recognize, go with this guy, but you'll recognize, you'll come back because I'm the good guy and, and I will always be there for you and I will never let you down. And I'm weeping and, and the guy in the motorcycle is going, who's this loser? He's just like, I don't know, just go, go, go, go. Is that your little brother or something? Okay. Oh my goodness. By the way, I'm going to fuck you in a minute. She's like, I know. Cool. It, it was so brutal, man. And that was my whole thing. So I got, yeah, there you go. There's one sob story. Right. Okay. So how did, how was it that that didn't turn you into a bitter woman hating or jock hating dude? How was it that you processed that? You know, I got asked the question a couple of years ago, which kind of set me back on my heels because I'd never been asked before. And the question was this, I don't know why I was never asked it, but the question was this, in all those years of massive pain and insecurity and loss and loneliness, pure loneliness, I was like, you know, did you ever think of giving up? And I'm like, wow, wow, what a question. And I never once ever, ever thought of giving up. I said, no, if other men have got this figured out, I have to figure it out too. I'm going to. So I became the student, you know, the student of life and student of observation. Like one of my highest skill sets is I really know the way a room is about to flow. Could be a, could be a club. It could be a party. It could be a lounge. It could be whatever. I know who likes who. I know who's going to about to position himself over there, who's going to go and talk to that girl. The girls are going to migrate this way. So you position yourself like, like a chess game. I can see it all. It's because I stood in observation of these social scenes for years and just watched and watched and watched and watched, went home alone. But I watched and said, you know, this guy straightens his ties and go talk to that girl. What is the energy? What is that? What is transpiring here? I want to know. What do you have your seduction Spidey sense on? And the thing is, in order to, in order for that to work, you actually have to drop your own ego because as an observer, you become scientific about it in the sense that you see that it's cause and effect. And is it the words that caused or is it the demeanor? Is it the posture? Is the, okay, you start seeing that one thing leads to another and then it can't be about you anymore. It can't be about like, oh, it's my, you know, my feelings. She should have, why do they always get to, and it becomes less of a personal thing. And that's why, as like you, I never, there was never a choice of whether or not I was going to do this. I felt like, yeah, it wasn't like a destiny so much, but it was just like, it was like, I must do this. There is no alternative because I know the alternative is regret. And that's the only thing I can't live with. I can live with a lot of mistakes, but I can't live with proper chunks of regret. I can regret certain actions, but like looking back on a period of my life and going, oh, that five years was a waste. I can't deal with it. So then, and I don't know about you man, but like, and I'm sure someone's going to do it. I'm so fucking sick and tired of answering the question. How do I get over the fear? Like how do I get over the fear of going to talk to a girl, right? Because I've answered that question in every way possible from every angle, from the psychological to the physical, to the fucking deep childhood traumas. Now what, you know, just every single angle covered, but it does come down to that. There is just some men who the answer is obviously like, well, I will, I will talk to her whether or not I do it today or now, or I do it correctly, I must. And that's the answer of like, how do I get over my approach anxiety? It's that, you know, you must. Now, I have an exciting announcement, which is that you're allowed to leave your house not yet, but at some point in the future, you will. And when you do leave the house on that first day, it's my belief that the way you run that first day will be indicative of how you then run the days afterwards. Because if you just fart around and go, oh, cool, we can go outside, oh, well, yeah, cool. I'll go out and chat to a girl or exercise or network, you know, in a few days, I'd say you're kind of lost. Like then the next thing comes along, you're just going to operate the same. So for the guys that on day one want to get out there and get shit moving, I've put together my own personal lifestyle academy. I've been working on this for years actually, but because I've been traveling the world teaching constantly, I haven't actually finished it. And now that I've been in lockdown with the guys, with my think tank and my co-conspirators, we have finalized and put together my, essentially what we've done is looked at the way that I build my lifestyle, all of the operating procedures, the rules, the laws, the networking schematics, the way that I design every aspect of my life. Because even though I do live in chaos and in flow and in the moment, I direct and ride that chaos in a way that a lot of people do not. I've been successful throughout my life, even when I was broke, I was still having fun and getting laid. You know, when I was wealthy, I still had time to myself to connect with women and do the things that I wanted, unlike a lot of other wealthy men. I have been able to make my business grow and grow super lean. I've been able to move from city to country, from social circle to social circle, moving up and down hierarchies. And I've navigated that through not just luck and charm, there was a bit of that, but through my ability to see the matrix of the way humans operate and to align and ally myself with other men and women who understand that too, to multiply our effects. And that's what I'm proposing that we do on this Lifestyle Academy. You will have me on weekly calls as well as a whole set of support architecture that means that you're accountable. It means that you're getting feedback. That means that you are preparing yourself mentally, emotionally, and in terms of your action steps for that day when the doors open and you can walk out on day one and actually make a change in your life instead of just going, Oh, I wish I'd done stuff differently. Oh, we're at, oh, oh, oh, and there's your life goal. So if you'd like to join me on this epic journey, then all you got to do is click the link below, put your email in and what you'll receive immediately is a 90 minute previously unreleased speech, which I gave at the MMC a couple of years ago, where I dive deep into how to unplug from the matrix on all levels, in all metrics. This is a killer talk, which I've been saving for something like this. Some of it was weirdly prophetic. You can pick out the bits that you think. So check that out, put your email in, you get the free video, and then you'll be on the VIP list where I will notify you day by day on the updates of my as yet unnamed Lifestyle Academy. See you next time."}
