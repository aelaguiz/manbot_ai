We've been in this industry for over 10 years and we were talking the other night about our origin stories and how we all met which there's some funny anecdotes and realized that at around the 2006, 2007, 2008-ish mark that all three of us were in different places in different parts of the world independently coming up with free electricity, I mean Daygame and in its kind of natural form all independently not being in contact with each other, not having any like real mentors or anything like that and then went on these separate journeys which eventually led us to combine our forces many years later. So before we get into that origin story, Sasha what's been going on with you lately? Well lately I've taken my evolution to the next level and I just realized that happiness comes from being complete in many areas, so health, wealth, relationships, finding your purpose in life, doing what you're here to do, doing what you came to the planet to do. So I've been working on the Infinite Man Summit and working with men just going a lot deeper you know because just getting it handled in relationships wasn't enough, I'm obsessive and I had to go all the way. So I've been working on that, working on my spiritual journey and yeah just working on myself to be honest. Which has been like a big 180 for you, is 180 where you change directions? 180 is when you change directions. Sometimes like you did a big 360 and like so you didn't do anything, no 180. Yeah, 360. Hey! Actually I do that for the day game, hey ladies! What's up? When we first met you, you were, literally we couldn't have walked down this street and had a conversation. That's right, that's right. You would have talked to every female. If it was a pretty girl I would have to talk to her. Yeah, hello. The first time you guys came and stayed at my house at the time I had a girlfriend, you guys came and stayed with me and you know she had never seen me do anything like approach a girl. All she saw you do was make smoothies and be a nice guy. Yeah and then she knew I coached but then Sasha came and we walked out our door and literally in one block he talked to 10 girls right in front of him. That's how crazy he was about it. What's going on? Is this what my boyfriend does? I was like no, no, he doesn't do it, he taught me, no. I remember that first time, like that was down and out in New York Times back then because it was like, I think we were teaching in one of your workshops and I was like, Sasha you organize some accommodation? You're like, yeah, yeah, of course. I'm going to crash with my buddy John Keegan and I'm like, I know John Keegan, okay cool and then crashing with you meant like you're on your bed and your girlfriend's in your bed because that's where you live with your girlfriend usually and you usually don't have all your friends in the same room. I mean, you know, back in like the 1800s or something maybe you did but no, but then you had me and Sasha sleeping like a small wall, basically like a transparent wall and then just another bed shoved in a tiny little room and you guys right in there and then, well Sasha pitched it as, I'm just going to be, we're just going to be there for a day or two. There was just, what were those sounds? There was just a girl crying every night, I don't know what that was, it was really weird. Sasha and I met in London in 2011, I saw some videos of him beforehand and he was the only guy on the internet at the time who was doing pick up and funny and nice lenses at the same time, I remember like, whoa, it looks like a movie and you were very amusing so I thought if I ever get the chance I'll talk to him and then in 2011 I went to speak at the 21 convention in London, I was in a very bad mood, very depressed, business was bad and I thought if I go to this convention maybe it'll save my business and it did but not in the way I thought and then you were there. That's right, yeah, I saw, I didn't know too much about James, I'd actually seen him years before with another guy he was working with and I saw him do a talk and let's just say I wasn't too impressed at the time but when I saw him in 2011 in London, he did a really good talk and I could tell he really knew what he was talking about and I was like, oh this guy's good, I can see how this guy would get chicks so I went to talk to him and I came up to him all excited like, ah, I love your talk, it's really good, ah, and he just kind of looked at me like, eh, thanks, he was in a kind of like a, I think he was going through like a semi-depression slash, and he's normally stoic so you had those together, he was like, eh. I was trying to be friendly but that was the best I could do. Yeah, yeah, it wasn't too good but yeah, but then that's it so we just became friends then and the rest is, as you say, history. It's funny how we did even cross paths earlier, that you came to, when he was talking about, my original business partner and I pulled off some very dodgy lair talk in London that he, my partner had organised, he was like, dude, we're going to do two days of content and I'm like, we don't have two days of content, he's like, I remember him saying we'll scrape the bottom of the barrel. I was like, right, we're doing a bit of the old scrape-o-walk, yeah, so that's right, you just happened to cross paths, it's like the early base player of. I came in, this was like 2008-ish maybe, I came in and it was near Leicester Square in the centre of London, I just came in, I hung out a bit and I was like, man, this isn't very good, these guys are, he was up there a while, I remember I was like, this is BS and I just left. He was good at waffling and ranting. He was a waffler, yeah. So yeah, then I was staying with a fan somewhere out in the suburbs and then I chatted with Sascha and he said, why don't you come and sleep on my couch and I preferred that idea so I went over and it was kind of like walking into this alternative reality because at the same time, I was living in a house with five dudes, Liam and a bunch of guys and everyone always sat around in their underwear and every business meeting was like 80% jokes and then 20% business and then I rocked up to your house and you had the exact same thing going on, a bunch of dudes in underpants kind of getting their shit together gradually. Yeah, yeah. And I felt quite at home, so yeah, it was beautiful. You got a tea? I got a tea. Okay, so this is the first of many of John Keegan's teas. Yes, beginning of the day. This is how you, this is the John Keegan system for exploring New York City. You have a tea every two miles. Yeah. And then you just roll with it. This lady looking at us in the window, she keeps like doing her makeup and then staring over and now she like looked away. Oh, I don't know where she went. Gone. Hey. Hey. We saw you doing your makeup. I'm trying to get ready for the day. What's going on here? Is there like a big photo shoot in here or something? No, we're not open yet and I feel like shit, so I'm trying to like make myself not feel like shit. Why do you feel like shit? You look so adored. I have a cold and I haven't been off in like six days. And so this is like day six. Yes. What is day game? Day game? Well, like many of these funny things in seduction, it's just putting a name on something that people who are social and know how to communicate have done for eons. We didn't invent day game. The idea of a man looking at or speaking at a woman in the daytime is not our invention. But coming out of the early days of formalized seduction, which was the mystery method stuff and, you know, hypnotizing girls into bed and lots of club stuff and doing a fan of funny tricks and trying to convince them they do. It was considered a revolution. Just coming. No booze. No nothing. I'm an artist. Pick up artist. Just walk up to a girl. They're pretty. Do you want to be my girlfriend? It was crazy. Yeah. Everyone said I was insane. I was like, no, you don't have to do any of that. You don't have to go anywhere. Just go on the street. You have to like convince them that you like their friend and then make them feel weird and then drop their self esteem. It was all this. It's all the systemized BS that you had to do in a specific order and you have to do in a nightclub or a bar. It would never work in the daytime. So and I was like, yes, it will. Without all the shit. Let's just go in the day and do it. So, yeah, everyone thought it was crazy and I always knew that it's going to work. I want to tell you that you are 100% adorable. Thank you. Yes. I live in the hood here. OK. We should flirt sometime. Well, I'm only here Saturday and Sundays. Mm hmm. OK. And where else are you the rest of the time? I work at a bar or karaoke bar in midtown Manhattan. Yeah. So. Yeah. So we'll meet one day before or after your work. We'll have a tea or something. I don't know. What do people do anymore? Yeah. Yeah. All right. Cool. I still remember the first the first piece of content we ever filmed. It was the next morning after we. After our first night together. That's right. And I had my my big camera that I was excited about. So and I was like, let's let's do something from a YouTube channel. You know, you put it on your big snout and you you look younger than less and more. I saw the video the other day, actually, and you look so young and just all the all this travel and all the ejaculations for hours of time. So it's like it's like a drain something out of you. You're like a boy. And yeah, it was and you were very much. It was just very nice. It was really exciting. I just put the camera in your face. It's quite a good chat as well. I remember it was quite good. If a guy's not good with girls, he can't. It's quite difficult for him to be able to move on to the next thing. Yeah. You know, this is this is a vital area. We need to learn how to do this. And then I filmed one and I uploaded it. It's still I think it's still up. And it's called Clip 001 dot MP3. Are you serious? You never renamed it? I didn't know how at the time. I was just like that. That clip of me and Sasha is always just. Oh, that's funny. The most important thing is the energy between me and the girls. Just like having that genuine connection, because I know what I like and I like girls who are fun. I could talk to them and joke around just like I should be able to sit in a room for five hours with a chick and just talk, talk, talk and be and having fun. That's my thing. You have a phone number. And then you probably have Instagram, too. I do. Yeah. And you probably look really good on us. Better than now. Really? Because you look a hundred. I want to say I hear your stuffiness, but you you looked cute enough for me to stop what I was doing and come over and say hi to you. I walked over there to get good lighting for my makeup. And I saw you guys. How are you? They're probably going to think I'm some creeper, but I'm not from here. So I thought it was cool. Yeah. People just randomly. No, we all were like, wow, that cute girl keeps looking over there. That's what we saw. All right. Cool. Yeah, I'm John. I'll text you in like, let's say I'll text you when you're done your makeup, like 10 minutes. OK. Thank you. All right. Bye. Bye. It was good meeting you. Good to meet you. Have a fun day. Bye. See you. A lot of the early dating coaches were that their story, their origin story was kind of I was a computer nerd guy and I was lonely and I got no chicks. And then one day I figured out the system by like sitting down and being scientific. And then I went out and applied this scientific system to get chicks. Not necessarily with that same kind of emotion, but that's how I imagine it. None of us, none of us were like that. None of us were computer nerds. I think we all had like girls in our life on and off throughout our life. Like, I mean, we had girlfriends. They weren't that hot always or not a bit annoying sometimes, but we sort of had women in our lives. So when we went out and decided to go and get really good at meeting strangers, we did it, I guess, in a very different way than a lot of the others. So, John, what was your process of like going from single normal kind of guy trying to make it in New York City to being a ladies man? Yeah, well, it's interesting because for me, I was here in New York City. I did have a girlfriend and we had just broken up. She was cute, but she had a violent temper. Oh, it's sexy, isn't it? And it didn't match mine. You know, we were like, you know, it's just like, you know, we had like we just were not compatible, but I was desperately trying to hang on to the great person. I was desperately trying to hang on to her because she was so hot, you know, definitely, you know, and how I met her was is in my one little way I could meet her was I was an actor at the time and I met her in an acting workshop. And, you know, she was the one hot girl in the acting workshop, which then ruined that because, you know, now I got the girl I'm dating in there. Right. So so then we broke up and right away she was hot and she already had, you know, 10 more guys lined up. And I was just like, hey, some guy on the street and I'm living who is sad and who is living in New York City. And I even had I really had no excuse not to have new girls. I would walk by thousands, tens of thousands of beautiful women every day, all of whom I would date, have sex with, marry. They were like this hot, you know, yet I would go home every night alone and it was causing me so much frustration. And unlike a lot of guys, it wasn't even locked in an office all day at a sales job outside walking by him. I had no excuse beyond all this apprehension and fear I have with all these women with any woman is the real me and that this is blocking me from true abundance. And that's stuff I was really into learning about abundance. I had already started learning about eating healthy. I'd already lost a bunch of weight. I already gotten like like in tune in a way. I didn't want to do nightclubs anymore. I wanted to meet really, you know, in New York. What's cool is, is there's really interesting people, beautiful, not just hot chicks, but really educated, interesting, driven. Yeah. Like the like the cramp. And I wanted to meet them. I wanted to know them. I wanted to date them. So I set this kind of ego driven goal, which was I will be known as one of the world's greatest ladies man. And I wrote it down and I wrote down all these other goals. I'm going to be a great writer. I'm going to be known as this. I'm going to be known as that. I didn't know how I was going to do any of them, but I knew the one I started on right away was this. I'm going to go out and I'm going to start talking to five women every day. I'm just going to go up and I'm going to say hi in some way and I'm going to walk away. That's what I can do to break the ice within myself. So I'd walk up, I'd say I'd ask for directions and I just walk away. I'd walk up and I'd make some weird comment about her shoes and I'd walk away. And, uh, and then I just kept doing that. And then I got to the point where, uh, I was like, okay, now I'm going to try and transition into a conversation. But even there, I kept removing the pressure because I had no wingman. I had nobody. Anytime I tried to have a wingman, he fucked it up. Uh, I actually stopped hanging out with any friends that weren't into it. I never went to parties with people in relationships or anything anymore. I became obsessed and I hit the streets day and night, like literally day and night. And then I even started going to bars all by myself. No drinking, nothing. Just meeting people, getting past all these social phobias. Everything I think, uh, isn't true. Like I don't know what's going on. And I found out like, oh, she's a bitch. I walk up, she's not. Oh, she wants me to leave. I ask her out, we end up on a date. Like I had to find out by doing it over and over and over. And that's how I finally stepped in a super empowered state. Like I couldn't believe it, you know? And this went on for months. And then I got to, I remember very specifically, I was dating more women. I was having sexual encounters. And then I thought, but still I'm not dating the, you know, the girls I thought I'd be dating. For like two, three weeks, I just, you know what? It came over me like, you know what? It's okay. You don't need to try so hard. I still, I'm still here. I like being me. Yeah, I'm not going to be a famous actor apparently. And I'm not going to be the world's greatest ladies man, but here I am. And I still like me, even if all these people don't. And I just stopped, stopped trying, stopped talking to girls. I went about starting trying to write a screenplay. And one day, like three, four weeks later, I was sitting in a cafe and I was doing, you know, working on this screenplay and I lean over to her and there's a girl there. And I just started talking to her. Like, like I didn't even think about it. And then we just started having a conversation. I wasn't leaning in. I wasn't trying to plow through anything. I wasn't trying to force something. I wasn't trying to make anything happen. I wasn't trying to get her approval. I wasn't trying to prove anything to her. I wasn't trying to prove I'm the greatest. Look, I can do this. I was just there being me. And I started, you know, it was like we're playing a soft game of ping pong and it was going back and forth. And that, I remember that so vividly. Cause from that moment on, I had discovered something totally new in myself. And I had then taken on, then that just was a big change in my whole life. And it wasn't too long after I started coaching other people. And one of the things I found along the way of, you know, meeting all these random people all the time is having, is it's about really just, when it comes down to the social stuff, it's about two things. It's about energy exchange. That's really what we're doing. And it's really, it's not that you're meeting women. It's not like I'm going out to get laid today or I'm going out to find my girlfriend today. You can have that in your mind, but really what you're doing is you're going out and practicing being in the flow by meeting women. There's something so much bigger than getting any woman. Having a great experience with the most beautiful woman you've ever had. It comes and it goes, even if it goes into a relationship. And what you'll find is creating great friendships and relationships and connections with your friends is one of the most important things you'll have because these guys know me through it all. I just think you look really sexy today. So I just thought I'd come say hi. Oh, thank you. Hello. Your style and my style look like we go together. Like we should be in a magazine cover. Don't you think? So good. Wow. Yeah, you're good. Good work. You look good too. What's your name? Rita. Rita? Nice to meet you. You're a very beautiful person. Yes. No, you're a beautiful woman. You're beautiful. I'm just going to meet some friends, but what are you up to now? Sorry, I have a boyfriend. Oh, oh, you ruined my day. Oh my God. I love you anyway. Thank you so much, yay. Have a good one. You too, bye. Thank you. Bye. Bye bye. Excuse me, miss. Hello. Hi. Don't panic, I'm not crazy. You just walked by me. I just had to tell you, you look fantastic. Not just good looking, but very, like you put an effort in. I don't, I'm lazy. I don't put an effort in, but I appreciate it when I see the effort. So that's it. What's your name? Sydney. Hello, Sasha. Hello. I would hit on you, but I don't live here. But if I lived here, I'd be like, hey, come get a juice with me, it'll be fun. But I don't like your, I'm sure you have a boyfriend anyway. You don't have a, what? How is that possible? I don't know, you tell me. Well, I hear this about New York, that a lot of guys just don't have the time, because a lot of guys are super businessy, a lot of gay guys. And then the online dating is kind of like not great. So there's a lot of beautiful single girls around. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What's been your experience? What's been your experience like? The gay part is right. The gay part is true. There's a lot of that. A lot of wasting time. Yeah. Most of it has been that. Like what excites you? What's your most fun thing to do? I don't know, I go to the movies. Let's say you inherited like $5 million and you didn't have to work, right? You were just rich. You were so rich. I travel. You travel around? Yeah. So you're adventurous. Yeah. Okay, nice. I'm the same. I love it. The world is, I love people who are, you know, adventurous enough to actually get the fuck out of their city. Well, you're a sweetheart. So what do you think? Should we get a juice sometime? You're not from here. Yeah, but I'm always, I'm a global citizen. So I'm always, you know, I come and go, I come and go. But, can I have a juice? What if? What if? What if? What if we get along great? Who knows? If you're adventurous, I'm adventurous. Or we could just, we can just have, we had this beautiful moment and we part ways and that's it. It's also beautiful. Either way is okay. What do you think? You want to flip a coin? I don't know. Tea or no tea? Tea or no tea? You pick. I like tea, but I need coffee more. I'll do tea, you do coffee. Yes? I'll send you a text. And if we make a tea happen, great. If not, not. But I like meeting new people. Come here. Nice to meet you. It was nice to meet you and have a beautiful day. Yeah, I'll send you like a not too crazy text message. It's probably just gonna say, hi. Okay, I'll talk to you soon. Ciao. Sasha, on the streets talking to girls. You guys would think this is normal because you've seen videos of him, but he hasn't done that in ages. No, not so much. It's actually amazing, right? And you're as good as ever, better than ever because, I mean, what I witnessed, if I could say just you're energetically, you were without any agenda whatsoever. You really enjoy getting to know people. You really enjoy like being with people. You're curious about women. I really noticed that about you. You're really curious about people. You really wanna share with them where you're at right now. And that's a huge, and that's why you make such deep connections now. I like people. Yeah, you like people. I like getting to know people. I like helping people. Yeah, it's fun. It's fun. You wanna touch one again or not? No, we'll see. Come on, let's see if you wanna touch one. I don't know about you guys, but the way that I got into coaching was to try and get a few bucks to party. At the time, I was obsessed with pick up, doing it all the time. But my plan was to leave Australia after a year of like just burying myself in hedonism and pussy and madness, and then go and become a monk in China. So I met this dude and he was like, well, why don't we make a business? We can teach some dudes. And I'm like, we didn't know what we were doing. What does that mean exactly? It means go out at night and just bring the guy with us and then like see if we can get some money. So that was my initial motivation. It wasn't very like altruistic or I didn't feel like I was there to change the world. I was just like, well, I don't have a job. All I know how to do is play music. So maybe I can make some bucks out of this. So yeah, that's how it started. And the first couple of workshops were really, first half dozen or whatever workshops were literally me and my partner just going and partying, picking up girls and then kind of dragging a dude along and throwing him in. We had no idea what we were doing coaching wise, but yeah, gradually we picked it up trial and error. At the time I got 90%, well, 10% of my validation from having sex with women and 90% from writing about it on forums so that anonymous nerds could write, good job, you sure did pick her up good. So I had this very unhealthy thing where like a girl would be there, I'd have sex with her and the moment she'd leave, I'd run to my computer and write this field report about every single thing I said and did, posted it on the online forums. And that was where I started getting my fan base in the sense it was a dozen dudes who thought I was cool because I got laid and they didn't. And yeah, that was where I sort of started to infiltrate into the seduction community and then I realized I was better than the people in there even though I was looking for mentors and there wasn't any. And then I thought, maybe I can make a few dollars out of this. What about you guys? So for me, I had been exposed years and years and years ago through Mystery. Meet the world's most successful pickup artist. Mystery. Sasha was Mystery's original wing just for a little bit of extra funny history in there. Back in the old days. They were talking in the late 90s. Before when Mystery was just Eric. And that's like, if they were making a movie of this whole thing, they'd fake that bit. They'd be like, oh, let's say that Sasha and he met like in 1998. It'll make the story more interesting. And basically, so the one thing I got from him was that this concept that you can actually go and approach women. Everything else I didn't like, all that he was doing magic and he was doing all this weird stuff. And I remember saying to him one day, we should just be able to talk to girls without the fake stories or the magic and hook up with them anyway. And he was like, no, that's never gonna work. You gotta use magic. He said that as a quote, that's never gonna work. You have to use magic. Remember that kids. But anyway. Your personality is not enough. That's not enough. So I knew him back in the old days and hadn't seen him for years. I read the game and I was really angry when I read the game because I was so. So how many years later is the game? That's like. The game comes out, I think it was like 2005 or something like that. I read it in 2006. So I think it came out maybe. I think he's right. I think it was 2005. And I read this book and I still sucked with women and I was getting my validation by telling jokes. I was doing comedy. Guys believe that, you know, if they see a beautiful woman, they can't just go over and introduce themselves. We used to kill bears for food. Hey, you want to go check that out? Fuck that. I ain't doing that shit. But I was so, so bad with women. Just terrible. And I read this book and I was furious because I'm like, this guy is famous now and he's getting all these girls and he owes me money because I lent him money back in the old days. And I'm like, he's got the money and pay me back now. He still owes you the money. He still owes me the money. Mystery? Come on, come on. But now he doesn't have it. Anyway. And so what happened was, I decided I need to fix this thing. This is not acceptable. So I ran into Mystery again. He didn't give me the money, but he said there's this forum, the London Seduction Society. You should go check it out in London and you can meet all these cool guys who are also into this stuff. So I joined the forum, not only because I wanted to, I desperately wanted to get better with women, but I thought if I get famous enough in the niche, in the pickup niche, then I'll be able to say to Mystery, hey, buddy, you better pay me my money. Otherwise I'll tell everyone you're an asshole and people will listen to me. Are you really serious? Yeah, yeah, yeah. That was one of my motivations. I was like, I'm going to show this guy who's boss. And then I started posting, but again, I hated nightclubs. I hated booze, all this stuff I hated. And I just had this insane idea one day where I'm like, I'm just going to go hit on chicks and I'm going to do it in the daytime. I don't give a shit. And I did it and immediately started to work. Like immediately. On the streets of London. Yeah, yeah. It was great. And so that started to work. And then, so I was on this forum. And again, same thing, like all these, I was getting all hundreds of guys commenting and like so many men who were like, living vicariously through me having sex. And like 20 comments. It was great. It was so good. It was a lot of fun. It really was a lot. That ego was really getting boosted up. And it was more about posting that I got laid than actually the sex of getting laid. It really was. It's like, I'm going to go like, this is going to be great. This report, I should spank her more, make her scream. This is going to make it more interesting for later. No, it was really fantastic. And so yeah, so I was doing that. And how I actually got into coaching was, so there was another guy who was quite known on this forum. And he was trying to kind of, he was a style guy. He would make guys look really, really good and kind of help them in that way as part of his thing. And so he was trying to raise 100 British pounds to one or 200 pounds basically to buy this guy who wanted to learn some clothes. Because this guy was broke. And this coach was a friend of mine. So I thought, okay, here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to offer a day game. So if anyone wants to pay me 50 pounds to come on first, I'll take two guys, 50 pounds each for a couple hours and I'll teach them what I know. And I knew this would be a kind of a good way to start coaching and get some reviews without actually being like, hey, I want money. I was doing it altruistically to help this guy. So I took- To buy some dudes some clothes because he's so dorky. That's how it started for me. Now there was something nice. But I did it, we raised him the money and I had a doctor, this Indian. I still remember the first two guys ever I coached and they both did really, really well. And of course I got reviews, they posted it up and that was the beginning. And then I was like, all right, if people want to pay me money, and then it just kind of steamrolled from there. Imagine those days back when you could hire us for a hundred bucks a night. A hundred bucks a night. We were the cheapest suckers in town. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, those cheap hookers do get expensive when they get popular. I'll tell you what. So yeah, so that's the short version of how I sort of- Well, how you got going? Well, how I got going, yeah. So here's the thing. At that time, I still was, you know, very similar to James and Sasha. I was an actor and I wanted to, and it wasn't, and I was, I'd never wanted to work a sales job again. I couldn't do it. I literally said to myself, I'd rather die than do this. That's where I was at in my life. And I thought somehow, you know, the gods are supposed to open up and make me an actor, right? So, but my buddy on the Upper West Side kept saying, it was watching me like I was a magician. I was talking to girls, 10 girls seating at a table. I was on fire. I could break the ice with anyone. I was like a storm going down the street. He couldn't believe it. He's like, you gotta teach guys that. I'm like, no, no, I don't wanna do that. I'm gonna do Shakespeare. No, no, right? And then anyway, one day, after many months of him doing that, I said, all right, and he was very seedy. He's like, yeah, everybody just wants to get laid. That's all they want. I said, nah, that's not what they want. So I went online and I went to Craigslist. I'm not a technical guy. I went to Craigslist. Back then, it was a real thing. It was about 2007. I went to Craigslist and I posted an ad that simply said, awaken to your new reality. Meet women anywhere and everywhere. And I called myself awakened because I didn't know what was gonna come at me. That was your ad? Yeah, that was it. Yeah. It sounds like something in an 80s movie that the guy finds like, awaken to your true power. Yeah, it was like that. Oh boy. Yeah, I mean, I might've had a couple other sentences like learn to meet her anywhere and everywhere. The spring is in the air, stuff like that. And I called myself awakened, right? And then they- Someone wrote to you? Yeah, it was unbelievable. Cause that was like a thing where all these forums were going on, which I was not a part of. And then this guys came to me and they were actually pretty cool New York guys. The first guy was like a guy who worked for MTV filming true life episodes. Showed up, we went from one side of Central Park to the other side. And I just talked to like 10 girls in front of him and he gave me a hundred bucks and he's like, you should call yourself amazing. And that was the beginning."}
