A week or so. A week, yeah. Sorry, I'm actually, I kind of like it, I'm from here. Wow, crazy, I'm surprised, like I've never heard this. Before, I was really too friendly, I had a disconnection with my sexuality and some negative experiences, and during the workshop, some NLP exercises from Shea helped me to reconnect that and reframe to positive experiences. So that gave me a huge boost of self-love and confidence. Hi, I'm here to meet you, because you look cute and sexy as hell. What? Yeah. Beautiful, thank you. You're welcome. What's your name? Laura. Laura. Pleased to meet you. I'm Stefan. Hi. They are already cheering you on. We're kind of in a hurry, so we have to go. How about we get to know each other doing a coffee, so we have more time for this. Okay? Okay. Do you have water? Yeah. Cool. Wow. How long are you staying in Barcelona? A week or so. A week, yeah. Well, I'm staying here for a couple of times for a long, I feel like. Okay. Okay. Where are you from? Switzerland. How did you get to know each other? Sorry, I'm actually... Okay. I'm kind of like... I'm from here. Oh, okay. I got pretty nervous. I'm from here. Wow. Crazy, isn't it? I'm surprised. Like, I've never heard this. She told him, like, that they're tourists, and then, mid-sentence, she's like, sorry, I lied. I mean, you can hear it, because you recorded it, but I was like, this never happened. Like, I'm surprised what's going on. It's amazing. Well, your English is very good for this. Thank you. Yours? Well, I have some Australian friends. So... All right. You got it? Coffee? Awesome. High five. High five. Yeah. Let's have a coffee together. Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Bye. Bye. You were bold, which is great, and then you were lucky that the two girls totally loved that as well, and, like, instantly, like, let you alone. Like, supporting us. Yes. It doesn't happen always. Sometimes it happens. It's a gift of the universe, so that's really cool. What happened with her saying, no, sorry, I lied? Like, I heard something, but I was really confused. Like, she told me that she's from another country. Yeah. Then, a bit later, she said that, oh, sorry, I lied. I'm from here. Wow. Then I said, well, your English is very good. That's crazy. Like, why do you think she lied at the beginning? I don't know. Maybe scared? Yeah, just like some defense mechanism of, oh, no, I will leave her. It's amazing. Like, she became so comfortable with you then, because the approach, okay, was very bold, very full on. Maybe she was a bit shocked, but charmed, and she made up some story, and then she was like, oh, yeah, this guy is harmless. He's really cute. I feel comfortable with him. Like, okay, now he's the real truth. Like, it didn't happen to me. I was really surprised. It was funny. One feedback. Okay. The approach could be, like, it seemed a bit as a line, you know? Like, the way you approached was like, hello, and, like, the smile was a bit set up. Like, it's more like, hmm. And then, I want to meet you, because you look tall and sexy. It's a little bit like, yeah, like a little, like, you read it, or you saw it in a video, and then you're replicating it. I'm here to meet you, because you look cute and sexy as hell. Which is fine at the beginning, you know? At least you're making things happen, and she appreciates that. But get into a little bit more like, whoa, hello. Wow, you look cool. I just wanted to meet you. You look really sexy. How are you doing? You know, it's like. Understand? Like, more in the flow. Like, feeling, right? Right. Like, give her the feeling that you're, like, still like, oh, wow, hello. How are you doing? You know, like, you're still affected by her. Versus just like a robot, and like, I wanted to meet you, because you are really hot and sexy. With three girls, you have to be aware you don't have as much time than one-on-one, right? Because obviously the other two girls will maybe drag her away in whatever sense. Like, they are on a mission together. You're shopping together. So you already have to be aware, I don't have that much time. So you don't want to go into very deep topics, as you maybe usually would want. Well, you got a number of beautiful girls. Yeah. And you only do, like, three approaches. Yeah, now the question is what I do with it. Basically, just a very quick advice is. There is no perfect approach. Like, if you're like, I'm only happy if I do the perfect approach. And I'm only happy if I'm in total flow state. You're going to be unhappy for a lot of the time. You should just be, I'm happy because I am. Like, the happiness must come from within you, not from exterior thing. Or did I get a number or not? Was the approach perfect or not? My experience with Alex was, he was a very strict teacher. But he really knew what I had to do. Like, getting out of my thoughts of, wait, I don't like this. And he was telling me, like, no, just go and see what happens. Okay, cool. And that's really helpful. I really like to be free and having the opportunity to suddenly create a wonderful day for me and someone else. Copyright \u00a9 2020, New Thinking Allowed Foundation"}
