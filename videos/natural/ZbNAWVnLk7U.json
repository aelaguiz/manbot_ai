It's not tough, you're not a martyr, you don't get anything out of it, it's not better, it's not honorable to be a martyr to your own pain. Right, so the idea of healing, it's not like, oh it's only some people heal, or that's only for pussies, or that's only for guys who are really messed up, that they need to go and seek out some way of healing. You are damaging, being damaged, and you are healing all the time. That is part of the human condition. And maybe this makes more sense if you think about it in sporting terms. Like, for anyone who's done any basic level of training in the gym, and has any understanding of the science, you'll know that when you go in and lift heavy weights, it rips your muscle fibers, it damages the body to a certain degree, which is manageable. Right now, if we just literally went into the gym after never going to the gym, and just bench pressed all day for eight hours, as much as we could, probably you would rip something, and it would be damage that is counterproductive. Right, but if you go whatever, three, four times a week, or you have a physical practice, and you stretch yourself past your original limit, you will accrue damage. Now, there's very few men that would say, yeah, go to the gym, do all that, and then don't be a pussy about it. Just fucking don't stretch, don't go to the sauna, like, don't worry about your nutrition, like, you don't need to heal. That's like, I'm tough. Like, most intelligent bodybuilders or people who go to the gym wouldn't think like that. They would think, I damage my body, and then I repair my body. And I do that in cycles. And overall, the testing myself or stretching my comfort zone physically means that I get stronger and bigger and, you know, more fit over time as my body changes and adapts to the new stresses and learns to deal with higher levels actually of damage, higher levels of trauma, and it becomes stronger and better at dealing with that. You add processes to that. You do a warm-down stretch. You go to the sauna. You get a massage. You look after your nutrition. You know, you have your glucosamine and your joint stuff and your essential fatty oils and your creatine or whatever it is that you're taking to assist you. And of course you do because that's smart. You have to process the fact that you're damaging yourself along the way. Why don't we think about our emotions like that? Why don't we think about our past like that? The things that happen particularly in our childhood, you know, those formative years. There's no escaping that, that they form you, right? We don't want to, most people who work with us don't want to be subject to extreme conditioning. They don't want to be tied to their conditioning. But we are all conditioned. And we all accrue damage throughout our lives on the various levels of what it means to be human. And if we do not work out a way to heal and process, we'll just do the best that this machine can do. As I said, you will survive probably, you know, until the point that you don't. Let's say if it gets too much and you top yourself or you're not looking after your health or something. But basically you will live and you'll probably still have a more or less functional life, even though you may be feeling shit, even though you may be feeling unworthy, unloved, in physical and emotional pain, stuck inside your own thought loops of negativity, believing belief structures that are negative by nature and directly affect your happiness because they mean you can't see the world as anything other than negative, right? You can still live like that, but it's not great living, I would say. Everyone needs to do something that is therapeutic in their life. And I've certainly met quite a few people throughout my life who certainly don't need any kind of specific therapy. They don't need to go and see a counselor or a shaman or to do dense medicine work, for example, plant medicine work. But that's because their lives are therapeutic. And I've seen that quite often with a lot of women that I've met. Not all by any means. I certainly meet plenty of women who are highly strung and emotionally numb and have sexual issues and so on, traumatic experiences. But I've met more women than men who live in a therapeutic way. And what that means is they do a whole number of practices and maybe they don't see them as practices. Maybe they just see them as this is what I like doing. But they do a bunch of things that have the effect of just flushing things through. Whether that's physical toxins or emotions or looping thought processes or stuckness in the body. They do something to let that out, to process it. And that's really what I'm talking about when I'm talking about healing. So somebody who lives a therapeutic type of life will do things like dance, right? So why do you think girls like dancing? Partially, if it's in a club, it's to get the attention of men and part of the, you know, I'm beautiful and I'm part of a female hierarchy and all of that kind of attention stuff. But women do dance by themselves or with each other or in their bedrooms. Or you'll see women be the first ones to get up and dance to a DJ or a band. Girls talk about that. I just need to dance. Do you need to dance? When was the last time you felt the need to just get up and do a tap dance and a Jimmy Joe jig and a shimmy? Never, right? Like men don't, very rarely do we feel the need to dance. But we do feel the need to express ourselves physically. So men will do it in a more masculine conditioned way through contact sports or the gym, getting in fights on the street, whatever they need to do to express that physically. But the notion of dancing combines a number of therapeutic aspects, right? It has movement, but it has movement in nonlinear ways. And I'm not talking about like formalized ballet, for example, right? Like that's a totally different thing. I'm talking about expressing your body to music. So that involves improvisation, moving it to flow, immersing yourself into the environment through the music and through the physical sensation. Expression, it involves like physical release, right? So, you know, like if I open my chest up and do some dancing of some sort, that's a very different experience of my body than this, or this, or this, right? Like the linear kind of prescriptive movements that we do in our job or in our routine if we live in flat surfaces all the time and we just walk around in shoes. We're not expressing in the way that a hippie chick who's doing dancing is. I don't want you to think that there is any therapy or any school of thought or any technique that really is the answer. And that is a very common human mistake and it's one that we want. We want there to be an answer that is prescriptive. Humans, you know like how people say women like to follow and men like to be leaders? I think that is tripe bullshit. 98% of the human population likes to follow, likes to be told what to do, likes to be led. We can't really just think through our problems and come to solutions for them. And you know that because you've tried to do it. Now there are some, yeah, I can think through a mathematical problem or a technical problem or a logistical problem. Sure, I can think through those and come up with better and worse ideas and come up with a plan. But when I have a deep sense of like I don't feel good about myself in some way or I feel sad or I feel broken, I can't think my way out of that. And you know that, you've tried, you've looped around your head over and what's wrong with me, why can't I do this, how can I do this, I should do this, that person did this to me, I did that, you know, I should have done this. All of this talking to myself, it doesn't actually heal me at all. There is definitely some value in just spitting it out. But what I'm starting to look at is different ways that we can be therapeutic to ourselves and how we can ask for help to bring others to heal. My first premise being that you don't have to heal, you can just be crippled, but your life will be way worse. It's not tough, you're not a martyr, you don't get anything out of it, it's not better, it's not honorable to be a martyr to your own pain. I know that, I've rolled around in my own pain at points in my life and for whatever benefits I got out of it from, you know, I don't know, thinking weird thoughts or coming up with some strange plans or something, writing a song, it wasn't worth it because the pain was way more intense than what I got out of it. So if you're living in pain, then you need to understand you don't need to. Human life includes pain, but if we learn ways to regularly process it, then it will be much less painful. And just as I was saying in my last video, it means that you will get to experience more of the bittersweet mixed juice that is life. With all of its ingredients, sorrowful and joyful, I think it's better to experience all of those than it is to reach some numb bandwidth in the middle where you don't really get peaks and troughs, you don't really get the intensity of life and you don't really feel the pain of it either. Personally, I would rather feel the pain and then get to experience all of it. Gentlemen, if you'd like to get more of the bittersweet juice that is life, the joys, the heartbreak and the eventual emancipation and success with both your personal life, your interpersonal life and your internal life, then I suggest you check out the Eurotour.
