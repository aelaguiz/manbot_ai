Voluntary celibate. Lays me down with my mind she runs throughout the night. No need to fight. Never a frown. With Golden Brown. Gentlemen. And a couple of ladies and mostly gentlemen. It's James Marshall reporting on Tuesday the 24th of March. From Portugal. Out in the Coimbra district. I won't tell you where because I don't want anyone to know. And I'm here in my Quinta for the first of a series of podcasts and productions that will come from the Lockdown Crew. And I'm here with my good friend and cellmate, Shane Matthews. Yo, yo, yo. Hanging out in the shack with my old man, James Marshall. That's right. We're shack buddies. So there's six of us on the Quinta. Myself, Shea, Liam, Alex and a couple of their girls. Not my girl. Shea has a girl. I don't have a girl. I'm girl-less. And that's fine. That's fine currently. We'll talk about that more later. But today we wanted to check in with you guys and we want to get this out as soon as possible. Tomorrow, hopefully. So it's more or less up to date. Everything's happening exponentially. So whatever we say today, exponential it till tomorrow. But things should still be relevant, we hope. So we want to touch base with you guys. Let you know what we've been doing. Find out what you've been doing. And readjust to this new reality. Which is now we're locked in some kind of like project house. For the next four to six to eight weeks is my guess. And the question is, what are we going to do about it? What are we going to do about it? So firstly, I want to hand it over to you, Shea. And can you tell us all about your journey over the last ten days? So ten days ago, where were you? Ten days ago, I was in Thailand. In the island of Koh Phangan. And I was there with a small group. Just running a retreat and doing some cool things. And then things started to change. Yes, they did. They did. And you had a whistleblower, which was Dominic. Who's the other coach that works with Shea and I on the Sex God Masterclass. Which is an amazing sexuality class. Where you get hands-on practice with your hands on another person's body. You get to touch them, you get to kiss them. No, you don't get to kiss them. You get to touch, you get to spank, flog. You know, get really tactile. And we run this workshop. And it's coming never again at the moment. But myself and Dominic and Shea did run that. And so you were over with Dom in Thailand. And what was the first signs that you started getting that things were changing? And they came from him, right? What was the first signs? Well, obviously we already knew the virus was around. Because it started in January. And it wasn't really an issue until we started to see some potential outbreaks happening in other countries. So that's when it became something a bit more relevant. Yes, we had Dom on the other end. He and I were early on having kind of paranoid rants. And he was like, fucking people got to get the fuck out. No one's listening to me. No one understands me. And I think in general he was pretty right. So what happened when basically things started shutting down with all the borders closing for you? Well, honestly I think I got through it pretty smoothly. I think I could see that something was happening. And then I was considering all my different options. Including staying in Thailand. At that stage we had a plan to be in Australia. And go and do some workshops there. But I could sense by the time that was going to happen that everything would be pretty locked down anyway. So it was more of a plan B. And then as plan A dissolved and plan B started to arise. Then it became clear that the best place to be would probably not be in Australia. Or probably not Thailand. I still think Thailand's a viable option presently. But then it's probably going to become some kind of human hunting ground in a few weeks. But we'll see what happens. That's the interesting thing. At this point if you're gambling with your location. It's like Thailand would either be the best place or one of the worst places. If everything kind of cruises over. And everyone who's just in their villas watching it all and going cool, chill man. And then they may get out of that fine. Or they may run out of water. The ferries may stop. And the Thais might suddenly start looking at all the hippie tourists. And go you know what? This is our island. I don't know. I mean the Thailanders I'm sure are lovely. They are lovely people. I've been there. They're lovely. But you know if you had an island. A whole bunch of hippies came over there. Just listening to trance all day. You know flopping around. Talking about polyamory. And then suddenly all the food starts running out. What would you do? Let's be honest. Okay. Let's be honest. Anyway sorry. Then what happened? Then what happened? It's all a bit of a blur honestly. I mean what ended up happening was I had some chats with you. And you said it was a good option to come here. So that was pretty high on the list. Because I thought obviously being isolated in a sort of rural area. In a you know complicated situation. Like a pandemic is a smart idea. Getting out of like developed areas is probably the number one thing to do. So yeah. Then it became like a matter of getting everything organized. To get over here as soon as possible. And like I said it was relatively smooth considering. I mean it was just before all the kind of lockdown started to really kick in. So we were literally like 24 to 48 hours ahead of it. It was Indiana Jones sliding under the thing. And then reaching back to get his hat. Which was for me. I had to reach back and get my hat. So I was in Kiev. I'd been out here for a long time. For months. And quite happily. I'd been basically living as the rest of the world has to live. For a while. But I chose to. And then I went to Kiev. And was reminded that the world existed. And had a great time with Alex. And we were planning on staying longer. And then suddenly it all became very clear. Because we were watching things pretty carefully. And we weren't listening to paranoid conspiracy news. And we weren't listening to just the kind of mainstream. Oh I think it's fine. We were researching and listening to doctors. And figuring out okay. It looks like these things are going to start changing. And then we get word that Ukraine's shutting the borders. And so we packed up everything. Which was an office. A house. Relationships. All sorts of things got packed away. And we did a whole bunch of cool prepping. That you can only do in Ukraine. Which was that we got a bunch of these. N95's over here. For anyone who's. Well we'll cut to a shot of that. It's alright Alex. We'll cut to a shot. Well later on we'll do a whole like. You know. Nice close up and whatever. Yeah. So we got a bunch of these. Not for resale. We're not trying to profit to you. We just got a bunch for us. And they've been useful. And a bunch of other meds that you can just get in the pharmacy. And then I've jetted over to Budapest. Broke the news to my staff. Which sucked. We'll talk about that in a minute. And organized what was going to happen to Vince. Grabbed my gold. And got on the last days worth of flights to Lisbon. Met all you boys and girls. And then Pedro picked us up. Took us out to the farm. And we locked the gate. And that's where we are. So. Fascinating week. So just for anyone that missed my last video. To recap very quickly. What this means for us. TNL. Is that all workshops are currently cancelled. Postponed. Let's say until the world goes back to some kind of normal. Where you can touch. And squeeze. And spank. And all those nice things. Until such a time. We're not running any workshops. When the world does open up again. And we're going to talk about our speculations later on in the podcast. When it does open up. Then pretty much straight away. As long as it's safe. We will be running workshops first here. The natural warrior training. And then back out in the streets. Now we're not going to be cowboys about it. We're not going to do it when. You know the infection rates are still high. We'll do it when the doc. Whoever the big doc is. Or the many docs say that it's okay. So. What that means for guys that want to do training with us. Is that we have put some dates on the website. They'll be here right now. We are taking bookings for them. All deposits are completely refundable. If we can't do it. Because the world's over. We'll give you your cash back. And if we can do them. Then we'll do them. Until such a time. We're locked in this house. And we're going to be gardening mostly. I'm going to be opening a new channel. Called Apocalypse Organics. Which is launching very soon. Which is basically a middle-aged man. Having a midlife crisis. Turning from being a high-powered jet-setting CEO. To suddenly becoming a celibate organic gardener. So. If that's the kind of thing you're into. Then check out that new channel. If you want to stay with us. The normal channel. We're still going to be ranting and doing cool shit. So. That's what we're going to do now. So. That's all about like the coronavirus. As the pandemic that we're going to talk about. Except to say that you should listen to the government. In terms of the medical body. And also look. And if your government's a bit dumb and a bit slow. Like for example the Australian and the American ones. And no offense to American and Australian people. I'm saying like the response has been slow. And not well rolled out in some places. And other places have gone quick. Lock everyone. Let's fucking nail this thing. So. I would say. Watch what the most strict. Watch what Switzerland or Sweden. Or one of those like very clean and organized countries is doing. And if your country is being a bit slack about it. Do like the Swedes or the Swiss. I don't know exactly if they're doing it right. But you can imagine they would do it right. Wash hands. Stay two meters away from everybody. That means no pick up. No approaching. No macking on chicks. That means actually even. If you're separated from your partner. Maybe not seeing them. Or that you have to quarantine. If you want. You guys want to bang. Then you have to stay in your bang quadrangle. And then you can't go and kiss your grandmother. And hang out with your friends. Because eventually it gets to someone's grandma. And then they die. That's the whole big problem. And some of us too. So. That's all I've got to say in terms of health warnings. But what I think is kind of interesting to talk about is. What is happening now. And what is going to happen in terms of humanity. Because there's some kind of interesting things going on. And of course there's a lot of suffering going on. And I don't want to like minimize that. But there's going to be some interesting stuff in terms of like. What does the individual do in this time. For one to two. Probably two is my guess. Months. You will be separated from everyone except the people you have in your house. Now the first thing I think that's cool about that. Is that there's going to be some really interesting weird house groups. Like this one formed. Like you know housemates that were put together. Couples mixed with some granny that they were staying with. For example John Keegan. We'll do a podcast with him soon. He's in Miami at the moment. And he flew back from Thailand. Where he was with Shay. And landed in New York. New York was fucking walking dead. And so he decided to go to Miami. He got himself a nice place in a hotel on the beach. Now the hotel has since closed. Except that it has a few condos. Or the top levels of condos. And so it stays open. Full staff but empty hotel. With Keegan and a bunch of odd characters who are in condos. Like what a great movie. It writes itself. John Keegan in Miami on South Beach. Everything's deserted except there's like one hot trophy wife by the beach. And then a man with a monocle sitting over in the corner. And then like some cholo gangster. You know you can imagine it. It writes itself. So mark my words. There will be a lot of interesting literature. A lot of terrible, terrible literature. And some interesting movie ideas that will come out of this. And this will be an era that people will draw from. As an artistic source in the next generation. Mark my words. Shay. What do you think is going to happen to people at large with that dynamic in mind? Keeping in mind that many people. I don't know what the stats will be. But many are alone. Or many are with a partner. Which is interesting. Or in a family unit. Or in some weird 2, 3, 4, 5 person random conglomerate. What do you think? Like in terms of how it's going to affect humans in general. What do you think is going to happen? That's a tough question. Because obviously it's going to depend on everybody's individual conditions. Well would you say there will be patterns of people doing certain. There will be certain outcomes that will happen good and bad for people? Well I would guess. Because I'm just sort of tapping into what's going on. That most people are more uncertain about what to do next. There's a lot of unknowns going on. And people are looking for some sort of order and security about the future. So I think in the short term when people have got food in the cupboard. And they don't really feel like they've got any major dramas. Then they're probably just going to be jacking off and playing video games a lot. That's the first stage. That's stage 1. Jack off, video game stage is first stage. It's still where there's surplus energy. Everyone's in that right now. This is the smoke weed, jack off, you know. Fucking whoa, month off work dude kind of days. But those won't last forever I presume. I'm guessing not, yeah. And obviously we're tracking, well I'm guessing anyway. People would be wanting to know what's going to come next. So I think there's going to be a lot of people looking for certainty. Looking for security. Looking for some kind of narrative that helps them to make sense of things. Do you think there will be an uptick in religious conversion? Potentially. Potentially. There'll probably be an uptick in... Especially tele, like digital tele evangelists. Suddenly like, oh imagine that. There's like a congregation of, you know, those mega churches. But it's just everyone by themselves in their... And then there's the pastor. Oh, praise Lord be. Everyone's alone in their apartments. Oh Lord. Maybe it's going to be an uprising of conspiracy theorists. We'll get on to the conspiracy theories. Don't you worry about that conspiracy theory guys. Well I've thought about this quite a bit in the last few days. Here's my predictions for relationships. Because think about this. Right now every couple in the world is in one of three situations. Maybe four. I haven't thought about it that far. they're separated and they can't see each other or or like they're long distance they can't separate see each other they're in the same city maybe they can see each other now but soon they won't be able to probably or that we have limited contact. Secondly they're living together and they're stuck together right. Thirdly they're in some kind of wacky three-way thing going on on a polyamorous farm and one of them just decided that they identify as an antelope that's another or you're gonna have shitloads of single people either in a group so what people are gonna start fucking whoever's in their house I won't I won't but you know if there's any single couple they're gonna there's gonna be some weird couples get together you know age difference whatever's because they're just like oh fuck it well that's the best that's the only one on the island and then you're gonna have lots of couples who can't see each other and so they're gonna do a lot of digital fucking jerking off there'll be a lot more of people's stuff getting leaked way more nudes going out on the internet mark my words but after some time it's gonna mean a lot of digital cheating couples are gonna break up on mass because they're separated for a long period and they won't be able to meet you know some will be like every day like all that stuff and they'll get through of course and some that'll make it stronger but mostly not I think there'll be mass breakups people that were stuck together for four to eight weeks with not with you know okay you live with your girlfriend I've done that before but have you spent every moment with her for four to eight weeks where you can't leave the house and for many people that's inside an apartment we can at least run out and scream in the fields cut that bit of what's that screaming comedian yeah so that's gonna mean that coming out of four to eight weeks that people and with there'll be a few murder suicides along with it coming out of eight weeks again there'll be a massive breakups because people just be sick the fuck of each other and there'll be also a lot of babies that will come out of this because people will get pregnant during this with people that they were like they shouldn't have so there'll be it I think there'll be like a new baby boomer generation the corona boomer generation I think will pop out of this but there'll be a bunch of people that shouldn't have been born because they were bred under circumstances where people didn't have any choice that's my predictions I haven't even smoked this all right it's like the dating apocalypse apocalypse right and yeah I think everything will get shaken up socially there will be this massive sea change of everything like people who are tight will stay super tight man probably they'll get married and have kids out coming out of this but a lot of them are gonna get out of the bunker go okay thank you very I mean thank you very much see you later which means you know good things for single dudes all right now let's talk about what are you gonna do with this time so right now right now everyone's doing whatever they're doing I think most people haven't optimized their time yet we've been doing some optimizing and I've been gardening and I've been looking after animals and doing lots of cool shit actually but we've also been indulging in some laziness those guys play a lot of Starcraft I've been smoking joints and just bro walking around the fields thinking about things you know Shay's been playing fucking gun games and so on as well as doing an exercise and feeding ourselves but the question what the question comes firstly what are you what are you doing now and be honest with yourself tracking it and then how are you gonna shift that into something else so that's something you've talked about before I remember on last warrior was tracking reality and I guess it's like kind of down to that old if you can measure it you can manage it kind of thing do you want to talk about like four guys right now using this as a time to track their present realities their previous realities and then how they're gonna start to make new ones yeah well I guess it's got to start somewhere right so you gotta you gotta start looking at your reality and ask some fundamental questions that are going to give you a position to begin from and that also is dependent on your circumstances because it's very hard to make a plan if you don't know what your kind of conditions are so I think that's that's one thing that's going to be difficult for people in this time is trying to work out like what how do you prioritize in a time of great fundamental uncertainty right when when you don't win any of your plans can fall apart it looks like if you've got your Maslow's hierarchy you know most people familiar with that idea that you know on the bottom of your kind of imagine a pyramid you've got to get your survival needs and you got your emotional needs and kind of build all the way up to the top of the pyramid which is more you're like you're selfish desires yeah your self actualization your your desire to be a whole and complete you know powerful individual which is an important thing actually but nonetheless if you know your your pyramid of needs is being challenged or this there's circumstances that are really making difficult then then you've got to kind of look at well how can you track your reality under those kinds of conditions and like it's a different circumstances are going to demand different kinds of responses so you know if your fundamental shelter and food is under threat then your priority is going to be around like securing those things so you're not going to be like reading self-help books and like learning how to be the world's next best seducer it's going to be more about like you know getting rice yeah how are you gonna live for the next month two months three months I think there's a lot of people who are probably asking those questions because there's not a lot of certainty about that I think that it's going to be an interesting blend of of reality that we're going to be moving into in the sense that like obviously mindsets and having like a sense of resourcefulness being able to move into the future is going to be any really important thing but all that is also going to be very much underlined by you know what's going on in people's circumstances and and how they can kind of make sense of their world true yeah well I guess maybe we should talk about that like if people are on the lower end of the Maslow's like I mean do we it's not really our place to kind of get into all the prepping stuff with them I guess but in terms of do people understand even what what is at stake and what they need to prepare right now what what they need to do to make sure their base level needs are met there is quite a lot of kind of misinformation and I guess denial like people didn't know because this is it like I know people are dying and that sucks but this is a weird kind of apocalypse in the sense that it's invisible it doesn't each it doesn't seem like terrifying in the novel itself like you know it's a flu that some you know okay yes all people die but for a lot of people that doesn't feel like a reality it's not like 13th century European bubonic plague where you had blistering boils that like exploded out of your fucking body as you like drowned in like mucus you know like and at the same time you thought that it was God bringing down vengeance on you so I think for a lot of people it's weird because it's like it's real in the sense they have to stay home but it's it's more it's in some ways like a cerebral apocalypse like it's something where the whole world has to pause be alone with itself for a month or so and there's very real things happening right so there's very and and like I know just down now just down our kind of supply chain my lawyer our driver you know people who work in our industry doesn't exist anymore you know like there's so many people who've lost their livelihoods or massively had it taken out and there's I guess a small group of people who are still out working you know in supermarkets in hospitals and those people are fucking heroes actually because they don't get any time off to think that just sit at home there I'm lonely what does it mean what's my purpose why don't I have the community they're like no fucking alright people buying 40,000 bags of rice and toilet paper and the medical staff obviously who are fucking heroes who are who are keeping the world from dying but for everyone else a lot of people even if you're broke and lonely it's like it's this thing in your space right it's like okay now I have this time where the world just like presses pause and now maybe that's the only time in our lives we'll have that and certainly the only time in this generation and I think that's interesting and I think there's something really cool could come out of that on individual levels and on and in the way that people now link up and connect what do you think yeah I mean I guess is like I like to try and look at things as in there's an expanding spectrum of things that are happening on both ends so on one side you're going to have like positive potentials and obviously there's a lot of hopeful growth in new innovations and people can work together in new ways and you know we can find a way through this kind of situation and I guess on the other side of it is going to be very interesting to see how it starts to pan out with the you know with the financial system taking big hits and people not being able to have like a normal sense of reality in in that and think about if your whole life was basically dependent on how society told you to live your life and then all of a sudden you know which is what we're going through in a short period of time the roles and responsibilities that you thought were of you know almighty importance have very quickly become you know just fragments of a past that doesn't necessarily exist so much anymore so that could be you know that's very disruptive to people's flow and how they're going to understand themselves but there you know hopefully can be also like a lot of really positive developments as well I mean it sort of depends on how it unfolds I think we're going to see a mixture of like bumbling stupidity and great genius kind of coming together in different ways I think there's going to be a lot of like people not not not let's say using their common sense very well and that could be you know an uncomfortable period of time for people to live through so you know I think I think there's like a lot of things at play obviously and it's going to be upsetting to people's realities and destabilizing them I don't think it's going to start really hitting home until people's like you know their comforts and their securities are starting to be eroded in some ways which is interesting because unlike a war or some other claim or like a tornado or some other calamity where instantly everyone has to you know your house is gone right or it's flooded or something and you have to change you have to rebuild everything has to go completely change to get back to comfort everyone's just sealed in there okay more or less comfortable cells right so that can and for many people that can they could sit there for a long period into some like dystopian future pod world or whatever I don't know if that's going to play out so much I think people are going to get pretty frustrated with being stuck inside in a short time who do you think who do you think is going to what kind of people and what kind of let's say strategies or mindsets do you think are going to be the most useful coming out of this that's a good question who's going to come out on top you mean or like yeah like like you think about it even though we took a fucking huge hit like our business tanked overnight considering the positions we were in which was that we're all scattered around the world you know in weird places that we were able to galvanize our team our Intel our resources and completely change the structure of a corporation overnight right now it's not that we're not a we don't have thousands of offices and we don't have factories and whatever else but but the funny thing about our business is that every business is that has an office overseas is multinational right but it doesn't mean that every member of the team is multinational in TNL every member of the team right down to the PA lives in multiple countries or like is constantly moving in this strange kaleidoscope around the world with with coaches meeting and dispersing and back end in different teams or whatever and we managed to soul that up and put it all into one spot and go lean super quick right whereas obvious and probably will survive maybe with your help whereas a lot of other people were caught with their pants down completely and so I'm not saying that we're awesome or whatever but it's that there are certain ways of thinking or flexibility that are going to mean that you have to have because I think a lot of the old the old thinking of post-world War two thinking of everything is okay for generations is still in the back of people's minds next to reflect on what you just said I think there's a lot of people that are going to go through entitlement grief yeah totally yeah they're going to go through a kind of a breakdown of what they expected and a big I guess a big thing that's going to be a form of cognitive dissonance like that's what we're seeing right now is cognitive dissonance arising inside of societies because people don't want to acknowledge that their fundamental belief systems are being challenged and eroded so basic and probably just the consumerist belief well that's it I mean like it's like your whole reality is invested in this whole structure you know and if that structure is taken away or severely compromised then Jake Paul has a tantrum yeah that's right there's what's Jake Paul doing right now he's probably fine he's in team 10 house mm-hmm so I think you know people people are going to have to be attentive to their own kind of expectations as well and maybe maybe that's something that comes back to what you were asking before is like what was it going to be the skills that are going to help people to move through this well obviously things like resilience and like an awareness and you know having compassion etc but then also probably expectation management you know so being able to adjust expectations and I think and a sense of self-reliance like or community reliance like realizing that the state or everything you know your job or your employer or everything else isn't going to protect you and I'm sounding like like a libertarian now listen listen what we all need to do is get ar-15s go and get a cabin in the woods everyone has their own society and what about schools and hospitals and police and sanitation and all that we just have our own that's right you dig yourself a hole well weirdly enough we are doing exactly that mm-hmm we're making our own libertarian well it does make sense and it like if you whatever degree that you can be responsible for your own you know needs and well-being"}
