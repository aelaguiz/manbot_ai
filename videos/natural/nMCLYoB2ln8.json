What about now, am I live? Alright, people of YouTube, is anyone there? Instagram? Facebook? There's one guy. Here he is. Sixteen guys. Alright, people are rolling in. Okay, I'm just going to start ranting because you know how I like to rant. Yo, yo, Jake, welcome. Victor, Alex is watching. He's sitting next to me and he's watching. Will, hey man, how you doing? I haven't seen you in ages. And John's out coaching right now, but he's also sending me likes, which means his climax must be in set. Alright, gentlemen, welcome to my live webinar. So I'm broadcasting live YouTube, Facebook, Instagram. If there's any aliens watching this for 10,000 years in the future to try and understand humanity, well, your 9,500 winter, nuclear winter's too late. So today what I want to do is open this up to ask you to ask me questions. Basically, we'll answer any questions that I have that you have, as long as they're within my field of expertise. Don't ask me about crypto. It was probably a bad idea. We'll see. Alright, one other question. I bought the MMM from last year and I said I would get access to the new version. I don't see anything. Yes, if you're an MMM guy from last version, you will get access as the new guys get access to the new stuff. So if you don't have access to it, it means it's not on this week. It means that next week there's videos. So, yes, don't worry. You will have access to all new material automatically. Just check the login from week to week and it'll be there. Just on that, if you're a guy who's done the martial meditation method before, please join us, the new group, for the new rerun of the series. It's a great opportunity to go through the material again, and hopefully you guys get more feedback and accountability for me. And unless you've been living under a rock, obviously I'm doing this webinar as part of the promotion for the relaunch of martial meditation method 2.0. This is my reduxed, redone, tweaked, and updated version of my most popular ever online course, which is all about embodiment, awareness, how to get into your body, into flow, get out of your fucking monkey mind. It's always talking to you all the time and you just want to have some silence, how to feel good in your body, how to be able to be an effective communicator, aligning your states of consciousness, your mind, emotions, body into a powerful machine. So yeah, there's 24 hours left to join that. So I highly recommend you click the link in the bio, in the Instagram, link in the Facebook. You guys know where those things are. Check it out. All right. Who's got a question for me? Where did I get that awesome headboard on my bed? It's over here. This is a custom designed headboard. I actually designed it myself. When I say that, I like drew it on a napkin and handed it to the guy and said, make this look like it's out of 50 shades of gray. You'll notice there's some holes in the headboard. That's not because we ran out of wood. That's where the gripes go. So, yeah, I can give you the, I can give you the number of the carpenter if you like. All right. How do you stay motivated in whatever you do with your meditation method? Okay. I'm going to, I'm going to assume you mean how do I stay motivated in meditation? Or are you saying how do I stay motivated and use meditation? So maybe you can just sign on exactly what you're asking. Do I ever run into a streak where you can only attract girls you're not attracted to? No, I don't have that experience these days because I'm really good at this and I practice for 10 years. However, I certainly did in my early years for sure. This is, there's a number of things going on here. One is that often when guys are not super confident, okay with themselves, they operate really differently when they're talking to what they perceive to be a very attractive girl versus an average girl. And one of the keys to success with beautiful women is being able to be comfortable around them and treat them like every other. It's true that there are some differences. If she's a super high value, very attractive, very well positioned woman, then the game that you need to use to work with her will be different because she has a lot more options. So in those cases, maybe I'm qualifying a girl more heavily. If I made a sweet, shy girl, uh, who's kind of like really bedazzled to be talking to a guy, I'm not going to be heavily qualifying her and teasing her and, uh, you know, getting her to justify herself so much because she already feels like she's not at my level.  this is not about negative, right? So I'm not trying to cut someone's self esteem down, but I am definitely trying to show a very popular woman that I have standards that, that just because he's, she's beautiful. This is not enough. And therefore I'll be doing a lot of qualifying. But in answer to your question, yeah,  this is natural that as you're going through the early stages of your seduction career, you're going to have these massive ups and downs. You'll have plateaus. You'll have periods where just every girl seems to have a boyfriend where you get blown out 20 times in a row,  where you get lots of numbers and they flake where you can get the numbers of the not hot girls, the numbers of the hot ones. This is, this is fairly normal in terms of your, your growth, what you want to look at less so than like, how do I deal with this hot girl in this one situation? Uh, you want to look at what is my overall growth strategy? I got good at this over a period of years. And if you come to a workshop, like we were on day nine of the Euro tour at the moment, and I'm seeing guys going from never approached before to very competent within that.  So these guys are doing a fuckload of approaches and they have obviously professional coaches tweaking them constantly. But the truth is even, even that steep learning curve, it's only the first part. It's over the first one, two, three years of doing this consistently, meeting lots of women, getting different women on dates and into bed. So you get more experience that you gradually become comfortable with what previously you perceive to be out of your league girls. I remember those early dates when I somehow managed to hustle a super hot girl on a date and I was acting very strange. I didn't want to, didn't want to cause any trouble. I didn't want to fuck it up. And as a result, I wasn't chill. I wasn't acting like a guy who's comfortable around hot girls. She can see that she's like, yeah, not ready for my time. All right.  So, uh, I just qualified his question. So it was sometimes with meditation or diet or exercise things,  as you should do, I begin to see results and then I lose motivation because I feel like I've arrived and then I begin to slack off.  So I think the issue there is that when you say you've arrived, I think what you mean is you've moved away from the thing you didn't like. So if someone's really stressed and then they learn a little bit of yoga and they do that and then they feel less stressed, they might think,  cool.  I mean, yoga has delivered the results that I was after. And so therefore maybe I don't need to do yoga or I go on a holiday and I chill out for a bit and I come back and I feel better. Really what this is, it's the, the away from motivation and a lot of people, uh, have only this motivation. This means you're broke. Suddenly you'd really need money. So, and it's painful, it's dangerous. So you've got to go and do something. So you go on a street corner and you go, Hey boys, or whatever you got to do to earn some cash. And you move away from totally broke to, you know, survive it. And then you stay there because all right, the danger, the thing that was pushing you on the other end, which was the like, dude, you better get some food or I'm totally lonely and I don't, I don't have any girls in my life. So maybe I go and do a bit of approaching and then I meet a girl and she's all right. And then we have sex. Then I'm like, okay, well there's my girlfriend, I'm done. The problem with this motivation is it tends to only move you away from the most painful situations. It is a powerful motivation in those times. Like when you're at rock bottom or when you've got nothing left to lose or when you really need a kick in the ass, you're like, come on motherfucker. This is ridiculous. I haven't been laid in X amount of time. My life's shambles. I'm not dieting. What are the, what's the thing I need to get some action happening and move before I end up wasting my life. That's, that's, that's part of the way that I coach, right? When, when I'm working with students, sometimes I'm the drill sergeant. Sometimes I'm like, listen, listen, dude, this is fucking serious. We don't sort this out. You're going to have a miserable life, but mostly not. That's, that's really when people are digging their heels in and going, Oh, I don't know what's the point of this, which guys do sometimes. Uh, and then I'm like, this is, this is do or die because we know the alternative. You know that if you do what you're doing, you keep getting what you get and then it pushes them. However, the more powerful motivation in answer to your question, it's like, how do we, how do you stay motivated meditation with your diet, your lifestyle or whatever? It's by continually checking in with what are you moving towards? Right? Because your goals, the, the action, the action steps that lead to the place that you want to be or the, and it's not like you end in one place. Uh, I try to see life as continual learning. I'm not trying to achieve one thing and then cool. I've done that. So now I move on to the other thing. I want to, I want to develop a certain level of competency and mastery and then be able to integrate a skill or a mindset into my life and then continue to use it. Because what's the point of like, you know, learning to play the violin and then going, cool, done that. I'll never play the violin again. It's like I, I moved away from them from the pain of not being creative, not being able to express myself. I practiced, I learned because I'm moving towards the point where I can play a beautiful tune and then that brings joy to my life and I can see how that's going to work in the future. And I want to keep moving towards that to get it, get better and better. These are the types of motivational strategies that work much better. Now there's all sorts of ways you can go about that in terms of accountability, but that really depends on what kind of person you are. I think some people respond very well to, uh, you know, reminders and scheduling and systems to be able to set clear things in place like,  I exercise in these,  these dates. I measure every single thing. Uh, I know my calories, I know my reps, I'm moving towards this body weight or this thing, or I'm moving towards this ability with women and I'm meticulous about it. I'm going to my six approaches a day and I do, uh, you know, I log them and I make my, my, uh, assessments and I adjust. That's a good way to do things for sure. Uh, I must say I've never been particularly good at that. The guy sitting next to me, uh, he's very good at that. He's the systems guy and he tracks and monitors every single thing in his life. And as a result, he's got a very clear idea of like, cool, I was there. I did all this shit exactly. I know what it was. And then I got this result. Okay. Was that good or good enough or not enough? If not, then do I need to adjust some stuff where I'm wasting time and money and effort, adjust that and then continue. That is the most intelligent way like to logically move towards your goals. But it does kind of depend on your temperament. For me, I have a different strategy, which is I'm going to get it done, right? I'm not, I'm not a, I'm not a disciplined person in terms of getting up the right time or, you know, doing a little bit every day on something. Uh, it's not that I'm a procrastinator. It's that I tend to do things in intense blocks where I'm like, all right, for example,  this last 10 days I've been working on a launch on photo shoots on running a very, very intense 10 day workshop and buying a castle in Portugal and all sorts of other shit. Cause I mean, I'm in my intense period by summers and where I'm like, I buckle down, I get shit done. Even if it means staying up till five in the morning to make sure that that piece of copy is written or that video is made, I'll do it right. Because that's, that's my attitude is like, if I commit to doing something, I will do it no matter how I need to get there. And that's what served me over my life. I've just gone from thing to thing where I'm like, it's going to, I'm going to make this thing happen until sometimes a rich point. I'm like, there's no point in doing this thing. And that's, that's also a skill to be able to quit things at the right time. But overall, my strategy is I'm moving towards my actualization, my goals, my dreams all the time. Uh, and I'm doing it not necessarily in a particularly meticulous way, but I know that that's what I'm going to do and I will do what it takes to get there. So be aware of that away from pain. Yes, that'll get you moving. But towards pleasure, towards actualization, towards your dreams. That's the thing that keeps momentum going. Okay. Uh, question, which is how long will I do the Euro tour? I think you mean for how many, how much more long time, how many more years? Uh, I am winding down my career. I have a very, very clear exit plan. Uh, something that I don't like you guys. I do. And I love what I am doing, but I've been doing it a long time and I've got a lot of other big projects and I'm going to be moving into it in the coming years. So, uh, realistically I will be coaching live next year and a little bit the year after. So you've got about two years if you want to get on. Okay. Next question. I've been diving into meditation for a while and we'll be taking my first bit past the meditation retreat in two months. Are there any tips you would recommend to help you prepare for? Yes. So for anyone who doesn't know what that means, the past nut is a style of meditation and it is one of the styles that I have based a lot of the techniques that I teach in the martial meditation method. Oh, I've created more stripped down kind of street versions. So a version of the pasta, which is means that you're able to do it in a short amount of time and you can do it on the go. So yes, I highly recommend sitting down for 20 minutes or more or doing standing  static meditation where I'm in one position and I'm focusing in on myself. As you're like, as the one that's going to be most in depth, but at the same time when you learn, uh, an awareness or insight meditation such as the pasta, when you learn to redirect your focus properly, you can meditate more or less all the time. So I am doing micro meditations, checking in on myself many, many times in a day to keep myself calm, right to check in and go, I'm getting a bit stressed or I'm getting a bit in my head. And then I have these methods for bringing myself back to the present moment. So what this gentleman is talking about is a 10 day retreat called the pasta. And that's the style of meditation. And these are run all around the world. There's an organization, uh, that runs them and they are, I highly recommend them. I've done six of those in my life. The first one that I did when I was 18, 10 day silent retreat in India totally changed my life because in that 10 days I found my anger and I learned how it worked and I learned how to dissolve it. It was a really grueling, grueling 10 days. It's not an easy thing to do to go and sit for 10 days, 10 hours a day, silently 10 hours with breaks and you have a break every hour, but it's, it's various still to this day, probably the most challenging thing I've ever done, but the most reward. So my tips for you, uh, do exactly as you're told, go there and submit, give up all your own ideas because you don't know what you're talking about. And when you get in there, your mind will start trying anything it can get you out of it. And it gets creative. It'll just start spinning all sorts of. bullshit about how this is not for you and you're not good enough, the teacher's a liar and all this stuff. It'll do anything it can to get out of it because it doesn't want to sit down and be still. Uh, so commit that you're going in, you're not going to quit no matter what. And you're going to listen to the instructions and do as you're told. At the end of the retreat, if you decide that they were wrong, you don't want to do it, throw it out. Okay, fine. But you won't get the most powerful results if you're full of doubt and you're questioning it all the time. So that's the first thing. Leave your cynicism at the door. Your skepticism submits for teaching. It works. You don't have to agree with all the, all of the philosophical aspects. You don't have to take him board the Buddhist stuff if you don't want to. It works totally fine. You can be a Satanist and do the fast and it'll work fine. The next thing is sit up straight. Now I have an in depth video in the martial meditation method that shows you how to sit properly for a guy that's not super flexible. I'm pretty flexible for a 39 year old guy, but I can't do a full lotus. I can't put my knees in the ground with my legs across. So you need to understand how to sit properly, elevate your spine, cushions underneath it and sit up straight and try to stay still. The sooner you can enter physical stillness, the sooner you will be able to have mental stillness, fidgeting and trying to relieve the pressure all the time actually makes things worse. Right? So as best you can set posture in place, hold it for as long as you can. If after 10 minutes your knees are hurting and you need to change it, fine, but do it consciously. Don't be like, Oh fuck, that's painful. I got to change. It's like, okay, I'm consciously moving my legs, stretching it out, changing posture, resettling back. Then you can actually maintain the continuity of the meditation. So those are the main things. Sit up straight, stay still, don't leave. You'll hate me on day six. You'll love me on day 10. All right. This is good guys. I'm glad that people are asking meditation questions because that's what I wanted to talk about. What else? Okay. Oh yeah. There's a red pill question. I'll answer that one just because why not? Does it make sense for an under 18 year old man? Is this an underage boy here asking to get into a longterm relationship with a slightly older woman or will her hypergamy kick in later and she will just dump him? All right. There's a lot in that question. Let's see. Let's see how we can dissect it. Firstly, let's keep the hypergamy away from this for now. Like I think that's as an 18 year old guy, having that in your mind as a concept is not a great thing to have. I'm conflicted on this because on the one hand, okay, do women social climb sexually? Yeah. In some sense they do. Are they looking for men that trigger certain primary responses? Yes. But it's not as cutthroat and brutal as the red pill community suggests. I was talking about this at length with a bunch of friends and we were thinking about all of the students we've had, all of the friends we've had, and we were looking for evidence of the idea in red pill, which is hypergamy doesn't care. If a woman comes across a man that hits better metrics than the previous man, she'll dump him and upgrade. That's kind of the law when it comes to red pill thinking. And when I look over that, I've seen very little evidence of that actually happening. Of a girl being with a guy, she's with him, she's happy with him, he's a good boy. That's my boyfriend. And then she meets some other guy who's a bit stronger or has a bigger jaw or more money or something. And she's like, oh, well obviously I upgrade to the next best thing because that's my biological prerogative. That doesn't actually happen unless she really didn't give a shit about the previous guy. I think a large number of men who would complain about this stuff were shitty boyfriends, never really had the girl in the first place. I've been this guy and many girls have been this girl to me, stop gaps, someone to fuck in the meantime. And don't take that as a big insult. Some people have fucked me as a stop gap before they hooked up with their next boyfriend because I'm not their type. And because, okay, I can have sex with him and he's kind of fun, but I don't see him as a boyfriend. And so she uses me for that and moves on. That wasn't that she was being hypergamous necessarily with me and upgrading. It's just that I played a different role in her life from a guy that might be fulfilling more of a boyfriend role. The thing is, if a girl is in love with a guy, those chemicals don't switch off instantly. That's an 18 month at least explosion of endorphins that locks somebody in it and elevates their value 10X. If you've ever been in love and if your friends would honestly say what they thought about your girlfriend, they'll be like, okay, she's cute, but I don't really see why he's so insanely into it because you're not supposed to. There's some chemistry, there's some elements in your makeups that just make you super attracted to each other and squirts out all the love juice and then that rolls, right? So a girl's not going to be in love with a guy and then meet a guy who's got bigger biceps and go, oh, I better go off with him. So the main thing to keep in mind here is like, don't be complacent once you get in a relationship. That's often why girls get like hypergamously move on. It's because the guy stops working out, stops seducing him, stops doing foreplay. And same, you know, same with girls. If a girl stops shaving her armpits and wears ugly underwear and never initiate sex and, you know, it just becomes a drag, then you're going to lose attraction for it. So you need to maintain the polarity and attraction in the relationship in order to maintain it. Don't think that just because a girl committed to you and that she said, okay, we're together, your job's done. Seduction is an ongoing process. You need to be able to seduce your partners over and over and over again in order if you want to keep the spark alive. So I wouldn't worry about the hypergamy thing, but I also wouldn't be getting into a, deciding to get into a long-term relationship. Like that's a bad idea in the first place to decide to be in a long-term relationship. You just get in a relationship with somebody and you start navigating it and negotiating it and over some time you're like, this is cool. I like this. I'm going to stay here. And then you stay there. And then, okay, maybe at some point we need to have a discussion about, we do, about what is the commitments and are we moving in? Don't move in together. Don't do it. It doesn't matter if it's cheaper rent, you'll break up faster. It sucks. So don't do it. Um, okay. So we need to negotiate the parameters of the relationship. All right. This is where we're at right now. Cool. We're not fucking other people. You know, this is, this is my boundaries. This is how I want to do things. And then we continue and a month later we're still here and we still like each other. Let's keep going. That's my view. I don't go, I'm going to have a long-term relationship. You don't know what it's going to be like. Don't force it to be in a box. And then if she's a bit older than you, so do you. Enjoy some time with her. But your first girlfriend, when you're 18, it's going to usually be, you're going to make mistakes. Let's put it like that. Relationships are a skill like anything else. You're not going to do the first one and it's going to be perfect. Okay. Maybe it may be sweet and innocent. You may love each other and there may be some lovely things, but you don't know how to manage a woman really. You don't know how to deal with her mood swings, with her sexuality, uh, the compromise of two people being together. So I would generally suggest your first relationship, don't stay in it for many, many years. My first one I was in for four years, should have been two. I still like her. She's a good friend of mine, but those last two years we shouldn't have done that. In this way, you get some relationship experience, you make the mistakes, you figure out what works and doesn't work. And also you're starting to learn about what type of women you want and what kind of relationships you want. And then you go through the seducer cycle once again, and then move on and get better and better with it over time. All right. What else do we want to talk about? Well, this is a big question. Do I really need women to be happy? And how good should I get at seduction until I can stop cold approach? This guy's looking for any way out. Well, happiness. That's a funny one. Happiness is not a permanent state. I don't know anyone who's always happy. I know people who are very good at being satisfied and drawing enjoyment out of whatever's happening in their life. However, to try and keep happiness, happiness is a peak state. Happiness is fireworks and balloons and this amazing thing happened and cool. Enjoy those things. And overall, you're looking to create a life which brings more happiness to you, of course. And then the question is, do I need women to be happy? Not necessarily, but you need to be able to choose to not have women if that's what you want. So I have done this at points in my life and I know people have done it for long periods. Chosen celibacy for a while. So I've chosen it when I've gone off to do spiritual retreats usually. So I go to the Amazon or China or into a meditation retreat with no chicks and I'm non-sexual for this block of time I choose to be because I want to direct my focus, my energy, my sexual energy into something else. We do this at work sometimes. We go and lock in when no one's allowed to bring their girlfriends and we just go and do the thing. So choosing or choose like you've come out of a, let's say you had a really awful breakup and your heart's shattered. It's okay to take some time to heal and renew. It's not a good idea to take lots of time to just fall in a heap and drink yourself into a stupor and wear the same underwear for a week. Being aware that a heartbroken man is not attractive. He is not a great prospect for women because he's needy and sooky and carrying baggage. So you want to be able to try and process that fairly quickly. But that may mean taking some time away from women totally and being with yourself and going through a healing process. So in that sense, it's not that you need to be surrounded by women every day of your life to be happy. That you need to have this constant pursuit and I think that's what we're getting at. Do I need to keep doing this day game grind forever? And the answer is no. Like when you learn it, you do it super intensely and that may take a year or so to get competent at. And then you're doing it a lot because you're meeting different girls. They're flaking. You're going on dates and you get this girl in bed and then she vanishes and you have this fuck buddy, but she's not exactly what you want. There's all this process of like, I need to approach girls to bring new women into my life, to upgrade them, to learn more about the skills that I need. And you do that until a point where it is like riding a bicycle. I do not need to go out every day and practice approaching to still have good approaches. I've done more than enough. My confidence is more or less good enough most of the time. Yeah. Like when I remember coming out of the Amazon jungle in Peru, I'd been drinking Ayahuasca with Sasha for a couple of weeks and we went to Buenos Aires and I was just like, I wanted to go and meet girls. And I was like, oh shit. I tried to talk to somebody and I was really not in the right space and it took me a day. And then by the end of the day I was back in, that's because I'd gone, I'd spent three weeks in psychedelic space deep in the jungle in my own world and then I'm coming out into a big city trying to connect with women and humans again. Yeah. That took a little bit of time, but that's the level where I can, I know for the rest of my life, you know, I might be a bit rusty for a couple of hours, but I'll get it back. Now I got to that point by years of, of meticulously doing it. Well, not meticulously. I didn't do it in like I do X per day. It was just like, I do this every day. I get it done. Every day I meet some girls, one girl, a couple of girls, feeling good, I meet some more. So yes, you, you absolutely do need to get this skill handled. So that's where you need to be wary when you've started out on this journey, you're doing it and it's, it's difficult at first and many times it's not pleasant and there's even if it's really awesome, it's not pleasant. It's lots of rejection. There's lots of not getting what you want, getting what you need, which is the reference and the learnings, but not necessarily getting what you want and, and your mind, again, will look for ways to keep you safe. And so if you're coming up with these ideas of like, do I really need women to keep, to be happy? Am I, aren't I just chasing gratification, my ego and trying to prove myself and looking for negative reasons why you're doing this to find a reason not to do it. And I've had guys who've been like, when I'm chatting to them in some social situation, nothing to do with business and they find out what to do and they're like, oh yeah, you know, yeah, I got my own thing, you know, I just like, you know, I don't like to try too hard with it. I just like to let things happen naturally. And then I usually say, oh cool, how's, when was the last time you got laid from that technique? Oh, it's not about getting laid for me. It's more about having a connection. Okay. So how do you get connections? And if you see a girl you want to have a connection with, how do you do that? Right? So these are, you'll be wary of these excuses coming in that, that create some philosophical reason why you should not do this. The final answer to that question is if you're a man who's heterosexual and has a decent sex drive and has a desire to be with humans, you're not sociopathic, then you will not be happy long-term if you do not have the ability to bring the partners that you want into your life. The partner or partners, right? If you are unable to have choice in your romantic and sexual life, you will not be happy. So in that way, it's vitally important because the alternative is waiting around to see which girl turns up in your university course. Most guys out there, you'll get laid, you'll have a boyfriend, girlfriend, you'll have a girlfriend at some point. But if you're just waiting for chance or social circle to deliver it to you, you'll be choosing from a pool of one or five or 10 girls maybe, right? If you've got a really awesome social circle, maybe there's 15 cool girls in there of which seven of them have boyfriends of which five of them don't like you, and then you've got a choice of maybe two. That's not enough. The guys I'm working with today have the whole city at their disposal. They are living in abundance, whereas 10 days ago they weren't because they now have the ability to go up and start a conversation and get something happening with a stranger. So that's my answer. When can you stop approaching? When you don't need to approach because you've got enough awesome women or an awesome woman in your life and you want to stay with her for a while and your skills are honed enough that even if you don't approach for some time, you might be a bit rusty, but you'll still be able to do it. All right. All right. James, you are very touching. I listen to your videos when I'm cleaning. Please don't die. That's awesome, Ellie. That's one of the best compliments I've had. Please don't die because I listen to you when I'm cleaning. All right. I plan not to die anytime soon. Next question. I find myself when my mind and emotions are..."}
