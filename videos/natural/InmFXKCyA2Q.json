I've heard it said before that you can't ask dating or seduction advice from a woman because it's like asking a fish how to catch a fish instead of asking the fisherman. And if you think about that logically, that's a really fucked up analogy because it assumes that women are a prey that doesn't want to be caught, and that's a really bad mindset to go into seduction. So it's actually more like asking a fish how it likes to be fucked by other fish. So that's what it's really like. So it is my belief that yes, you certainly can get insight from talking to women about their desires and that is definitely how I learned a lot of my seduction abilities was talking to women. And of course, not all women. There's plenty of women just like men who are completely unaware, who don't really know why they have certain motivations, who are very reactive. And then there's also women that are very insightful and very intuitive and understand and can verbalize what it is that they like and want. So in the lead up to the re-release of the five principles of natural seduction, which is my overarching thematic model for teaching seduction that I teach in my live courses and in this online course, I decided to sit down with five very beautiful, very interesting and intelligent women, myself interviewing them one-on-one and then Travel Bum talking to them as a big group and having some interesting and fun dialogue. And we recorded over seven, eight hours worth of these in-depth interviews. Today I'm releasing some of the highlights, some of the snippets, behind the scenes material. And I hope you guys enjoy this because it gives you some interesting insights into what's going on inside the female mind. A lot of this reinforced, reaffirmed what it is that we teach at TNL and there were also some interesting surprises as well. So please enjoy Inside the Brain of Hot Girls on TNL Couch. Well firstly, do you have experiences where men come and approach you in, let's say, whatever on the streets or in a cafe or in bars or clubs? Is that something that's happened to you in your life? No, not really. Okay, so you've never had a man come up on the street and say, like, I saw you there, I thought, you know, you look cute, I wanted to talk to you or something like that? No, only in parties. Okay. Yeah. If you had, if a man was to do that, let's say, and he did it in a good way, okay, so he wasn't creepy or weird, but if he did come and speak to you on the street, do you think you would chat to him? Would you be open to that? Yeah, I would love that. Because I think it's more easier to contact with girls in this way, not just in parties. And I would think that, okay, if he is good looking and interesting and anything and not creepy, I would say that, oh, okay, he's really confident. Okay. I would love that. You mentioned the word creepy. What does that mean to you? How do you know if a guy's creepy? What tells you he's creepy, as opposed to confident? Well, it is creepy when somebody's just staring for minutes and not talk to me and he's just not coming to me, just staring. That is really creepy, I think. So you've had that experience, I guess. Yes. Yes. Many times on the bus or anywhere on the street. Right. But if a man was to come in, let's say there's two situations. A man comes and says, oh, hi, do you know what the time is or where is the Starbucks or something? He's asking some random question. Or he comes over and says, I saw you there, I think you look really adorable. What's your name? Which one's better and why? I think the last one would be better because then I would know that, yeah, he really wants to meet me and not just asking some silly questions. Right. Okay. So much better to be clear than to use some excuse. Yes. Let's say in a normal day, let's say a Friday, from starting work through to going out and partying with the girls later at night, what kind of attention would you usually be getting during one day? On the streets from the workers. Sometimes they, you know, like... They whistle? Yeah. That's the same everywhere in the world. It's hilarious. It's the only country in the world they do that, right? In the metro, sometimes, you know, there's men smiling at me. Some shop assistants flirting sometimes. What is it? What does it feel like to do that? Like to have every day being something where you're the object of people's attention? Like does that affect you in some way? You know, when I just, you know, when I go to somewhere and really just disappear or just go to the gym and really just, you know, don't look at me, then it's not good. It feels awkward sometimes. And it's also not good when, let's say, I'm standing in a line and there is in front of me a middle-aged chubby woman and the guy is asking me what I want and she was the first in Starbucks. Right. It's not good attention and this is not a good feeling for me. So yeah. So this is, for me, it's not a nice feeling. Like the same with drinks because I feel that I own something and I don't like this feeling. I can buy this if I want and you don't, I don't know you. So why are you giving me drinks or free fries or free, you know, like advantages? Because it's not really free. Yeah, because they expect something back. But believe me, if I'm interested in you, I will act the same way if you give me a drink or if you don't. I would say in the afternoon I usually go to the gym. Yeah, there is some attention also from other guys, but, you know, this attention is not like they don't come to me. I just feel that they look, that they might, you know, ask some questions but, or start a conversation, but it's nothing like they don't ask me to go out or sometimes, you know, they may add me on Facebook and then they are starting to message me and then they're, you know, like asking me out, etc. But at night, yeah, that is the only time when they actually, you know, like they know that they... When they're drunk and they have the courage to finally come and talk to you. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So, and then we add to that all the social media, you have more attention coming there as well. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So on a normal day, you've got, I don't know, many, many men showing some kind of interest in you, sexual interest in you, like whether that's a look or asking a question, a comment or like, there's plenty of it. Yeah. Okay. I mean, this is interesting for my clients to know this because like I'm a good looking man, but I get, if I'm carefully watching, maybe I notice three girls in a day looking at me. So it's like the amount of attention that even a good looking man gets is tiny compared to what a good looking girl is getting. So I think we don't understand that there's this huge amount of, and maybe it's not great attention, maybe it's kind of cheap attention. Yeah, usually. Do you care if a guy came and spoke to you and was clearly nervous, but was being honest, would that bother you? No. No. It's happened before. Yeah. I mean, it's going to be really cute. Yeah. And, and guys don't fake being nervous to try and get the girl either. Okay. Let's, let's go back in time to before you, with your boyfriend, uh, did you, did you ever meet men who randomly approached you? So did you ever go on dates with guys who either came and spoke to you on the street or maybe spoke to you in a social situation, a bar or a club or something like that? Uh, yeah. Or do you have like some hard rule where you're like, I would never go on a date with a stranger? No, actually never happened to me. You mean guys never came and approached you? No, no. Like out of blue. I'm like, you know, sitting like, you know, at the, at the bar or restaurant, um, or like street. Never happened? No. That's an outrage. It's a scandal. If a man had of at some point in your life, come up to you when you were single and was not a jerk and spoke to you in a respectful way and was showed that he was interested in you. Would you have gone on a date with him? Probably? Maybe? Yeah. Sure. Why not? All right. Well, that's a, that's a tragedy. Oh, I should have said no. No, no, no. It's the point we're getting across to the guys is go and approach girls on the street because they are open to it. What I would say is, because the assumption is most men think that if a woman is attractive, that she has, uh, all the attention she wants, that she has all the options that she wants, that there's no point in him going and talking to her because she's, it would be a waste of his time because she would reject him cold. Um, so all the reasons the guys didn't come and speak to you when they could have, and it's, and you know, you would have said yes to some of them, uh, they just didn't take that action. So that's the, that's the whole crux of what our business is, is, is teaching guys to take that action. Go and speak to a girl on the street or in a coffee shop or in the bar. Uh, and like where to find a girlfriend, like go to public library, something like that. Well, you can find a girlfriend anywhere. That's the thing. It's like any, anywhere, as long as you know roughly how to do it, there's good ways to do it. There's bad ways. Obviously whistling at a girl on the street is not good idea. No, that's like, that's already turned off. Yeah. So, okay. So let's say hypothetically, if you were single, how would you like to be approached by a guy? Like say whatever you're sitting in a, on a park bench reading a book, what would be a good way for him to do that? I like to be, obviously I would like to be impressed, you know, like right, right away. So what would be impressive in that moment? Is it impressive at all that he came and spoke to you at all? Like, is that showing some kind of bravery or? Well, I think the way a guy would, you know, like speak to me, the way would, would like either impress me or not. So if a guy, you know, like approaches me like saying like, Oh my God, like the girl of my dreams, something like that. Yeah. That would be like a little funny and maybe impressive and, but once again, if a guy approaches and asks, you see the intention in his eyes that he's kind of like interested, but he asks like trivial questions, like what time is it? Something like that. Don't, don't, don't bother because that's, if you want to like, to, to get an acquainted, yeah. Just, just approach and, and show your intention. So tell me what's, what makes a good lover? What makes a man good in bed? If he's open-minded and he's not that egoistic, you know, that he can admit that, okay, maybe this was not that good, but I can ask you that why, why wasn't it good for you? And he's interested. What is good for me? That's the most important. What are some areas that you think men misunderstand you or, and or women? Like an area where you're like, I wish men would just understand this. I wish that they would understand that we, we don't expect that much that they think, let's what you said about the bed, I think, uh, it's just, you know, they put the pressure, it's in their head. Of course we expect more than two or three minutes, but it's, it's, you know, two new people meeting. It's not going to be perfect for the first time. And there is, you know, we are just human, so it's easy to solve if we speak, but, um, it's awkward sometimes. I know. Like what, what makes with man a good fuck? What's makes him good in bed? Okay. That he's not selfish, but, uh, if he wants something, just, you know, say if he wants or us, then just don't put my head there. Just, you know, like there are many ways to, to suggest it, suggest it. Um, let's, I think to, to care, not to, to use me as a thing. Even if it's like a short term thing, like even if you never see the guy again, what would be the best way for him to treat you? Like let's just say, okay, you meet at a train station and you're both passing different directions and you're never going to see each other again, but you have an attraction and so you sleep with the person. There's obviously a good way to do that in a bad way. I think the good ways to, if he, if he doesn't want to spend the night with me, I mean to actually sleep with me, uh, then, then he should suggest my place because then he can leave when he wants. And there is no awkward morning for him because I think many girls, they, they want to sleep with, with someone. So if we have sex, we don't, we don't want to run away mainly, I think. And if he's into, to sleep actually together, then, you know, we should go to his home, his apartment. He should be like really respectful with me and not to judge because I'm spending the night with him. And if I don't, then, you know, like. Yeah, you mean, you don't want to be judged as a slut or whatever because of your decision. It's so like, then if he thinks that, then yeah, then really, I don't want to be there because it's not for, I don't judge to him. Um, okay. What about dominance in the bedroom? Is that something that's appealing to you or not appealing to you? Yeah. The dominant should be the man. In my opinion. Sure. Sure. So, okay. So that's something that you respond to very well. Like if a man is dominant physically and he's clear about telling you what to do. Yeah. In a relationship there are, you know, it can be a common fantasy, but in a one night stand, I think it's a very risky thing to be dominant or not because it can show also that you don't respect, you don't handle it well, but in a relationship, yeah, if, if, you know, if it's a common thing and if he likes to do that and I like, like it also, then it can work. Right. And if you're in a situation where you trust the person, you know that they respect you, then you, then you feel much more comfortable to be submissive or to like have him take control. Yeah. Whereas, you know, in a short term thing, you might be worried about your safety or how he perceives you, sorry, how, what he thinks about you. Yeah. Okay. I think a lot of guys think that to be good in bed means you have a lot of technical skills, right? So some special G-spot massage and where the clitoris is and you research some particular sequence of events, maybe like, okay, ABC steps. Is that a way to be a great lover, do you think? Every woman works differently, so, which is good for me, maybe not good for someone else, but also, you know, it's very, very, very different with every woman. I think really, like, I'm just talking with my girlfriend and someone can come in a like totally different way that I would never, I would be never able to. So the importance then is that he needs to communicate. He needs to ask if it's good and I need, I'm willing to give sign that it's good or not, but he shouldn't think that if he made a girl come with something, then it's going to work the exact same way with another girl, because it's not. Are you like, does a dominant man, physically dominant man, is that interesting to you, not interesting to you? Yeah, yeah, it is. I mean, I like it when someone just grabs me and puts me in a bed or whatever is there. It's like, I like to be dominated a bit, but not, not too much, but like a little bit of like hair pulling and I don't know what, that's fine. Yeah, BDSM 101, basic choking, spanking, hair pulling. Is it like, of course those things are dependent on certain factors, right? Yeah. What are those factors for you? So, I mean, yeah, unlikely it's going to be with any random person that you just met, but like what, what, what do you need to have or what parameters or what container do you need to have to be able to explore that side? Well, it's like, it's something that I, I don't really talk about. I want to talk about it when I'm in a relationship, but I need to have some trust and I need to feel safe around that person to talk about it. And of course it depends on what, what is his reaction because there was one guy in the past who I told that, okay, I like this, but I didn't tell him anything really serious. I just told him that, I don't know, just some spanking or something. And he reacted very badly that it's some, some disgusting thing that I wanted to do and it's not, it's not normal. So yeah, I, I, um, I need some trust. Like I need, that's the most important thing for me. So the trust is mostly around his judgment. Like you need to be, you need to feel like he's not going to judge you for that. Not only the judgment, it's also like, yeah, well of course after a few weeks you're going to know that, but he's not going to strangle me to death or something. So it's about like really trusting him with being nice and not hurting me and stopping if I tell him to stop, you know? But for me, I think it's, yeah, when, when sex is really great, then it helps me to, to get a bit more connected with my body. Let's talk about that then. So what is it that makes a man a good lover then? Um, this is a cliche, but I think that communication is the most important thing because if you can speak openly about anything about sex, then it's, it's going to be great because, you know, you just have to really communicate what you want and what you need. And of course there are some people who are naturally really good with each other, but, but usually there are some problems at first or some things that you don't like. Um, yeah, so I would say that that communication is the most important thing. Uh, so what are, what about this, this dynamic of dominance and submission? So if it's something that you've said, you're curious, obviously within a context where you feel safe and comfortable, um, what is it that's interesting about that to you? I knew it really early that I like it and I really enjoy it. And um, I couldn't tell why it's interesting for me. What does it feel like to, to be in someone else's power like that? It feels awesome. I don't know. I mean, um, it feels, it feels really, it's a really big turn for me if I, if I'm completely like sensitive and I know sensitive is not the right word, like vulnerable, you know? So for example, if I'm tied up or something, it's really, it's really up to him what he wants to do to me. So it's like, it's absolutely his choice and it's, uh, it's an amazing feeling for me because Is it to do with the fact that he, that you're pleasing him so much or that he's, um, like that you're an object of his desire or something like that? Yeah, it's not really a feminist thing to say. Look, I know. So yeah, sometimes it feels like really, it's like, um, as if I was just an object of his neat desires and, and, um, yeah, it's weird. I was just thinking about that, but usually I don't get turned on because I see that he likes it. It's just coming from me. So it's because there are some situations where, where obviously I get turned on because I see that he loves what we're doing or what I'm wearing or I don't know. And I just get turned on because he's turned on, but this is absolutely not, this is just about me. All right. So what makes a good lover and also what makes a bad lover? Uh, all right. Um, I think once again, confidence. So, uh, regardless of the body type, you know, like fat thing, super skinny, you know, like bulked up, you know, like with a bare belly and, uh, the guy should be confident in his skin. So like if a guy, you know, like just had sex and like running, running, running away from me, like covering his, you know, like junk with a blanket, while that's kind of like, what, what's wrong with you, dude, I've seen naked guys. That's okay. That's not a problem. And, uh, so confidence. So if a guy wants to walk around naked, by all means that that's fine. Uh, um, so that, uh, and I think, um, prone to find my experiences. That's what I, I think would make obviously good lover, uh, a person who wants to improve person who looks for something new or like interesting and, uh, not just, you know, like one position and that's what all we doing that's, yeah, that, that will be a problem. In the early stages of, let's say you meet a guy and you're having a date or you're, you're, you know, the early stages before you sleep together the first time, um, is it a good idea for him to touch you or is it a good idea for him to wait until he's got very clear permission or to wait three dates before he tries to kiss you? Or do you prefer things to happen physically to happen fairly quickly or to that there's some very clear step by step thing? I think a man should really notice when a girl wants him to touch her. What do you think are your signals for you? If you, if you want a man to touch you, how, how are you different than when you don't want to? Biting my lips. Yeah, that's one and the long eye contact and, um, also I always touch him first. In terms of a man physically escalating touch on you, so let's say from, from only from originally meeting you through to going and kissing you the first time, what's the best way to go about that? Do you find it, would you, do you like it if a guy expressly verbally asked permission every time he wants to touch you? Is it something that should be happening gradually and, and kind of intuitively, like how, how do you like to, a man to progress physically with you? I don't like it when someone asks for permission. It's not so romantic and it's, uh, it's, you know, you, I think you should feel it or you should just do what you want to do. Like in terms of like the first case, it's usually, usually both of you feel that it's going to happen, I think. So you don't need to ask for permission or if I don't want it, I'm not going to kiss you. So it's, I don't know. So I think asking for permission is, is not really not, not turning anyone on. Not sexy, not, not romantic whatsoever. If you, let's say you went on one date, two dates, maybe three, if you really thought he was interesting and he's not making a move, he's not touching you, he's not getting close to you, he's not looking at you with clear intention, uh, is this ruining the sexual tension? Is this ruining his chances? Well, I think at that point I would start, you know, like kind of like questioning myself, is it something wrong with me? Am I like not, you know, like attractive enough or like maybe something is wrong with me. So at that point I would like start thinking, uh, like what's, what's going on. Like maybe I need to dress, you know, like more provocative. I don't know. Maybe, maybe the guy's waiting for me to make a move, but I mean how he wants me like, you know, to tell let's, let's, let's kiss or like let's have sex. I'm fine. I'm ready. So you're free to touch me. I don't know what, what kind of messages a guy can, can expect. I guess he needs kind of like to, to make a move. You know, like I'm not talking about like, you know, grabbing, grabbing me, like forcing to do something, but you know, like a slight move and then see whether, you know, like it's, um, whether he received the same in return if the girl says no. And if the guys sees that it's like a really 100% no, no, just, just, just leave it be. But if the girl is kind of like, um, yes, but well, okay, you, you have a chance. For you, what are, what are the qualities in a man that are most important? To be loyal and to be honest and, uh, to be mature enough. To be mature enough. Yeah. Yes, yes, yes. Because, um, I'm living on my own for, I don't know, four years now. And that's why I cannot date with somebody, somebody who is in still college or something like that. And what is it? What does a mature, how do you know a man's mature aside from if he has a house or some other thing like that? Well, I think one thing is that we can discuss about anything like, like our sexual life, the sexual problems that we have, or what can we, what we can change about our sexual life. I think that's the most important. So I know that he's mature enough to talk about our relationships and he doesn't afraid to share his emotions. And I know chemistry is kind of a hard thing to define, but how do you know when you feel chemistry? Like what's the proof to you? For me that I can stop thinking about, um, kissing him. Yeah. That's the first sign. Yeah. That's a good sign. In our heart. And so we can just feel if somebody, uh, is the same as we are, but chemistry means that I am always open to talk with that somebody and I can never get bored with him and, um, and then I can, um, have sex with him a lot of times. Yes. Do you think there's things that a man can do to affect that, to change it? I think with his confidence, yeah. What about his attention and presence? That's a good point. That can help also. Yes. For me, it's really important to eye contact. I think that's the most important, but it's also, um, important to touch me sometimes so that I can feel that, yeah, he's listening and he feels like I am attractive for him and things like that. Yes. Okay. So why is it that if a man is confident, why do you care? Like what does that do for you? Okay. Let's say I'm confident, like that's good for me, but why is that interesting to you? For me, because, um, once I had a boyfriend and he never talked. It was like entertaining myself. It was so boring. I mean, I'm not boring, but you know, when I'm just keep talking and talking and he doesn't have any opinion about anything, that is really boring. And I think it was because he didn't have confidence and he couldn't express his feelings or his opinion or, or anything he is interested in. So."}
