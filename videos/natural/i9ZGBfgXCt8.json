Now today's video is very off-topic. It's about the conflict in Ukraine, the war in Ukraine. So if you're new here, or if you're someone who comes to this channel very specifically for information about dating and lifestyle, then feel free to skip this video because it's not about that today and we'll be going back to our usual programming tomorrow. So as many of you know, myself and a lot of the TNL crew have been based out of Kiev, Ukraine over the last couple of years coming in and out, teaching there and living there, and people were asking, you know, are we safe? So firstly to let you know that yes, the TNL crew are safe. Most of us were not there at the time, although Shea Matthews was there when the war started and he and our friend Michael and his girlfriend and her mother got in a car and drove out of Kiev whilst the conflict was going. It took them about 60 hours to cross Ukraine and to get over the border safely into Budapest, which is where they are now. However, of course, there are many, you know, there's a whole country that is trapped and a lot of our friends, colleagues, employees, and their families are of course still trapped in Ukraine. And we've been working around the clock since this started to try and help people get out to settle them on the other side of the border here in Hungary and also to use our networks to connect with students and people that we know to offer accommodation in Poland and Romania and all sorts of different support, which people have been amazing at delivering. Shea has been an incredible hero since he left, started trying to leave Kiev. He got online and built up a network of people both on the ground, internationally, to start helping to coordinate all sorts of logistics. And there are many, you know, there are thousands of grassroots organisations that have popped up with people on all the eastern borders, on this side of the conflict, on the inside we have people who are going around delivering food and rescuing cats and all sorts of really heroic behaviour. So Shea has been really pivotal in organising that and since he's arrived, we've managed to get out eight, no, nine Ukrainians in total so far. I've been hosting some here, looking to put more people at the farm in Portugal very soon, and we've been also helping to get some people to friends and LDA members who are offering accommodation in places like Poland. So that's the situation that we're currently dealing with and I wanted to bring this up to you guys to let you know what's happening and also to appeal to you and ask you for help. Now in the last 15 years of running this channel, I've never made a direct appeal to the audience to ask for material help, but I'm doing that today. So myself and Shea are currently bankrolling nine people and we have many more arriving in the next couple of days. We will be locating them, we're feeding them, we're clothing them and this will be a longer-term thing, right? So there are, as you know, there are a million refugees, there's likely to be another four or more million coming in in the coming days and weeks and months and the response on the European side has been incredible in that anyone who comes through is, you know, looked after and let in. Some basic services are provided but what we are doing is trying to locate people and look after them for as long as it takes. So, you know, currently that's nine people and there is going to be more people arriving. So I have a big apartment, I have a big house in Portugal, I can pack it out with women, their children, their mothers. This is the types of people that obviously we're dealing with at the moment, but we are going to need support longer term. So I'm putting this to you guys. Again, if you're new here, disregard this. If you don't know me and you don't trust me, then please do not donate money. I'm asking the guys that have been following us for years that know that we have integrity and know that what we're doing here is aiming to help. So I'm asking for donations from you guys, which will be spent directly on food, clothing, housing, transport for people who are arriving in Budapest and then wherever we need to put them on to from there. And we're also still sending money to people in Ukraine to basically pay for food and train tickets and whatever they need to try and help them survive and get out. So that's what we are currently doing. We're giving as much of our resources as we physically can, but we would really appreciate any help. So what that means is we've set up Patreon link. You guys can sign up for recurring payments of whatever it is that you want. If you want to make a one-time payment, do that through PayPal. Anything helps, 50 bucks, 100 bucks. That means that's a shopping trip, you know, that's some clothes. That's a night of accommodation for someone who's moving through Moldova and Romania, which we're having tomorrow. So all those little pieces of cash support will go directly to the people that we're supporting. Every single cent will be spent on that and I'm happy to do an update in three or four weeks to let you guys know what's happening with that, how we spent the money and how the people are going who we've been helping. So if you would like to donate something, then the links are in the description. Patreon for recurring, PayPal if you've got a one-time thing. Revolut if you have it is ideal because that money goes directly to us. We can punch it straight to people in Ukraine. Whereas Patreon and PayPal will go through the business and takes a bit longer for us to access the cash. If anyone wants to make larger donations, the better thing to do is to send a direct international bank transfer to my Portuguese bank account. So those are your options and for the guys out there who know us and trust us that we are here to do a good thing and I'm promising you that every single cent that comes to us is being spent on the Ukrainians that we're helping. Then that is much, much appreciated. I know everyone's very aware of the situation, but you know if you're in countries that are further away, it can seem like kind of a TV show. But as we're meeting the refugees coming in with horrific stories of leaving, you know, leaving their husbands, their fathers, leaving every single thing behind, you know, observing explosions and the terror of escaping through a war. This is extremely, you know, it's imminent, it's real, it's horrific and people need help. The other thing is if you happen to be in a country that's on one of the borders, Romania, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Moldova, and you have spare room, like we have people who need places to stay. I can host as many as I can host, but there is going to be many, many more people coming. So if you've got a spare room in Warsaw or Bucharest, or you can host people even if it's for a few nights, or even if you can meet people at the train and just, you know, look after them and help them buy them lunch, get them to their next train or wherever they need to go. These kinds of things make a massive difference to people who are fleeing in terror with nothing. So if anyone has, like, material support they can provide in that way, you can contact me directly on my Telegram. I'll put the link in the description as well. So please don't just write asking random questions, but if it's like, hey James, I've got two bedrooms free in this town for X amount of nights, I can host or I can pick people up or I can provide food or whatever, please contact us and we will punch that information through to whoever else that needs it. The other information that's important for you guys out there is that we've decided to move all of the locations, all of our workshops from, which was obviously originally Kiev, and then Budapest, and now we're moving those to Barcelona. Right now I'm here in Budapest, everything is fine, everything, life is going on as normal, but understandably people around the world are pretty worried about coming right to the, you know, the border of a war, and so they don't want to do workshops here, fair enough. So we have moved all our workshops to Barcelona, so keep that in mind if you're thinking of doing training with us, we will be continuing, we need the funding, and we'll be doing this coming up very soon in Barcelona, so you can check the links in the description for all workshop details as well. And the final thing I wanted to say is that after this video, we will be going back to our normal programming. This is not a political channel, you know, everyone knows what's going on, I think, in the world, you guys can do your research and make your own conclusions. But, you know, we are still a lifestyle design and seduction company, and we will still be releasing material from tomorrow and the next day. So I, you know, I have mixed feelings about that, because I'm living in a, you know, one extreme reality, but on the other side, we are running a business, we are providing a service, and you guys come here for certain types of information, and we will continue to deliver that in the coming weeks. We had some episodes of a documentary about Kiev, which we decided obviously not to screen at the moment. But yes, you know, from tomorrow onwards, you'll have our usual programming of lifestyle design, intergame, sexuality, and so on. So that's all from me for now. Thank you for the messages of support, and thank you in advance for anyone who's willing to help us in any material way. This makes a big difference directly to people's lives today, and tomorrow. I'm filming this... What date is it today? Today is the 6th of March, so we'll be releasing this today or tomorrow. So this is, you know, real-time stuff that's happening. We've got people here now, we're feeding them, we're housing them, we need help, so do what you can. And if you don't want to help through us, then please donate through any of the other organisations around the world. Medicine Sense, Frontiers, Red Cross, these kinds of people that are on the ground delivering, you know, medical help and food is needed as well. So everyone, please do what you can, even if it's, you know, 50 bucks, even if it means just not going out for dinner one week or any way that you can help is going to make very, very direct real-time effects in people's lives. So thank you very much, gentlemen, and we'll see you in our next video about how to pick up chicks or something. This is James Marshall, passing out and signing out. Thank you."}
