One is the achiever, in my example here, and another is maybe a fun-loving, more childlike part that just wants to be in the moment and go ride your bicycle or something. You're inside your mind in this, you know, this asylum. There's different parts coming out like, but I don't know. Oh, absolutely. You two, I think you're awesome as well. You're right. You're fucking sexy. You, not so much. Just keep in the background. It's a really important point. It's about loving yourself. And I think very important to emphasize loving the bits of yourself that you don't like as well. I've often had clients say to me things like, I need to crush the old me, or I need to obliterate the beta version. I used to think that way. And isn't it such a terrible thing? It's like, imagine a therapist telling you, okay, what you need to do is destroy all evidence. Basically, you're not good enough, so let's get rid of that old you. Destroy everything. Okay, the bits I don't like about you is everything. So let's kill that and replace it. Are you insane? And I've had guys very sincerely say that. And I understand why, you know, because they're like the behaviors and the emotional reactivity and the clothes and the body or whatever of the person I've been so far, I haven't gotten what I wanted. And so that therefore, these things are not good enough. And I need to destroy them. And I need to hate them. I need to actually hate elements of myself. And then, of course, you're at war with yourself. This is not a positive or healthy way to view your own development. So maybe talk a little bit about that. Like, how do you extend love to parts of yourself that you don't like, you know, that you're scared of, or that you find, you know, that there's this shame and guilt and fear related to it. Or there is, and there's things that are true. You know, you are lazy, or you are an addict, or you are, you do get angry too much, or you do retreat from the world and hide, which is, it's proven because you know you were there. And so how do I extend love to parts of myself, which I know should be changed, or they're just old calcified parts that, you know, I didn't, I wasn't consciously creating, but got created through childhood and so on. Yeah. Wow. You ask the best questions, James. We're covering so much ground because your questions are so awesome. So yeah, this is a fantastic one. And I'll start by saying your true self already knows how to love all of your parts, including the ones that you currently are judging as undesirable. And the problem is that when you consider them to be undesirable, you're judging them from another part of you, not your true self. And what that means, in case that's too much IFS therapy jargon there, is that the first thing to realize is that all of your parts have positive intention, even the addict parts, even I would even go out on a limb to say, even the psychopathic parts. So maybe a part like the Joker, somebody who does some heinous crime or even enjoys inflicting pain. At some level, doing that act was trying to deal with some kind of emotional shit that you didn't know how else to deal with it. Definitely with the addict, hopefully people understand how that starts and keeps going is as a coping mechanism, right? Like life sucks or there's like some crap that happened in life. And having, you know, taking a drink, getting a drink takes the edge off. And then the edge comes back and you keep having to get more drinks. But the intention was good. You want to not feel so bad anymore. And there's a part of you that jumps in and says, hey, try this. This will help you not feel bad. The intention was good. They didn't want you to feel bad. And you start with, okay, this part that is very neurotic now and is harmful and destructive in its behavior had originally a positive intention. It just isn't doing it the right way. Or maybe when it started, it was good, but then it went way overboard. Right. And that's like an achiever. Achievement is great to a certain extent. But if you just go overboard with almost anything, it will be bad. And you start with a positive intent. And then any part that relates to that part that you're targeting in a negative way, like a judge saying, man, that fucking achiever, he's getting in the way of me enjoying my life. And that's another part. That's the part that is polarized with the achiever part. And then you can, you should pay attention to that part too. Like, oh, I wonder what part that is that doesn't like the achiever. Now you've got two parts of you. One is the achiever in my example here. And another is maybe a fun loving, more childlike part that just wants to just be in the moment and go ride your bicycle or something. And these two parts are polarized. And it's easier to love the fun loving bike rider. And it's harder to love the hard going A type personality, maybe. And what you're able to do is once you're able to separate those, those are not all me. There are different parts of me. And they both have positive intention. And they're both dealing with some perceived trauma in their own way or life in their own way. And then when you come to it that way, starting with positive intention, and then you attend to it, which is to say, do you listen to it? You ask it questions, so to speak, in your mind's eye. Like, what is your intention for me? What's your job for me? When did you start doing this? What do you fear? Here's a really big one. What do you fear might happen if you were to stop doing this job? That's a good one. And you learn about that part of you. Yeah. All of those questions will lead you into a state of love towards this part. Right. If these are true answers. And then what will happen inevitably, if you're new to this process of loving yourself, is that other parts will jump in and judge the part. And then when that happens, you say, oh, hey, other part, you know, in your mind's eye. And you say, hey, you're really valuable too. And I know why you don't like this guy. But right now, can you just step back, take a deep breath, relax? Because I want to really want to focus on this target. You're inside your mind in this, you know, this asylum and different parts come out like, but I don't know. Absolutely. You too. I think you're awesome as well. You're right. You're fucking sexy. Not so much. Dude, that's how it works, man. It's really weird when it's hard to do by yourself. It's possible my clients after 10, 20 sessions are able to do it on their own with mild issues. But especially with severe trauma or any kind of overwhelming emotion, if they get too blended with a part that's in a painful pattern, it's a lot better. It's a lot easier to get guidance with it. So the therapist is really like a guide, just prompting you with these questions and just nudging you in a certain, you know, just like, hey, try this, ask that part this. And then it's just this gorgeous, beautiful, psychedelic experience that unfolds. And one of the reasons I love doing this parts work is because as a therapist, it's not my responsibility to unburden somebody. I just guide them. It's just I open the door and then they do all the work and it's and then that's how they arrive at fully loving themselves, because they're the ones who have discovered this huge, this never ending fountain of care and compassion and confidence and courage and connectedness that's already in them."}
