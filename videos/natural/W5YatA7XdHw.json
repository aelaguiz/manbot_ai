In today's video I'll be revealing to you part two of my James Roasts James. So this is where I've gone back through some ancient infill footage of mine from over 10 years ago and pulled it apart and had a little roast and toast to see if I was any good back in the day. And this one includes some very amusing Australian pickup which I'd forgotten how to do but that's a thing towards the end of the video so stay tuned for that. And now I present to you James Roasteth of The Younger James part two. Enjoy. Next up we've got Low Energy Day Game Approach also from 2010 from Prague on the Eurotour. I remember this one and I remember the girls being really cute and I remember me being really smooth so let's see if that's true or whether I was delusional. You guys make a really cute couple. I said you make a very cute couple. Oh thank you. I'm gonna make a guess and uh suggest you're not from Prague. Good opener. Smooth young James Marshall. So this is an assumptive opener. I'm like reading the situation. Two cute girls relaxing in the park. Go over and tell them that they make a cute couple and then make another assumption that I'm guessing they're not from here. Right so I didn't just sit on that. If I just got over and said hey so you guys look like a cute couple and they're like haha and like that was my thing that's my line then it would have instantly been cheesy but because I went made the assumption and then moved on to the next thing I think this is pretty good. No. Not at all. Where are you from? Australia. I was right they're not from here and she the girl lying down I remember her she was really cute. Then in a sultry kind of seductive way asked me where I'm from and I'm getting vibes off her straight away and the friend is just waking up figuring out what's going on. So I think I'm matching her vibe pretty well. She's chill. I'm chill. We're showing some low-key interest in each other in the first few seconds. Nice. Australia. You keep meeting Australians. You said it like that's a bad thing. No. Where'd you come from in Australia? Questions already. Um I'm from Melbourne. All right so I I'm like teasing a little bit here when she's saying she met a lot of Australians and I'm like oh it sounds like it's a bad thing. She's like no no. So this is the a good type of like slight disqualifying or putting a little bit of breaking or tension in the rapport when I feel there is rapport. Like when I've sat down and I'm like I got this. The work instantly the group is comfortable. There's no resistance to me being there and so I'm choosing to be put a little bit of edge a little bit of tension into it and it's having the desired effect. Do you know anything about that? Also notice the what my physical blocking right so I walk over I deliver my opener as I'm sitting down and once within a few seconds as I can see they're kind of comfortable now I make myself very comfortable. I lie down in a way where I'm not encroaching on her physical space but I'm like clearly here and relaxed. I'm not going anywhere and the group is cool with it so this is locked in comfortable. What brings you here? Pleasure. So I'm all cool with my early iPhones ringtone going off. Excuse me ladies it's technology it's a new thing. What brings you here? Holiday and I immediately say pleasure which is great and you can see what's going with her toes and her feet here where she's starting to do dancing with her feet. That's all good signs right that's I'm pretty sure when girls do that it means that they're feeling a little bit saucy. So me redirecting it from the very vanilla and very you know polite thing of we're on holiday to it's about pleasure. This is me leading the conversation into a more flirtatious direction by using a essentially a misdirection or a deliberate misunderstanding of what it is that she's saying. Good choice it's been fun. I'm traveling for work and for pleasure so I have a few days off here and then I have to do some business in Hungary and Serbia. This is me this is like obviously Jane's being cool it's like yeah I've got a bit of business to do just right this is obviously when I've just started where I can finally say that I actually have a business I'm like oh yeah I gotta do some business in Hungary you know you know how it is being an international traveling guy being pretty cool here she's putting up with it right on. I'm a life coach yeah it means you help people with their lives This is back when a life coach was not a thing and I'm like I'm a life coach. What does that mean? I help people with their lives. I wouldn't do that now right so if it comes up what do you do I might I may still say I'm a life coach but then I would have a story to go with that whether it's the seduction one or this the helping people with their lives version I would present that in a way that allowed the woman to find something out about me so it's like oh well yeah actually it's kind of an unusual business but essentially I'm a coach that helps people with their their mindsets and their confidence and the way that they communicate with people and to pick up chicks on the street mostly but I would have a spiel that goes along with that that gives her something to work with. Here I'm playing super mysterious. I guess it's working because they're like what is this life coach we have not heard of in the 2010s? All sorts of people. What do you guys do? We're students. We're entering university. Are you excited? Yeah. Because we're moving to London. Yeah. But French don't like British do they? The youngsters do. I mean like the tradition. British people? I don't know. I mean we're like our parents you know our parents generation they don't really well because of the Beatles I guess. The Beatles fixed the relationship. Yeah. I don't know but like traditionally they don't like each other. During this section I would say my timing's good right in terms of like the amount of space that I'm leaving which fits the situation of people chilled in the parks I'm not trying to like speed things up and quickly say stuff I'm allowing measured silence but I'm also not doing too much like I did in the Serbian interaction and now we're chit-chatting about French and the English and how the Beatles fixed the relationship and so yeah this is like good vibe stuff. So you know you guys you know you guys are not prejudiced against British or other races? No I don't. I used to live there. I keep hearing that French people are rude but every French person I've spoken to has been fine. French people are rude? I guess in Paris but it's not once you talk to them it's like when when you're surrounded by them they like don't care about you and if you ask for something they might be looking at you. They won't be that polite. They won't be impolite. This is a decent way to bring up a cultural cliche right that instead of me going too harsh and saying so French are rude but you guys seem okay you know I bring it up as the global thing. I've heard that the French are rude but every time I've met them they seem fine what's going on there and now the girls start qualifying themselves as not rude French girls. They won't be nice that's a problem. It's the same with people in Eastern Europe that's generally yeah kind of the same but in a different way less obvious and more contemptuous maybe. So hopefully I'll pick it up if you guys are being contemptuous it's not that obvious but I'm watching carefully. What a French way to describe things that their rudeness is less obvious but more contemptuous I think is the word that everyone there is massacring as I'm like yeah if you guys get contentious I haven't heard that word before in 2010. Contemptuous you philistine. If I can define our culture in one sentence no bulls**t and Americans are extra bulls**t and the French are what classy bulls**t. Exactly. Classy just in any even if they're rude mean or they don't say anything intelligent it's just classy. That's good. Wow this is amazing we've got a young woman and she had a book and now she's lying down to read the book I haven't seen that in 10 years wow. She's sitting here waiting for her to finish the book. The cool thing about this which I'm sure I noticed at the time is that the friend who is also cute knows that I'm trying to pick up her friend because we're we're facing each other directly and we're staring into each other's eyes and we've had the chat about what the French are like and what the British are like and whatever and now the friend's like oh well I'm just going to read and book while these two flirt. Good job French wing girl. We just didn't sleep much last night and today we were just like oh let's do that there's a park. The end. Yep I feel your pain. Where'd you guys go last night? First time I ever did that. Very funny it's a friend of mine who was a who was a prom too and uh who loved doing a pub crawl. You went and did a pub crawl? French people on a pub crawl? Jesus. Really? So trashy. When you meet girls who are travelers it's totally cool and normal to talk about what you did last night what you're doing this week because that's their experience right now they're travelers having adventures and parties and going out to pub crawls and so on and if I come over there doing my cold approach like like a weird old uncle and start grilling them about their university course and you know what are their hobbies and passions I'm showing that I'm not a guy that gets it that when you're on a holiday you want to meet a chill guy who's on a holiday who's like we're shit talking and we mentioned talk about where we went last night and this this kind of present time experience especially when girls are traveling because you ask them like what do you like doing for fun they're doing it they're they're traveling right now they're doing their thing so it's let's explore that experience that they're having and that hopefully I'm having as well because I'm not a weird uncle I'm a cool chill guy and so this this kind of basic rapport stuff's fine and good and then I'm adding the right type of tension here where they say they went on a pub crawl I tease them a bit about how that's a trashy thing for French people to do because they're supposed to be classy and now she's going to justify herself like French and English accent like French English American so trashy actually I did one for my first time in my life in Barcelona recently actually I hate to admit it but it was pretty fun cool so I've accused of them being trashy for going the pub crawl then I admit that actually I went on a pub crawl in Barcelona recently and I have to admit it was kind of fine and now I've created the tension then resolve the tension without needing to get into a fight or insult them about it yeah but it's no it's kind of like the same thing you do if you were with a group of friends but this actually organized for you and you meet other people and it's cheaper and and you get good addresses because I mean those pubs we don't yeah and since you move in a big group it's never like empty or have you been have you been to any of the kind of underground check places underground check places like the ones that you don't find on the tourist maps oh yes here I come in like yeah you had your pub crawl oh yeah that was fun so have you been to any of the underground check places which I mean it sounds a bit try hard but it's the right direction because what I'm really saying I'm what I'm leading to I think if I remember correctly is that well I know stuff about Prague that you don't know because you've clearly just come as a tourist on your Erasmus holidays or whatever and you're going to pub crawls well let me show you the cool side of Prague which is a good thing to do if you you live in a city or you know a city well you and you're approaching you're going to meet girls who are travelers and or expats and knowing what the city has to offer that's not just pub crawls or what's on the Lonely Planet guide is a good thing and you can say it in this cocky cool way as well that wouldn't hurt well they call no I have no idea how to find them I do there we go she's like well what are these underground check places that you speak of we don't know where to find them I'm like well I do I was setting this up I knew what I was doing um you come with me um oh yes yeah down dark alleys and under tunnels and I'll be wearing I'll be wearing a black cape as well um two hats oh good this is role playing so I'm making fun of the fact that they're gonna follow me down our dark alleys into somethings and I'll wear a black cape and she's like oh I know this game and you're wearing a hat and I'm like actually two hats and she's like what does that even mean that was James two hats back in the day it was kind of my thing oh you cocky little bastard it's working now isn't it just so that it's not that scary it's a bit silly um well well somebody give me their number anyway and we'll let you know where we're going and if you want to join some locals and fun people with brains um feel free the clothes I'm doing here so I'd say one of you give me the number now it's obvious the girl with the book is not going to and it's obvious the girl lying down who's into me is going to give me the number so that's fine and I guess my my thoughts there was like I'll go out with a wing tonight we'll take these two girls out and we'll split them because they're both good time girls here for a good time but these days I would be more likely to say all right well you give me your number definitely want to hang out with you and I can take you both out show you around a little bit which I would have like I mean I didn't I don't know why I can't remember why I never saw these girls again but taking both of them out who were lovely girls and the other one wasn't cock blocking that would be a cool thing to do traveler girls if I've got a wingman and I take them out ideal but here I think I'm being a bit indirect when I probably don't need to be oh we might not go tonight that's the thing you're resting tonight yeah well I won't be here tomorrow so that's you're what I'm leaving tomorrow you're leaving tomorrow where are you going to Budapest no to Lake Balaton it's a Hungarian lake What? A Hungarian lake. I like. Are you with some friends and are you doing some kind of interrail or? I'm with a couple of my, the guys I work with. And so we're just having a few days off and then doing some more work in Hungary. What's, what are your names? And you are? Mine is. Yeah I can, I'm Australian but I'm not stupid. Good little joke there. Where she's like, it's a. And I'm like, it's like. Yeah, yeah, yeah, we can do. Yeah, we're Australians but we're not dumb. Good joke. Yeah, they can't handle any foreign names over there. And I'm like, yeah, they had trouble. So what, do you think you're going to go to those clubs? But nightclubs or parties? Okay, at this point, so we've, I think I was being too cool about this really, where it's like, I'm leaving tomorrow, that's why I didn't see them, and they're having a night off. But they're 19 years old, they partied last night, they could party again tonight. And so I'm like, oh well that's a problem because I'm not going to see you again because I'm leaving tomorrow. And then she starts asking questions like, oh, so what about these clubs? Are they this and that? Because she's trying to get me to go, oh, well, let's just go out anyway. They're saying that they don't really want to go out because they had a big night last night, but she's clearly interested. So come on, James of 10 years ago, why didn't you do this? She was fucking cute. Is there, well, let's see if we find out. I don't know yet. Sorry, say that again. Underground places. I can tell that both of us are usually more intelligent, but today it's a little bit slow. So please, a bit more slowly. Underground places? Yeah. Yeah? So you've been there already? Yes, I have been there before. So are there more like night clubs? I come here every year, so there's a mixture, depends what you're interested in. So, I mean, there's places which are kind of half underground cellars, and then they have a dance floor in another room, and it looks like it's one tiny bar, and then you go downstairs and it's bigger. What kind of music do you like? That's probably the easiest thing. Dub and reggae, probably, if you're from France. No. Well, the friends we were with, yes. I like it, but that's not why I like it. Is it A-U-X? Yes, it is. I don't know, in bars I'd say, I don't know how you say that, electro? Yep. Alternative? Yeah. Whatever. This is not such an alternative city. I think I know what's happening here. I think I'm bullshitting, because I'm like, yeah, these underground clubs and stuff, and they're asking questions, and here's me going, oh, yeah, there's a place which has kind of got one door that goes into another door, and I'm like, what kind of music do they like, electro? And I'm like, yeah, it's not really an electro kind of city. I think I'm just talking out my ass here. Chaperouge is the place I should have taken them. That's alternative underground. So I think what I'm doing here is lying and bullshitting, which is why I'm being evasive and not going, yeah, come out to that alternative place that I said I knew about, which I don't. And you're saying underground stuff is full of, like, Czech people? Yeah, yeah. Or, like, snobbish tourists? No, where the locals actually go. And expatriates, I guess, people. There's a lot of people who live here from other countries. What's your number? 063543. 06 what? Oh, I can write that number down and call it. Or what's the international code for France? 0033. Okay. 063543. Oh, they muted the number. Oh, God, back when we didn't mute the numbers, I was like, oh, I can still call this girl. 12 years later, and then I realised we did mute it. Ah, editor of ten years ago. How am I ever going to go on a date with this girl again? 39407. Yes, let's just call you. I only know it in French. Okay, so, NY, oh, yes. Are you leaving to Budapest for work after that? Yeah, I'm going to the lake for a few days to relax, and then I'm going to Budapest for work. That's my check number. Cool. So you guys just going to be zombies here for another few hours? Um, I don't know. I have to go to the internet. This is a good way to wrap up a number close. So a common issue is that guys, like, get the number, and then the moment they've got it, they're like, oh, I better go, because, like, I better leave before I fuck it up. So this is a cool number close. All right, I probably should have been clear about that I was interested in her, but there's so much vibe going on here that me and Margot know what's going on. So getting the number and then not leaping up and running away, because I came in chill, so it's like, all right, what are you guys doing? You're just going to be zombies here for the next couple of hours? That's my standard, like, what I do after I've got the number. It's just like, so what's on for the rest of the day? Bit of chit-chat about that, and then I'm sure I'm going to coolly get up and walk away and never text her for some dumb reason. You guys seem kind of different, like, not exactly the same personalities. Did you meet on some random night out? Us? No, we're best friends since we were six years old. Okay, so you've learned to like each other. We're very different. Yeah, same with me and my best friend. I think that's kind of important, if you're too similar. I forgot your name, or maybe I know your name. This is good, too. Although the friend has been excellent, she has the opposite of a cockblocker, she's been helpful, like, me noticing something about them, and this is in the outro, right, so I've got the number, I'm not in a rush, we're all chilling, and making an assumption or a guess about the two of friends, and then they explain that they've been friends all their lives and they are very different personalities. Cool. That observation led to more rapport, and both girls knowing that I'm engaging with both of them. Or maybe I know your name. Maybe I didn't tell you. It's Sunday after all, or Saturday. James. Sounds like a fake name. Sounds like a fake name. Okay. Bruce. Cyril. No, it's James. Nice to meet you, James. Nice to meet you guys. Thank you for once again disproving cultural stereotypes. Let's keep doing it. All right. Good. Final line. Let's keep doing it. This one I think I'm just being too cool and not moving on it fast enough, because I remember that girl was fucking really cute, and if I just said, fuck off this underground something. I've got to take her to the special underground Czech club, which I've got to find out now from someone where it is. If I just pivoted from that and said, hey, listen, I know you had a big night last night, but you and me, let's just go and get a green tea and hang out, because I'm leaving tomorrow and I want to spend time with you. It would have worked, and the friend would have gone, okay, I shall read my book, because I am a cultured, elegant French lady, and I will give my friend a chance to have her vagina serviced, because that is what a good friend will do. But alas, none of this happened, because I was just too cool and walked off. Oh, well. This one's a bunch of random, not complete interactions that were filmed in 2012, so 10 years ago, at the Melbourne Cup horse race, which is a horse race where everyone goes and gets fucking wasted and doesn't look at the horses. It's basically to dress up fancy, get wasted, and try and pick each other up. So here's me doing a bit of Aussie pick up back in the day. Let's have a look. Hello. Hi, how are you going? Good, I thought I'd come and see what it's like to be short. Oh, well, yeah, how is the weather down there? Fucking Australia. Yeah, I thought I'd come over to this, like, seven-foot Aussie fucking farmer chick, and just straight away, oh, yeah, how is the weather down there? Oh, I miss Aussie girls, they're kind of funny. It's alright? Yeah. It's alright? It's pretty nice up top. Yeah? You feel superior? No. No, it's good Aussie stuff, isn't it? Yeah, it's pretty good up top. Do you feel superior? Nah. Oh, good. I feel like, even without the shoes, I'm still a foot taller than everyone. Oh, she's a tall girl, nice Aussie chick. Alright, let's see what happens next. I'm betting you don't usually wear these kinds of things. No, I've never worn heels. Neither of us have ever worn heels before. Have I? There's my guest. So you ladies look like the kind of ladies who mainly wear fucking boots when you're shearing sheep, never worn heels, and they're just, oh, they're so endearingly straightforward and earthy Aussie girls, aren't they? Just like, nah, me and Charmaine have never wore a world heel, high heels. Oh, actually, no, Charlene wore them at graduation once, but yeah. Oh, yeah, once wore them for graduation, and comes in with her like, yeah, I like to wear them for five hours. And you're like, oh, yeah, I remember that day when I put on the high heels. Wow, it's very different in Europe. How it goes? Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right, so there was me, like, asking her to do a catwalk, and the cameraman cut away, so we didn't get to see her do that, which I kind of wanted to, because she's seven foot and has legs that are five foot. Anyway, and now I'm going to school her on how to walk on an Aussie catwalk. I'm going to be honest and give you like an eight, yeah, because here's how you're going to do it. One in front of the other. I don't want catwalk style, I want, like, natural. These are real country girls, aren't they? Is that catwalk style? Yeah, yeah, nah, it's catwalk style. No, I don't like catwalk style. I'm like, all right, let's try, like, you know, a bit more Shearer style. Shearer, Shearer. Okay, well, in that case, aim for the centre. If we just go straight for the centre, and that's going to put a bit of swing in your hips as well. Yeah, you're like... Oh, she's like, I feel I've got a bit of bogan. Now, bogan, it's hard to translate, but it's something like a redneck, an Australian redneck. So she's like, nah, I'd rather walk like a bogan. And what am I doing? What am I doing at this... I don't know, but it's funny. You're like this, you know. All right, try one more. I love this chick. I should go back in time and marry her and have a sheep farm and breed extremely large children. I'm way behind, I'm afraid. Yeah, you probably don't watch TV. Don't read magazines, don't read newspapers. What do you do? A lot of other stuff. Like? Play music, travel, have adventures. Oh, that's so much more better. Nah, you see, you probably don't, like, read newspapers. Newspapers, wow. Or magazines. Wow, magazines. Or watch TV. Nah, what do you do? Nah, what do you do? I'd say some other shit. Oh, that's way more better. Oh, I miss my home. I miss my ladies. The women of Australia. Such an underrated population. But you guys are sisters, right? Yeah, yeah, but... Dad's an Aboriginal, my dad was the postman. What a... Oh, this is awesome. These girls should be teaching this. Yeah, same, yeah, we're sisters, but... Dad's an Aboriginal and mine's the postman. Our mum's a slut. I have to change my opinion on everything. I've been spoiled and ruined by all these, like, sophisticated and fancy European girls. I'm going home to find a real fucking woman. I'm gonna tell your mum you said that. Only in Australia could you have that kind of conversation and it be kind of a pick-up. Can you give me your card? I just feel like that's a really weird thing to do. Crazy. Well, I've never done it before in this capacity, but anyway. All right, there you go. You can text me at some point. What do you do? I'm a dating coach. You're a dating coach? Yeah. Oh, my God. That's very exciting. Oh, there was a little Irish... An Irish lady there. She goes, I'll take your card. And I can't remember the context of this. And back then, I had a card. I don't anymore. I had a business card that said with, like, a bad... Like, one of those bad strip club silhouettes of, like, the chick with the tits or whatever. And I'm handing it out. Irish lady, Never heard of that. Oh, you will. Oh, yeah, we're not going to be dressing up. Don't worry about that. I'm going to be saying this because I've put my feet through this so far. And what's yours? Oh, there I'm going for closing the two eight-foot sisters and they're talking about, oh, this... I think I was saying we're having an after party and they're talking about, well, do we have to wear our whole heels because my fucking big toe's going blue? No, ladies, you can wear your sheep-shearing boots if you'd like. Can I, like, look really cool and have two of you on? Absolutely, darling. Us? Gems? Double. Oh, there. There we go. I walk off into the sunset with my two ladies and they're like, absolutely, we can escort you young gentlemen. And then I went and had a threesome with them both. And that's it. Oh, that was pretty funny, eh? Good Aussie chicks. Why did I talk bad about them all these years? I'm going to go home, find a good one and marry her. So, I hope you enjoyed that roast series of me roasting myself, my old infields. Now, if you'd like to learn how to do that yourself, that is, how to meet women in everyday situations, have good, clean, clear, natural-style conversations that lead to them wanting to see you again and go on dates with you, then you should consider subscribing then you should consider joining us for our last ever, not ever, this year, workshop which is going to be in Barcelona, seven days around the clock from the 28th of August to the 4th of September with myself leading it as we go through 80 plus hours of infield, Mike Darp, theory, role-playing sessions, in a game, sexuality training, style makeovers and so much more.
