Because if a woman's not interested in a man, she doesn't probe him and test him. Hello there guys, it's an Ask The Naturals with James Marshall time. Question from The Guy. Hey there The Natural Lifestyles, I've got a question about women testing men. Why is it that women test men, and not the opposite way, or both ways? Well firstly, I don't think that that's true. So he's saying that women test men, but men don't test women. Well firstly we do, we just tend to test on different criteria. Anytime you walk in a club, you are testing all of the potential females in there based upon their hip to waist ratio, their beauty and the size of their breasts, and their hair colour or whatever specific thing that you're into. Women tend to screen or test primarily, initially, on looks. So that's their technical, aesthetic beauty, and then the way that they use their beauty through makeup and movement, and all the other tricks that chicks use to make themselves look hot. So yes, we do, we certainly do test women in that respect. And I, and every other good seducer that I know, test the fuck out of girls in many other ways to see if they are worthy of being dated. Because as you, that's one of the most important things I think about learning seduction, is not trying to just hustle endless women into bed, that's not the end goal. The end goal is to be able to have choice, to be able to choose your partners, and therefore, when you are, if you are actively choosing, then you need to be testing. And that's something that, at first, guys don't really think so much about often, they're just like, I just want to bang hotter girls. And okay, even if that's all you want, in order to be able to bang hotter girls, or date hotter women, you do need to be able to start testing. Because you are right, that most of the time, men don't test women around their character, their personality, their achievements, you know, whether they're a nice person, or have a good heart, these kinds of things. Men don't, often don't test women on those things, they just, if they are attractive enough in the guy's eyes, then the average man doesn't quiz her, doesn't probe, doesn't qualify. And also, very badly, puts up with shitty behavior and lack of investment, lack of engagement from the girl. The reason why this happens, that's the question that you're asking, why is it that women do test? And how do women test men? Many, many ways, right? So they ask them, what do they do for a job? They screen them on the way that they dress. They test them to see if they can handle being teased, or being challenged, right? So often a woman, if she wants to test a man, she will tease him, she will make a comment about his clothes, she will suggest that he doesn't know something that he said he did, in order to see how he responds. That's the primary reason why women test men, is because there are many men who are able to put on the veneer and appear to be confident and sexy and cool, because they know how to do the look and the pose and say the things, but what happens is when you prod them a little bit, they fall apart and they get reactive and angry, or apologetic, or they are forlorn or whatever. So it's very common for girls to test a man to see what he's actually like, because she's had experiences where when she was 17, 18, going out to the clubs for the first time, she met some guys who on the surface looked like they were the shit, and then she found out after fucking them or dating them for a bit that actually they were reactive little boys in the grown up's bodies, and she realizes that, oh okay, just because it looks like a duck doesn't necessarily mean it is a duck. Just because he appears to be confident or puts on the show of confidence or being at ease with himself or cool doesn't mean he is. So women develop these mechanisms to start to test to see what the man's actually like. The first thing you can take from this practically is to understand that if a woman is testing you, it's a good thing, because it means that she's bothering to find out if you're worthy of passing her specific tests, because if a woman's not interested in a man, she doesn't probe him and test him, unless she just happens to be, I don't know, like some really bratty annoying person who just likes poking holes at people, you'll occasionally meet a man or a woman who's like that, but for the most part, if a woman's not interested, she won't ask questions, she won't challenge you, she won't like get you to justify yourself, she'll just cut it short as she can to get rid of you. So I always take it as a good sign, if a girl's testing me, it means to me I'm like excellent, mainly she's testing to see if I'm reactive, that's the main thing, because a man who's reactive and what I mean by reactive, for anyone who's not sure, is a person who when a stimulus comes into their vicinity, someone says something to me or something happens that is unexpected or I don't have control over, and if I'm reactive, it means I lose my cool. So it doesn't mean that I need to know exactly what I'm doing all the time and I need to have the right thing to say, but if something doesn't go my way, that's when a woman will see more or less what my character is like. So let's say we're sitting having our first coffee date, the waiter comes and knocks the coffee into my lap. If I go, fucking ah, you fucking cunt! Then she's going to probably not want to see me again, and she's going to have a fairly good indication of what I'm actually like, because I'm sitting there being all cool and something happened that I didn't like, and I flipped out at her. And of course, it won't necessarily be that extreme, but it can just be stuff like being very nasty and rude to a waiter, if something's not on the menu that you like, getting all huffy about it, if the girl doesn't want to do exactly what you request, come and sit next to me, or Trump forcing someone to eat meatloaf or whatever, it doesn't go my way and then I get aggressive or reactive or sullen. Those are indications to the girl that, okay, if I was to continue our relationship with this man, it's not going to be fun. I'm going to be tiptoeing around this man's reactive behaviors forever. So that's how she's going to screen me and go, all right, well, you flipped out about that or he was all moody because I said that I didn't like the movie that he liked or whatever it is. So keep that in mind. Women test to see what you're like when things don't go your way. So take it as a great opportunity. Awesome. She's testing me. I can just show her that I'm okay with this thing, right? I don't have to be right all the time. I don't have to prove myself. I can burn the toast and she can go, oh, you left that, you don't even know how to cook toast. If a girl says something like that to me, some girls will be a little bit bratty like that and I make a big deal out of that, then she's going to not want to see me again. If I go, yep, failed the old toast 101, I guess we'll be having a uber toast. Cool. I've passed that test. All right. So that just shows her that, okay, he's cool. I've met girls who belligerently keep prodding and testing. I've met men, probably more men actually who do that because often men belligerently test and prod at other men in order to maintain their dominance hierarchies in order to try and exert control, right? Which is why when you see Trump do that absurd fucking handshake on every single dignitary, he just says every time, says this man is not confident. This man has so much to prove. This man has so much to lose because he feels like he needs to physically overpower someone with his weird handshake every time. It's a very reactive movement before there's anything to even react to. To me, that demonstrates powerlessness, not powerfulness, right? Because you see, someone who's confident, when he shakes another man's hand, he doesn't need to prove that he's got a stronger grip. Like what is this? Are we in the caveman days of like, oh, the strongest grip wins? No, it's just like, okay, he just goes, yep, okay, I'll do a firm handshake. You do a firm handshake, fine, right? So any of these like extra aggressive or interrogatory kind of techniques that some people do, mostly men to other men, to me is a sign of like, I don't want that person in my life. So if a girl does that kind of thing multiple times and I see she's simply testing just to constantly have me on my toes, okay, I'm not interested. But if a girl is like checking to see how I respond to stuff early on, totally fine. Why should she not? Why should she not see what kind of person I actually am when the masks drop? That's the why, right? That's the why that women test. And it also relates to the fact that she can, right? Because if she's an attractive female, she has way more options than you. That's the fact, right? Like you put a girl next to me who is as attractive in the female version as me, because I'm pretty good looking, she can fuck every man in this city pretty much. And I can, you know, I can get a date in an hour for sure. But she's going to kick my ass if she wants to do the numbers. So beautiful women who have some kind of economic stability behind them tend to have a high level of entitlement to men. Is that fair? No. It's just whatever. It's just like men want to fuck the women from 18 to 25 who are hot. And every man who's single and straight wants to have sex with them and the many who are not single. So therefore she has infinitely more male attention, whether it's quality attention or whatever you can debate, but she has infinitely more attention than you can command. So therefore she is able to be more picky in the initial stages, especially in terms of choosing a person to go on a date with or have sex with, she has way more choice. She may not have amazing choice on a very stable or awesome partner that she can have a relationship with. That's the issue that women often face, but she can get laid right now if she wants. And I've started to see that in my life. My level of entitlement has risen over the years because my skill and my abundance has risen. I won't put up with a boring girl anymore. I won't put up with shitty behavior from a girl. I will set very, very clear boundaries. I will test girls. Free interaction. If you look at every infield video that I've ever put out, there is some level and often a very strong level of me qualifying the girl, applying pressure on her. Explain that to me. Tell me more about that. What's that? Okay. All girls like shopping. What do you really like to do? Is that it? Would you like to know something about me? Do you want to have... Should we chat a little bit more? Yeah. That topic's not so great. Why don't you ask me something different? I do that stuff consistently with the girls that I meet. It's not just a trick. It's not just a seduction trick. It literally relates to my standards. If I'm going to date a girl, even if I'm just going to have a short fling with her, she has to have some curiosity. She has to have a personality. She has to invest. She has to be sensual and sexual. She has to be able to vibe and flirt with me. Otherwise, I mean, I don't have to because the reality is I don't need to settle for a girl that doesn't have those things because I have a higher level of entitlement and choice than the average man because I've worked my ass off to develop that and I'm at my peak of sexual marketplace value because of all these factors that I've been working on to make this time kick ass. So the answer to your question is men do test women. The thing is just the guy, number 2256, you're not testing women and you need to ask yourself why is that? Is that because you're not sure what you want out of a woman? You don't really have standards and that's common. Many guys, their standard is attractive. That's it. They're like, hot girl, hotter than my last girlfriend. That's their standard. And if that's all you've got, that's all you expect from a woman, then why would she give you any more than that? Why would she want to win your affection? Why would she want to qualify herself to you if you don't have any standards aside from just the basics of her aesthetics? What's up gentlemen? I know it's weird when I shave, I look, it's a different person, isn't it? It's me again.
