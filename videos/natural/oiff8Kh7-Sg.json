You might grind all week and not have an amazing result, but you'll still have a shitload of internal changes and strength and framework and foundations that can ripple out into your life for weeks, months and years ahead. So this is how I basically stay alive. I don't eat food, I just live on amazing like extravagant elixirs and powerful tonics from all around the world. Basically this is my daily kind of supplements and there's a good combination of vitamins and minerals as well as a bunch of herbs that are very good for boosting your body to have a lot more energy. Basically adaptogenic herbs. So that's the key word. Look up adaptogenic herbs. Do a bit of study on that. But we're just about to kick off for the day. The team's warming up and we're just about to hit the park. It's going to be fun. So I've worked with supplements a lot in my life because basically I have a history of chronic fatigue. So I was trying to work out different ways of maximizing my energy and sustaining myself through difficult times. So I know what it's like to have a lot of head fog. I know what it's like to wake up really tired even though you slept. Yeah, I lived like that for years. And there's many strategies that helped me to kind of raise my energy and get out of that kind of funk. And one of them is supplementation. So supplementation has been a huge game changer for me personally. I mean obviously supplements can be a bit hit and miss. I don't recommend you just go out and buy whatever is in the store because you don't know what you're buying. And I don't recommend you go to the supermarket and buy crappy stuff either because there can be lots of fillers and chemicals and junk in those kinds of pills. So just do a little bit of research on quality brands or even sometimes you can just see on the bottle if they're a decent quality brand. Something with some good dosage. And yeah, basically start to learn about this stuff. And there's a lot I could say but I just recommend you start opening your mind to your own health and well-being. And yeah, yet again supplements are a big game changer. I'm going to eat all these fucking pills in probably one mouthful. Should I try that challenge? It's going to be fun. I don't think I've ever taken this many at once but I'm going to do it just for the challenge because I know it's possible. That's good. Too much. See, I'll keep practicing that until I can get it in one clean hit. Don't try that at home kids. I'm not going to be responsible for you dying on your kitchen floor. This is exciting. I get to travel on the New York subway. The way that I teach has so many different levels of things that have benefit within it. Because when I'm speaking with their unconscious, I'm offering them conscious strategies, I'm questioning them. I'm getting them to fill in their own kind of map of reality some more. I'm also speaking to them hypnotically which takes them into generalized states of mind which are positive. So there's a lot of different levels of stuff that's going on. Basically I have no fear that guys are not going to get changed because it's pretty much impossible to spend a significant amount of time with me without getting some shift in your mindset. Especially if you turn me on to coach mode. Men being boys, that's a good thing. Men being boys, that's a good thing too. It's important that men get connected to their playful side. Let's get into this class. We have a circle here. Hey little buddy. He thinks he's got something. What a cutie. A big part of doing this is obviously the first thing is just go and talk to some women. Stand in front of a woman and see what happens when you say something. She's the flesh and blood fact of why you're here in some sense. Now that's important because you need to come into contact with what you're really here to do. Now as we're doing that we also want to step into this kind of awareness of how are we interacting in a way that gives us purpose and meaning to be there. Imagine you wake up early, you're tired, you don't want to go to the gym. If you let that self control your choice then you're never going to go to the gym. Who do you want to be in this process? Once you start to trust in the generation of who you're becoming then it's going to give you momentum and energy. It's going to give you power to step into this. Basically what that means is you'll feel like I can't do anything right now. I'm just going to wave at some people and say hi. I'm just going to go and have some simple conversations and give a compliment to some people. And then boom it starts to fire up. So you're in good hands, you're on the right path. So your purpose, why are you there? You're there because you want to meet her. You're there because there's something about her that's attracted you. You're there because there's something within the moment or there's something within you that has a desire to meet her because you want to engage in connection. So that's your purpose and it's important to get connected with that. And this is something we were talking about yesterday is state your purpose. Cleanly state your purpose to yourself first. You know, what are you doing? I want to go and meet some girls. I want to go and meet a lovely girl today who really wants to meet me and have a great fucking adventure. You are in the exact right place at the exact right time having the exact right experience that you need right now. So therefore you don't need to be anywhere else. Work with where you're at. Be who you are. Because the first level of confidence that I want you guys to get is what I would call acceptance confidence. Once again, I want to take you on a big journey this week hopefully of like learning to transmit substance. What I mean is essence like bringing energy through yourself into the world. And we're going to be doing a lot of exercises in terms of your emotional range. Can you bring emotions through into the world? Can you be, you know, challenging? Can you be deep? Can you be fun? Can you be quirky? Can you be interesting? Can you be, you know, can you be really curious about somebody? All these different things and shifting your mindset from just playing out this one range of who you are. And instead having a much broader range of what you're becoming. So yeah, really good first day yesterday. Really learned a lot from every approach. Not only about myself, about posture and tonality and things. But also about the girls, the interacting. Like that maybe they're afraid. Like and it's our duty to make them feel safe. And that we can change the interaction in so many ways. What we say, how we say it, how we feel. So really, really good first day. Although I did caught myself often of not approaching. Which I really, I do want to approach more and more and more. Then this morning I felt completely the same as the others. Maybe like really I wanted to approach, I wanted to continue with the vibe that I had yesterday. Which wasn't possible at all. But I already feel different like 20 minutes ago. So it really changes a lot already. And really I'm really excited about what's going to come today and learn more. And yeah, just be there. Cool, I like it. It's really good. Yeah, once again really normal. And we've got a strong group energy here. So there's going to be a lot of power that comes out of being here this week. So you're going to get a lot of permission to do a lot of things. So yet again, take that permission. Feed on it. I want you to marinate yourself in permission. I want you to get your nervous system really like hungry and used to the neurochemistry of permission. Of going for it. And part of this also really want you guys to recognize. Yet again, so similar to going to a boot camp in the morning or something. You know, like going to do it like an exercise thing. It's really similar. It's like don't want to do it. Heavy, tired, reluctant. Get out there, warm up. Okay, it's not so bad. Get into it. Okay, now it's good. You know, finish it. You're like, wow, okay, I feel alive. But I'm also tired. So, you know, and there's time to recalibrate. So we need to create new references and put them in the past. So that we can know new things about ourselves. So basically what that means is be aware that there is a scared little boy inside you. That for various levels, for various reasons, sorry, has been abandoned or hurt or whatever. Or at least he feels that he has. He might not even had a hard life. He just feels that he missed out on something or something wasn't the way he wanted it to be. That's okay too. Trauma is relative. You know, some people have had very difficult things happen in their lives and they're completely fine. They have no problems. Some people, you know, have their mother look at them a little bit sideways and they have a big problem. How much are you creating a sense of meaning and attachment to your experience? Because if something shitty happens to you and you're like, okay, that was a thing, whatever. Then you just keep moving and there's another thing and there's another thing. And there's, you know, there's another average experience. There's a good experience. There's many experiences. Then all of a sudden you're just moving through experience. If you're the kind of person who can just have experience and move through it without getting like help, like without grabbing the good stuff and going like, oh, that's a good one. I've got to have that one. That's a bad one. I want to get away from that one because that's what most people do. If we can be somebody who just moves through experience, then we don't need therapy. We don't need to change our deep structure of personality. We don't have to reprogram our traumas. You know, it's the parts of us that get attached to the problems. It's the parts of us that grab onto an experience and make a story about how shitty and painful and negative that was and how much that means that we're wrong or broken or something. Also, what I found yesterday with the social freedom things, like I found it very easy to act, like really to say hi and really to act, so really easy. But then being yourself or really showing, like I found it a lot difficult here, showing that and interacting like that. Very good observation. And yet again, it's good. It's a common thing. I mean, for example, when we do social freedom exercises, it's not for every guy because some guys do find them difficult, but some guys find them easier because it's like, oh, cool, I'm doing a thing now. I'm doing a social experiment or I'm hiding behind an exercise or I'm doing something goofy that's fun or whatever. And there's truth to that. That is also an aspect of why we do like those exercises and introduction because it is a shield. It is a level removed from just direct transparent self. And it is. It's increasingly scary to bring your direct transparent self into the moment. What if I get hurt? What if it fucking hurts? Yeah, that's it, right? So that kind of creates the feedback loop of the assumption of trying to protect ourselves. We can't always be our honest, authentic, true, genuine, transparent selves because what does that even mean? Yeah, that's that's it gets becomes too much of a head fuck. But we can try. We can we can try to be honest. We can try to have an intent. We can try to express ourselves with meaning. And we can try to come from a genuine place of like, hey, I feel like I have a open human need to meet you right now. Do you have an open human need to meet me maybe? Because it's a pretty basic and innocent thing. Don't get too lost in the idea of results because results is the fact that you're here doing this. You know, the facts of the results, you're becoming this and it's a somewhat unpredictable path. You know, you might meet the world's most amazing girl in the next five minutes and she has a life changing effect. You might grind all week and not have an amazing result, but you'll still have a shitload of internal changes and strength and framework and foundations that can ripple out into your life for weeks, months and years ahead. So there's no way that you can go through this process without having some deep, significant level of confidence change. What's interesting about her? What's important about her? What is special about her? What's unique about her? Who is she? What's going on with her? Because it's all about the connection. And the point is, especially for women, they're reading, they're feeling, they're looking, they're sensing all this stuff all the time. So the more honest and authentic you are, she'll just feel like, oh, this guy's the real deal. This guy's like honest. This guy, I trust this guy. Women need a man that knows how to handle them. And when I say that, it's not like in a negative way. It's just in a way of like, you're emotionally bigger than her. You're able to contain her emotions and not be reactive to her emotions as a generalization, for example. You are able to understand her needs and respond to her needs appropriately. Sometimes that might be saying like, fucking step down. You're being a little girl. It's not appropriate. Sometimes it might be like, hey, come here. I need you to come closer to me because I know you need some attention, some affection now. So it's your ability to read that as well. Your ability to read, when's the right time to push? When's the right time to pull? When's the right time to feel and to connect with these things? And you'll get all of this. This will just start to happen naturally as you just hang out with women. And you'll see it. You'll feel it. You'll understand it. You'll get it. And if you pay attention, they will teach you how to do it. Because they're giving you the cues and stuff all the time. And if you pay attention, this is another great reason to talk to a lot of women, is they'll start giving you great content and information and questions and stuff that you can use for talking to other girls. So it's a great feedback loop. Ready? Huh? No? Yes and no? No and yes? Let's go on a mission, huh? We're going to warm up a bit. Alright. So that woman, she's running quickly. Just go and give her a compliment. Hi there. Sorry, I see you have a hard day today. I just want to say that you look so beautiful, even though you look... Bye. So our mission is to just warm up and get into the zone here. And what you did is great. I mean, I just wanted to say that you look great today. Or, you know, I'm doing this thing where I want to give good energy to people and I just wanted to say I hope you have a great day. That's good, just to warm up, get into the zone, for sure. Straight in front of you, leather jacket, blonde hair. I don't think she's from around here. She's kind of going pretty slow. Maybe she's a tourist, maybe she's not from here. Do you see what I'm saying? 12 o'clock, straight in front of you, right in the middle of the street. Just don't get run over. Hi there. Hey. If that happens, just because it's for your motivation too, if that happens and she walks around you, just spin around and walk with her for a little while. Because, for example, like if you're walking along, right, you just keep walking. If you're walking along and somebody like stops and then you just keep going, then it makes it weird, you know. Whereas if you, like for example, if I just did what you did... And I'm here, and I'm like this, and you do what she did, then that's weird. Whereas if I just jump in and I'm like, hey, how are you going? And I just keep going as if we're friends, that actually makes it normal. And it makes you feel good, too. So even if, like, even if you can tell she probably doesn't want to interact, just give her, like, enough of a, like, just like, hey, I just wanted to say you look really friendly today and, you know, something. Then see what's going on and say, hope you have a nice day. Elegant's great. Feminine is great. Graceful is great. Um, you know, adorable. Only those things. Speaking of which, I'm going to go and tell her something about her adorable, lovely, elegant, graceful self. Hi there. Saw you walking. I think you're a very elegant girl. Sorry? Oh, I just saw you walking, and I think you're a very elegant girl. So I just want to stop by and say hi. Let's do a little bit of a challenge with you quickly. See, there's a mom and a daughter. We're going to just go, they just walked past. We're going to go to the mom and the daughter and say, hey, you guys sisters, are you, what are you doing in New York? You know, give them a quick compliment. But the daughter's amazingly beautiful. So they're right there in front of us. You know the ones I'm talking about? Yeah. Yeah. Green, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. See how he goes with that. Just trying to, trying to flex them a little bit too, because once again, we're pretty early in the process, and they need to develop a lot of reference experiences. And part of those reference experiences is doing things like working with girls in groups, working with moms and daughters, working with girls going into shops, working with girls that are maybe like a bit fierce or bitchy on purpose, because it can be really healthy for guys to realize, okay, cool, that's what it's like when a girl really doesn't want to talk to me. Or that's what it's like when, you know, a girl's with her mom. Or that's what it's like when I'm dealing with a group. And for example, guys can often go in with a lot of assumptions. Like, I can't do that. That's impossible. And there's way too much pressure. They're going to think I'm a weirdo. And like, I'm such a strange person, like talking to somebody on the street. That's not true at all. As a matter of fact, what's often the case is you get in there and you start talking. And all of a sudden, you realize it's really comfortable. And it even feels good. And they like it. And you like it. And all of a sudden, you walk away like, wow, I feel amazing. This was really good. So that's obviously a very positive outcome. It's a good side of this. It's not always that way. But that's what we're seeing at the moment, which is nice. He's getting into a really good flow of surprising himself, which I think is a kind of a manifestation of retrieving the power from his shadow on the positive side. Because he's not used to actually operating from his permission and his power and his authority. So in some ways, because who knows, whatever reason, it's very common that guys end up suppressing their power, their sexuality, their ability to be free. So it's quite a beautiful thing when a man realizes that the thing that he thinks is scary is actually his power. And he starts getting that back. So it's kind of a really good side of doing shadow work, reclaiming the power and the positive aspects of self. Would you mind if I ask who are the flowers for? Okay, do you buy it for a specific purpose? Like a gift or you like flowers? Really? Oh, that's so awesome. So you put it on your kitchen and they have it there? Oh, that's pretty interesting. All right. Hey, I mean, if you don't mind, I can maybe ask for your number and we can catch up for a coffee or something. You can see I'm a... You have a boyfriend? That makes sense. And you are an attractive woman. All right, I will let you go. Have a nice day. Bye. That was cool. Yeah, so tell me about that. So the thing that she was open to is you were quite friendly in some sense. We didn't come off with any dirty agenda or anything. The stuff that I would say is, and in many ways, you kind of broke the rules by telling her what you were doing, but it was in a good way. So you sort of said, I've seen you and I'm a little bit intimidated. But basically, I wanted to come and see you because you're an attractive woman and I wanted to see what you're like, which is all true. And then she was like, oh, okay. And then you said, what's your name and yada yada. It's good. I wouldn't do that all the time, but it's good that you're doing that because what you're starting to show her is like, here I am, I'm honest. This is what I want. Coming up at the end of August, from the 28th of August through to the 4th of September, we are running our last European seven-day residential seduction workshop for 2022 in Barcelona. It's going to be epic. We just ran one a month ago there. Sun is shining. Girls are out.

Come and learn natural game with us in Barcelona at the end of August. Click the link below, get on a call with us. And now back to the video. It's pretty easy. You'll be able to do it. Just going to go in direct and just talk to the one you want to talk to. Just the same as you were talking to just one girl. And all you got to do... I feel very pressured right now. You don't have to do it. But let's just imagine, okay? There's three girls there behind you. You can just go up to one and say, like notice something about her. Or you could even say, hey, excuse me, I'm not from around here. But I was just wondering where's good to go for a coffee or something. And then even just start something really indirect. But then see if you can go more direct. I really like this about you. You have a cool style. I like your glasses or you have a good vibe. And all I want you to do at this stage, because I know you're feeling a lot of pressure. It's okay. I don't want you to do anything extraordinary. You just go up to her and say, excuse me, do you know where the Starbucks is around here? And give her a compliment. Say you don't have a cool style. You have something about you. Like whatever, like tell her something about you observe. And then just say, yeah, cool. It was nice to meet you. And then introduce yourself and then go. Okay, you can do it. I just want you to challenge yourself a little bit. You'll be able to do it. Yeah. Hi, excuse me. You seem very friendly. Would you tell me where the next Starbucks? Oh, I actually do know that. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. It's in this building on the corner right there. The red one. Not the red building, but over here. Yeah. Okay. Right corner of that building. Awesome. Thank you very much. A very nice smile. Have a wonderful day. Bye. What you learn is that your thoughts and your feelings are full of shit. Yeah. Which is kind of cool. Something completely different. What I think is going to happen that really happens. Yeah. That's good. So hopefully you can have a lot more of those kinds of referencing experiences. Especially positive ones. See if we can find another girl to talk to. Do you want to go and talk to this hippie girl? She's kind of walking down the street quickly. Excuse me. Not selling anything. Just wanted to say you look very, very different and very nice. I really like your clothes. Have a wonderful day. So she wanted it more actually. So I could have stayed there, but I shut it off and let it go. But yeah, positive. Very good. Feeling a bit more warmed up? It doesn't take much, does it? No. It's amazing. The second one was like a thousand times easier again. Oh, that's strange. Oh, that's fine. Have a wonderful day. I want to give positivity. Another protein bar. It's what we live on. She's got black style like you. You've got black style. She's like, hey, we match today. Actually, it happens to be a fashion school. So you study fashion? Hi. You good? Have good fashion? Good style? God, they look the same, right? So it is a fashion school here, right? You're in it or? Yeah, it's also a design school. Okay, so you're into design or? Yeah. What do you design? Like people or? It's a master's or like an MBA here. Oh, okay. So you like to design things? Yes. How would you say that? How would you describe designing? Like what kind of things do you design? Just trying to connect with people. Like I think, I thought New York is a very big city. And there's a lot of very positive people. You look very positive and very friendly. He's talking too fast. But his vibe's okay. Friendly. He's from Germany. German. Oh, you're visiting? Yeah. How long have you been here? Just three days now. Yeah, but staying three weeks. How do you like it so far? Oh, it's very nice. Very, very, I don't really like the weather. So I... I'm very happy that I do have some long trousers and a jacket. She's kind of hooked. She's like, she's intrigued. So you live here then? When if you study here, you're probably doing that. Yeah, I just started a couple of months ago. Okay. I'm from Lebanon. From Lebanon? Oh, okay, nice. Did you live there before? Like before living in New York? I've lived here before. Just everywhere. I've lived in Spain. So now he's starting to chill out. So, okay, so he's just gone into this interaction. He's not really super confident about his position yet. And just put him into a couple of interactions. Definitely responding well. When women like him, it's not a big deal. He just needs to do it, basically. So he's just gone in there. Simple interaction, just a warm-up interaction. Girls standing there smoking a cigarette. I think part of what happened was he was trying to justify why he was there, which is a common thing that guys come up with. It's like, I have to like make a good reason or an excuse why I'm here. So he's talking a little bit fast. I think that's part of why he was talking too fast. I think that's part of why he was talking too fast. He's trying to fill in the gaps. Trying to make up ground. Would you like to hang out again? Like, I really feel a nice vibe. My boyfriend is here visiting. Oh, that's very nice. So it's going to be weird for three of us. That's fine. So thanks very much for the nice interaction. Enjoy your stay in New York. Yes, I will. Thank you very much. Yeah, cool. Have a good day. Bye. Like you just had a friendly interaction. Wouldn't say it's like, you know, class A seduction or whatever. But that's not the point. He's warming up. He's being social. He had a good interaction. If you pay attention, she was quite into it and positive. She left with a good vibe. He left with a good vibe. So it's good. How do you feel? Yeah, good. Like I had a nice little flow, I would say. Like I just kept doing. It was nice topics to talk about. Talking about me. Talking about her. Talking what we're doing. Exactly, yeah. So once again, overall pretty good. I mean, especially it's a nice warm-up set. And that's like getting into that flow of conversation exchange. And I've seen that, which is good. You were maybe talking a little bit too fast to begin with. Okay. But I think that's just because you were trying to deliver your story and try to get to know her. And there was maybe a little bit of uncertainty about yourself being there. What I noticed was you were kind of like, I'm just like, you know, walking around New York meeting people. And you look really cool. So I want to come and say hi because you look really friendly. So there's a little bit of that. Which is not a bad thing because you are trying to explain yourself fast. You're trying to say like, this is why I'm here. Don't worry. I'm cool. And I think you got to that point, which is the most important factor. I can't. Can't. I feel really... Too much pressure. Okay, that's fine. We'll keep going. Once again. And it's good to even recognize that too. And to be self-aware of it. Like, cool, this isn't the moment. I'm going to do it. But not for this moment. That's fine. And once again, I'm not saying you do it. But it's a very common thing that guys do as well. They use a lot of guilt on themselves. Like, I didn't do it. I fucked it up. So yeah, we don't want to have that at all. We want to be like, cool, it's fine. Next one. Next opportunity. And yeah, there's plenty of girlies. Hi, how are you? I'm fine, thanks. Not trying to sell anything. Don't worry. I just thought you were sticking out of the groove. And you look very special. Okay, thank you. Very nice. So you live around here? No, I'm just... Visiting. Oh, that's nice. Yeah, I'm visiting. Do you live here? No, I'm visiting too. Oh, from where? I live in Spain at the moment. Oh, nice. Are you from Spain? No, German. Ah, then we can speak German as well. Ah, yeah, that's funny. How cool, I'm enjoying it. I mean, the city is... The weather isn't that great today. It's not that cool. How long have you been here? For three days now. Ah, okay. And where are you staying? For three weeks, probably. Here in New York? Yeah, in New York, yeah. Yeah, I'm going to Washington tomorrow. Oh, how cool. Are you going on a round trip? Yeah, I'm staying in Boston. And now I'm going down to Washington. And then I'm flying to L.A., so... And why? Just for travelling? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just wanted to... Yeah, that's cool. Are you studying? Yeah, exactly. Are there semester holidays now? Yeah, I still have a day off on October 22nd. Oh, how cool. But the others are already starting. I was just about to say that. Because a few of my friends are already starting. Yeah, yeah. So you're like, yo, I'm just going to keep going. No, no, no. I really do have a day off. Ah, okay. Yeah, what are you doing? I don't really know yet. I've been to Spain, I've done some real estate. But now I'm going to New York. Exactly. In Alicante. Ah, cool. Yeah. I don't know yet. I'm looking forward to going back to Spain. Have you been there before? Yeah, but not in Alicante. In Barcelona and then in Malagado. Yeah, yeah. In Barcelona, just before I flew here. Yeah. And it was just this... It's just so great. Yeah, but I didn't go through it on the first day. Totally. Good, but now... I was like, oh god. I'm going to New York. Me too. It's just so much. And so many lights. Yeah, I'm looking forward to it. Yeah, he's made pretty big leaps and bounds. I mean, we're only really one day in. And yeah, stopping confidence with stopping girls has grown a lot. I mean, he's only had four interactions or three or four interactions and already you can tell he's... Yeah, he's much more confident in general. He's got a lot more authority. I'm going to Cancun later. Yeah, so... And then I googled it. It looks pretty cool. Cancun, then Tulum and so on. Then there's still Yucatan. But that's also Belgium. But it's really cool. Yeah, that's true. Where are you from in Germany? Where do you live? I live in W\u00fcrzburg. But I'm studying in Leipzig. You're studying in Leipzig? Okay, that's pretty cool. I've heard a lot of cool stuff there. Yeah, I'm looking forward to it. What are you doing now? I have to go to Munich Square to meet a few friends. Oh, cool. Do you have Instagram or something? Maybe I'll text you later. Yeah, I don't have one right now. Oh, okay. Then give me a few friends."}
