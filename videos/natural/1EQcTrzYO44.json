And I know there's a lot of that out there on the internet, you know, when incels are kind of a joke in and of themselves, brought up in disdainful ways, cruel ways, often like kind of victim blaming ways that it's because they're something something, it's their fault, that they're undateable. And I don't perceive that at all."}
