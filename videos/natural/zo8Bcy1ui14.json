I remember this. He doesn't say anything. And then the girl thinks, well, it's cause I'm fat or I'm ugly. Or there's something wrong with him. Maybe he's gay. And she either takes it on board herself or projects it on the guy. It's said something like, what's the problem? Which is the worst thing you can say to a man who's having trouble getting it up. He's like, ah, no problem. And now there is a problem. And this feedback loop happens. And then there's an awkward experience. Either or both people walk away from that feeling bad about it or having an attitude about men or women about it. I remember those exact types of experiences. When I started just talking to girls and saying, hey, when I'm with a new partner, sometimes I feel a bit nervous. I don't get it up instantly. So can we just take it a little slowly or let's have a break or don't stress about it. It'll change. It solved the problem. Then the woman was on my side. Then she was like, oh, okay, cool. Can I help? Or what do you need me to do? It wasn't about her being fat or me being gay or whatever it was about. This is not an easy thing necessarily for a man sometimes to get it up on command. And she wants you to, and she wants you to feel good. And she wants you to feel turned on. And so she wants to engage and help to create that awesome juice between you two."}
