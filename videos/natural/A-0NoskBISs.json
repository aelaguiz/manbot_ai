What do they do? That's why the first thing men ask each other or people ask each other, people ask men, is what do you do? So I can figure out what function do you achieve? Are you useful to me? And in the case of the family unit, your job is to be the utility to provide, to look after. Of course, with variations, depending on if the woman's working or not. But that is essentially what you are driven into. Either aggressively and coercively, or with this soft kind of, just over, just over here. There you go. Sit there, stay there forever. Who feels they've been a victim of some kind of influence like that in their life? Who here had parents or other people of that generation, when you look at it, they followed the dream, and even though at that time, economically it made sense and maybe they got to buy a house and whatever, they didn't have the most fun life. Who is being on or is on a path currently where they are following exactly what seemed to be the textbook of what they should do, yet there are areas in their life, major areas, where they feel dissatisfaction and it's not working. There was more than that, but some people just didn't want to admit it. That's been the drive that's kept me moving this whole fucking time, is that I don't want to have a life deficient. I never really gave a shit about money except as a tool for freedom. That is the way that I view it. And that doesn't mean I'm frivolous or stupid with it. I'll talk to you guys a bit about the way that, let's say lifestyle entrepreneurs handle their finances, but it was always not a tool to create status or to create a buffer zone between me and the scary world. It was to create opportunities for freedom. However, the amount that I needed at various stages in my life to get into whatever it is that I wanted to develop, whether it was my spirituality or my musical career or networking or seduction, was way, way, way less than what I was told was needed. Because mostly the message is, if you want success, implication is if you want beautiful women in your life, then you need all the trappings. You need the fancy watch and the nice car and the prestigious job and the respect of a bunch of dudes who wear ties, in order to then one day at some point, it doesn't exactly explain how this happens, but out of that comes a hot wife, all right? Yeah, it's like you're looking at the ad and you're like, okay, buy the car and then something happens and then here I am with a beautifully functional relationship with the girl of my dreams and I somehow know how to fuck her perfectly and she's like well balanced and not hysterical and not entitled and I can manage her moods and it's all totally fine because I got the car. Oh. So in my opinion, if you're looking to design your life, especially for guys that wanna unplug from the career matrix, right? So does anyone here have any who's doing it? Where's Patrick, where are you? Yeah, there's Patrick S, there he is, excellent. There's, I'm sure there is a lot of people in this room who are experimenting with trying to unplug from the nine to five rat race, work in one company forever until you die, do exactly as you're told even if you fucking hate it, life. Who's interested in not doing that a bit? Okay, good, so this speech is relevant, excellent. So what are the other metrics that are missing in that life and I know I'm painting a very bleak picture of it because I'm just justifying why I never did it, but and obviously there are all sorts of grades of that and some people work that system to their advantage. Many do not and many get ground down over decades into wage slaves or they just have to sacrifice so much of their time and energy and health and have to deal with all of the stress and all the other bullshit that comes along with success in certain types of dominance hierarchies, which I'll be looking at it in a lot more detail tomorrow. So what are the other metrics for success that you should really be paying attention to? Anyone? Time? Absolutely, managing time. We can't get that back and if you put 80 hour weeks into something for long periods, unless you're really loving it, then you're wasting your life, in my opinion. I don't, I mean, I'm doing an 80 hour week right now. Absolutely, I will do 80 hour weeks sometimes when I really need to pull off something or I'm really invested in getting a project together when I'm teaching a workshop, yeah, I'm doing an 80 hour week, but then I'll have three weeks to do some other shit after that, all right? So it's not about that you always have to do the four hour work week kind of style life to be managing your time well, but if you're looking down the barrel of, this is another 10 years of me doing that if I wanna make partner. If that's, if you're very predisposed to that and that is your dream and passion, cool, pay the price. If you're not and you would rather lift some of the other metrics, then you will need to reconsider your life position. You will need to make drastic changes. What else? Health, health, absolutely. Okay, so there are all sorts of industries and pursuits and ways of life that although they may develop the financial success, destroy your health and mind. Yeah, and a lot of that is to do with modern lifestyle diseases, to do with bad diet, stress, bad sleep and opioids, I believe. We'll shout out to the opium heads in there. I mean, it's good stuff, right? Just like, oh shit, this isn't a dream, this is real. All right, what else? Freedom will, well, essentially freedom is the umbrella. That's what designing a life should be about. It's to be able to create levels of freedom. None of us are 100% free in the sense that we can't just go and like shoot someone in the head if we want to, because there'll be consequences. You know, there are limitations based on the people around us, but there are some people who live extraordinarily free lives and many who volunteer into slavery. And then there's a whole bunch that have no fucking choice. None of you exist within that group. All of you have choice. If you got here, even if someone had to get out of North Korea to get here, by the time that guy arrives, he's getting a free bootcamp, I promise. People are, people are, for, all right, yeah, yeah, all right. Okay, we'll work on that. That's a, that's a work in progress, that idea. What other metrics? Okay, so freedom, relationships, absolutely, right? Because the old school says to us in many ways, settle down quickly with a woman and breed. Why? What's the agenda there? Why not just say, just whatever you want to do with women and relationships and children, do it? Why do they give a shit? Who? Why do the parents care about their genes being passed on? I don't actually think anyone cares about passing their genes on. I think people care about passing their memes on. Like, it's like, do I really care that half my genetic coding is gonna be recreated in another human being and it's gonna sort of half look a bit like me and have some of my fucking issues? No, but I do care about my legacy. I do care about passing on, not the family name so much, but passing on a legacy of who I was and what that meant at this time in history. I think that's really why grandparents start putting pressure on people, is because they want another generation to remember them so that they can actually pass on the idea of the fact that they existed on this planet. I think it's a fairly narcissistic motivation. Pleasure. Well, before we get into pleasure, which we should, don't defer that too long. In terms of the relationship stuff, let's look at it a little bit more, because there are overall societal structures that benefit very well from men settling down with a woman that exists within what demographic? This, what? The same demographic. The same demographic, essentially, right? People, there is, the only social mobility exists for women because of what? Because of their vagina. Exactly. And the quality of them, right? So women use beauty to climb socially. And if I was a hot chick, I would too, absolutely. Right, so they have that resource that they can, if they have that resource and it's valued, if they're in Siberia, hot chicks are a dime a dozen, same girl moves to New York, she can have any banker there, and she can set herself up in a new type of lifestyle, as she should, all right? For men, the leverage and mobility tends to be because of? What is that? Status, finances, resources, okay? So typically, people are shuffled into and encouraged to just shack up with someone that exists within your demographic, if you can move up through some advantage, then cool, do that. But settle down, have children, because that locks you into the space that society at large, probably your family at large, and the globe operates on fairly well. Family units keep things working, people keep working and saving and bringing up children, the whole machine rolls and rolls, right? But it's not necessarily, and often definitely not, for the advantage of the individual. It's not designed that way, although it will be marketed that way, and as a thing that there is almost no alternative. The only alternative is really an immature, masculine, boyish pursuit of Peter Pan, never never land, getting laid forever, traveling the world, bagging chicks. That's essentially what it is that we are doing, would be considered to be something that is like, why would somebody do that? Only if they have not developed as a man, only if they have not come to peace with the like, I am a man who has duty, who is supposed to do these sorts of things, and my function and my value is in my utility. To a large degree, men are valued by their utility. What do they do? That's why the first thing men ask each other or people ask each other, people ask men is what do you do? So I can figure out what function do you achieve? Are you useful to me? And in the case of the family unit, your job is to be the utility to provide, to look after, of course, with variations depending on if the woman's working or not, but that is essentially what you are driven into, either aggressively and coercively, or with this soft kind of just over here, sit there, stay there forever. Who feels they've been a victim of some kind of influence like that in their life? Who feels like they haven't, that they've just been able to avoid that constantly? How'd you do that? Pushing where though? Like away from that? Uh-huh. Yep. We are all tied by strings. We are all puppets to some degree. We can't not be until unless we reach some basically Buddha level of disattachment from everything that we're not influenced by anything. You often hear life coaches saying be outcome independent, be internally validated. I've probably said it. I definitely have said it and I stand by it, but it's a moonshot goal. It's something to work towards because the truth is we will never be removed 100% from our conditioning. We will never be totally unreliant on our environment or our peers or the zeitgeist, the ideologies that are floating around in our time and space, the things that are infecting us mimetically, but we can certainly do a very good job of recognizing and understanding when those things are owning us and riding us as opposed to us being able to recognize them for what they are and use them if we need to and discard them if we want to. That's the crux of true lifestyle design. I'll put that aside because I want to come back to that. Any other metrics? Which understanding? Okay, cool. Yeah, like when I look at what do I think, what do I work on the metrics in my life and what are the ones that I'm coaching people on because they come to me and they're like, wanna learn to pick up chicks and have a better life. Can we do that in a week? Yes. So the areas I'm looking at are yes, the way that you spend your time with your career and finances, your location where that is to me is a very, very important piece that a lot of men don't even think about. Your overall enjoyment day to day. A lot of people defer their gratification too far. Deference of gratification is an important skill to be able to do, especially if you wanna start a business, if you wanna live a life that's outside of the safe lane, then it will often require being super lean. It will require you to be able to defer certain gratification for sometimes years. But if the idea is that I'm gonna defer my enjoyment of my life till the end of it, which is essentially what we're told. Okay, if you have fun along the way, well, don't have too much, but that's not the point. The point is fulfill your duty and at the end, then you get to put out the pasture in Miami. So in my opinion, if you wanna design a good life, you need to be enjoying a lot of it, right? It should be a joy to live. \u266a It ain't all good, but it's all good \u266a \u266a I said it's all good \u266a \u266a It ain't all good, but it's all good \u266a"}
