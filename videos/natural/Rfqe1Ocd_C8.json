Gentlemen, James Marshall here from The Natural Lifestyles, back in 2020. Now, it's been quite some time since I've had a chat to you guys in a more kind of informal way, not just a slick production advertisement or rant. So I wanted to have a chat with you guys just about what's been going on for TNL and for myself and what is in store in possibly our hugest year ever. In a decade of huge years, 2020 is set to be totally insane, stacked upon a lifetime of insanity. So this video that you're watching was filmed, I don't know, three or four weeks ago, which seems like three or four years ago. And so much of about what you're about to see, especially the bit where I'm just about to say 2020 is going to be the craziest, wildest coaching year ever as I career across the planet and go to lots of different countries and touch people in the forehead or anywhere I want. I was wrong. So basically all of that is no longer relevant, although kind of interesting to look back on three weeks ago when everyone thought everything was fine. There is a lot of relevant stuff in this, however, if you want to find out what happened to Liam, why half of our YouTube videos are gone, and the secret to curing... No, I don't have that one. Other cool shit, then stay watching. And this thing over here, this is the last thing that I bought when I was rich. So this is a Lithuanian outdoor jacuzzi. And I wouldn't buy it now because I can't afford it, but I did buy it and now it's here. So I'm glad. So I'm going to have a bath later. Get back to the video. What's been going on? Right now I'm here in Portugal, out at Natropia, and I'm having some wonderful time here in nature, building, planting, reconnecting to Mother Earth, myself, as well as, of course, always plotting, planning, scheming, designing and creating. So I don't know about you guys, but for myself as an introvert, I need good chunks of time more or less alone to, yeah, really decompress, reconnect, and also then to work out what's next. So you may have noticed that I've gone a little bit dark in terms of social media. For a while I was posting heaps of Instagram stories of my jauntings around the globe, and then at some point I just stopped. Why was that? Mainly, mainly because I couldn't be fucked. So any conspiracy theorists out there, mainly because, fuck, being a daily vlogging, Instagramming dude, that is exhausting. I don't know how people do it, and it does take you away from the present moment. However, secondarily, and also importantly, was that last year, 2019, was the busiest, most intense, and let's say most chaotic year that this company has had for a number of reasons. Firstly, because, as you guys know, that was my last year as a full-time seduction coach, leading all of the workshops around the world, the 7-day and the 10-day workshops. And so I was doing all of that, plus we added a new suite of incredibly fucking mind-blowingly advanced new workshops, the Natural Warrior Training held here, and the Sex God Masterclass held in a secret, dirty location. So I was doing a heavy load of coaching, plus all this new stuff, plus all sorts of roles, changing new people, coming in and out, of course putting out shitloads of videos, and still traveling the world, learning movement from Ido Portal and Kung Fu and shamanism and business and reconnecting, and still trying to find time to see my mum and hang out with my friends and do all the shit that I love to do. So that was 2019 in a hyperbolic 30-second rant. So what does that leave us now? Well, before we get onto what's going on in 2020, and there is a lot of crazy shit and cool shit coming, what I wanted to do was actually change the tone a little bit and show you around Natropia. So this is my farm, my property in Portugal, and it's not just a farm, it's a space which I am developing as a workshop space, as a retreat space, as an artist residence, and also as an organic permaculture farm, agroforestry experiment, and all sorts of other cool shit. It's my passionate moment and it's connected to everything else that I'm doing, so I want to show you around. So when I bought this place, I inherited these two geese, and believe it or not, they're 30, shut up, 30 years old, 30 years old these fuckers, so, and then I went ahead and bought a bunch of chickens. So when I was buying the chickens, I saw that they had peacocks there, and I thought immediately, fucking, I'm buying the peacocks, obviously. So come check this out. Stay by me, huh? Just a little bit further. Come on, come on. Just this way. Come on. Come. Nearly there now. Shut up. I think part of the reason why I suddenly, impulsively bought like nine large birds was because of Emiya Kusturica's movies about gypsies, and they always have flocks of geese. Like whenever the gypsies are running through in Black Cat or White Cat, there's always like a flock of fucking geese and goats. So I got a bunch of geese and some goats. This is our stone circle and fire pit where we hold the all-night bonfire and San Pedro ceremony during the natural warrior training, so it's beautifully overgrown now as nature comes back. But in April, that again will be alight as 12 men sit around, ah, you fucking ruined my take. The postal service is surprisingly good here. Like way better than fucking Budapest. Hungary, you suck. Here shit gets delivered directly to your fucking... Of course. Look. Sorry, Augusta. Look, it's not what it looks like. I don't... This is so cliche. It's like... Do you think we set that up? Do you think we hired a dude to drive in dressed up like Portuguese postal service? All right, well, this I can explain. That's for the sex class. See? It's great service. This I bought on Portuguese eBay. It's an 1840s American thing that used to be pulled by a buffalo or whatever and that you would dig out as you were a frontiersman digging out the fucking west, you would sell your corn. And so of course I just had to have it. So these were the old pig sheds when Daphne used to have pigs in the 90s and now I've converted it into a little goat area and behold, that one's called Little Brown, that one's called Goat. Hey, little cutie. So as cute as these little creatures are, they're also fucking awesome machines. So my plan is to move them with electric fences through the property anywhere that there's weeds and blackberries and they'll be my organic fertilizers and weed destroyers. Won't you? Yes. Eat them all. Alright, see you later. So down here, this used to be a big pile of pig shit because this old piggery produced a lot of pig shit. It was left in a big pile for 10 years and now became a huge pile of compost. So I got my boys to build this cute fence and this will be my first ever attempt at a vegetable garden. So I have no experience at all, basically the only thing I've ever grown is some marijuana plants and they died, but I'm all inspired to become a hippie permaculture gardener so tomorrow we're going to plant a whole bunch of whatever it is you plant in early spring in Portugal, I don't know, parsnips, kohlrabis, some ancestral type of turnip. We shall find out. I'm really very lucky with the geography of this area. Basically it's perfect Mediterranean climate, great rainfall and a whole range of different topography. On this fairly small property I've got rolling pastoral farmland, I've got hillside covered in forests, we've got little streams and marshlands and drier areas and more lush areas. It's gorgeous as you can see. So over on the hillside over here, there's basically a hillside covered in eucalyptus and pine trees. So these are just cheap plantation trees that were planted by the locals. They harvest them every 10 years for the wood and they gradually degrade the soil because they've cut down all the old Portuguese forest. So my plan is over time to cut down these introduced forests and replace them with the old cork oaks and the chestnuts and all these beautiful old Portuguese trees. And while I was planning this one night, I was sitting down and there was this area on the hillside that I was thinking about. And what it is, it's an old terraced area. So the locals, hundreds of years ago, they would take the hillsides and they would make staircases where they would make walls of stone and then they would make these staircases and then they would cultivate them with olive trees or whatever crops they were growing. And over the years, these things have now been grown over and fallen into disrepair. So what I did was I sent a forestry team up there, got them to cut down all of the trees and we've revealed this staircase. And then in my mad late night ponderings, I came upon this idea, which is now happening, which is that I decided to build a Roman amphitheater made out of stone, handmade out of stone, and then up onto the hillside to cover it in an olive grove. And right now you're thinking, what the fuck are you talking about, James? Well, come on, I'll show you. Just down here. This way. Just a little further. This way. Don't be shy. You see that? So I came across these guys, Carlos and his offsider, when they came to build me a little bridge and I discovered that these two gentlemen are excellent stonemasons and so they've just taken all the rocks out of the hillside and they're just using that and cement and they're building an amphitheater that hopefully shall last 1,000 years. So as you can see over here, this is the start of the amphitheater and these gents are just by hand placing like a jigsaw puzzle every single rock and doing a gorgeous job. This has only taken them like a week so far. So you can see this is the hillside and so all of these steps were built 100 years God knows how long ago by peasants for stacking the stones and now these gents have harvested them all to build my theater. Why? Can't do that. If everything stays on target, which it seems to be, by the summer this will basically be an olive grove and the olive trees that I'm getting are over 100 years old because everyone in this country has 100 year old olive trees in their back garden and they like to sell them for a couple of hundred bucks so the aim is that by next summer this will look like an olive grove and theater that has been here for 500 years so that in 1,000 years people will be confused when they find the strange Illuminati symbols and totally irrelevant things that I've carved into the rock and hidden inside with secret messages which mean nothing. Now I know from lots of emails and Facebook messages that I've received and comments on videos that a whole bunch of you guys are confused about what's happening with this channel and fair enough and I've wanted to talk to you about this for some time but shit has been very busy and also we haven't exactly known what we should be doing. So, in case you hadn't noticed, something like half of the videos on this channel are now gone. Look back for your favourite daily naturals and infield videos and movie roasts and so on, and they're gone. Why is that? It's not my choice. If I had my way, I would love all of our material to be up online forever. However, we have received very good advice from other people within this industry, so guys who are our direct competitors, as well as our collaborators, as well as lots of people in the marketing industry and people who are in the know when it comes to YouTube. Unfortunately, YouTube's policies are getting much stricter and a bunch of channels have been taken down. Not necessarily channels exactly like us, but, you know, pick-up artist channels and things about gender and about politics, and unfortunately, we, or let's say dating coaches, are all lumped in the same category, and we've been told very clearly that if we want this channel to continue, we don't want to wake up one morning and find it just nuked, that we should definitely take down a lot of our videos. So that's what we've done. Is that something we're going to do? Will it be permanent? We don't know. We need to just see how things play out in the broader scheme of things on social media, but we need to keep this channel as PC as possible, and unfortunately, that means, yeah, we've had to censor ourselves and take down videos, which we put a huge amount of resources and time and creativity into because we want to give you guys the very best and give you everything, all of the aspects of our knowledge. We don't want to have to only kind of cherry-pick certain aspects that YouTube finds acceptable, but unfortunately, that's where things are for now. So we're looking into putting all of our videos up on another platform. Vimeo is actually even stricter, so the major platforms probably won't work. So we're looking into creating our own little mini-platform where we will at some point sooner rather than later host all of our videos and you will have access to them again. So in the meantime, I apologize for the fact that they're all gone. It's not my fault, it's not my choice, but really, it's what we have to do to make sure that we are able to have a channel at all so that we can stay in touch with you guys. So that's what's going on there. Next, on the drama controversy list, if you've been a fan of TNL for longer than a week, you will have noticed that my right-hand man, my top coach, close friend, and doppelganger Liam has disappeared as well. So his videos have been taken down, he's not on the internet at the moment. And so obviously, a lot of people are asking, what the fuck happened there? And there are conspiracy theories, assumptions that, well, who knows what happened to Liam? You know, who was that guy? We don't even talk about him anymore. He had a mysterious accident. So firstly, what I want you guys to know is that there is absolutely no blood, bad blood, there's no blood, no bad blood between he and I or anyone else. He's still part of TNL, he's still working with us, he's still coaching on all of the workshops that he was listed for this year. So he's still the operational head of the company. He's just decided, for personal reasons, to step back from the public eye. And in terms of being, this is a guy that's been a public figure, he hasn't been mega-famous, but he's had a lot of attention on him since he was 19 years old, he's now 31. And so he decided that he needs to take a bit of time for himself to go dark in terms of the internet and to figure out what's going on for him in the next phase of his life. As a man, when you're going through your satin return, the end of your 20s, start of your 30s, and I know this for myself and many, many clients I teach, this is a time of introspection, a time of rethinking what it is that you want out of life and evolving into your kingship as opposed to being on your warrior path. And that's what Liam is doing at the moment, and he has our full support, full backup, and he's still with us. And he's welcome to come back and make a big splash again publicly as and when he wants to or to continue doing things in the underground, behind the scenes, and working with us on the workshops. So, if you want to work with Liam, any of the 7-day and 4-day workshops this year, almost all of them, he is leading, and so he's still out there grinding the streets, helping people, changing lives, he just don't want to be on the internet for a bit. As somebody who's spent all my career not doing anything really practical, you know, with your hands and lifting and fucking smashing shit, it's been really fun to do that. And so, one of the things I did was teach myself to chainsaw, and what I've been doing here is dropping the waddles and bits of eucalyptus and fucking pine trees and chopping them up and let them dry. As per permaculture and agroforestry, you don't clear the undergrowth, we'll just chop it up, let it rot into the earth. Up on my hillside, so this is all covered densely in waddles and eucalyptus trees, as you can see. Now, these are all pests. I know it might look like a nice forest, but it's not. So, I'm going to chop it up and let it rot into the earth. So, I'm going to chop it up and let it rot into the earth. So, I'm going to chop it up and let it rot into the earth. These are all pests. I know it might look like a nice forest, but they suck the water out of the soil, the local plants and animals don't recognise them, so it's basically a desert. The great thing about that is it allows me to do a guilt-free massacre of an entire forest. You know, like in Walking Dead, when they just gun down a whole herd of zombies and you feel nothing because you know that they're undead. But when, you know, you see them shooting down a whole bunch of Nazis in a movie, you sometimes have to consider the greater, you know, questions at large of humanity and what it's like for them to experience this and was it really their fault, and then you can't enjoy the massacre. Here, I get to enjoy chopping down a forest without having to worry. In fact, I'm helping the environment. Stop! So, the other thing that people have been a bit confused about is whether or not TNL is still a seduction company. So people writing in the comments after I'm putting out videos about The Natural Warrior and sexuality and all sorts of other stuff that we're interested in. People saying, oh, do you guys still teach pick-up chick stuff? So, the answer is absolutely yes. The Natural Lifestyles has always been, and I presume will always be, a natural seduction company. But as we've always been, we have always embraced holistic change. We've always looked at a vast array of technologies, mindsets, and ways of life when it comes to if you want to optimize your success with women, we've always understood that you need to optimize yourself. That if you want to be attractive, then you have to have an attractive life, you have to have an attractive inner world that is rich, that is creative, that is curious, and that needs to reflect in the things that you do, the people that you hang out with, and what your purpose and mission is. So, for me, I've always used The Natural Lifestyles as a vehicle for my own personal growth, for my own personal mission. I've been very privileged to be able to make my personal mission also my business and my professional mission. And that's allowed me to spend the better part of the last ten plus years exploring the world, bringing in different teachers for myself initially, and then passing those teachings on to people that come to me to learn. So, the answer is yes, we will continue to do our four-day, seven-day, and ten-day workshops. They will be led by the rest of the team. I've trained up these coaches over many years. They're all exceptional specialists in their own areas, as well as having a broad understanding of TNO concepts and applications. However, because I'm a groovy, because I'm a groovy, growing, gradually evolving, funky dude, I'm always looking to grow and change. And so, in the last few years, I've been exploring a whole bunch of other areas, such as shamanism, as movement technology, internal change, business, lifestyle design, lots of cool shit. And so, I've put together a bunch of new workshops, which I would say is the next evolution of Natural Lifestyles thinking, and adds, let's say, like adds to the suite of experiences that guys can have when they come to us. So, for the most part, men come to us because they're having problems with women, but they didn't just come because they wanted to get laid quick with strippers tonight, which some spurious dating coaches might suggest is possible and try to sell you. Men come to us because they want, yes, success with women, but they want to feel good about themselves. They want to not have to say bullshit lines or put on some false bravado or pretend to be somebody they're not. They want to be themselves, but be able to remove the filters of fear and doubt and ignorance and information that's incorrect. They want to adjust their mindsets. They want to upgrade their emotional intelligence so that they can connect with women on a real level, to be able to do it quickly and effectively, yes, but also to be able to do it in a way that is sincere and true to them. So, for me, the natural progression was moving past just teaching this holistic type of seduction and moving into, let's say, deeper men's work. I've been working with men for over 12 years, and the same patterns of internal problems come up over and over and over again. The how to meet a girl, how to have a good conversation, how to escalate, how to design a life, even how to set correct goals or meditate for optimizing your health and sleeping, for example. All of these things, these are tools, and they're not easy to learn because you do need to find the right teachers, but they can be learned relatively quickly and put into your internal toolkit. However, this is only really a fraction of the issue that I've been dealing with. For most men, the issues are not so much the what to do and what to say and how to do it, although they do need to learn that. It's the how do they feel about themselves, their sense of worthiness, their sense of purpose and their sense of belonging. These, I've found to be the biggest issues that men face. The real reasons why they don't go and talk to that cute girl in the coffee shop or ask for that raise or decide to leave their small town and go and try and make it big in the city or do whatever it is that they actually fucking want to do is because of this sense of this fear of that possibly I'm not enough, that I'm not good enough, that I don't have what it takes, that she wouldn't like me, all of these doubts. It's perfectly natural to have them. I've had doubt and this shadow follow me every step of the way through a lifetime of overall success. I've fucked up and I've had periods of being down, I've had projects that were failures but overall I've succeeded. But every step of the way I've had this sense of what if it doesn't work, I'm bullshitting, I'm not enough, this will never happen. Those things still existed alongside the positive thoughts of I can do this, I'm the man, I'm going to change the world. So when I was looking at how do I crack this nut, this complex, deep but fairly universal issue that men who come to me and I think most men in general have and I don't have a singular answer because I don't think there is one. But I have found over the years mentors for myself and tools and ways of living and thinking and being that really, really do help you to overall feel exceptionally confident, to be able to live a life that has purpose, to be able to be embodied in a very, let's say loose, creative and enjoyable way. And so over the last several years I started constructing a prototype of a workshop that would address these deeper issues and that's what the Natural Warrior Training became. Last year I held the first full version of the Natural Warrior Training here on this property with 12 amazing men from around the world in these forests, in the fields, the bamboo groves. And over the 7-8 days that we had together something truly, truly magical happened. You know, I've run a lot of what I would consider to be exceptionally good, incredible workshops in my time. It's been my passion, my profession, something I've dedicated my life to. But every now and then you pull a group together and something about the alchemy, just the combination of people creates something truly special and that's what happened on the last Natural Warrior Training. All of us got to see huge transformations in each other, in reflection to each other and also on deeply personal and let's say intimate levels. I saw men really like releasing trauma, activating their power, their masculinity, their sexuality in a really positive and clean way. I saw men dealing with family issues, with their ancestral pain that's been passed down father to son, grandfather, you know, going back through generations. And guys realizing that the culture of their family had been influencing them and trapping them in patterns that they were their own."}
