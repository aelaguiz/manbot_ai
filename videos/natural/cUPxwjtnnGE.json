They won't say, oh, okay, I get it. Take these pills and see you in a week. So here are some of the ways that I've personally found to be very beneficial from a therapeutic position and I've also worked with lots of clients and I've given these techniques to clients, I've led them through and I've gone and sought out various teachers and healers in my own life as well. I don't want to necessarily advocate one school over the other. Like if you're going to get therapy where you go and talk to someone, there is a lot of different types of therapy and very different schools of thought and some of them I don't think are very good. Many therapists are not very good, like especially unregulated industries like life coaching, right? There is no life coaching standard. There is no dating coaching standard at all on the planet. So literally anyone, you right now set up a YouTube channel and say, hi, I'm a life coach, I charge $1,000 an hour and if someone pays you, then you're a $1,000 an hour life coach, can be done. Now, obviously, if you're a psychologist or a psychiatrist or various types of counselors and various therapists, then you do need accreditation but that still doesn't mean you're going to be good. Being a good coach and a good therapist is not an easy task and most people are not suited to it. It requires you not only to be empathetic and to be able to listen and read people very well but it requires you to be able to see through their bullshit and call them out on that as well. So I remember like school counselors, I went to one when I was 16 or something and it was just like some dude with a long scarf and all I remember him doing was this. Hmm. Like literally that. Whatever it was I said, I can't remember. Oh, that's my problem. Hmm. That's all I remember him doing was a hmm. So it didn't help me very much. So I would be ready to dump your therapist like you dump a Tinder date, literally. If you want to go and seek out a therapist, it may take six to find them and that's where finding them by referral, finding someone who says, yeah, this person really helped me. Although they may not be able to help you because their characters are different but okay, a personal referral is useful. But if you go and you see the person is not listening, not asking good probing questions, not directing you somewhere, right? So if I only ask you to tell me your story, that will be useful for the storyteller in some sense and it is a good thing to just say your story. I fought that for years because I was a Buddhist and I did meditation, which I think is another very amazing therapeutic tool. But the thing with meditation is, depends on the type, but if we're using, let's say Vipassana, the action is to observe and not to interfere at all. That is all. Observe and don't get involved, right? There's a way to do that, a technique to do that, but that is the core of it. Why do we do that? We do that because we don't project things onto reality, right? We get to step back and observe reality more or less objectively or more objectively than we do when we put many layers of meaning upon something. So if I sit in silence and I watch my breath or I watch my body, I will start to learn a lot about myself and I will start to heal in some ways automatically. Automatically, I will start to drop stress. If I go into a meditation session like this and I had a stressful day, I sit down and I'm meditating and I'm fucking... My life is better right now. Those five seconds of me going, I don't know, what am I doing? Oh, yeah, I'm getting aware of my body, I'm loosening, I'm dropping tension and I'm starting to observe myself. Just doing that on camera for five seconds, I already feel a bit better. I already feel a little bit more clear because it just gives me that little window of shut up. Just shut the fuck up, you. And you don't have to force the thoughts away, you just force them to do what they're doing, but you create space. And within space, automatic processes that know how to unwind and unravel and relax will have a chance to relax. When you lie down and you finally fall asleep, you don't need to remind your body to keep sleeping and wake up every hour and go, oh, you're still sleeping? It's like when you switch off certain things, other automatic processes will take over that are positive. They're built into you to design, to break down waste and toxins and rebuild cells and all the good stuff that humans do. So meditation is a form of, let's say, pure observation if it's done purely. And that yields a lot of benefits. And it's not the only thing. Because I was stuck in that for years, because I thought Buddhism is a complete system, my aim in life is to be enlightened, not happy, not fulfilled, not successful, but enlightened. I wanted at the age of 20-something, which is a bit weird, I wanted to be free of all human suffering, all attachments. And so that's what I was working on. Good day, gentlemen. I hope you're enjoying this deep topic for today. Now, coming up very soon from the 4th until the 8th of October, I'm going to be running my very final live infield seduction workshop for the year in Manhattan, New York City, myself leading this four-day workshop. So if you'd like to join me, there is literally only one spot left. So I'm talking to you. Click the link in the description, get on a call with Alex, and hopefully we'll see you very soon in New York. And now back to the video. So when someone would talk about a therapist, I look down on that extremely hard, right? I was like, you're going to lie there, talk about your life, which is only a construct. You're going to talk about this narrative, which is just your perception of the narrative. Then you're going to create a map of meaning about why you fucked up. You're going to place blame to your parents. And then you're going to spend the rest of your life with this complex story about why you are the way you are. And that gives you an excuse to be complex and to be fucked up. And then you're going to spend 200 bucks a week going and whinging to someone because no one else is willing to listen to you talk. That's the way I thought about it, until pretty recently, to be honest. And as I said before, you can be self-indulgent and there are plenty of people to whom that is what therapy is. It becomes a recreation of self-indulgence, narcissism, and whinging. So sure, don't go that far. But the other side of it, that I never need to speak about things because I can work them out. I can process them in other ways. I think he's actually short-sighted. Not all the time, but when I feel like there's something I want to say, like there's something inside me and it might be a complaint. It might be a rage. It might be just a ramble. It might be some crazy idea. It might be something I need to say to somebody because I have unresolved feelings for them or we have a conflict that's not resolved and so on. And if I don't speak it, it stays in my, I do, I keep speaking it to myself over and over and over again in my head. I keep having that argument with that person. I keep on complaining about something. I keep on blaming somebody. I keep on reinforcing my old story. Journaling it, writing it down, blurting it out to someone who will listen, even someone who'll go, hmm, is worth something, right? But it's not worth that much. I would say that the thing that makes that talking then move into real therapeutics is when you are with a good therapist who understands that, okay, I need the context of what the person's life is and the person needs to tell me because they need their life to mean something and they want to explain it a bit. That's fine. If I need to say, okay, here's my friends. Here's my lovers. This is what I did. This is how things led to that. That's what happened in my childhood. These things are all relevant, okay? A good therapist will be able to see when you're just getting lost in the story and getting self-indulgent and they'll direct your imagination or your focus or your breathing back to something that they perceive is, okay, this is a sore point or this is an area that needs to be lanced or this is something that needs to be investigated. So a good therapist will use tools and I won't get into the specific tools because that's a whole other video if we want to get that granular but that's part of your experimentation. Five types of talk therapy. Pros and cons. Freudian one, do you like psychoanalysis? Personally, I don't because I think it's too tied up with symbols and sex and I've got enough of that in my life as it is. You know, cognitive behavioral therapy or shock therapy or all sorts of ways that people will do this but the overall characteristics of a good therapist would be someone who asks good, clean questions, listens carefully and you know they're listening because they tell you back what they hear. What I'm hearing you say is, is what a good therapist should say. I'm hearing you say that this is this is this. They won't say, oh, okay, I get it. That means that and that and that. For their own ego, they're like, oh, I've diagnosed you and you're done. Say 12 rosaries, oh no, that's the priest. Take these pills and see you in a week. That's probably not so good but if they're able to draw you into a place in your story, they're able to adjust and change your physiology and put you into an altered state, which is a trance state, it might be like a whole hypnotism thing or it might just be more like, tell me how that felt. Imagine what it was like when you were at that stage. What did it feel? Where can you feel that in your body when you remember that, right? So these are ways of starting to link up the memory, the emotion, the physicality and then in putting you into a trance state, then we can start to use corrective procedures, whether that is some kind of breathing, purgative breathing like a holotropic breath work with hyperventilation, for example, or whether that's alignment, like helping you to align your spine, your organ systems, your energy systems, whether it's just allowing you to breathe into the space where you feel the pain because that can be a really common thing. Once you dissolve the outer layer of numbness using awareness, vipassana or meditation of some sort, and then you go back in, you feel more, right? Now you have more senses and now there's a pain. There's a pain in my heart or a pain in my gut. It might not register as exactly pain but it might be heaviness or numbness, like denseness or heat or cold or there might be all sorts of ways that it represents but then we can start to go into that. We might just have to breathe into that, to draw light and love into it, to say words like I forgive you or I love you, these invocations of healing. I want to release this, I let go. I don't need to hold this anymore or I command you to put this down to your mother or whatever. This is when this becomes therapeutic and in a way what we start to combine is speaking therapies or questioning or conversational therapies with meditation states and also blended with more intense trance states. Now we're in the subconscious, now we're in the deeper emotional layers, not just in the cognition thought layers, so now we're starting to tinker under the hood. Now we're starting to create a purge or a healing or just being heard, just being able to say, you did this to me, even if I can't say it to the person. My therapist has said to me before, I don't care if you sit here for an hour and say nothing. I don't care if you shout at me for an hour, right? Like whatever you need to do to purge or not on a given situation, I will be here to hold space for you. That is what a great therapist does. They don't project their own shit onto you, they don't make assumptions and quick judgments. They gradually draw things out and then hold a space and give you tools to then work through that.
