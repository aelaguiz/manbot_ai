A fan says, I've heard of your days of seduction completely broke. So there's this myth that back in the day I was a seducer and I was also broke. True. How can a guy manage seduction with no money? To start with, I want to say that money does make a difference with women. Money and looks are these two things that everyone wonders like how much effect it has and some people will deny that it has any effect. You know there are certainly seduction teachers who say it doesn't matter what you look like, doesn't matter how much money you got, we can get you strippers tonight no matter what. Now what I want to talk about in terms of this question is like okay, how do you seduce women when you're broke? Can you do that? Does it matter at all? These are the questions we'll look at. So firstly, does it matter at all? And the answer is yes. Now for the first like 10 plus years of me meeting women being a seducer, I had very little money. Sometimes I was what you could call broke in the sense that I only had enough just to get through the week to the next paycheck and you know I was living really uh just living paycheck to paycheck and didn't have any savings. Low income right, so this is broke in Australia, as broke as you can be. There are certainly places in the world where broke means you don't get to eat. I didn't come from that background but I certainly came from a poor background. So throughout my life money was something I had very little of. I didn't have good mindsets around it. I didn't really know how to manage it but I was quite frugal and so in answer to your question how did how did I seduce when I was broke, it didn't mean that I was just dumb with money right. It didn't just mean that I if I ever got it I spent it immediately like a lot of people who are broke do right because money mindsets in terms of having negative money mindsets, a poverty mindset is and it's common is that money is seen as like there's only a finite amount of it you get it a certain amount for your job and anything extra that you ever get is just like this windfall and you don't have any systems in place for doing anything with it other than buying validation purchases right. So like if you live on I don't know 500 bucks a week you got to pay your rent and your bills and so on and then I don't know you made some money doing a freelance job you may not have a concept of how do I invest that in myself. Maybe I need to put that into a course or maybe just into clothing so that I look better or maybe I should just put it away and build it until I can use that to go and do a TNL course or find out this mentor improve myself in some way or start to invest money. People who are poor in mind don't have this and I'm not someone who I don't think that's necessarily poor people's fault. I was poor in mind and and in money throughout a lot of my life and you know there's reasons for that it's not just the fault of the person there's there's a system at play there's economics there's people taking advantage of people there's all sorts of there's the economy of the country all these things involved. However I learned how to live within my means and make my means work for me even when they were very low and I also saw friends and plenty of other people I met who maybe earned more than me or the same as me but were always struggling for money and could never invest money in things that they wanted to. Now when I first started going out cold approaching girls my financial situation was literally that I could afford to pay rent pay for food and that meant I cooked everything and I couldn't afford to go out to meals or rarely so I was cooking everything. I had very you know very little left at the end of a fortnight or a month but what I did have I put into having a good time right eating good food travel and learning things right those are the that's how I spent my disposable income. It wasn't much but over time I would save up over a year to go on a trip to China to train in Kung Fu for example. To me it was a priority to eat good food so organic when I could or just good quality food I had meant I had to cook it and I wanted I was a young guy I wanted to have a good time I wanted to go out I wanted to get laid I wanted to party right so I wanted to be able to do these things. So I didn't like sit down and do a conscious budget right like okay so my seduction budget well if I'm going to spend this amount on coffees then I won't be able to have a car I didn't think of it exactly in in those terms but whenever it came time to make choices about where I placed my limits of resources my social world and my my continuing process of discovering myself through seduction and therefore increasing my social world was more important to me than any physical object. I never I've never had a car now I could have a car now if I'd learned to drive I could and it wouldn't be a liability but throughout your early years unless you live in a very spread out country you know place where the cities are super spread out getting a car will ruin your finances for the first couple of years of you being a working adult. Any kind of heavy debt that is that is on a liability and a car is a liability right I mean you could almost make an argument that a university degree can be a liability but a car or a watch or a flat screen screen tv any gadget or gidget or machinery it loses value immediately it's not an investment so you're you're putting money into it and then it's going to drain money out of you and I saw that with cars. Cars was the most obvious one everyone wanted to get a fucking car when I was 16 or 18 and then they'd borrow money and then they would inevitably crash it or get fines and spend huge amounts on it and for men in their early 20s often the car was the thing that just took all their money. So in answer to your question firstly where do you place your meager resources if you are broke well what does broke really mean you if you are so broke that literally you just can't afford to walk out the door well you need to change that that that needs to be your priority but if you're a student you know you're a student you work a part-time job you're more or less broke in the sense that you don't have a lot of cash around you can you can survive and that's about it and you've got an extra 50 100 bucks a week or something like that in your pocket. So firstly look at if I want to be a seducer I need to put those resources some of my resources into seduction I need to do that. Secondly I need to change my mindset around what do I think women want out of men particularly like especially if you're a younger guy if you're a guy in your late 30s and 40s and you have nothing to your name that will affect your choices with women it just will right like if I if I was 40 which I am and I was living on minimum wage well obviously I couldn't travel like I do I couldn't hang out with the types of women that I do because that involves a certain level of resources I wouldn't feel probably as awesome about myself as I do usually and women a woman who has a lot of options she's not just looking for money right to get that's not a good way to see things there are some women who are just looking for money but mostly not but they are looking for a package particularly as you get older so yeah it is important that I have some kind of resources behind me it doesn't mean that I have to be baller Rolex the Lambo rich that may even hurt me if I was that rich but it means that I need to be able to you know pay for a dinner I need to be able to get in a taxi I need to be able to have a roof over my head a place where I can fuck a woman where I can bring her back to which which has heating in it you know that's the really what I need at that age in any age is a place where a woman can walk into and go I feel okay about being fucked in here right I don't have to drop my dignity and my standards in order to get laid tonight cool he's got sheets that are okay there's the lighting is all right it's warm it doesn't stink there's not another housemate in the room that we're fucking in at least you know it's not in a ghetto where I might get shot you know these are basics of where a good lady a well-bred lady can feel like she's all right to be fucked in so when you're a younger guy you can get away with being broke it can be part of an aesthetic actually it was for me being broke was kind of part of my appeal when I was in my 20s now not that I would lean on that but it was like I was broke because I was a musician because I was following my passions because I was living on the edge you know I didn't know I didn't have any security I didn't know what was going to happen week to week and I was living that in a way that was kind of exciting and I was okay with that right and so women I used to sometimes date women who were corporate chicks who had real jobs and you know would wear nice clothes and they would come over to my house and bang in what was obviously a student pad but it was clean and you know I'd set it up nicely but it was clear I wasn't rolling in it and they kind of liked that right I had one girl I remember who was about 34 or 35 I was much younger and I picked her up and I said well you're gonna have to take me home because I don't have a car and and then she took me home and then I asked her like what's it like dating men in general and she said ah sometimes it's hard with guys my own age because they feel intimidated that I own more than them and I have to play this kind of a try to pretend I'm a ditzy secretary when I'm a director and I said well with me you don't have to worry about any of that I'm just the I'm just your local poor boy here to at your service and she liked that fact that that money was not an issue I wasn't trying to prove myself with money and it was part of my poor boy appeal now if I try that now probably wouldn't go down as well so I'm saying what you need to do is you need to own where you're at financially because if you try to fake it you'll get caught out and it's going to be embarrassing and you will not recover from that right so maybe it means I need to look at my finances correctly but I need to be able to have enough cash to go on dates with girls and dates don't have to be expensive most of my dates back in the day were a cup of tea and a walk a smoothie you know one or two drinks a little picnic where I'd buy some you know some salami and bread and cheese and I'd say hey you grab a cheap bottle of wine and then that was it so the dates were like 10 bucks 20 bucks maybe right so if you can't afford that then you then you need to change something yes if you want to be out seducing girls you need to be able to afford paying for cups of tea and and train tickets basically transport and and food and drinks that's all though it's never a good idea to be taking girls on extravagant dates recently I was working with some guys who were stupid rich you know like 0.1 percent rich and uh I was talking to them about how they're dating girls and they would say things like oh you know well you know when you take them to a nice restaurant and something something and I said don't take girls to restaurants until you fuck them ever and he's like what and I'm like and especially not I know I know you probably go to fancy restaurants in general but don't take them there first because it sets all sorts of weird precedent firstly it says I'm trying to impress you and when a girl senses that she's trying to be that a man's trying to impress her then she decides am I being impressed or not and then she's like okay I'm into control that was impressive that wasn't impressive no I don't want that secondly at the case it can create a weird sense of obligation for the woman if I take her to an expensive thing and she sees that like I've obviously invested in this event she sees that I'm trying to buy her attention or impress her and then therefore she there's some kind of obligation she owes me something that's not a nice feeling so she's less likely to fuck me if there's a feeling that she's obliged to fuck me right so that's another reason not to do it the other one is that it's just formal and uncomfortable sitting across from somebody in a formal setting of any sort I don't think is a good first date so try to keep money out of your dates as much as possible even when you are even if you become wealthy yeah look listen sometimes I'll I take I do take girls out to dinner and stuff once we've started a sexual relationship and you know I've taken girls on trips and I've bought them things and you know the fact that I have more money than the than the younger girl that I'm dating yeah I use I'm not stingy I use my resources but not to try and impress her or win her or buy her so as a poor poor boy uh just you can look at it like I'm gonna I'm gonna do poor boy dates and I and I'm just gonna I don't need to say because I'm poor I can just say hey you want to go for a walk and have a picnic if it comes up where there's a thing where she wants to do something and it's outside your budget you need to just own it then and there right and you just need to say hey listen like that that's well above my income I can't do that kind of you know doing that kind of thing is going to ruin me for the week I don't know what it is she wants to go bungee jumping you know with a golden cord I don't know whatever rich she wants to do a rich thing and you say listen honey I ain't got no money I just here for the good times I got good times I got good loving that's what you're here for so that's that's my attitude that was my attitude back then it was like I'm okay being broke and young and and figuring my shit out I don't know myself I don't I'm not the man I'm going to be I haven't succeeded yet uh but I'm but I'm learning I'm growing I'm loose I'm funny uh I'm making mistakes I'm fucking up I'm living on that edge and yes sometimes I'm just so broke that I can barely afford to pay rent and I'm going to live on lentils for the next five days and that's part of the funny wackness of being down and out as a young dude it gets old right like you don't want to do that forever uh so I'm not here to give advice on how to be a 50 year old guy trying to hustle little glamour girls into bed and convinced and trick them into thinking you're rich or anything like that it's not that it's that some women will screen you out at various levels based on your swag right they will and that that can even be on teenage girls or like young girls who have had a taste of the good life and then they're like yeah well if I'm going to date a guy I'll he has to be fun and cool I like him but he also okay he needs to be to know some people or he needs to have access to this scene or like when I hang out with him we get, you know, I get to eat good food and go to nice places. Some girls care about that and as they get a taste for that they will care about it more if they get access to that, that's true. But that very same girl will still, because I know those girls through modelling scenes, I know girls and I see that they will at the same time be dating like a rich guy where they'll see him once a week or whatever and he takes them out to fancy dinners and flies them to places and buys them shit sometimes. It's not like a prostitution thing but like an informal sugar daddy, right? She's dating a rich guy. That same girl will also be dating like a down and out rapper or like skater kid or whatever who's, you know, her age, is fun, they live in the same world, they speak the same language, she gets him in a different way and she's into him and she fucks that guy and she also, you know, sometimes fucks that rich guy and she feels feelings for him too, right? So you can play different roles and as you grow and change over your life, you will need to. The secret to lifetime seductive success is to be a man of your age, right? That at every age from 16 to 60 there is an attractive archetype for a male, right? You can be a 16-year-old who's fucking cool and 16-year-old girls want to fuck you. You can be a 60-year-old guy who's established, confident, sexually experienced, knows how to treat a woman, is not needy, has, you know, doesn't have that same young man's like need to prove an ego and then a 25-year-old hottie might want to fuck you as well, right? If I'm doing my age well. So if you're at the period where you're the, I'm the broke dude age, wear it well. Invest what little money you have into like dressing in a way that looks cool, even though it can look broke, right? Like I wouldn't wear any more converse and ripped jeans and a flannel shirt. Yes, I would. Basically I would. But like that's the uniform of like a broke skater that's cool, right? He can wear black ripped jeans, converse, which costs whatever 40 bucks in the US and 80 in Australia and a t-shirt and that's it, right? And it can be cool, doesn't have to cost, his outfits don't have to cost a lot. He needs to understand style to an extent, right? You can be a boho hipster and you can do that one into your 40s actually. I know I'd still do that. You can be like a cool hipster in your 40s, you know, one who brews at home. Is that how you, doing my mad home brews here? It doesn't have to cost a lot, right? You don't need to be rich to look cool and to have experiences that are great. My brother and his wife are very low income, but they have an incredible life. They've put resources into travel, learning experiences over all other things. And as a result, they spent the last 10 years doing those as opposed to being poor. They were technically poor the whole time, but they didn't live a poor life. They had amazing experiences all around the world. They just did it cheaply, cheaper than I would in order to make it work. So in conclusion, I would say it's important to look at your finances as one of the pillars of your seduction. I'm not someone who lives for money or who it's my primary goal or motivation, but I see money as freedom. That's why I became successful, like why I pursued business success was so I could have more freedom, not so I could have more shiny things or more impressive stuff to try and get girls to think I was cool because my watch gleams in the sunlight. It was so that I could decide to fuck it, travel here or go and learn from this person or there's that awesome girl and she's in that place, fuck it, I'll go and see her and I'll get an Airbnb instead of a hostel room because I got a bit of cash and that's going to be better for the seduction, right? So therefore, money becomes a tool for freedom, for leverage, for experiences, not for one for self-validation or for propping my ego up. So look at the longer term. If I want to plan for my seductive retirement, my social retirement and my financial retirement, those things are all interconnected. I need to learn how to cold approach and I need to draw leads. I need to learn how to bring money in my life so that I can have some kind of freedom and I also need to understand that it's not necessary to have heaps of it to be free. I've met many people around the world who just have a guitar and a suitcase or a backpack and they go around and busk or they go and work on farms or they work seasonally. People who live very, very cheaply but manage to have extraordinary lives. I think it's good to be able to have both now that I have money and freedom. It means that I can multiply my effects. Awesome. But I've always lived free even when I was totally broke. So look at what are your core fundamental values here. What does money mean to you as a tool? Is it something you're hiding from and not learning about and therefore staying in the poverty trap forever? Or is it something that you're learning about in conjunction with your other life skills and you're okay with where you're at with it right now, you'll work within your means and you'll show women that the reason that they want to date and fuck you is not because of your money, it's because you're charming, because you're there with them, because you're willing to learn about them, because you're growing as a man and that is vitally and incredibly and timelessly attractive throughout the ages no matter how much cash you got. This video was filmed a couple of months ago when the world looked very different and my financial situation was very different. I was speaking from the position of someone who was very wealthy and who had made it and I was reminiscing about my old days about being a broke vagabond musician and how I managed to pick up girls in those scenarios. Two months later I find myself in a situation where I'm certainly not broke but I'm in a much leaner situation than I was previously and it's great because, I mean it's not great, but one great thing about it is that I do have the skills to go lean. I mean I was spending money building this which is you can see a Greek theater and the idea is that this terraces up here will be covered in olive trees so I'm still doing that. I'm putting some of my money into that but I am living a lot more of a lean lifestyle and that's one of the tenets of lifestyle design is being able to use your resources effectively and when I talk about seductive economy I talk about currencies. Now currencies are not just money. Currencies are things that you trade with people. A smile is a currency. If I smile at you and you feel good it's worth something to you. Advice, helping someone with a specialized skill, connecting somebody, swapping and trading skills. There's so many ways that humans have transactions that are non-financial and in this video I was talking about how do you manage your finances in a way that's more effective depending on what stage you are at in your life and the whole point I was trying to make is you don't have to be rich to live a rich life. You can't be broke in mind and in pocket and in mentality and expect to enjoy yourself but you can have limited resources financially and have excellent social resources, excellent networks. You can have people wanting to do favors for you, to help you out, to give you opportunities that they wouldn't give to other people and so on and so what I've done over the last number of years as I've been living my own life in this way I've been codifying how is it that I move strategically through life, through cities and then through the planet making connections with usually groups of powerful men and I don't mean powerful in the okay they're CEOs and suits in a boardroom although some of them are those. I mean powerful in the sense that they have influence. They have access to social scenes or to girls or to information or to investment advice. Things that the average person don't get doesn't get access to I get access to because I'm many layers up or many levels up when it comes to global social lifestyle design. If you want to learn how to maximize your resources not just your money but your charm, all the things that you have to offer and if you are deficient in those how to work out how to develop currencies that other people want to trade on then you should check out my Lifestyle Design Academy which is coming very soon in the middle of May where I will be outlining and breakdowning my blueprint for designing a wonderful life in the 21st century and I'll be there with you week by week giving you live lectures, keeping you accountable, giving you missions, making sure that this is not just a theoretical dump of more information that you can absorb and then forget but actionable steps backed up by me pushing you and encouraging every single week to redesign your life completely even if you're in lockdown because that will end at some point and there's a lot of groundwork that we can do prior to lockdown ending depending where you are in the world so that you can hit the ground running not just in terms of being a hustle monster monster but in terms of being an intelligent social animal someone who is able to get the best out of the environment around you rather than just being stuck in the old boring rat maze of going to the office going to the gym seeing your three friends and rinsing and repeating that indefinitely.
