Will it be more difficult in life without a high school diploma? Okay, let's be careful with this, right? I don't want to be responsible. I know I am responsible, but I don't want to be the guy that's like, no one needs to go to college. It's a complete waste of time and money. You know, all the Zuckerberg and fucking all those people who were university dropouts. Remember they were Harvard dropouts though, right? They weren't just like dropouts at community college. They were smart motherfuckers who got into the best universities in the world. And then during that, they were like, Oh, actually I've created a billion dollar business. Fuck this shit. And there's a lot of like guys like Gary Vee and lots of people like, I never went, well, I went to college for a little while, but I'm not a college graduate. And I have a bit of survivor bias where it's like, I didn't need that. I was successful. And a lot of friends I know who went to university ended up with big debts and they never used their degrees. And that can, I can see, well, that's a waste of time. It may well be a waste of time or it may not, right? So if you're in, if you want to pursue certain fields, technical fields, finance, law, medicine, you know, these are, these are things where there are real jobs waiting out there for you. And that's something that you really want to do. Then sure, go to university. Although as an, for Americans out there, I would recommend looking into doing your university overseas because America compared to every other place on the planet, in the developed world and in the non-developed world as well, has an obscenely expensive college, which if you've got a hundred grand plus debt at the end of it, it's going to take you most of your early working life to even pay that shit off. And there are options. You can, it's way cheaper to go to Czech Republic or Germany or places where there are excellent universities and just pay the fees than it is to get your student loan debt and end up with six figure plus debts at the end of it. So that's where I'd be like, well, you know, is it worth it to just go and go into college when you're not really sure why you're doing it? You're doing a liberal arts degree or you're doing something where you're like, oh, I don't know, I just guess I'll do this and go to college. And I burn up four years of my life, I accrue a huge debt and it wasn't, it didn't translate into work and I don't want to use it later. Then yes, I think it is a, it is a waste of time. So yeah, it's like, okay, you want to be an engineer, go to university. And there's jobs for that. There are, there are, there is a lot of things where back in, even in my day and in my parents and obviously before, where getting a college degree was cheap, it was, you may as well have, I mean, and it meant that even if you had a basic arts degree, that was worth something. Whereas now often you need a master's or more, you know, to be accepted in that part of the workforce. So like it was worth it to do and it was, and if it was worth it just to be, to do something that was interesting. And you, you were kind of fascinated by it even if, and you learn a bunch of skills. You learnt writing, researching skills. There was obviously a big social aspect to it. There was networking opportunities and it gave you a place to move out from your parents and go and start to become an adult. Okay. So I'm not, I'm not saying that college is a bad idea for everybody, but I would say if it's, if there's definitely a lot to be said for at least taking a year off, I would say finish high school. Like, why not? It's because the, yeah, okay. It's not, it's not a good look. Maybe if you're applying for jobs and you don't have a high school diploma, unless you've, unless you're one of those young guns who figured out a way to make money by yourself early on and then you don't need it. Cool. But for a lot of people, we're going to need to be involved in the machine at some point or another. And so having that kind of thing is probably worth it. Just finish high school. So yeah, I don't, I don't want you to think that I'm telling you that the answer is don't go to college. It's okay. Let's do it. If it makes, makes actual sense for you over the longterm. But first I would recommend taking a year off. Gap years are awesome. That's what I did and never came back. But it's not that you'll be told by your careers advisor or whatever, oh, you'll be a year behind. What? A year behind what? No, if you take a year off and you go travel and you LDA and seductive economy your way through the planet, you will get way, you will come back as a way more advanced human being than the kids that just went from high school to college. So it's, I'd say it's better to give yourself some time to go and work and travel and, and figure out what you do and don't want to do with at least the big, the early part of your adult life. And then it may make sense. You're like, actually, yeah, no, I know. I really am into marine biology. That's something I want to follow. And okay, there is, there is potentially work for that afterwards. And I can imagine myself getting into that kind of career and that's worth the four, four year investment and whatever, then cool. Go for it. Okay. So there's my caveats. Please, please don't just quit uni just because James said, quit uni and everything's awesome. Good day, gentlemen.
