One of the things that ultimately you're really looking for, and this comes down to like, when is it time to settle down? It's time to settle down when you're mature enough to settle down. It's time to settle down when you're conscious enough to actually be able to relate on a high level with somebody and you've met somebody who is also mature enough to settle down and is conscious enough to be able to relate. Then you have two mature people relating in a conscious way to create a dynamic, positive, really good relationship and there's lots of good rules for relationships. For example, some simple stuff that I can just say off the top of my head is, if you're going to be with somebody, take care of them. Treat them like royalty. Make sure that they are a special person. Don't treat them like shit. A lot of people get into this thing of once they're in a relationship with somebody, they get less and less appreciative of them. They take them more and more for granted. They pay less and less attention to them. They don't adore them. They don't appreciate them. They don't honor them and it can be sad when people are in an intimate relationship for a period of time and then they're treating strangers better than they're treating their partner. That's not fair. Don't fall into that kind of trap. Obviously, if you're in a position where you've got a partner and you find that you're treating them with less respect and less honor and less appreciation than you would a stranger or somebody that you hardly know, like a new friend, then there's something that either needs to be negotiated or it's a sure sign that you're in the wrong relationship. You're with the wrong person and you need to negotiate something else or get out of that relationship to find something that's going to be healthy for you because in my opinion it's better to be single and to be happy than it is to be in a relationship with somebody that is not really making you happy and ultimately you're not making them happy as a result either. So these are really important things is being aware of like being with somebody who can love you, who can meet you in this space of these rules, this game and somebody that you can make sure that you're solidly relating to each other in a conscious kind of way and that, like I said, is an ongoing conversation. That means that when things come up, which they do on a regular basis, you're able to be honest about them in the right way and sometimes things come up and it's not the right time or place to deal with it. Sometimes emotions come up and you have to think, I'm feeling some emotions right now. I could talk about it and make a drama out of it or maybe I should sit with my emotions for a little while and understand whether this is actually a real problem or just something that's a result of a state that I'm in right now or it's a reaction to something that I'm dealing with right now. It actually doesn't have very much to do with her or to do with the relationship. Sometimes that happens. So sometimes it can be really good when you're in a relationship to step back and to think for a moment like is this a good time to voice this or not. Other times it's important to step in and make sure that you are voicing what's appropriate at the time because there's something important that needs to be understood, it needs to be negotiated and the sooner the better rather than later because some of these things if they fester under the surface can create difficulties. Now the art of being able to do that is intuitive really and it's also intuitive because it's a result of having a lot of reference experiences of relating and relationships and seeing positive models and effective models of people relating. Now it's important if you want to be in a good relationship that you find somebody who's able to meet you in that. So for example be with a partner that if you feel strong emotions and you can say to them I'm feeling some emotions right now I don't know what to make of it and I'm just going to sit with it for a while. I don't want to talk about it for a few hours or a few days until I really get what's going on and it's important to have a partner who's able to say okay that's cool I understand that or if it's not cool with them to say it to say that they're like no I really need to talk about this that you can negotiate that or vice versa it's cool to be with a partner and you say I have these things I really need to talk about right now because this is really important for me and even if she says I'm not really cool with that I need some time then you negotiate that so you want to be able to meet each other in your negotiation in your consciousness in your ability to keep this relationship alive. So that's being able to meet somebody who can really love you and that's also being able to really love and finding that balance between the ideal of love which is like I said the ideal of love is I want you to be the best that you can be and if you being the best that you can be means that you have to take me out of your life or that I have to allow you to do things that are not okay with me because of my expectations then I have to deal with that but that goes both ways that's the important thing here is that like you have to make a choice if like if the best thing for your partner is to allow her to go and sleep with another guy because that's truly what she needs to do and that's who she really is then maybe you'll have to deal with that and vice versa this is where the power comes in for you guys out here as well because if the best thing for you for your truth for your true higher self your true love of who you are and where you're going is to be free and to date other women or to be in open relationships then you need to do that and ideally if you're with a woman who loves and loves and respects you then she will give you the freedom to do that and meet you on that level. Now if somebody is unable to hold the space it's such a hippie thing to say but unable to allow you to be the person that you need to be to experience your higher potential and to you know be all the things that you want to be then they're probably not the kind of person who's going to make good relationship material in the long term. Now there is a paradox here as well because the funny thing that can happen is if you're with somebody for example and there is this knowledge there is an understanding that you just want each other to be happy and if that means being with somebody else then that's okay and the irony oftentimes is that when somebody gives you complete freedom to say if you really need to be with other people go and be with other other people so the irony is that when you're with somebody who really acknowledges what you need and loves you and wants you to have all those things then the tendency is that you don't want to stray away from that person you actually respect them more you want to fulfill their needs more so you can find this kind of amazing balance of like the more that you give somebody freedom or the more that you're given freedom to be all that you are sometimes that makes you want to serve the rules the romantic rules of devotion that then allow for the best possible conditions for that person to keep loving you in that way. I'll just tell you a little story really quickly which i think is is a powerful story it illustrates some key points there's a teacher she's worth checking out her name is Byron Katie and Byron Katie does a lot of things but she teaches people how to break out of certain emotional patterns and she's worth checking out but she told a story which was quite key for my understanding of love and she was going through a stage of depersonalization I guess she was breaking out into a very expanded state of awareness where she was seeing her humanity and her new individuality and her truth in a completely different light now she was in a marriage at that time and that's quite weird because her personality was changing her habits were changing the way that she was connecting with her partner was very very different and basically her husband came to her and said do you still love me and she asked a key question which is a very powerful question this is a good one for you guys to keep in mind she asked what is this thing called love that you're asking me about like what what is it that you think that love is that I need to understand so that I can answer that question and he basically said something along the lines of well do you feel these feelings of special significance for me do you feel these like warm fuzzy feelings and fantasies and desires and do you want to adore me and do you want to appreciate me and do you do you see me as somebody really special in my life in her life sorry she thought about it for a moment and she said something that was very powerful she said well I feel those feelings when you create the conditions for me to be able to feel those feelings more easily so when you take me out when you appreciate me when you talk to me when you uh do nice things for me when you take care of me I feel those feelings more regularly it's easier for me to go into those feelings of love so what she was saying to her husband at that time is like if you treat me with respect and you you understand the patterns that I need inside myself so that I can be safe and comfortable in my ability to see you as that kind of person that deserves that kind of connection that kind of emotional attachment then I will do that and what she also said is like when you don't do those things when you don't act like a mature you know husband or you don't take care of me or you bring too much like negativity or judgment or frustration or whatever it is into the relationship that's not healthy for the relationship then I don't feel those feelings for you now it makes sense right it's pretty simple what does that demonstrate it demonstrates that there's rules of devotion there's rules of romantic love that work now the second part to what she said which is also extremely powerful was she said and in some sense I don't love you because I am love we are love this is love life is love so that's a pretty you know trippy spiritual thing to say but she was she's talking about how her perspective of love had shifted from this small contained box of rules that most people think a relationship is that's based basically on possession the rule and the typical role and rules of relationships that people have is like you act the way that I want you to act so I'll feel the feelings that I need to feel and then I'll act the way that you want me to act so that you can feel the feelings and then we'll basically write a contract over those feelings so you become the drug dealer of my feelings and I'll become the drug dealer of your feelings so we become responsible for each other's feelings and then you start to become dependent on each other and then you start to want to possess the other person that's where it really goes wrong as people start to possess each other you start to control each other and most of this stuff happens unconsciously I mean you think about what happens in a lot of relationships and this is important is you guys well people can fall into a relationship and before they know it they're just stumbling into this relationship of convenience they're not really aware of what they're doing and before they know it because the relationship feels good in that moment they feel like wow significant and connection and good feelings and pleasure and sex and especially if you haven't had a relationship in a long time that might be something that seems really addictive and it's comfortable and it feels really nice so what do you do say for example you stop going to the gym so much because it's not as important anymore you stop hanging out with your friends so much because it's not as important anymore you stop working on the projects you want to work on because it's not as important anymore you stop adventuring and being open-minded and learning cool things you're interested because it's not as important anymore and you start putting this this focus of this relationship is the primary thing in the center of your life and then over time it becomes like a feedback loop of addiction it really does and and you sacrifice all these other parts of your life and then what happens is you you start to feel like you have to work harder and harder to get those same feelings out of that relationship and if you're with a partner that's doing the same thing and you've basically like shut yourselves off and alienated yourselves from the life that you did have so that you could be with somebody then you fall into this sad sorry situation of then feeling resentful to your partner because you feel as if they've taken you away from your life but really you're the one who took yourself away from your life so this can be this resentment that that develops and then you start projecting that resentment onto each other and then that's when you get this nasty mess of codependence and uh what we call abandonment and enmeshment so that means like now i've got you i need you and if you leave me then i'm fucked and then if that goes both ways it's a very very nasty situation now why do i bring that up that's a bit of an aside but it's not really because that leads back to the thing i was talking about before with Byron Katie saying that she doesn't love her husband she is love because what she's understood is that yes she's when she spends and devotes time with her husband and he spends and spends and devotes time with her then they create this bubble of romance and they create this bubble of good feelings together but at the same time when she remembers which she's basically permanently established herself in an identity and in a state of realizing that everything is basically love she can never be fully attached to the ideal of that romantic fantasy and that's a healthy thing because it allows her to move into the romantic fantasy and experience it whilst always having a part of her that's like outside not falling into the trap of what that that romantic fantasy could be if she got too lost in it if she got possessed by it if you will if she if she um became completely lost in that as if that was all that there was good day gentlemen james marshall here on the noisy sweltering streets of
