Starting with getting over the fear of approaching strangers, then going and saying hi, getting into some kind of conversation, trying to make that conversation fun and flirtatious, asking for numbers, getting the girl on the date, and then what happens after that, well, we'll see. And it's understandable because there's a logic to that. A lot of people view their learning in terms of what is the next thing in front of me, okay? I don't know A, so I'm going to have to start by learning A, which is fair enough. But in my experience teaching thousands of men the art of seduction, it is the men who give it a go at trying to open and give it a go at trying to close and are working towards the end result that actually get the fastest and most effective results. The guys that are kind of meticulously working incrementally, step-by-step on just their opener and then just the next line and then just the basics of conversation, all right, so they're taking this in a step-by-step manner, means that you might get really good at saying the first 10 seconds of words, but that's less than 1% of a seduction, right? Yeah, we have to go and start talking to the girl, but there's a lot more to it. And it is ultimately your abilities in the bedroom that will define your confidence with women, right? Because if you're excellent at approaching and excellent at taking girls on dates and having a fun, flirty banter, but you suck in the bedroom, it's kind of hard to deliver on your promise. And it's hard for you to be able to actually be grounded, confident to know that you've got this to be able to project the right type of intent into a woman's eyes that makes her sizzle if you don't got the goods. So if you'd like to develop this end game confidence, stick around because today I'm going to reveal to you five characteristics and habits of men who are gods in the bedroom. But before I get into that, a very important announcement for those guys who've been waiting patiently for the launch of the Master Lover Method. It is live right now. So if you want to skip this video and jump straight into the course, then click the link in the description. It'll take you to a page which explains everything about how the course runs, the 35 huge modules, hundreds of different techniques, plus seven massive bonuses that are available for a limited time only. So check that out in the link below and now let's get into it. What do master lovers do in the bedroom? Number one, they understand the first three strokes. So many men skip over foreplay altogether or just give a kind of cursory attempt at it. So few men know how to turn a woman on psychologically and physically before they penetrate her. And even worse, when they first put it in, often they just kind of shove it in. It's really important to understand that fucking hard is great. Lots of women like to be banged hard, but not on the first three strokes. Give her a little time. It's really important to do what I call docking, which is where you nuzzle aside the pussy lips, gently put the head of your cock in and allow the vagina to actually draw you or suck you in and then to reshape around you. So that first stroke especially should be kind of excruciatingly slow. It should take up to a minute for that first penetration because this allows time for the woman's body to reshape, to get used to you, to lubricate, for her to get actually properly turned on. The second stroke and the third stroke will be, you know, have a little bit of momentum and maybe we need more to slow strokes to easier into it, or maybe she's now ready and warmed up and now you can bang her hard. Number two, the master lover understands how to implement variety in the bedroom. Now, even if what you're doing with your partner, long-term partner, for example, is good, right? You know her body and you know how to get her off. If you do the same thing more or less every single time, the same sequence of events in the same location, it becomes extremely predictable and therefore over time it becomes boring, right? Like even if someone cooks you the most amazing steak every single day, pretty soon you'll be sick of steak. You want at least some kind of spices or garnishes or to alternate it with something else. So the master lover understands how to move a woman through different peaks and troughs of different types of intensity, right? So he will be able to be tender and subtle with his touch to have, you know, like intimate lovemaking and he'll also be able to shift into more intensity, into more dominance, into more aggression as and when needed. Creating this different bandwidth of sensation and also psychological impact is going to be the thing that keeps a woman excited, anticipating new things, and he's going to create a powerful polarity between the pair. If you're always just doing slow lovemaking, two pumps slowly per second with the waves crashing in the background and the soft light filter behind you, although this can be and is a beautiful thing to experience with a partner, it is more on the frequency side of sex as opposed to the frictional polarity side of sex. It has its own delicious flavor, but it's only one type of flavor. You need to be able to take a woman into more intense spaces to be able to spank her, choke her, lead her with dominance, to be able to create more of a polarity between the masculine and the feminine in order to be able to please all sorts of different types of partners who have, you know, different sexual needs. And especially when you're with a longer term partner to keep things hot in the bedroom. Number three, the master lover knows how to take the lead. Now we can think of sex as analogous to dance. In most partner dancing, we have a leader and a follower. Usually the man is leading and the woman is following. Now, if you have a situation where both parties are trying to lead, then it means you're going to end up stepping on each other's feet and jerking each other around and getting in the way of any kind of flow or partner communication that's going on. If neither side is leading, then nothing much happens. So we can see this in the bedroom. The man that is not confident and clear about what he wants, who's not able to give the woman direction, who's not able to take command and take the lead of her. This puts her in the situation where either she has to like wait around and nothing much happens, or she's forced into the position of being proactive and taking the lead, which is usually not the situation that she wants to be in. I'm not saying that this always has to be rigid. It's awesome if a woman initiates sex or initiates a sex act or takes the lead in some aspect of the sexual play. But for the most part, most women are going to want the man to be the active dance partner, right? To be the one that's telling her what he wants to do, getting her into different positions, telling her what he wants to give and what he wants to take. And it's important that that is cleanly communicated. For example, if you want a girl to get on top of you into cowgirl position, then the right thing to do as the clear communicating dominant is to say, come and sit on my cock. It's not to ask a question. Hey babe, do you want to like maybe get on top? Right? Because that's not sexy. She wants you to know what you want. And right now I want you to sit on me or right now I want you to turn around. I don't say, uh, would you maybe, you know, maybe a little bit of the old doggy, right? Cause it's not sexy. It doesn't communicate that I'm a man who's in command and that I'm a powerfully sexually competent male. Whereas learning to make requests, give commands. Of course, if she doesn't want to follow the command, she can say no, or she can say her, her safe word. That's totally fine. But we need to take a jump out into the unknown to be able to make our needs heard and in order to be able to get our needs met and vice versa. So vitally important that you are the primary leading dance partner. Number four is the ability to have clean, clear communication with your partner and also to hold a space of nonjudgment for her. We can't expect to know everything about our partner's body and desires just through intuition, right? There's a lot that we can figure out by watching her nonverbal responses, right? Watching her blush, hearing the noises she's making, seeing how she adjusts and tilts her hips backwards or forwards to get deeper or more shallow penetration and so on. So there are lots of, uh, nonverbal cues that you do want to be aware of. And you do want to, to develop the ability to be present time aware, to be actually really in your body, not up in your head thinking about baseball scores or what you're going to do next so that you can read the present time needs of the moment. However, we can't only rely on that. We need to be able to open verbal channels of communication with our partner either before, during or after sex so that we can figure out what we could improve and what are some things the woman may wish to try. And so we can get a real sense of what's going on for her in her internal fantasy world and to understand her particular anatomy. An example of this is how you would go about mastering a new woman's vagina. Now, if I'm just trying to use my intuition and I'm fingering her, for example, or rubbing her clit and I'm just guessing or doing what I did with my last girlfriend, because I think that's what you should do with every woman, then I might get it right. But very likely I'll get it wrong. I'll be in slightly the wrong position or I'll be doing it a bit too hard or a bit too soft or a bit too fast. This is where clean communication comes in. So in that situation, usually what I do is I'll place my hand on her pussy. I'll start to do broad strokes and then I'll start to zero in on the clit and then I'll say, well, what I won't say is, is this good? Because if you just ask a woman, is this good? Most of the time, she's probably going to say yes because she's perhaps worried about your ego. And in the past, if she's tried to correct a man, he's been too proud about it. So it's kind of easy to just say yes and then fake it, uh, rather than trying to give instructions to a man when she's not clear that he's going to take them. But what I would do in this situation is give her only options for me to improve. All right, so what does that look like? Means I'm rubbing and I say something like this, is this the right spot or do you, do I need to move it somewhere? Right? Or is this speed good or do you want it faster or slower? Right? So she has options there. I mean, if I am doing it right, you can say, shut up. That's great. Keep doing what you're doing. But because I've given her the options to improve it with this clean, clear communication, and it's obvious that I want to learn about her in order to give her more pleasure. I'm not doing this for my ego. Then she's going to give me actually accurate feedback. So then she can say, Oh, that's almost a little bit to the left. And I go, it's a bit to the left and I go, okay. And is the speed good or fast or slower? And she says, no, that speed's really good. Cool. Now within, you know, under a minute, basically I've learned more or less how to touch this particular woman's vagina in a way that's pleasurable for her specifically. And it's something that, you know, within that one or two minutes of clear communication, I may end up knowing more about her than her previous boyfriends who didn't take the time or didn't know how to communicate it properly. And connected to this is a sense of nonjudgment. If you want to get the best out of your lovers, you want to see them go totally wild and get crazy, kinky porn star sex out of your girls, then they need to know that you don't judge them or women in general about what they choose to do sexually. If you give any indication that you think what she wants is weird or taboo or makes her a freak of some sort, she will shut down. And if that's the way you operate, unfortunately, you'll only ever get to see a small segment of female sexuality. They tend to save the crazy wild stuff for the guys that they know are going to be totally cool with it. They think that it's awesome that she expresses her sexuality, that they're not judging her for it. A wise woman once said to me, you can't fuck every woman the same way, which brings us to point number five, which is that the master lover understands how to adapt and change what he's doing to the specific needs of each individual woman. Now there's not so much variety when it comes to male anatomy and what you would do with a male cock. If you as a woman know how to give a blow job, you can probably give a good blow job to most men on the planet. But when it comes to women, there is a massive range of variation in their responses to touch. Some women, you know, you barely kind of blow on the clitoris and it's almost too sensitive. And if you were to touch her on the glands, you know, underneath the hood, it would be way too sensitive. For her, it would be better to be touching over the hood or up near the root of the clitoris. And she might be needing a really delicate, sensitive pressure. For another woman, you might need to kind of lean your body weight and like scrub really hard because she likes really intense pressure. For either of those women, if you're well off, it's not going to be pleasant at all. If I'm doing the really hard rubbing on the girl who's super sensitive, then I'm going to wear her out and she's not going to want me to touch her again. And if I'm there with my little fairy touch on the girl who wants you to get in there and give it, give it some elbow grease, then she's going to be bored and going, it's like getting one of those massages where the person's just kind of just, just touching you, like just stick your elbow in, come on. And also understand that the very same woman can change depending on her mood, depending on her menstrual, where she is in her menstrual cycle, depending on how turned on she is and whether she's had an orgasm or not yet. So we need to be able to understand that you can't go into any kind of sexual liaison thinking, I know what I'm doing and I'm going to do all my stuff, right? I've got my six, eight, 10 cool sex trips, sex tricks in my mind and I'm going to blow this woman away by running a train on her with them. Okay, they may be good techniques, but they may not be good for her or we may need to adapt them or change the order of them. We may need to have a discussion about some of these things first to negotiate and get consent because it might be something that she's never tried before and she's not sure if she wants to try it, right? So there are so many aspects to sex that need you to be able to adapt to the needs of the woman and to be able to grade and adjust and shift that throughout a play session, right? We may start off really super sensitive and soft with our first three strokes at least and sooner or later we may ramp up and she may really want you to get wild and rambunctious and be slapping her around. But if I do the harsh slapping around straight away, she's not warmed up. She's not in the right space. I haven't adapted to the needs of the moment and so it puts her in a head or she resists or it feels like it's painful and she wants to stop the play. Whereas if I am there with her present time reading her responses both intuitively and also checking in with her verbally or proposing things verbally as and when needed, seeing where her limits are, adjusting them, maybe ramping them up in tandem with her desire as opposed to my egotistical need to like, I don't know, do more cool stuff, then we're going to be getting in sync with that partner. Then you're going to be able to move. partner to partner and within a night most likely or within a short amount of time be able to re-figure out what does this woman respond to how is her unique body being affected by what it is that I'm doing what do I need to adjust in order to make this perfect for her this isn't the massive difference between the guy that is the cool sex trips tricks guy you know who's done some research on the internet or learned how to do this with a squirting or learn a bit of tie rope-tying or something and the actual masterful lover right the master is a master of improvisation of adaption of communication of consent right of non-judgment of holding a container and a space for the woman to go wild and express her rawest desire within as opposed to the guy that's like okay line get ready for my four cool sex moves they better be really cool to make up for the lack of adaption and ability to adjust to the needs of the woman much better to figure out how to have this subtle level of communication so there's five quick tips to improve your bedroom skills but if you want the really good stuff I mean the black books vault secret sex ninja stuff then as I mentioned at the beginning the master lover method is open for enrollments right now enrollments are open only for seven days after that I will be shutting the cart so that I can move on to teaching the guys in the course for full details click the link in the description it'll take you to a page which explains everything but right now let me explain to you in brief how the course works the muscle of a method is a five-week interactive course which teaches you a layered approach to improving your skills in the bedroom so starting with the fundamentals of understanding basics like undressing kissing manhandling coordinating breathing different positions and their variations basics of tantra and stroke control building up your own personal stamina and endurance in the bedroom and moving on from that I create layers of progressively more complex and spicy and crazy and wild techniques so throughout the progression of the five weeks you'll move from whatever level of sexual skill and understanding that you currently have into the echelons of the top 1% of lovers on the planet now that may sound like a hyperbolic claim but the reality is that most men suck in bed it doesn't take so much to move over from average to lousy lay to being absolutely incredible of course there are many levels and layers to that as well and we can keep progressing until we become a literal sex god the course is broken into 35 primary modules and within each of those modules there are dozens of individual techniques as well as all of the applicable theory I cover literally everything in this course and every single technique is demonstrated in excruciatingly high-definition explicit detail so I brought in five liberated open-minded sexy ladies to help me on this course and so every single technique that I explain I demonstrate in detail on the models multiple angles in multiple ways so that you can easily replicate them and bring them into your personal play off the top of my head and there's no way I can remember every single module and technique in the course because there are literally hundreds of them but the course covers the following and lots more eight different types of Spanx and how to apply them precisely fingering g-spot massage how to use all sorts of sex toys restraints and bondage using the silk tie which you actually receive a free one when you sign up for the course solo tantra exercises to improve your stamina and to make sure that you're rock-hard getting it up and keeping it up for as long as you want also translating these tantric skills into the bedroom with your partner and being able to take a woman who's never seen this kind of thing before and lead her through tantric sex after I've covered the fundamentals of excellent normal sex we move into some of the more taboo and kinky areas the reality is that the vast majority of women want to experiment with wild and crazy and kinky things in the bedroom most women identify as some type of submissive and they want a man who is dominant and knows how to take the lead so in the BDSM sections of the master lover method I introduce you to all the fundamental techniques you're going to need in order to be able to dominate her properly this includes restraining her with and without tools using cuffs using collars using the silk tie manhandling and being able to throw her around in a rough way which is not painful and is also caring for even when you're doing extreme things moving into more advanced techniques like choking safely spanking training your woman to give deep throat blowjobs how to go down on her how to introduce anal sex in a way that is completely painless mess-free and that every woman's going to love I also break down the mysteries of dirty talk and fantasy roleplay so that you can easily step-by-step integrate this with your partner without any cringe or awkwardness so that you're able to create erotic moments and bring both of your fantasies to life and so much so much more everything from hair pulling to understanding female sexual psychology taboos and desires consent handling your own sexual anxieties and fears and having effective strategies to be able to move through them so you have confidence in the bedroom and the bridge between seduction and sex how to make sure that your dates escalate smoothly to sex excellent sex of that so these modules are broken up week by week in easy to understand video tutorials plus you will have access to a private telegram group where you'll get access to me where you can ask any questions get clarification on any of the techniques troubleshoot any problems or issues that you have had and also to network with a group of like-minded guys who want to improve this area of their life all these topics and many more are covered in detail week by week in progressively layered tutorials lectures and demonstrations the course contains over 60 hours of unreleased never-before-seen material which breaks down all the components that you need to be absolutely incredible in bed into easy-to-digest weekly pieces but the master lover method includes much more than this to celebrate the launch I've also added seven massive bonus modules to make sure that this is the most comprehensive and detailed course of its type on the planet the bonuses include five long-form live webinars with my personal sexual mentors the bonus modules include five live webinars with my personal sex mentors where you'll get access to world-class specialists in areas of female sexual psychology tantra male potency and BDSM these people usually charge many thousands of dollars for their services but this is thrown in as part of the master lower method bonus to is six long intimate interviews with women so I sat down with six very different types of women and asked them extremely intimate and explicit questions about their sexual preferences what they like and what they don't like and these girls tell it all honestly without filter this has been a massive part of my growth in my sexual ability is is being able to sit down and talk with women about what they do and don't like in a non-judgmental way and in these interviews you'll no doubt learn a whole lot of new things that perhaps you didn't know because mostly women don't feel comfortable to explain this but in these six interviews we get deep into the darkest desires of womankind bonus three is ten live zoom classes with me where I will take you through my personal qigong stretching and pre-sex warm-up exercises so this shows you how to isolate your hips how to get more fluidity in your spine for your stroke control how to regulate your breath and your arousal state so that you can last as long as you wish and how to become an expert at your stroke and hip game so you can hit all the right spots inside the woman so these are fun 30-minute classes you can log in wherever you are I'll be there taking you through the course and if you can't make the live classes they are all recorded and they'll be up on the site so you can access those at any time as well bonus four is a guest module put together by my close friend and colleagues dr. Seda Desilets. Seda is a professional sexual psychologist and she's worked with men and women for many decades to help them to have mind-blowing spiritual sex in this module you'll learn the fine art of pussy mapping so that's how to really get to know your partner and to understand where all the different spots are and how to stimulate and massage her vagina in different ways to give her a profound range of orgasms bonus five is a sex toy masterclass where I demonstrate an explicit detail pretty much all the types of sex toys that are out there and showing you which ones are the most effective which ones are more niche and most importantly exactly how to use them so in this in this module I literally take each of the sex toys discuss its pros and cons demonstrate it on a real-life woman whilst getting feedback from her so you can see exactly how these toys work in play bonus six which is my favorite details and explains to you how to use the James Marshall system of silk tie bondage now this was developed by me as an alternative to using ropes the reality being that learning to tie a woman up with ropes is complicated it's difficult it takes quite a while to get the hang of it and plus it's not always that practical because it's not easy to get on or off or to have sex while the woman's tied up so I solved this problem by developing this the looped silk tie now you may be thinking well what's the point of the module if I don't have one of these and you can't buy these anywhere on the planet because I invented them well you're in luck I asked my groundskeepers wife who's a very nice seamstress to produce a hundred and fifty of the silk loop ties and so for the first hundred and fifty guys that sign up you'll be mailed out your very own handmade silk tie so you can practice this incredibly beautiful and seductive art form and finally bonus seven is a pretty spicy one what we've done is we've filmed four explicit sex scenes with myself and a sexy partner and then I have broken this down with commentary to explain to you exactly what I'm doing in real time now don't worry we filmed it in in a tasteful way so you never have to see my junk but you'll certainly get to see explicitly everything that's going on and you'll get to see in a real partnership how I'm applying all of the techniques that you've learned in the course but that's not all for the next 72 hours I'm also including an extra three free bonuses this is to reward the guys who are super proactive and want to get into the course straight away the first action taker bonus is a live webinar with myself and Alex Leon TNL's head coach and specialist in online game and photography and videography of a particular type so in this webinar Alex will be sitting down explaining how he uses photography as part of his seduction tools and also if this is something you're interested in how to get a woman to pose for you for naked photos or videos to make her feel super sexy and erotic so that she wants to expose herself and create raunchy content together so this is going to be a very fun action-packed and practical webinar with myself and Alex extra bonus two is a behind-the-scenes documentary of the live sexuality class that this course was based on so for the last four years myself Shea Matthews and Sir Dominic have been running the sex god master class around the world where you take in small groups of guys with a bunch of hot girls and they got to practice pretty much everything that it is that you see in this course so this gives you another angle inside TNL understanding what it's like to be in a live course and you'll see different variations and nuances that come up with the different girls and reacting to the clients this is a fun uncensored look inside the world's most exclusive and expensive sex school action take a bonus three or bonus ten in the complete list of bonuses is from date to sex so this module breaks down how to transition from your date into the bedroom so I give you lots of demonstrations of what not to do of how to mess up and screw up a date then I give demonstrations and commentary on how to have let's say a normal date right where you have you're not jumping into bed immediately but there is a seduction involved so the processes of escalation from bring her in the door until getting her into the bedroom we also look at the rapid escalation model as well where there are certain circumstances where you don't need to sit on the couch and talk with a glass of wine for an hour it's on so you need to be able to pull the trigger and make things happen immediately so in this extra bonus you'll see me demonstrating with live models how to do things correctly incorrectly and also how to rapidly escalate when that's appropriate so there you have it that's the master lover method in a nutshell 35 modules 60 plus hours plus another 40 hours of bonuses plus an extra three bonuses if you move quick in the next three days this is a course that I have been working on behind the scenes for over a year I'm very proud of it it literally covers everything that I know and my other professional colleagues and sex educators know about the bedroom arts everything through from the theoretical from the psychological through to the exact and practical applications of all these methods there is literally nothing like this on the planet available it is the only place where a man can come and learn step by step from any stage that he's currently at how to become a masterful top 1% lover so that he becomes truly unforgettable to all the women that he meets so that he has end game confidence knowing that he can deliver the goods when he's meeting a new woman and creating a reality where women always want to return to you as I said at the beginning if you're spending all of your time just focusing in on approaching conversation trying to ask girls out on dates you're going to be moving very slowly this step-by-step chronological approach often it doesn't work because men tend to give up before they get to the end you need to be working on the approaching sure but you also need to be working on what happens when it works right you don't want to be in a situation where you self-sabotage because you don't feel confident enough to actually close the deal or to do it properly becoming a master lover has been for me one of the most profound things in my life I know that when I get in bed with a girl it's gonna rock her world and I know that she's gonna come back because why wouldn't she there are so few men on the planet who really know how to please not just one woman maybe their girlfriend that they spent a long time with but different types of women in a short period of time guys that are able to quickly communicate quickly understand and quickly integrate different fantasies and desires that the woman has and then can draw from this massive toolkit of possible sequences and techniques that he can choose from to create endless combinations of delicious erotic delights so remember that the master lover method is only available for the next seven days from today through to the 12th of March after that I'm shutting the doors and getting on to coaching the guys within the course so now's your chance to join the sexual elite and to become the man that women fantasize about"}
