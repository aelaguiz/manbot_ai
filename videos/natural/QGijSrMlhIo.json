The other person. Keep your eyes focused in just a second. Move your body around. And then, say for instance we're in danger. We're gonna get to the top of the hill because that's safety. Now, go! Cool. So, being able to turn on those motions. It's direct, it's charged, it's got focus. So, grab a quick drink of water, and then we'll head out. \u266a\u266a\u266a \u266a\u266a\u266a \u266a\u266a\u266a \u266a\u266a\u266a \u266a\u266a\u266a \u266a\u266a\u266a \u266a\u266a\u266a \u266a\u266a\u266a \u266a\u266a\u266a \u266a\u266a\u266a \u266a\u266a\u266a \u266a\u266a\u266a \u266a\u266a\u266a \u266a\u266a\u266a \u266a\u266a\u266a Alright, so now we've done everything but verbal expression. Now I want you to go one by one around the circle and just share something, express it. You don't have to be muddled by words, but now you choose to, you get to, and just share something. Alright, starting with you. I really loved how intuitive things became. The more we were in, I felt like it was so clear the sub-communication, what was going on. It was very easy to pick up. Like being a kid on the playground, just throwing stuff, eating stuff, following the leader, stuff like that. It was fun. For me it was just feeling the energy of the tribe, feeling everyone's individual energy and just, even though it was, overall it was cohesive, but it was amazing to just feel it. Yeah, it was just a sense of freedom, freedom. I expected to be less comfortable, more painful physically, but I found the dynamic with the group very interesting. Feels like this is how we were meant to live, like feel a pain somewhere, but no matter, just move on. Very cohesive, very playful, no worries at all. Yeah, just be in the moment and enjoy yourself. It's very liberating, very Lord of the Flies. Yeah, it was great to connect with that deeper part of us and to just be playful and feel a lot of these intuitive aspects. Very liberating from the mind. Yeah, the best way was the lack of words for me. That was amazing. That was the liberating part. You need to be aware of everything and you need to express yourself without filters. You need to, because otherwise you don't survive. Moving in the pack, I loved that. That was so cool. Never experienced anything like that. And for me, depending on where in the group I was, there was a different role and a mindset that came up. At one point I was at the rear and I was like, I have to guard the rear. I have to notice stuff so I can warn the pack in advance. And that felt amazing. If the pack had someone to look out for the pack, you were definitely doing it. Even when you're in the middle of the pack, you're looking at the front, looking at the back. And everyone finds their role, finds what they're good at, finds who they're meant to be. I found long periods of thoughtlessness, which I just only realised at the end. I'm like, I haven't been thinking in words for maybe most of the thing, which is usually I would have to do really intense, long meditation to get into that state. So it was really like, well, I'm just here experiencing, not analysing. Thank you for trusting me and trusting yourselves along this journey. And most of all, it was beautiful to see all of your expressions just come out. And you could see it was just true. It was just truth. It's so addictive and so attractive when you just express from truth. You can see it in your face. You can see it in every part of the body, the way that you move. So thank you. Thank you. So this was a returning back to intuition in our bodies, in our thought patterns, taking away all rules and literally just having complete heart, complete intuition. And most of all, just absolute expression. We went through a few exercises of getting back in touch with our bodies to be able to express inside out, getting in touch with our thought processes, and then went into the wild. So we gained the tools first, and then we went into the wild where all intuition. There was no speaking, even speaking. It's a rule that we've created to understand each other. Can we go deeper than that? And so for an hour and a half, there was no Western influence. It was all expression. Returning back to our primal movement of looking out for each other, of tribe, and communicating completely non-verbally. One of the things that James said, which is definitely the point of it, is to remove thought processes. We all have this continuous pattern in our head, constantly going round and round in circles, telling us to do this, telling us to do that. Our parents, this is right, that's wrong. Taking away right and wrong, and suddenly you just have this plane. Oh, you get to ask yourself the question, who am I? Why am I here? And the most of all important question, why is what's happening now happening for me? How is it happening for me? Most of you probably go to the gym, you exercise regularly. If you are following a regimented program that's fully linear, right? Most of you exercise in the gym are linear, but they're also mentally linear. They're like, if you do this, you will get this result. They take out intuition, they take out feeling, they take out that each of us is individually different and need to express ourselves in different ways. So unless you're going to explore different ways, you might exercise this way up. You might do handstand push-ups, you might do flat on the back. Like trying different ways to allow your body to move and to be able to express yourself in completely different ways. If you move your body in a different way, you're expressing yourself in a different way. What you'll gain here is opening your mind from a closed rules position to becoming curious, to becoming childlike, to having a life full of wonder and options, freedom. Why do you exercise? When you have a why, you're more likely to pay attention. I have like a mantra that I repeat over, which is like with all my heart. And so I'm doing my practice with all my heart and I'm constantly bringing my attention back to that. So it's more likely that all the activities that I do out in life are going to be done from that place. We've been using movement to create all these different patterns in our nervous system. So it actually gives us options to think in new ways. It increases neuroplasticity, not just for the body, but also for the way we think. Why do you exercise? Most of the whole fitness culture that we have in the Western world is like rules before heart. Rules really help us, but unless we're bringing our intuition and starting to tune into that, then we're losing touch with our bodies anyway. This is really going to create a practice for you that you can learn to dial into yourself and become intuitive. So you can start to read the direction that your life's going through even this practice. Last session of the day and it's going to be physical. Similar kind of intensity as we did yesterday. But I really want you guys to focus in on the water energy, on the sense of your meat dripping off bone. So we're really trying to keep pinpointing this active relaxation. The point of this is not to muscle through it, force through it, especially as we're going to start getting into partner sensitivity drills. The focus is not on overpowering. Some of you are way bigger and stronger than others. Some of you are more trained than others. It's not about beating each other or imposing your will. All of these things are going to be about blending and cooperating with your own bodies. So let's do a little bit of a warm-up. So the next thing we're going to do, it's not going to look like much, but it's quite interesting to do. So you're going to hold your hands out in this loose, standing like a tree, zhan zhong thing. And what we're going to do is I'm going to focus in on the muscles, the tricep and the bicep and the delt. And what I'm going to do is over five seconds, I'm going to go from zero to five seconds. So what I'm going to do is over five seconds, I'm going to go from zero, and then I'm going to start increasing pressure. Two, three, four, five, until I'm at complete tension. However, my hands are totally loose, which is going to be quite challenging. So I'm at full tension in my arms and totally loose in my hands. It's a weird thing, huh? All right, so let me explain how it's going to work. We're going to go zero to five over five seconds. So I'll count it, so you're going to have to fraction it so that a full tension happens over those five counts. Then I'll count back down, five, four, three, two, one, as you then cut off 20% of tension with each count. Then we're going to go one to four and back, one to three and back, one to two and back, and then one to five in one pulse. So it'll be on, off, on, off, off, one, two, three, four, five, five, four, three, two, one. Breathe in. Again, now one to four. And now pulsing from zero, one, zero, one, zero, one, zero, one, zero, five. Five, zero, five, and relax. Okay, so now we're going to move into another whipping arm pattern. Get the noise in there, some sneaky noise. Anyone ever done sticky hands or push hands before? There's lots of ways to do it, variations, but the way we'll do it here is we're going to touch it just off the wrist. So one hand's on the inside, one hand's on the outside. Now the first thing, eventually what we're going to be doing is we're going to be looking at ways to pull the person off and take their center of balance. The beginning is just literally contact, and we want to be settled down in the lower stance, very relaxed in the arms, and all we're doing is reading. So there'll be a little..."}
