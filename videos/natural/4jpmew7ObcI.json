Today, it's Monday the 25th I'm filming, so I'm going to put this video out tomorrow as soon as I can. And it's going to be a short one. So I know a lot of guys have been saying to me, dude, you're putting out like two hours of content every single day. I can barely keep up. It's like your full-time job is to watch me ranting to interesting people. So today's video will be brief. And just to let you know that I've been working insanely hard in the lead up to the launch, doing all sorts of interviews and filming great content, as you know, pumping them out on the channel. And things will slow down a little bit next week. So you will have some time to catch up and me as well as I move into coaching the course. So if you didn't know by now, the Lifestyle Design Academy is open and live, but it closes very, very soon. So if you want to join me on this life-changing adventure, now is your chance. Before I get into the final details on that, I've had, understandably, a lot of guys contact me and ask, what is in this program? Like it sounds cool. I like you. I like your philosophies. The course sounds interesting, but I'm still not exactly sure how it works. So today for any guy that is still on the fence or wants a bit more information about how the course works and what's on the inside of the Academy itself, I'm going to give you a sneak peek, a little inside touring to how this works. So let's check it out. So the Lifestyle Design Academy is a 12-month program, right? That's literally one year of mentorship with me. So it's not with my, I don't know, hidden other coaches or random interns. This course is led personally by me through the first eight weeks, which is the intense accelerator part of the course. This is where I cram in all of the theoretical information, get everyone up to speed and give you the blueprint for redesigning your life, right? So this takes about an eight-week period. After that, we have a further 10 months to then take these skills out into the real world. Let's hope we can actually go out into the real world. Or if not, we'll work around that with technology as we need to. But to be able to go out and implement this over a long period. Now I've taught lots of programs in the past, which were say seven-day or 10-day intensive live programs or like a five or six-week online program. And you can get a huge amount of results when you have a catalyst for change, you get inside an intense crucible, you learn a huge amount, and then you go out and implement it, which is awesome. However, as you would know, and all of us know, motivation is a thing. Accountability is a thing. It can be hard to stay motivated and stay on track over the long term when you don't have a mentor or someone there to keep your accountability. A good wingman, a powerful social group, or a particular mentor that's going to keep you on task. So that's what I wanted to do with this course. It's a rare opportunity where I have more time than usual, and I can commit to you guys for the next 12 months to make sure that I'm on all the calls, that I'm on the accountability groups, that I'm organizing and corralling everyone to start to work together as lifestyle crews. So this online program, yes, it's for you to do on your own initially, but it is a collaborative effort. The whole point of this is that we create a global brotherhood. The whole point of lifestyle design from my perspective is to create leverage. I'm not interested in doing every single thing myself. I don't want to do, you know, make the money, make the contacts, organize the parties, manage the staff, like all of that stuff by myself. It's too much work, and it's not the most effective way to do things. The most effective way to do things is to coalesce together with lifestyle design tribes, and that's what we're going to be making all over the world. So with that in mind, let's look at how the course itself works. When you sign up, you immediately get a private login to the membership site, and this is where we'll be working from. So there's a whole lot of support materials, which are already recorded. In fact, over 50 hours worth of support materials for you to go through gradually. Don't binge them all at once, but gradually week by week, as well as missions, and most importantly, the live lectures, which haven't happened yet because they happen live starting on Tuesday. So when you first log into the site, you'll be welcomed with this welcome video, which now I'm looking at this thumbnail, and I'm like, who chose that thumbnail? It looks like I'm some like evil dude who's explaining, now if you put a little pinch of arsenic in her gin and tonic, once an eve after three months, she will slip. Looks like that, but anyway, that's not what it's about. Not at all. This is where I welcome you and explain to you how the course itself works. Now, you see, if we move over here into the eight-week accelerated lectures, as I said, these lectures happen live, the first one happening tomorrow, Tuesday. And so what I'll be doing is I'll be taking each week a component of lifestyle design, which I have deconstructed from my own life and through those of all of the people around me I have seen who have consciously created incredible lives, and then extrapolating that through the thousands of men that I've taught over the years. So I've broken down over eight weeks, the eight key principles or areas that you need to understand to create powerful collaborations, to break out of your current limited social world, and to be able to target gatekeepers who have access to amazing social scenes, to understand the seductive economy, which is how we trade on non-financial currencies. So whether that's a smile, advice, access to women, cool events, a shoulder to cry on, someone who's a very active listener, someone who's fun to be around, you know, there's many, many different currencies that you can trade on. And we'll be looking at what do you have, what is your strengths, what areas are you weak in and that you need to bolster, and how can you, in a way, compensate for your weaknesses by pulling other people in who have strengths that you don't have. As I said, I don't do it all myself. I have big picture thinkers, small picture thinkers. I have extroverts and introverts. I have creatives and analytical thinkers in my social world, which means we can all plug the holes of each other's limitations and then bolster each other together as a group. So we'll be hitting these particular elements week by week. I decided not to pre-record these lectures because I like talking to people live. I really enjoy the interplay. And I want you guys to have the opportunity to ask me, this is a class, we're in a school, ask the teacher, challenge me, help me to adjust and tweak the course material to the specific needs of the group. And now I have a complete template for teaching, but I'm also very flexible with that. As I see over the months, once we've got the fundamentals down, the foundations down, if people want to work more into the how do we break into the modeling scene or how do we create freedom businesses or how do we move in nomadic digital lifestyles, like there's so many directions that I can take this. And every month after the initial eight weeks, I'll be bringing in new guests. You've seen some of the amazing guests that I've had recently on the podcasts. So some of those will be brought back by popular demand. And then I will also contact anybody that the guys in this crew want me to talk to that I have the clout to get to. Okay. Don't ask for Joe Rogan. I can't get him yet. Don't ask for Jordan Peterson. As much as I would love to have those guys on the show, we're not quite there yet, but I have access to an incredible array of specialists, professionals, lifestyle designers, freaks and mavericks who've had kick-ass lives and they've strategically done it and they can explain to you how to do it. So week by week, we'll be getting into all that fun stuff. If we now look at the extra material that's part of the package, we have the MMC at home. So the Masculine Mastermind Conference. This was our huge conference we run once a year. We're not running it this year, unfortunately, but the last three years where myself, the TNL team and the guests that we really rate came and gave exclusive, never-before-seen material, speeches, lectures to the 200 plus guys that attended. I've never released all of these speeches before. We've put out clips and the occasional one, but now you have the entire MMC at home. So I've chosen some of the most powerful key speeches by myself, by Shea, by Alex, by Hayley, by John Keegan, and those will be unlocked every single week. You'll be able to watch those and then there'll be also missions and, you know, different exercises to do in relation to those speeches. So there's, I don't know, 15 hours plus of amazing material there. Next up, what we have now, this is something I'm really excited about. This is called the Great Library of Notropolis. And what this is, is a collection of questions and answers. So people ask me questions on the many webinars that I've done over the years. I answered them somewhere between the 5 and 20 minute mark of answers. And then I just got kind of shoved in big videos somewhere. So what I got my crew to do was chop all of these up and now we have over 200 questions that people have asked me and my detailed answers all put here on this, you know, huge database. Everything from seduction, to lifestyle design, to sexuality, how do you pick up girls at the beach? You know, how do you access different social circles? How to tell the girl you're seeing that you're seeing other girls? So, so many different questions. And then I put them all into different categories. So if we want to go to my sex questions, we have a click here. Beginner tips for BDSM, anybody? Well, I have a whole video on that. Could you give us some wisdom around performance anxiety in the bedroom, right? Very common issue. So almost, I would say that if you've got a question, you know, whether it's lifestyle, sexuality, approaching relationships, dating, texting, it's quite likely I've answered it and we've cataloged it all here. So this is a massive resource for you to return to over the years. Currently 22 plus hours and I will keep adding to that as we go. Next up, we have a whole bunch of my iconic 21 convention speeches. So I spoke at the 21 convention quite a number of times back in the early days before they changed politically. And I bought the rights to those speeches. So now I have them licensed here without any advertising and without the worry that YouTube may take them down, which is definitely a possibility. So I put these, and these are the speeches that defined my career and were the first point of call for many hundreds of thousands of men who found my material. So these, the three pillars of seductive success back in 2011 changed my life, changed the life of so many men and really set the tone for what T and L would become. So I put all of these iconic speeches, the final pillar of seduction, what women want, multiple relationships, how to be a man, as well as some opening and closing keynote addresses for, from the Australian event. So yeah, over well over 10 hours there of incredible speeches. And many times people have contacted me and said that they have watched these speeches multiple times and that they have revealed new depths and new levels to them over time. So check that out. Next up in the course, what we have is movement and meditation module. So if you've been following me for any length of time, you would know that I've always been into meditation, into movement, martial arts, qigong, spirituality. And it is my opinion that without some level of introspection and self-awareness, then it's really almost impossible to consciously design your life, right? Because if you're so unaware of how your emotions, your body, your breathing, your reactive patterns, if you don't know how that works, then you're a slave to it. That's why my first principle is awareness. And in this, I've given you guys some of the foundations from my other martial meditation course to make sure that you are working on your awareness, being able to use simple meditation techniques to clear the mind, to settle the emotions, to relax the body, and to get more perspective. I've also added a couple of movement exercises, guided movement exercises, using the Swimming Dragon Qigong method, which I've studied for years and is a beautiful way to loosen the body, loosen the mind, align the mind, body, and emotions, create flexibility, save your joints in old age. It's amazing stuff. In terms of all the physical practices I've learned, martial arts, movement, yoga, dance, all sorts of things, Swimming Dragon is the one I will take to my old, old age. It's a beautiful system. Next up, what we have, what I'm offering is, as an extension to this, is until I am allowed to leave this farm, which I'm saying will probably be two, three, four weeks maybe before I can start traveling again, I'm going to commit to offering a daily movement class. This will be a Zoom class every day. You don't have to come every day, but I'll be there, where I'm going to get up, do my routine, my stretch, my flexibility, my self-massage, my meditation, my Qigong, and I'll choose a few tools each day, and then I'll just explain as I go, and you can turn on the Zoom link and then just run through the class with me. This will be a great way for both of us to keep each other accountable, to make sure that we're not just sitting and absorbing information, that you are actually proactively taking it and utilizing it in your physical life, in your internal life, and then out into the social world. Another feature that I've added to this course as a little bonus is what I call the martial charm school. Now, I get requests all the time by people asking, what should I read? What are your favorite how-to books or your favorite productivity or spirituality books? And I have some, for sure, I've read a bunch, but I'm very commonly saying, dudes, stop just reading how-to books, because they're only a fraction of what real literature and human thought has to offer. There are some good how-to get a bit richer, how to get a bit more effective, how to not be such a nice guy. I do recommend some of these books, but what I've done here, and I sat down with my best friend, John, who is the best read, most cultured person I know. He's read 20 times more books than me easily, and I've read quite a few. He's so cultured that what he does, when he finds a book he really likes, he will read it twice, and then the third time, he will record himself making an audio book of it, believe it or not. So I've got a whole bunch of customized audio books by John. So we sat down and we thought, okay, what does it take to be a cultural renaissance man? Because there is an issue that men who only study things, how to do things, are missing out on another major aspect of the human experience, and particularly, they're missing out on a lot of things that girls are interested in, or other people are interested in. Other people read novels. Other people read biographies. Other people read spiritual texts or travel writings. or great stories and fiction. And I know for myself, I've learned a huge amount about humanity, about women, about culture, about history, about the hero's journey, by not by reading how to do the hero's journey, by reading a book that someone wrote of their hero's journey. So what John and I did was we sat down and we put down all the books that we thought were the best how-to, okay? And then we also looked at the why is it so books, you know, books that explain how the human condition is, or the I was there books, the books written first person by an adventurer as they go on a quest to find a snow leopard or a spiritual teacher or improve themselves with women or whatever their missions were. And then what about fiction? What about the stories that people that are really, that have a real insight into humanity look at and poetry and music and different fantastic movies? So what we've done is we've put together these little culture packs. And I know that sounds dystopian, but that's what it is. Little culture packs every week where we give our recommendations for good books in a multiple variety of areas. I don't expect you to read them all, but it's a good library, as well as movies, poetry, and other thinkers from various schools of thought and of all sorts of ideologies to start you thinking and experiencing life in many directions. It makes you more interesting. And then finally, just to top it off, I'm throwing in my book, A Natural History, which is essentially my hero's journey from the early years of getting into, pick up for the, we could say for the wrong reasons or for egotistical reasons to prove myself, and then showing that over the years, as I got into this, got better at it, that my motivations shifted. My adventures led me in all these directions that made me a more well-rounded person. So there you have it. That's a brief tour of the way that the LVA works. We also have a private accountability group on Telegram. That's already popping. We've got guys going in there, working on the week zero missions, and really pumped to start class tomorrow. So if you've been sitting on the fence, hopefully this gives you better insight into how the course is actually going to run. And just to really emphasize this again, it is a 12-month program, and it is taught all by me, right? Every single call, I will be on, and I will be bringing in lots of different guests and specialists to assist me and to broaden the scope of what I teach, but I am there mentoring you, heavily invested in your change over the next 12 months. So if you want to join, I've had a lot of requests in the last two days of guys who are kind of scrambling to get the cash together, making their last minute decisions, and who really want to come. So I was supposed to close the cart today, which is tomorrow, because I'm recording it today, or tonight, but what I've decided to do is leave the doors open for two more days and two more days only, right? So if you really need that extra 24-ish hours to get your stuff together and join, then this really is your last chance. Now, the first lecture happens tomorrow, Tuesday, at 2 p.m., Tuesday the 26th, at 2 p.m. London time. That's the same as Portugal time. So if you sign up before 2 p.m., you will be able to get on the very first lecture, so you won't miss out on any of the material. If you sign up after that, because it will be available for one more day, the recording from the first lecture will be put up within the first 24 hours, so you won't miss any content, you just won't be there for the very first live event. That's okay, if it happens that way. I missed some of my first lectures at university back in the day, and that was all right. Don't make a habit of it, but if you miss the first one, we can catch you up and to make sure that you are doing the first week's missions, you're on the group with all the other guys, and you're moving at the same pace. So this is it, guys, the very last chance to join the Lifestyle Design Academy. When will I, people are asking, when will I run this again? I don't know, and if I do, it won't be for at least a year. I'm committing myself for the next 12 months to working with these guys, and no doubt I'll be working on other projects later in the year, but for now, this is where I'm at. If you want to be part of this in 2020, going through to 2021, in the most difficult, challenging, unpredictable, and possibly exciting times in modern history, then this is the product that is going to help you navigate through this. I can't predict exactly what's going to happen, but I know that it doesn't really matter from my perspective. I'm gonna be okay because my strategies, my networks, my resources are nimble and flexible enough that I can adapt to any scenario, as I have in the last couple of months, and I will continue to do that in my personal life, coming into whatever comes next. And I know that the people around me, those excellent lifestyle designers who are adaptable, who are well-connected, who know how to trade with people on things other than money, those are the people that will thrive and succeed in the coming post-corona world. So I hope to see you on the first day of class, or at least on the second class. Links below for full information on the course. Check it out, but don't think too much because we are shutting very, very soon. Looking forward to working with the guys in the LDA starting tomorrow. Peace. One more thing. I wanted to say a heartfelt thank you to you guys, to the TNL audience. As you know, the company took a big hit with corona, as many, many people did. Not that we're looking for sympathy, but that's just the reality of things. And we worked very hard to pivot the coaching model into online coaching. And it led to an unexpected kind of blossoming of new ideas. Because we were under the pump, because we were hungry, because we were like, okay, we have to really rethink the way we're doing things. That meant that I then reached out to a lot of amazing people and created what I feel like is some of the deepest and best material that TNL has ever created. And we've been putting out some good stuff for a long, long time. So I wanna thank you guys for following this. We've noticed that the clicks have increased up to 100%. So there's a lot more people watching. Watch time has increased. And I'm gonna presume that a bunch of you guys have been sharing videos as I asked. So I appreciate that, that's really helpful to us. And just a little message about what's gonna happen going forward. So we won't be putting out six videos a week like we have been the last couple of weeks. Obviously, we've been pumping everything into this, building anticipation for the launch and showing you what it is that we're capable of. And now we're gonna have to spend a bit more time being rationalizing our resources. So I'll be focusing on teaching the guys in the LDA. We still will be putting out video content, definitely. It won't be as common where we're aiming for a video a week through this kind of a more slow season. And it also gives us an opportunity to work on some broader content. I've had a bunch of videos that have been kind of left in the editing backroom for months and sometimes years because they were big projects that were not so specifically targeted to workshops. And for example, I've got a whole documentary series about when me and Sasha Daygame went to the Amazon jungle like six years ago and went and found masters and took ayahuasca. And we filmed everything at the time. We just never put it out. So that's the kind of videos which I'll have a bit more time to put out, which some of you will find very interesting and some will be like, where's the chicks? And which is fine. There'll be more seduction material, of course, as well. We are still a dating company. We will still be dealing with relationships, sexuality, all that kind of stuff. But as you know, my life has changed. Most of my coaches have expanded their scope well beyond just picking up girls on the street. So we will reflect that because we're not just one dimensional beings. So I wanna say a big thank you. If you haven't subscribed, please do subscribe. It makes a difference. Click the button, smash the like, you know, the stuff that you see the young kids tell you to do. I've been told I gotta start saying that. So smash that like button, subscribe that smash button. And spread the word. So we rely on you guys. We need an audience in order to justify sitting here talking out into the ether. We know that our audience is about five to 10,000 very loyal, big picture thinkers. And that's good. Like that's a really, really powerful tribe. I would much prefer that than 100,000 casual users who occasionally check our stuff out for the memes and the lols. Way better that we have a core tribe of men that really give a shit about their own lives and bring you more joy, more depth, more love, more sex into their lives and are not just here for entertainment. So once again, thank you, gentlemen. Don't worry, we're not disappearing. If we don't put out a video for a week, we need a break to figure out what our next moves are, but we will certainly be back. Peace out. \u266a\u266a\u266a"}
