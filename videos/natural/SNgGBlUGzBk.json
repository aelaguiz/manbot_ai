This guy talks like my imaginary boyfriends. He is written by a woman. I can't believe that such men actually exist. Sending my husband all your videos because so much truth. Can we have you speak at every college? Mandatory, you teach sex ed. As a woman, I like to send your videos to men and say, this, this is what we want. Good day gentlemen, James Marshall here and in today's video I'm going to share with you what I learned by going viral with the ladies of TikTok. Now personally, I've never spent any actual time on TikTok. I'm not interested in watching, you know, kids lip sync to K-pop or cat videos. Sometimes people send me a cat video that's a TikTok and I'll look at it and go, cats sure are cute, but it's not really my thing. However, my team put together a natural lifestyles TikTok some months ago and chopped up a bunch of clips from sexuality stuff, dating stuff, meditation, lifestyle, you know, all the things that we cover and punched up a bunch of one and two minute clips. Now obviously I'm a teacher for men, teaching men about sexuality, dating and relationships. And I was in no way expecting what happened because what ended up happening due to the algorithm gods and obviously the quality of the content is that a bunch of the videos went quite viral in the millions of views, uh, pretty much overnight, which is kind of ironic. You know, I've spent whatever 10 plus years on YouTube and getting a million plus video is something that happens really rarely, but, uh, you know, on TikTok things happen fast if they happen and suddenly I'm blown up. Now the interesting thing about that aside from cool, I'm an influencer on TikTok apparently is when we look at the analytics and obviously within the comment section becomes very obvious is that over 50% of the audience that are watching those clips are women. When you look at the analytics on the YouTube videos, it's, you know, somewhere between five, 10, sometimes 15 or 20% if there's something that's, you know, juicy and sexy, some of the sexual related stuff the ladies do watch sometimes, but on the TikTok, very clear that over half the audience is women and they are very active. So the comment sections have, are on fire and pretty much it's only women commenting in those. So this is unexpected and just an organic outgrowth of the content that I was putting out, which was directed at men, but is definitely striking a chord with women, particularly in the areas of discussing sexuality, BDSM, dominance, things like consent, aftercare, and especially discussions about what it means to be a healthy masculine male who is interacting with a woman with directness, boldness, but also sensitivity, calibration, and an empathetic understanding of her situation. So I thought to kick off this four part series that I'll be releasing over the next week, we would dive into what is really striking a chord with women on these TikTok videos. So pull out some of the clips, look at some of the most popular comments and see what we can learn about women. Now there will be some guys who will have an initial resistance to this, who will be like, ah, it's just chicks complaining, or they expect us to read their minds or be immature about this. And you can have that position. And there are definitely some women on those comments who are being bratty and immature as well. But for the most part, the women are really trying to express what is unheard and unseen about them in terms of their sexuality. And it's very obvious that there is a massive gulf or massive divide between what men and women want, the lack of communication that's happening between them, and how much dissatisfaction there is sexually between the sexes, and also how unnecessary that is, because all of these things can actually be solved with some technical understanding, clean communication, and some empathy. So let's dive into some of the most popular TikToks on the internet about sexuality BDSM starring James Marshall. The first stroke of penetration should generally last, you know, at least a minute to penetrate. Usually when women are aroused and they're ready for penetration, they will start moving towards you, right? Their body, their hips, like, they will guide you in rather than you, like, pushing it in. And in terms of the first stroke of penetration, an interesting study, like, the first inch of the vagina, which no one ever really pays attention to, I think, has a lot of, a lot of pleasure nerves that a lot of women like. So instead of just going right in, even if you take your and start, like, stroking motions, like painting, kind of like a paintbrush, or you kind of go in and out from the first inch, it will also create a lot of pleasure before you, like, fully penetrate. Yeah. And that's something I do at various points throughout sex is, like, take it and paint with it. You can do cool things where you can spiral it out, like, where you, like, kind of stretching in a circular motion. As far as I understand, you know, you have these stretch receptors, stretch cells, right, that, like, respond to actual stretching. And kind of regardless of your size, if you were, like, actually pushing around the edges of the vagina and then you can spiral it out and just do the head on the, you know, first inch or so, and then spiral it in and out. And that's also a cool way to map as well, because you can tell her to say yes or yes if there's certain points. And then as you're spiraling through, you'll find all sorts of points and these are special points for her and you can navigate in and out towards them. This one on arousal and penetration with 3.8 million views. Some of the top comments from the ladies. Just the tip is literally something that I live by. How do I get this on his FYP, which is for you page? I had to look it up. I didn't know. But until now that I need to be spiraled. Saving this to watch later while my husband is listening. Cool. And then from some of the dudes, we've got comments like the first stroke should last how long? So here we see some of the issues going on. So the point of this video is looking at the speed of penetration or the initial penetration of a woman. And almost ubiquitously, women are saying that men penetrate them too quickly, right? So it's like it's a bit of kissing, a bit of foreplay, and then they stick it in. Now, I can understand there can be reasons for this which are not necessarily selfish or negative. It can simply be that the guy's a bit stressed out about trying to get it in because he wants to maintain his erection. There's the stress of performance that can happen initially as a guy's trying or the like uncertainty of whether he's actually going to get it in at all. And if this is happening and trying to rush towards the goal. The problem with this though, is that if a woman is not ready and her arousal typically takes much longer than a man as sexologist Tucha Belek has expressed in this video, then we can be completely out of sync with the arousal phases. The man gets turned on really quickly, penetrates and typically lasts three to five minutes at best. Unfortunately, the statistics say, whereas a woman needs time to get out of her head to relax for her pussy to engorge with blood, to swell, to puff, to lubricate so that she's actually really ready for penetration. And if by the time she's anywhere near that, the guy's already started, done his thing and finished, then you've got these two people working on very different and incompatible timescales. So it might be a surprise to some guys to be like, what, 20 to 40 minutes before she's ready to be penetrated. Well, yeah, we'll look at this in more detail in creating solutions in part two of this video series in the next video. But in brief, we can think about it in terms of foreplay, right? It doesn't mean that I need to, I don't know, sit there with a, with a watch and wait until she's turned on. It's like, okay, I need to enjoy pleasure with her. I need to lead her mind into this erotic space. I need to get her and myself out of my head into my body. And learning to slow down will be of assistance to both men and women, obviously for the women gives them time to get ready for the man. It does actually over time teach him to get into a state of relaxed arousal, right? To not be thinking or projecting multiple steps ahead, to not have fixation on his orgasm or on the penetrative sex act itself. Of course, you know, that's a part of sex and amazing and irreplaceable part of sex, but you want to start thinking of as, as you want to start thinking of the entire sexual experience as part of the arousal, right? So that foreplay is happening throughout that we're always looking to be sensual, to read the other person's body, to be able to see if we can sync up and match up with each other's arousal states, because obviously that's where we're going to generate the most connection, intimacy and pleasure. This video with 2.4 million views is another one that looks at the speed and pace of the sexual experience itself. And a lot of women complain to their sexual therapists and in general that they feel rushed. So whether this is about rushing to the first penetration or just rushing the sexual experience in general, it's really important for a woman to, in order for her to really relax, really let go, she has to get into a trance state essentially, right? So to get out of her head, to relax, to down regulate. And a lot of women can feel like that this is a chore for the man, right? That they're worried that they're taking too long to come or that he's kind of selfishly just wants to get his rocks off or wants to get to, you know, certain positions or certain extreme sex acts straight away because that's how he feels gratified. And so as a result, a lot of women feel like they're just there to serve the man's kind of selfish pleasure. So for men that do care and that, you know, do want to give their women good sexual experiences, which a lot, you know, most men do actually, a lot of the time this stuff doesn't come from malice or from actual selfishness. It comes from some ignorance or from not being able to know how to communicate, not feeling comfortable to discuss things or not understanding his own body or her or her body properly. And so there's these disconnects. So even as Tucha is saying here, just allowing the woman to take time by giving her verbal permission can make the world of difference. You know, some of the comments that we look at here show that often women have never experienced that. Do most women complain about that we as men could easily fix or take into account? A lot of women feel like they are rushed. So even letting women know, take your time, telling them like, I enjoy your body, even like the most confident body positive woman report having high insecurity when it comes to their body image. I think a lot of like words of appreciation help women downregulate and relax and get out of their head. And also slowing down is very big. A lot of women feel like if the man came, okay, like it's done, let's wrap it up. I think by slowing down together and just giving her time, a lot of women will feel like that's already like a lot, I think. Some of the top comments, OMG, seriously, I just want him to slow down. I feel like by the time I get out of the car, he's already halfway to the store. Work with that analogy. It makes sense, right? Take your time, inverted commas, would push me over the edge. A hundred percent. I'm here for the whole experience, not just the end moment, right? So this is clearly something that a lot of women are struggling with, that the guy is just too fast. The sexual experience is over before she's had a chance to rev the car up and get it out of the garage because he's already at the store or whatever the analogy is. So slow down, take your time. This clip with 800,000 views started a little, uh, controversy between the men and women who were kind of arguing some of the finer points of this. And there's some interesting things to note from it. Describe what is good dominance to you. When he actually pays attention to your body talking, like if he actually goes ahead and like listens to you, kind of like really like tries to learn you and then make it that turning to something dominant and just like, you know, like grab you on the right spots and just like kind of pull your hair or just like bite your lips or just like, I don't know, like turn you around. Like again, this is another thing that is actually showing so much dominance and it's so underrated. We do not like it when a guy is asking you to switch positions, like just go ahead and put me into doggy position or whatever you want to f**k me in and just do it. And do not ask me. From the ladies, some men just get it and instinctively know, others don't. When he just knows and actually does it. From the guys, being dominant equals read my mind and anticipate what I want, even if I don't know it myself. Brilliant. And there's 1400 likes on that one from the gents. And then from the ladies, I like how people think she wants a mind reader, but men who have done this know exactly what she's talking about. So there's this confusion here, right? Where it's like, as Emily in the clip is saying, in general, a woman wants a man to be dominant, but he doesn't want, she doesn't want him to have to ask her or micromanage every single thing. Right? Baby, do you want to get on top? Or could you please turn around? Or do you want to get into this other kind of position? These kinds of statements, although they're, you know, I mean, it is a bit of a bit confusing because you're trying to communicate, but at the same time, what she actually wants is for you to take clear leadership. Now there is, you know, some challenges here in terms of that we have to read her mind, but it's not so much that it's learning to read her body. And also as the, as the dominant male to be able to make decisions, right? So you can say, turn around, get on your knees, spread your legs, open your mouth. Like starting to give these kinds of commands. This is the, you know, the foundation of verbal dominance and it allows her to then relax into the moment and to be led. So when in doubt for men, yeah, okay, we can, we can discuss things. Maybe it's better to talk about these things after sex or before sex, less so during them. But you can, if you, if you have confusion as a male, you can say, okay, well, it's not so clear to me if I want to move you in different positions. Should I just do that? Or should I ask you every time? And very obviously in these situations, the woman will just say, just do it and do the thing that you want. And at the same time, we need to have the much subtler understanding of learning to read her body signals, learning to watch the way her breathing is, or to see the way that she arches her back or opens her legs up and so on. There are so much sub communication that will give you permission or give you a clarity about where you should go in the next move. But ultimately as a dominant male, it comes down to you making clear decisions, leading and likely she will very happily follow. Do I have your consent? Yep. I'm sorry but I have to let you go now That's okay, but this is really good, thanks This saucy video of me tying up a lovely lady in a podcast, how that happened, well it's welcomed my life, generated a lot of activity, a lot of women were very interested in this one so you know some of the comments we've got here is, it was the come here for me, the way he avoided almost any physical contact and yes his voice, good lord I would have fainted when someone tells me come here in that voice or come here as I did, what do I have to do to become your subject, blushing me, I'm blushing, he's so polite and calm, me next, my turn, these are all like individual comments, um daddy, this man, oh my, the come here, so wonderful demonstration, we have all melted, that come here made my knees melt, you get the general idea, well the first thing I've discovered is that uh the male version of the thirst trap when it comes to TikTok is putting up gentlemanly respectful BDSM and I get way way more DMs and attention than I'm betting a lot of the muscle bound chads out there, it's really struck a nerve with a lot of women, the key things that the ladies have pointed out in this clip is okay so what am I functionally doing, I'm demonstrating tying a woman by the wrists and putting it over her head, it's a cool move but the things that really stood out to the women was for many of them seeing for the first time an example of bondage, BDSM and bondage, that wasn't rough and aggressive and degrading or humiliating, you know it wasn't extreme dominance, it was actually sensual dominance, lots of people have commented on the way that I applied the silk with minimal touch to the woman, the politeness and the gentleness of the way that I did it is something that really struck a chord with a lot of women's sexuality, so this comes down to you know there's broad misunderstanding of what dominance, what kink, what BDSM actually is in terms of the spread of possibilities and most women who have got fantasies related to you know being dominated or restrained or having different types of fantasy role plays, using wax, like all of these kinds of things, often they're not thinking of it in the most extreme ways, they don't necessarily want to go to a dungeon and have a dungeon master flog them for an hour, they want to feel safe, they want to feel respected, they want a man who is gentle but powerful who can take command of them in a way that makes their body feel really safe and good and then it kept on coming up over and over again, the couple of phrases that are in in that clip, one is the come here right and this is again the use of simple clear direct dominance in terms of vocal commands right and this you know this you can use those two words, come here in all sorts of situations which would have otherwise led to a stalling point in the interaction, the seduction or the sex, you know I've talked about this before when guy gets girl home sitting on couch and then there's a metre divide between them, the simplest way to solve that issue is to say come over here right to get her to come that metre towards you to close the gap herself or later on stand up and say come here right or in this situation where it's like I know it's very clear to the woman when I say those words that something's about to happen and I know what it is right which puts me into leadership dominance, puts her into follower submission and a woman who's anticipating a good time right so keep those those words in mind the come here giving simple directions. The other one that there's many comments about is you know saying how can sexy consent is or how the fact that I asked for consent just put me into some top echelon of of men, you know this is a big topic I'm not going to go into too much detail about consent here but there can be a misunderstanding that if I have to use verbal consent for like every step of the way that it's going to break the flow and it's going to be unnatural and that's true right so if you know every kiss I said is okay if I kiss you again is okay if I squeeze your boob again uh you know all of those kind of progressional points it's not really realistic and yes it can be really unsexy but it is important to be able to use verbal consent at the beginning of play right and ongoing as well right so things like if there's a thing that I want to do to the girl I'm going to do x right now I'm going to flip you over and fuck you you want that that's consent right that's that's me saying what I'm going to do and then checking to see she's down with that it comes across as dirty talk actually it adds to the erotic flow and then she can reply yes sir yes daddy oh yes I want that and cool this like little bit of consent is now something that's part of our play right or as we're going harder or we're spanking or doing something that's more you know a little bit more extreme checking in again with this ongoing consent you like that can you take some more you want that um you know is that enough for you these kinds of phrases will help you to navigate the sexual experience making sure that the both parties are enjoying it and want to continue it as I said it's a big topic it's there's a lot of gray areas within it but it's something that women really really appreciate and it's awesome also because it allows her to like make a decision and then really jump into the thing right as opposed to like kind of resisting the the advances of the man and gradually letting down her guard and letting him do his thing it's like getting her to enthusiastically be involved in this as well right so at the beginning of this I say do I have your consent and she says yes now she's now she's an active participant in it now she's you know committed herself to this to this thing now of course she could change her mind at any given time and as a good dom you want to be reading her physical signals not being attached to the outcome that you want um but is a really important thing and it's something that is lacking for a lot of women and it can lead to not good stuff you know lack of communication can lead to disconnection can lead to awkwardness can lead to things happening which shouldn't have happened because one party or another usually the woman wasn't into it we all know where that can go as well so important things to take away from this that girls find it sexy when you lace them up in a gentlemanly and respectful and lovely dominant manner and they love it when a man checks in to make sure that she's enjoying the process as well. I don't want to have sex for three minutes why would I want to do that if that's your idea of sex like you're like yeah I just want to like fuck her and come quickly then leave this channel I literally cannot help you if you think that that's okay and uh that is the preferential way to have sex that it's just about you getting a woman's body fucking it and coming then you're you're always going to be a lousy lay always and women won't stick around. 2.1 mil views on this one about men uh not lasting or wishing to last more than three minutes a lot of a lot of kind of let's say immature comments from men on here like I mean if we both come quickly I'm a busy man got to be efficient in time management call being efficient mate when you say three minutes it sounds bad say stuff like 180 seconds that sounds like a lot 1500 likes from the dudes I guess uh and then there's a lot of comments from guys okay so that's dudes who are like yeah I'm a three minute man I guess they're trolling I hope so um but then you have a lot of guys who are basically talking about how they wish they could last longer I wish I could last longer too but it's too good I don't want to but the problem is the scarcity of it yeah that's an issue when you know you don't get sex often then you get it and then it's over quickly what if that's all I've got with a broken heart emoji all right so I feel for everybody in this situation because we have circumstances where women are experiencing men lasting a very short amount of time in bed and as we've looked at it's just not enough right three minutes of penetration and a some cursory amount of foreplay is going to be a disappointing sexual experience for almost every woman on the planet and then on the other side you have guys who I mean we certainly can see from these comments there are a lot of guys out there who just think it's fine right it's just that sex is for the man to get off or why should I put all this effort into making a woman get off uh it's it's a selfish kind of childish boyish attitude to have and I'm sure that there are just a bunch of dudes and they're just trolling going to mid I'm a two-pump champion or whatever all right fine if that's how you you know what you like to do for recreation then that's fine but in the real world this is not going to assist you but then we have the vast majority of men who have issues with this it's just that they don't seem to be able to last long enough now in the next video in this series I'll be going into details a lot on some of the solutions to all of these issues so I'm not going to this is a big topic how to last longer in bed but the very quick tips that I can give right now is that it's about learning to have relaxed arousal right so if the reason that a man ejaculates quickly is because his body becomes tense and like to a certain degree we're wired that way right like it's like biologically throughout history it was probably you know you look at the way animals have sex some of them have it for ages but mostly they get in there and do their thing and then get back to like defending and fighting and feeding and doing the other animal things so you know we are wired in some way to ejaculate quickly but luckily our hard wiring can be adapted and absolutely absolutely any man can change uh from being a two three four minute man to being a guy that actually has complete control over his arousal and it can be a process of reconditioning his body reconditioning his mind things like removing pornography from your sexual diet things like not training and practicing to be shit and quick in bed and people like what why would I do that well you do do that if you're masturbating to porn quickly with a hard grip and you know getting your rocks off quickly well that's training right and for a lot of guys that's where the bulk of their sexual experience is going to be is with themselves cool no shame in that but we can start to view view this as training for the main event so being able to actually slow down to be able to use a little more relaxed grip to be able to deepen your breathing there's a whole bunch of other techniques that can be applied but it is something that requires a man to go through a process of self-knowledge right the same way if a common issue that women have is that they're not able to orgasm or they're not able to orgasm with a partner you know they can only do it when they're by themselves and so for them they will have to go through with with or without a partner a training period to understand their body their arousal uh their anatomy better and it's the same thing for a man you know every man knows how to knock one out as we might say in Australia or jack off or whatever spank the monkey have a wank everyone knows how to do that but have you learned how to do that in a way that's actually going to elongate your pleasure and stamina or are you training to be shit in bed and do you care because if you don't as I said in this video you'll always be a lousy lay and and women don't stick around with men usually if they have options who are crap in bed the best way to keep a high quality woman in your life is to treat her good and fuck her better yeah they're just going to want to stick around because the bar is unfortunately very low and very few men can last longer than a few minutes and very few men care to learn how to do that there is boiling in the subconscious of most women far more complex fantasies than most men ever have because men's fantasies is like I'd like to have sex with a hot girl easily and maybe two at a time once in my life uh whereas you know women have like complex fantasy structures often like zoning with childhood conditioning around to do around things they're not supposed to be doing yet they yearn for and so like a good dom has the ability to create a like a safe container for that to be explored in a way where there is no judgment and there is no danger and there's no consequence and so you can play through the sequence of the scene or the fantasy or whatever and at the end with proper aftercare it's sealed let's say it's finished and then she goes back to being herself without any residual like oh did that guy think I was a or like should I have done that that kind of thing which often women do experience lots of enthusiastic and interesting comments on this one I haven't experienced this sadly but it feels true to me I've seen three videos of this guy and I firmly believe he's the only man who is allowed to mansplain anything don't get triggered dudes but uh they like when I mansplain and others not the first man I've ever seen talking about female fantasy and desires with any kind of depth or intelligence sincere empathy high praise just not enough men in here right now wild to see how few of us understand the message because again with as with all of these videos there's just reams of comments from the ladies going yes or this or that and silence from the dudes except for the occasional trolling comment someone want to explain how this guy figured this out and I still have to spell it out to my husband the way my my heart leapt up the thought of that acceptance and then immediately fell it's pure torture in itself I guess when you can't get to experience these things that you wish having this guy show up unprovoked on my for you page is so bittersweet for what I looked for and could never find so it does exist dot dot dot oh that's like a heartbreaking poem that one how can I find a dom with this mindset holy crap I've never felt so seen now in this video I'm a little bit flippant about male fantasy I say that men only have the fantasy to have sex with hot chicks easily and maybe two at a time in their life is that true for you no of course men definitely have fantasy structures as well but definitely women's internal fantasy worlds tend to be deeper more mixed in with things like taboo childhood conditioning fears that can also be related to eroticism and then there's this underlying hum of the common desire not every single woman all the time but the common desire for a woman to be dominated or led into a fantasy space by a man and what's coming up in this clip is a lot of women are resonating with this they're like oh yeah spoiling in my subconscious there is all these fantasies and I do want to express this in a place where I feel safe and not judged and that's really the role"}
