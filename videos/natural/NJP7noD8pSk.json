Like things maybe they thought they know what they're doing, but they don't. Different, like maybe not great at communication or technical issues, like any problems you've seen. It's such a big list can be. Yeah, give me a few. For example, I don't like hyperfixation on my orgasm. When the guy makes it, his first goal, I feel kind of pressure on me. It turns me off, of course. It's easier to simulate and just not make it last for hours. Also, I just want him to think about his own pleasure too, and not making my pleasure like 100% the most important thing in sex. Because the orgasm isn't actually a necessary thing. Not always, let's say."}
