Can we do that in a week? Yes. So the areas I'm looking at are, yes, the way that you spend your time with your career and finances, your location, where that is to me is a very, very important piece that a lot of men don't even think about. Your overall enjoyment day to day. A lot of people defer their gratification too far. Deference of gratification is an important skill to be able to do, especially if you wanna start a business, if you wanna live a life that's outside of the safe lane, then it will often require being super lean. It will require you to be able to defer certain gratification for sometimes years. But if the idea is that I'm gonna defer my enjoyment of my life till the end of it, which is essentially what we're told. Okay, if you have fun along the way, well, don't have too much, but that's not the point. The point is fulfill your duty and at the end, then you get to put out the pasture in Miami. So in my opinion, if you wanna design a good life, you need to be enjoying a lot of it, right? It should be a joy to live. How is that useful for seduction? It's totally attractive, right? What does it mean to be cool? What? No, there's some passionate people who are really not cool. Huh? Being satisfied, that's the more of the right direction. What is cool is a person that is at ease with themselves or is at least able to look like they are. Let's say they don't take life too seriously. It's like, I think I take myself seriously in the sense that I am daily aware of the absolute insane chance that I got to be this, whatever this is in this time and place, that I have finite amount of time, that there is shit to do, and that I only have a few hours to live. So I'm not gonna say that I'm not cool, but I'm not gonna say that I'm not satisfied. That I only get one chance at it. So in the sense, that's a serious way to view things. I'm conscious, I try to keep that kind of way of the samurai thing with me all the time as like, death is always present, the moment is fleeting, this is your only chance, fucking milk as much as you can out of it. And I don't do that all the time, but that's an operating philosophy, which can be aligned with seriousness. But at the same time, there's a paradox of running it as this, that it is some grand joke. We don't really understand or know, we definitely don't understand or know why or what we're doing here. And we have the opportunity, if we decide to, to look at life as a trudge, as something that is about duty and following this path, because somebody else told you that's the way it's gonna be done, or to view it as a game. That can be won on multiple levels, and can be a lot easier and more enjoyable than a lot of people would suggest. All right, so those are kind of the metrics I'm looking at. Am I having fun a lot? Do I have enough time for myself to do whatever it is that I want to do? If that combines with my work, excellent, if it can't, how do I segregate my time away from that? Do I have the friends, the family, the sexual partners in my life that I wish to have? And all of you, pretty much, if you're here, probably don't have that at the level that you wish to. And understandably, because to get the top level of what it looks like for your ideal social and sexual life takes effort and time. Took me 10 years to get there. I mean, I've been there now for some years, and I'm hoping I'll be there for some to come. But all along the way, I was building that, and building variations and versions of that, which were less spectacular, or less international, or glamorous, or whatever, but still were delivering for me at that time in my life, the community, the sexual fulfillment, the sense of purpose and satisfaction that would allow me to then grow and move from level to level. I remember those days when you could stand in a suit in front of an audience and speak to them in real life. Remember those days, gentlemen? They'll be here again, I'm sure.
