So if I sit her down on the bed here, it's not exactly the right position, but you can imagine, unless I had a very long curvy dick, but generally the right position. Music So what I'm going to be doing here is essentially getting the hair out of her way. Now, if she's giving a blowjob and her head's down, the hair's going to get in her face and eventually the hair's going to go in her mouth and it's going to be annoying, right? So just to be a gentleman, I'm going to move it out of the way as well as it being super sexy, right? So all I'll do here is I just scoop the hair into one hand. So what I did was I put my hands under, I got this chunk and the other side went, and I dropped the hair into that hand and then I just have this loose ponytail here. So the way I'll initially apply this, because what I'm not doing is going here and then this. There will be a time and a place for that. Absolutely. And especially with a partner who likes that kind of aggressive blowjobs, then being all like forced blowjobs, then yes, I will. But let's say it's the first time, right? She's on her knees. Then I'll just do this gentle here. And all I'm doing is just holding the, like cupping my hand and holding the hair out of the way, right? So I'm not in this situation. Now she will get to work. She will start giving a blowjob doing her thing, right? But I'm just keeping that loose there primarily just so the hair's out of her face. And it's a sexy moment where, where I'm reading her, right? Especially if I haven't had the head from her before. I don't know her style, whether she likes me to take control or she likes to take control, or maybe she likes to vary it up. But first, I'm just getting a sense. And so as she's sucking, I'll do a little gentle guiding, right? But you can see I'm not holding the hair in any kind of tension at the moment. It's just, it's just sitting there. Okay, maybe I've got my hands around it, but it's not even, I'm not holding attention on it. Right, so that would be where we'd start. So again, it's just like so. In this case, I'm holding it in the left hand, but you could do it the other way. So I could go here and hold it in the right hand. Right, so left, right, or right, left. Okay, and if it takes, like sometimes you might have a girl with thick curly hair, for example, and you get some of it, but she's got heaps more, and then you get some of it, and then you do it again, and then you do it again. Cool, so maybe it takes like one, two, three, four maybe to get her in there if she's got lots of curly hair. But, and that's, that's fine too, because it feels nice. You know, it's, it's a caress, it's a massage. And then I can take it, and then from there she starts to work. Now, from here, we can now change the tone of this or the feeling of this by actually increasing the pressure. So you can see from where here where I've got my loose ponytail. To increase the pressure, all I need to do is just squeeze it. So I just increase my grip strength, and now the hair is being pulled under tension. So now I have direct control of her head. All right, so this would be, let's say she's going down on me, and then I might put a bit of pressure. Now I might take over a little bit. All right, so we get a sense of handing the rhythm over. So now she's being directed by, by me. All right, and I can interdisperse that. Like I might do that for a little bit, like three strokes, and then I might release, and then let her take over. All right, so she's doing her thing. And then, you know, I might swap the hand. I can do that, and then increase the pressure, and so on. Okay. And, you know, like if it was then much more aggressive, I could squeeze, and then I could hold her hair down. So if she's deep throating, for example, she swallows, and I hold, hold, and then release, and then go into the loose grip again. So then she backs up. All right, so start to work this rhythm with her where we have this shifting from me taking and her allowing. All right, so this is me taking a blowjob and her allowing. All right, or she's giving me a blowjob, and I'm just assisting by just holding this out of the way. Now she's doing everything, and I'm just here receiving while she's giving to me. All right, so it has a different, totally different feel. And you can take a blowjob through a really beautiful kind of musical patterns as we shift from her, you know, delicately showing me what she's got. Me like taking a bit of control. Me like holding her head down for a bit. She swallows, you know, releasing. She does her thing for a while. A little bit later, I come in and grip. All right, now some variations upon this. What I can do here is a two-handed grip. So for this one, I might just run the fingers down the scalp, and then I go in, and then I just grip. So it's kind of like I'm grabbing two ponytails here. All right, so I'll come in, grip. All right, so this is for much more forceful dominance. I've got her head completely controlled in this situation. So, you know, we might be here. We start, and I just take the hair out of the way. Essential, right? So she starts. She's giving head. I'm allowing or receiving. A little bit later, maybe I intensify that. All right, so I'm directing her head more. And then a little bit later, if I'm getting more forceful, I come in and I grip. And this is a cool one to do for like a really dominant Spider-Man kind of kiss. Yeah, so I can put your head down. So I come in, I grip, and I just tilt into the neck or tilt to kiss her. All right, or it's dominant, and I'm actually, let's say, forcing her head at this point. Obviously, consensually in a way that she likes, but she's getting that sense of the man really has control of me. Or I come in like that, and I've got this control here from the ponytail, and that works nicely as well. Good day, gentlemen.
