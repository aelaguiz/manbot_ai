Now, two days ago, I launched my 2.0 revamped version of my most popular ever online course, The Five Principles of Natural Seduction. Already, a whole bunch of guys have signed up and are getting stuck into the first week's worth of materials, drills and missions. And I've also received a lot of inquiries from guys asking for clarification about exactly what is the course and how does it work? Asking how many hours is it? How do the modules work? What is the structure? Am I involved as in am I personally involved or is it just a whole bunch of videos? So I thought it would be a good idea to take you guys for a little guided tour, a little walk through the inside of the academy to give you a sneak peek on how this online course works and to give you an inside peek into all of the amazing bonuses that I put together. So let's check out the inside of The Five Principles of Natural Seduction. I've structured The Five Principles of Natural Seduction online course as a week by week module based learning system. So every week, you will get access to a bunch of new videos which include the primary theoretical lectures where I explain in depth each of the principles. So week one being awareness, the foundational principle, then moving into intent, emotional impact, pressure release, and decisiveness trigger pulling. So week by week, the theory structure builds as you come to understand more of the overall teaching method. As well as this, you get practical drills. And this is very important because a lot of online material is simply information. And if you're just sitting there watching lectures, okay, that might be interesting or stimulating, but if it doesn't have a real world effect, then it's basically pointless. So it was very important for me to be able to give you guys drills and missions that you can take out into the field. So every week you have internal and external missions, meaning missions where you're working on your inner game, your meditation, your focus, your self esteem, your confidence. And then of course, missions and drills where you take it out into the streets, into the clubs, the cafes or wherever, going to meet girls. And each week, these drills and missions move up incrementally in terms of difficulty. So in the first week is fairly simple stuff, especially for the guys that are struggling with approach anxiety or not being able to know what to say in conversations. Week by week, these build becoming more complex as the course continues. So let's have a look inside the academy at the primary modules and the missions. Once you sign up to the five principles of natural seduction, you'll be given a private membership login to the TNL Academy. When you log in, you'll find yourself on the inside of the five principles course. As you can see, it's laid out in a very simple, easy to use structure, starting with the five principles lectures. Week one moves into awareness, external awareness, main lecture, and then internal awareness, main lecture. If you've been watching any of my videos for any length of time, you would know that I'm a big proponent of awareness and meditation. This is the foundation and the bedrock for everything that I teach at the Natural Lifestyles, which is why it is the first week's component. Awareness is in this situation divided into internal and external. So what I mean by internal awareness is the study of your mind, your emotions, and your body, understanding how they interrelate, particularly when it comes to the dreaded approach anxiety. Being able to get out of your head, into your body, learning how to relax, stay calm and focused. And then this extends out into external awareness, which leads to the skill of calibration and sensitivity, responsiveness, spontaneity. So if you're going out there and meeting girls, it's all very well to have your day game or your natural game lines where you go up and say, Hey, I think you're beautiful. But if you don't have an external awareness, then you're not able to read the situation and adjust to the needs of each individual girl. So the main components of week one, internal and external awareness deal with both this, the way that you are personally feeling when it comes to your interactions and your, your general self-esteem and confidence. And then how do you take that out into the field to make it fluid, smooth, and flexible. Moving on to week two, principle two, which is intent. It's all very good to be relaxed and aware, but if you don't have any kind of intention, any desire or will, then nothing much is going to happen. You're just going to stand there being chilled out. So the second principle intent is all about using this now potential space inside yourself as you've learned to become more relaxed and focused, and to be able to charge that with very clear messages. The guys that are really good with seduction are ones that are able to project their desire, their will, what it is that they want through not just their words, but their body language, their presence, and most importantly through their gut instinct and desire. So the second principle shows you how to unlock this inside yourself so that when you're talking with a girl or going on a date, it's very clear to her why you're there. This means that the seductions are inevitably going to move forward much faster. Week three, we're looking at principle three, emotional impact. Principle three, emotional impact. A simple question for you, which is why is it that a woman decides to sleep with a man? Now the answer is that she doesn't do it based on a logical checklist. She's not going down a list and thinking, okay, he's got a good job and he's got a nice square jawline and he's the kind of guy I could introduce to my mother. The reason why a woman decides to be with a guy is because it feels right, right? She is emotionally driven to make the decisions about whether she's going to get romantically or sexually involved with a guy or whether she's going to put him in the dreaded friend zone or whether he's just irrelevant to her. Men who are very seductive have the ability to trigger and arouse an emotional response out of a woman and a variety of emotional responses, not just the like pleasant, okay, he's kind of nice one because that's going to lead to just the friend zone, but being able to arouse a whole range spectrum of emotions through curiosity, excitement, being challenged, sometimes a little frustrated, uh, feeling sexual tension, feeling understood and acknowledged, right? All of these different types of emotions which a woman wants to feel, the effective natural seducer is able to elicit them. And this week is all about that. How to elicit a wide range of emotional responses from women in your seductions. Week four, moving on to principle for pressure and release. Pressure and release is my favorite principle. This is one that I certainly utilize a lot in my own seductions. If you've ever seen a video of me staring at a girl and asking her a few kind of difficult questions and then her starting to give me lots of answers and get involved. This is me utilizing various aspects of pressure and release. Nice guys tend to have a fairly bland, um, impact on girls. So the girl feels fairly comfortable, but she's not feeling excited. And most men don't know how to apply any of the correct type of pressure on a woman. Of course there is negative pressure, which is awkwardness and weirdness and sleaziness and creepiness where a woman's feeling under pressure, but it's not fun. And then there is positive pressure, which is where she feels an expectation on herself, where she feels like she wants to prove herself, where she feels sexual tension, right? Because all seduction is actually tension building to pleasant resolution, right? All the way through from the first thing I say right through to orgasm, which is actually a buildup of pressure and release of pressure. So understanding pressure and release, this is like the engine underlying all things that happen within a seduction. Very important to understand how to apply pressure verbally, physically, and on the intention level and how to release it at the right time. Week five, principle five is trigger pulling or decisiveness. Guys who get very good with seduction fast are the ones who learn how to try to open and try to close. Even if it's not very elegant or done particularly well, if you have the ability to start pulling a trigger, taking decisive action, then things start to happen. You get momentum and of course you get more rejections because you're putting yourself out there more, but you certainly get far more successes. Very common for guys to get stuck in the early stages of conversation or maybe going on pleasant dates and ending up standing at the doorstep as the girl turns her cheek as he tries to kiss her and never sees her again. This is because the guy hasn't been pulling the trigger physically or verbally. He hasn't been leading through his logistics, getting girls back to his house or moving the physical relationship further. Trigger pulling is absolutely important for this. Being able to just step out into the unknown, take a chance and see what's going to happen. In this week, week five, we look at this incredibly important aspect. Without pulling the trigger, without taking decisive action, nothing's going to happen. That's the core theory for the five principles course. These lectures are delivered to you week by week. They're important for you to watch and understand and to return to multiple times over your own personal journey because you'll find that each time you watch it, say every week or every month, you'll find deeper insights as your own personal knowledge and experience grows. But now let's move on to the practical application of it. Now we've looked at the theory, now let's look at the weekly missions that I'll be sending you out to make sure that this is not just a theoretical exercise but is something that becomes practical and gets you real world results. Moving into the weekly missions, first there's an introduction video which explains how to apply these missions week by week. And then every week you'll receive access to a video which gives you a series of different drills to take out into the field. These include internal drills, looking at how to develop your personal awareness, your calm, your sense of intention, will and desire, understanding yourself more on an emotional level, being able to handle internal pressure and becoming more decisive in your thinking. And then of course taking this out into real action, meaning that you will be going out and meeting lots of girls to apply your newfound skills. You can then discuss all of your experiences with other members from the course as well as myself on the private Facebook group. I'll be there, available every day answering questions and you can get amazing level of support from all of the other guys who are in the group. We found this on the previous launch of the 5 Principles to be a really dynamic and amazing supportive mastermind where guys got a lot out of interacting and explaining their experiences whether they were challenging or difficult or embarrassing ones through to of course all their amazing triumphs. So that's the basic silver package where you get access to the primary resources, all of the lectures as well as all of the homework drills and access to the 5 Principles community through the private Facebook group. But now let's look at the goal package. This is where I have put a huge number of extra hours of bonus material from when I did the first launch as well as all of the old material to provide dozens literally of hours of extensive extra components and modules. So let's check out the bonus sections. Moving into the bonus section, the first bonus is 5 Interviews with Dating and Seduction Gurus. I sat down with 5 of my favorite colleagues and friends who are also seduction and dating coaches and picked one of the principles to discuss at length with each one of them. Principle 1, I sat down and discussed with Travel Bump who's been a coach with TNL for a couple of years now. He has an amazing background in Zen meditation and is one of the most deadly ladies men that I've ever met. So we talk at length about how he's integrated meditation and awareness, presence and what he calls non-duality meditation to make sure that he gets incredible results with women at the same time as always feeling cool and calm and relaxed. Interview 2 is with Liam McRae. Liam is my executive head coach. He's been working with me for many years now and is well known for being an expert in rapid escalation and a projection of very clear sexual intent, getting super sexual with girls very fast. And in this in-depth interview, we look at the mindsets that he has in order to project this really powerful sexual presence. Interview 3 is with my good friend, John Keegan. John has been a guest coach at TNL workshops for many years now. He's a good friend and an amazing dating coach in his own right. A guy who was a professional actor for many years and then moved into seduction and dating and coaching. His specialty is into really flirtatious, spontaneous, improvisational type of game. And so in this interview, we sit down and discuss how it is that he constructs conversations, how it is that he's able to draw really powerful emotional reactions from girls. So we go deep into his insights into emotional impact. Interview 4, Shay Matthews. Shay and I have been working together since the very beginning of TNL and he is known as the inner game guru of the natural lifestyles. He studied a huge range of different personal change technologies. And in this interview, we're going to looking at the internal side of pressure and release. So looking deeper into understanding how it is that we as men can maneuver through and handle pressure because it's a vitally important thing when you're a guy who's trying to become effective with women to be able to be unreactive, to be solid, to have a core sense of good self-esteem. And so in this deep interview, we look at what is the internal processes of being able to maneuver through hold and then project pressure. Interview 5 is Sasha Daygame. The artist formerly known as Sasha Daygame, now going by his real name, Alexander Lazarev, uh, was a very famous dating coach for many years. He and I worked together on a lot of projects. He's now moved on to different areas of life coaching, but I sat down with him and interviewed him on his particular style of seduction. He's known for being very direct, for not giving a fuck about what anyone thinks, for being incredibly socially free and for always pulling the fucking trigger. So I sat down with him and discussed at length what's going on in his mindsets. How is it that he's able to move, move through fear to not care about what other people are thinking and move directly towards his desire. Next up, bonus two is the infield analysis series. In this bonus, I've added five unreleased infield videos from myself and two of my coaches. So these are infield videos which show a full pickup, but what I've also added is an in-depth analysis where I break down each of the infield sessions into the five principles. So I discuss at length how is it that me or my coaches have used the five principles throughout the seduction. This is much more useful than just watching a random infield video because now you can start to critique and analyze these infield videos to see, okay, that's how it works. That's why this is working, and then you can apply that in your own seductions. Bonus three is the sexual escalation seminar. The sexual escalation seminar is a two-part video series based around the most requested areas that I cover with my clients. And these are female investment, number one, which is the ability to get a girl to start chasing you. For the most part, seduction can be a frustrating process of running after girls, trying to convince them to stick around and give you their number and trying to convince them to come on dates and continue this series of you begging or convincing and the girl kind of dodging and weaving, and then maybe eventually you catch up with her. When you learn to utilize pressure and release, clear intention, clear logistics, then you can actually flip this script so that girls start to invest in you and chase you. That's what part one of this series is all about. Part two are sexual escalation secrets. This is, again, one of the most requested areas by my clients, understanding how do you physically escalate? What does it mean to escalate? A lot of guys kind of think of it in those old terms of bases. You know, you go for a kiss, and then you go for a grab, and then you go for a grope, and there's these big moves that you make. This is not the right way to look at escalation. Escalation should be something that is smooth and natural and that is integrated all the way throughout a seduction. In this part of the seminar, I actually demonstrate on a female model the best ways to physically escalate so that you can apply that in your next dates. In the lead up to the 2.0 relaunch of the five principles, I decided to put together a brand new, very special bonus. What I did was I got five beautiful, very self-aware women, sat down with them one by one and interviewed them in depth about their sex lives, about dating, about what turns them on and off, about how they feel about men, about the process that they go through when they're feeling attracted and when they want to sleep with a guy. This was a really fascinating experience for me to sit down and ask girls very deep, intimate, and sometimes confronting and shocking questions and for them to answer very, very honestly. So for this bonus, you receive five interviews with these individual girls going into depth into how they perceive the principles, what it means for them to be with a man who is aware or has intention, what are some great experiences they've had with guys and what are experiences that have turned them off or led them to putting a guy in the friend zone. And at the end of this, we put all five of them together in a room and my good friend Travel Bum sat down and discussed with him in a group dynamic all of these questions for a very, very interesting dialogue. So this is a really powerful and interesting new bonus, over five hours worth of material discussing the insights and insight of the female psyche. Bonus six is my awareness meditation system. Awareness, as I've said before, is the bedrock, the foundation of everything that I teach at The Natural Lifestyles. And in this bonus, I go into depth to explain and instruct you on a very simple yet powerful system of awareness meditation. This is what I would consider to be the most profound technique that I've ever learned in some ways in all areas of my life. It's a system that allows you to understand your mind, your body, your emotions, to learn, to relax, to settle into the present moment, and to be able to interface in the world in a way that's much more relaxed, spontaneous, and in flow. So in this bonus, I take you through step by step how to utilize this meditation. It's a very practical thing. It doesn't involve any hippie weirdness or any chanting or any bells and whistles. It's a very pragmatic system for understanding mind, body, and emotions. With this bonus, you'll be able to download it onto your phone, run it through at any other time, or run through and watch it with me in the video series. The final big piece for the five principles course are the live Q&A webinars. Your membership will get you access to video recordings from all of the webinars that I recorded the first time that I ran the five principles course. So this is over eight hours of recordings of all sorts of deep and challenging questions that all the guys who were involved in the first course asked me. I go into huge detail. I don't hold anything back, and this is an amazing resource answering many of the questions that you will have and a lot that you wouldn't have even thought of. As well as this for the 2.0 version, you'll get access to join the live webinars that will be happening later on in the course. You'll be sent details of when these webinars are going to be held. You'll get a login, and then on the day, you join the group, and this is your opportunity to ask me personally any questions that you wanted to ask about seduction, lifestyle design, sexuality, or any of the other areas that I cover. This is a rare chance to get access to me, to be able to hear my insights live in real time to answer your specific questions. So there you have it. A behind the scenes sneak peek inside the five principles of natural seduction online course with the foundational lectures, drills, and material, and over 30 hours of unreleased material that you cannot find anywhere else in the bonus sections. So if you'd like to join me and an amazing group of men from all around the world as we go through this journey of personal change and growth, and of course, seductive evolution and success, then now is the time to get on board. There is only a few more days left until the cart closes, until I lock this down. The reason being is that this is not just a dump of videos as you can see that you have on your hard drive. This is an interactive course. As soon as we finish the registration, I'll be getting straight into instructing the guys through the Facebook group, through the live webinars, and working through the material with the guys week by week. So don't miss out on this opportunity to join me on your own personal change journey through the five principles of natural seduction. Check out all the information in the link below, full details, and I look forward to seeing you on the course. This is James Marshall signing out."}
