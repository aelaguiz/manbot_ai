As we mentioned at the beginning, there is the dip, the part where it gets a little hard. James calls it the beginner's hell in seduction. Seth Godin calls it the dip. Once you push through that, there will be a phase of momentum, accelerated learning. You can put yourself into certain situations where you learn really fast. There's a lot of material out there online. There is people that can help you, advise you, teach you, because they went through the same initial phase. So basically, if we look at that scale again that I mentioned before, it's that phase where you go from a three to a five to a six to a seven, where you form hobbies, where you have fun. Now, after this stage, there's another phase. And that's when basically the second struggle phase begins, where things plateau a little bit. It's basically a law of diminishing returns. When you see, okay, the beginning is a bit hard, then it accelerates a lot, but then it plateaus off. Things get really tricky, you know? Imagine you play guitar, you know a few songs, a few chords, but then playing really fast, very specific stuff gets really hard. If you are conversational at a specific language, it gets fun, you can talk to people, but if you suddenly have to read very science-y kind of stuff, very technical stuff, and you have to learn very specific words, it gets really hard again. If you talk to women, maybe you went through the initial phases, you can now say hello, you can get into somewhat of a conversation, you get some numbers, it's cool, but maybe girls don't respond. Your conversation isn't really on point. You're not challenging the women enough. You're not making enough of a positive impression, and you're not getting the women in your life that you would really want. Now you're again at the struggle phase. Every hour that you put in in that phase gives you less of a return, less of a return. It gets harder and harder, and it's quite discouraging, because now you're in an area where not a lot of people push through. There is not so many resources online out there anymore. There is not a lot of people you can ask for advice, your friends cannot really help you anymore, your parents cannot really help you anymore. So you're a little bit more on your own, it's quite tough. And there are two ways, I would say, of dealing with this. One is the hard way, and one is the smart way. The hard way is grinding it out, putting in the extra hours, sitting down and really doing it. That's where people go to university for many years. That's the kind of guys in school that really pay attention, do the homework perfectly, spend an extra few hours into that project to get an A. The people who really specialize. But then the problem again is, we have to put so much time into that one thing, and we are kind of like in this loop now of this video with the beginning again, where we have to specialize in one thing to become an eight, a nine, to become really good at something. So I don't really wanna do that method because I wanna do several things. I wanna become really good at more than one thing. I wanna be a more complete man and offer myself to the world in a better version. The smart way is finding people that went through the struggles already, finding people that are at a nine or at a 10, finding those people that overcome and overcame those challenges, that know the dangers, that did all the mistakes already, and that can, which can package all those learnings and give it to you in a way shorter amount of time that it would take you to learn all those things. And those people we call mentors. Those people are out there. Sometimes they're hard to find, but they're out there and they are ready to help you. Some people may think, why would a mentor even care about me? Why would he help me? Like he's already good at that thing. He's accomplished. He probably makes a lot of money because he is at that expert level where people paying a lot of money for the skill. Why would he help me? You might be surprised. A lot of mentors either just enjoy giving back. They enjoy the process of teaching in itself. I hear that a lot. But, and that gets me back to a point I made before, they really value people who can solve problems for them because they have problems too, different kinds of problems, mostly time problems. For most mentors that I've met, for the most successful people that are in my life and that I get in contact with, time is their most valuable asset because that's what they don't have enough of because they have so many things to do. So if you're a guy who can really see through their problems and create solutions, have this problem-solving mindset, then you're a guy they wanna have in their life. And this is an extra video that I will do in the future of how to properly approach mentors because there is an art to it. There's a specific way of getting their attention, getting them interested, delivering, over-delivering the way you should approach their problems and deliver that to them. But that's a whole different video. Now, I just wanna mention that this is the magic bullet. That is the one shortcut in life that will massively accelerate you. Finding a mentor that can package those insane learnings that he took so many years to gain and can literally just give it to you. He's almost like a godfather in the mafia, with a lot of money that he can spend to make your life easier. He often could, and we see that on workshops, completely change your reality in a couple of minutes with knowledge that took him a decade to know. So the best example is this company, The Natural Lifestyles. Us, the coaches, spent five, myself, 10 years, 12 years, living, breathing, thinking in this area. Lifestyle design, seduction, dating. And we now, because of that, have the ability to massively reframe and change mindsets of the students that come to us. So I'm sure you have a lot of mindsets and limiting beliefs that you have based on your experience in life. You had experiences with a certain amount of women, have been in relationships, and this formed you. But maybe you're lacking information. You're maybe at this plateau level in this graph of diminishing returns, and pushing hard or pushing through just takes a lot of effort. That's why people come to us. They pay us a lot of money so that we can really feel into them, ask them a bunch of questions, make themselves ask questions, and then massively change their view on life, totally resolve certain limiting beliefs, change mindsets, change the whole outcome of their happiness, and change their worldview, change the way they approach life in this area. So I wanna ask yourself, how do you wanna proceed in life? Do you wanna either try new things all the time? Do you wanna find a few things and push for the dip? Do you wanna specialize in only one thing and hope it will be fine? Or do you wanna become the type of guy who is more complete, who approaches life in a more holistic way, who enjoys being with a lot of people, who opens up, who is okay filming and expressing himself, maybe even as an introvert, who wants to connect with women, who also wants to maybe speak languages, and has a high-paid job, and is really interesting to companies, to mentors, or become an entrepreneur yourself, and do all this in a way that is fun and in line with your passion.
