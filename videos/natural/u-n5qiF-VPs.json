And if you're one of the lucky first or early movers, then now you're rich. Well done. But for the rest of us mere mortals, the question is, what is the next big investment? How is it that you're going to be able to 10x your fortunes in the coming months and years? Well, I have an answer for you. So stick around until the end of this video where I reveal my investment secrets for 2021. All right, I'll get straight to the point. The answer is platinum coins, forget about gold, silver, crypto, whatever it is, platinum. You know why? Because a friend of mine told me that in the future, ammonia is going to be the next big thing in energy production. And one year of constant five gigawatts electrical energy on one tank of ammonia and the catalyst is made of platinum. So they're going to need heaps of platinum. No, that was a joke. And for anyone who just like switched off the video then, then there's an article, man invests children's college fund in platinum coins and they tank. That'll teach you not to watch the entire video. No, I'm not going to be talking as a spoiler, I'm not going to be talking about any financial investment in a thing, whether it's crypto or property or whatever in this video. I'm going to be looking at different types of currencies that truly can 10x the results in your life. And throwing that around, there's a lot of people who throw that around, right? Like to 10x your investment. And I think it's kind of human nature to want to have that experience where it's like, I don't want to like invest in some boring thing like stocks and bonds where maybe I get a 5% to 10% increase over time. You want to double, triple, quadruple and quintuple, quintuple whatever their cash without any work, which is why get rich quick schemes are so attractive and lucrative for the person running the get rich quick scheme. What am I going to do? And why that leads to financial ruin or disappointments for people who invested in those kinds of things. So again, today I'm not going to, I mean, buy platinum coins if you want, I mean, that is a real tip. I don't know. We'll see. But that's not the point of this video. What is the currencies that I'm looking at here? Well, let me tell you a little story. It's a little sad story. It's a little bit of a boring sad story. So you know, if you want to watch Netflix in the background, that's cool too. But let me explain. When I was 19, a long time ago, I moved to Sydney, Australia with my girlfriend and we were really broke students. We moved into this tiny one bedroom studio together and nearly killed each other because you shouldn't have two humans living that close, but that's all we could afford. And it was one of those rare times in my life where I actually had a routine. So both of us went to university. I went to Kung Fu classes. We both had part time jobs and our schedules were pretty clear. Like we would go to classes. We knew we would be back at a certain time. We'd cook together, eat together because we couldn't afford to go out and we would cook our lentils and beans and we were vegetarians at the time and tofu. Oh, I can't look at tofu ever again after that. And so we lived this very clear regimented life. And for some reason, I don't remember why, but we only had one key to the studio. I think the landlord didn't trust us with more than one. And what happened was one day I came home from university knowing that my girlfriend would be there because I knew her class ended an hour before. And she had the key and so we'd agreed, you know, that she would be home first to let me in. And I came and I knocked on our little, the door to our studio. I had a punch in code to get in the building and knocked on the studio door. And there was no answer. And I knocked and waited and there was actually a keyhole, right? So I looked through the keyhole and I could see just a tiny crack into the apartment. And my mind started racing. By now I was waiting outside the door for half an hour and I started freaking out thinking fuck, what's happened to my girl? You know, she'd be kidnapped or fucking hurt or what's going on? And you might be asking, well, why don't you call her on the mobile phone? Well, because it was 1999 and there was no such thing. Or if there was, it was only like rich businessmen who had car phones that were like this, like, check it out, I'm so rich and I'm, what? So no, there was no way to contact her. And I spent, I think, two hours outside the front of that door. And in that time, I became a complete mess. I was convinced that she'd been kidnapped, raped, murdered. And I realized that I had nowhere to turn. I didn't know anyone else in that city at the time. I didn't, I mean, I couldn't call anyone. You know, I had a few bucks in my pocket, not enough to even call anybody. And there was literally nothing that I could do. And I walked out on the street up and down and I was freaking out. And I remember looking at all the people walking by in this big, big metropolitan city, feeling so alone, feeling so disconnected and feeling like these people had no empathy for me, no understanding. There was no one that I could deal with and I'm starting to imagine dealing with the police and trying to contact her parents and whatever. And it was just this sense of absolute powerlessness. I just didn't have any backup. Now, the good thing, you know, the happy ending to this story, it was no big deal. In the end, she was just off fucking some other guys. It was no big problem. No, that's a joke. She was, she was, she was, went to after class drinks with a couple of her friends from uni and although now I, now that I think about that story, maybe she was banging another dude. But anyway, she survived and we got another key cut and moved on with life. Now fast forward to a few months ago. I caught a train from Budapest to Vienna because I had a flight booked to fly out of Vienna because Budapest was locked down. So my flight was going to be the next day. So I booked a hotel in Vienna, caught the train, got a cab to the, to the quite nice hotel and walked in and I was like, hello, I'm here to check into my hotel for the night. And the Austrian lady said, excellent, welcome Mr. Marshall. And so do you have your business papers with you? And I went, what? Business papers? Well, the regulations are at the moment you, of course, must have a business reason for being in, in Vienna. There are no travel, there's no tourism. And I was like, well, I have a business, but I certainly don't have any business papers saying that I have any particular reason to be in Vienna. I'm just catching a flight tomorrow. So don't worry about that. I'll just, you know, can I just check in now? And she's like, no, this is the rules. It's Austrian rules. You cannot stay as a night. And I said, well, it's 10pm and it's one degrees outside. Are you going to kick me out onto the streets? Like are you saying that all hotels are like this? Yes. And Airbnbs? No Airbnbs. So you're going to put me on the street? This is the rules from the Austrian government. And I said, fuck you and walked out. And then I walked out onto the street and it was freezing cold and I thought, wow, am I going to have to spend the night on the streets in Vienna until the police pick me up? Like, I haven't done that since I was a teenager. And I went, aha, now I remember. I'm extremely well connected. And I made one phone call. Within half an hour, I was in a cab and I was over at a friend of a friend's very nice apartment who had a bed for me and put me up for the night and whose girlfriend fed me and we had a lovely evening, actually. Much better than in that hotel. So fuck you, Austrian hyatt or whatever you were. And then I went on my merry way the next day. So these two little anecdotes, people are like, cool story, bro. It's not the most interesting stories I have in my life. I've got an interesting story about a bar fight in Mongolia that I'll tell you about later. But that's irrelevant to everything except for an interesting story. The reason why these stories are relevant is they point towards the currencies that I'm talking about that really do 10x your life, or on the other side, vastly minimize the pain and misery and negative things that can happen in your life. And that is what I call the seductive economy. So this is looking at usually non-financial currencies that people trade and the bonds of trust and reciprocity, that's a hard word, isn't it, reciprocity, I say it a few times, people are like, okay, I messed it up, fine, reciprocity, that draw people together and lead to multiplications of the results that those people can achieve. So you've probably heard the phrase, it's not what you know, it's who you know. I would say you would need to qualify that phrase further. It's not what you know, it's who you know. It's not what you know, it's who you know and what you know about who you know, firstly, because you could know somebody and not actually be curious enough or have good enough communication skills or rapport to actually find out what they really know. And then I'll add another one. It's not what you know, it's who you know, no, hang on a minute, it's not what you know, it's what you know about who you know and do they give a shit about you and are they going to help you with that, which doesn't fit on a bumper sticker quite as well, but it is more useful. Because if you have someone who knows something that's really important and you know about that and they want to help you, now you can multiply your effects in all areas of life depending on what it is that they know. And this, this is the currency that I'm talking about that will ultimately 10x your lifestyle. And it can also lead to financial success as well. In my life, I've had a number of financial wins and losses, but the ones where I multiple xed my resources were not based on watching a YouTube video, they were not based on any kind of easy to find media, they were based on hot tips from insiders. So people who were there early on or who were inside an industry and know how it actually works. So for example, I mentioned Bitcoin at the beginning, it would have been unlikely for a guy like me to, in the sense of an artistic dude who's interested in music and culture and history and traveling and sex, to, if I'd kind of gone through the natural trajectory of my life where I just hung out with those kinds of people, it's very unlikely I would have come in contact with anyone who had any interest or knowledge in cryptocurrency early on. But because of my position as a dating coach, I have, over the last 12 years, I've met a whole range of men, usually, yes, mostly men, who have specialized skills and areas of knowledge in areas that I would never come in contact with otherwise. And because of my, both my nature of curiosity, but also more importantly, my strategic ability to create bonds with people, I found out about stuff well in advance. So back in, what was it, 2010-ish or something, when Bitcoin was worth about a grand, I can't remember the exact year, you can check that out, but some many years ago, when it was, it was still new. It was only something that crypto purists and, and I'll say the word nerd in the, with absolute affection because I too am a nerd of many things, someone who is really obsessed about stuff that people don't think is cool, well, who's laughing now? So I met a bunch of crypto dudes, early movers, early on, and so people started talking about it. Now, at first I ignored it because I was like, what is that? That's nothing. That's a digital nonsense, I called it. And then Sasha, the artist previously known as Sasha Daygame, who some of you may know, who was an early collaborator of mine and an early seductive economy partner in the sense that he and I invested in each other, worked for each other, taught each other the skills that we had to, to multiply our personal effects. And as a result, we became very, very tight as, as friends. And so very early on, he was into it and he was like, dude, you got to buy Bitcoin, like put everything you've got into Bitcoin. I was like, I don't have much and I'm certainly not putting all of it into a digital nonsense. Sasha, what are you talking about? He's like, trust me. And I said, I trust you as a human being. I trust you implicitly. It doesn't mean you know about this thing. What is this? And he tries to explain it to me. I'm like, nah, nah. And now I regret it. No, because I ignored it for a little while. And then various other people told me, and then he's like, all right, just at least accept it as payment from students. And I went, okay, why not? So at some point, one student paid me, I think it was five Bitcoins for a workshop at the time was, was five grand worth of workshopness. And I got those five Bitcoins and I still have them. So you do the maths on that. That's right. I'm retiring. No, I'm not going to retire on that. But out of that, I 30x'd over less than 10 years, 30x'd my investment, which I would not have known about if it wasn't for people on the ground early on. So you find out about it in the mainstream media years later. Is it too late to do it? Well, often it is in those areas. Another example of where I tripled my investment was in real estate. Now, again, I'm not a real estate specialist or investor, I'm not here to give you real estate advice, but I'm here to show you how the fundamentals of my lifestyle and people's strategies have led me to be able to multiply my results far more than I could have done just by myself. So when I first made my tentative moves to move to Europe in 2012, I rented an Airbnb, an apartment of some local agency. And I met one guy and we became friends. He was the guy that rented the thing to me and I was new in town. I didn't really know anyone. So I was reaching out to try and make contacts. And he was a guy that was interesting. He was starting a small business in terms of real estate investment. And he was interested in me and we hung out and became friends. As a result, I got to know his business model, which was that he had on the ground contacts with all of the real estate agents in the center of the city in Budapest. And he would be the person that would get first options on apartments that came up for sale. And these would be ones that were in pretty ratty condition, but they were dead center, the best possible locations in Budapest, and they were old and fucked up. But they were in amazing locations and they were big. And so he explained to me the way that he did that, what he did. His business model was that he had a small group of private investors, who were not multi-millionaires, they were guys who had a little bit of capital thrown around, that he trusted and they trusted him and when a great deal, he came across a great deal, he would get that investor to invest, buy the property and then pay for the renovations and he would organize everything. Because he had amazing contacts with all the builders and plumbers and the legal aspects of doing that in Hungary. And he would renovate them to a very, very high standard and then he would sell them for between 40 to 50% increase in the value and then split the profit with the investor. So he guaranteed at the time, he guaranteed 22% return within 12 months, which if you know what you would get putting money in the bank or in stocks or bonds, that's a very large return and he guaranteed it and he followed through on it. And so as a result, he found me my dream apartment in the center of Budapest, I put all the money that I had in at the time and I bought it and I renovated it and then I didn't sell it because I wanted to live in it. Fast forward, I think I've had that for six or seven years now, it's worth triple the amount that I put into it. So I tripled my investment in way less than 10 years and if I'd, whereas if I'd been living in Australia and decided to try and invest in real estate there where the housing market is extremely overvalued and there's a huge massive bubble and you can't get anything basically for under a million bucks, you might be lucky to get a one bedroom shed for a million, you can't get anything less than that. So there's no way you're going to triple your investment. In fact, what you're going to do is you're going to be in massive debt to the bank for the rest of your life to maybe eventually pay off this overvalued piece of property. So the reason that I won on that was a number of reasons. One was that I moved to an environment that was where my limited resources could get way more bang for the buck or bang for your Hungarian forint as it was. The Australian-American-British dream of owning your own house on a quarter acre block was something that would mean being saddled with massive debt for the rest of your life and it wasn't really what I perceived to be investment, maybe it's something you pass on to your kids and they benefit from it, but it wasn't going to really benefit me in my life. And so I decided early on, I'm not going to do that, I'm not going to invest whatever resources I have into this country. And so as I traveled the world and started making more connections with people, meeting different people, starting to be on the ground and see, okay, what is it like here? Oh, I see that there is a rising housing market in this particular city at that particular time. It's different now, but at that time it was exploding. Prices were cheap, were going up fast. A lot of people were coming in to buy high luxury properties from Russia and China and Arab states because they wanted to have a backdoor into Europe and so on. And so I was there, right place, right time. But again, if I'd done that by myself, because I could have gone to a real estate agent and bought something. I could have done that. But I would have gotten screwed on the renovation and all of the red tape dealing with the bureaucracy because I don't know that country and I don't know how to not get fucked by contractors, right? But trying to figure out builders as I'm like, hello, I'm a Westerner and they're like, all right, we're going to 5X our profits right now by charging you five times what it is and doing a shitty job because how do you know? But because I had someone on the ground that I trusted and I didn't trust him day one. I spent months hanging out with him. He took me around to his properties. He showed me how it worked. I got to see him in relation to not just me, but to other people and even things like how he treated the waiter and how he treated his family, which he introduced me to. And I came to see that this was a true gentleman in the old school sense. This was a man whose word was his bond and his business model was based around mutual benefit. It was simply that the lower that he could get the price of the apartment and the lower that he could have the price of the renovations, the higher the margins of profit were for both parties. So he was highly invested in saving money for me to make money for both of us. And as a result, I watched it for a while. I didn't jump in straight away. I think I spent five, six months hanging out with him and seeing how it was. And then when I was like, all right, this is a big risk because this was all I had at the time, but I see that I have seen proof that this works and so I'm going to go for it. And as a result, it did work. Right. So these are just a couple of little examples from my life where I got to, I got really big wins, multiples, multiples of my investment wins based around what I call the seductive economy, right? So the, the trade of non-financial currencies, personal interpersonal currencies between two or more people with the, with the aim of everybody winning. I would say since around the release of Tim Ferriss's iconic book, The 4-Hour Workweek, there has been this new kind of archetype developed of a successful male, right? So throughout recent history, the, what it meant to be a successful male in the 80s was cocaine and Wall Street, hookers, suits, big lapels, nice, what are those called? Business cards. Yeah. And it, or, you know, in the fifties, it would have been the upstanding man in the suburbs who, you know, worked, worked in a, in an office and went home to his wife and 2.5 kids and a Chevrolet. Is that what they had in the fifties? I don't know. But there's this, there's this new archetype, which has become extremely popular and it seems very, very appealing, which is the idea of the digital nomad, the lifestyle entrepreneur, the guy that works out some system of creating wealth and theoretically a better lifestyle, which is kind of a turnkey thing that you set it up, you work really hard for a short period of time, you set it up and you press go, and then it just cashes, gives you cash and for four hours a week, you check in and basically you just check in to go, oh, I didn't realize I got so much richer this week by doing nothing. So this is, and correlated to this type of lifestyle is a lot of good things, right? So it was about hacking, it was about being more effective, it was about optimizing all sorts of areas in your life, including your health and your sleep and your time management and your finances and your location dependence and so on, so that you could create essentially leverage, which is something that I think is amazing and that archetype has spawned countless numbers of men and women who are now working remotely or working way less or unplugged from their nine to five and figured out ways to generate passive income or side hustles and so on. So it is a way better one than the cocaine and hookers and 80s greed is good kind of archetype of what it means to be successful. I think it's an interesting one, but it is also I feel missing out on some of the key components that really lead to multiples of your success. Because if you've read the four hour work week or looked at any kind of digital nomad or lifestyle entrepreneur kind of courses or resources, very rarely does it, I haven't even seen it happen, does it talk about collaboration in any other way other than outsourcing things to virtual assistants, for example. So, OK, like, you know, you may have a team working for you, but they're not really a team in the sense that they are contractors that do jobs for you and you pay them. So the aspect like all of this is hyper individualist. It's really looking at this as like a single person, single man or single woman can set up their turnkey online business and then end up living in Bali, going like this on a laptop a little bit and then what, sipping coconut juice and doing and surfing. OK, which as a snapshot, like I think you need to be wary of like when anyone's selling your lifestyle, there's always kind of a snapshot of what it looks like. Right. So it is like there's the guy on the beach in Bali or Thailand with a laptop just living the dream. All right. That's that's a better office than being in a tiny cubicle. Right. But what's going on for the rest of that person's life? Are they actually, is the business actually working? Because that can be dubious to see if that actually is true, but let's assume it is. What are they not getting? Right. Are they, do they, what do they have? Do they have a community? Do they have collaborators? Do they have women in their lives? Because I saw, I didn't, never saw a woman around Tim Ferriss. Maybe he was just keeping her quiet. And a lot of these kind of lifestyle entrepreneurs seem to be pretty kind of solitary and not really having relationships, who knows, but that was the impression I got. But without the ability to actually connect with other people in a way that goes well beyond just having drinking buddies or, you know, going to network meetings where you hand, we exchange contacts and say, let's do a deal sometime. No, I'm talking about true tribe members, true brothers and sisters on the path, true people who have your interests at heart and are willing to give you those tips, help you out in ways that they wouldn't just publicly give all that information out to, to make sure that you benefit as well as them benefiting. This is, this is what is missing, I think, in this archetype of the, of the hyper individualist, can get it all done by yourself, kind of like modern archetype of a successful man. In my case, almost nothing that I have ever achieved has been done completely alone, right? Like I can't, I can't think of anything that I've, that I've really gotten good at or that's given me really great results where it was just me, just me and a laptop or just me with my one skill or my one hustle. It just didn't work like that. And even though I'm the face of this company, there is, and has been a huge number of collaborators who have worked with me from the very beginning to, to make this successful. So I'm not a like lifestyle entrepreneur who sits on a beach or in my farm in Portugal by myself doing it all remotely. I have had partners along the whole trip and the thing that has held us together, and it hasn't held all of us together all the time, I've certainly lost people and had breakups along the way. But the thing that has held us together over time and has meant that not only I, but everyone else in the crew benefits has been this idea that I have lived by for a long, long time of the seductive economy. I have this attitude, which is the best way to get what you want is to make sure that everyone around you is getting what they want. And that's, I guess in a nutshell, that's kind of nepotism, but this is, these are the facts of life is that people help people that they love and respect and, and get benefit from. And if you want to be a great leader or you want to be someone who, who is able to use the resources and the knowledge of other people, then you need to be able to make sure that they are getting what they want in some way as a result of being close to you. And look, this, this happens organically, like I have, I have this course, the Lifestyle Design Academy, and I have this system, the seductive economy system, but it's not something I invented. It's something that I codified and have worked out ways to vastly accelerate what, what can and often is an organic, be an organic process. Because it's quite likely that you've used, I mean, very, very likely that you have used this at some point in your life. And if you think about your closest friends, the reason that you consider them to be, if you have them, I hope, I hope you got some, if, if you do consider them to be really, really close, it's not because you have the same interests necessarily. It's not because you were bought up in the same town or you're of the same demographic necessarily. It's more to do with the shared experiences that you've had over time and the type of those experiences. Because you've probably had this experience where you've been in a social circle or a work situation or a study situation, and you had this, this gang that you hung out with or a couple of people you hung out with after work drinks or, you know, waiting for class and this kind of loose, easy to, easy to put together social experiences. But then once the course is over or the job changes or someone leaves, those relationships just dissipate. That's because they weren't friendships. They were, they were just hangouts of convenience with maybe, maybe you really liked each other and you found each other funny and pleasant and interesting and you vibed, but you didn't have any real shared investment in each other. And so as a result, when the thing that held you together stopped, you fade off and go off into becoming Facebook friends. How do you know when someone is really tight with you? When they're your, when they're a real brother, when they're your best friend, for example. Those kinds of relationships develop because of reciprocal altruism or reciprocal trade of non-financial usually, and maybe financial currencies. You help your buddy out with moving house. He helps you out with getting over this girl that you're all caught up about. You help him, you know, study for his exam because you're better at that than he is and vice versa, right? So all of these things accumulate over time and the investments in each other, they have to cost a little bit for the person giving, like it kind of has to be, it kind of has to hurt a bit, right? Like if I go and help a friend move an entire house, that's a hassle for me, right? Like that's me putting myself out for that person, which means that it's a real investment of time and energy. And if I did this for a person where they just only called me up to get favors off me, and the only time I heard from them was to have favors, I might do that some number of times because I liked them and we were friends. But after some time, I would start to feel like this was a very imbalanced relationship that I was being taken advantage of. And if I was a really nice guy, then I might just put up with it for years and years and then eventually explode with violence or just hold resentment.
