No, you're not allowed. You have to stay forever. We are now together. Hello, hello. 2020 has been a really strange year so far. For me, for our whole team, probably for you as well. I've been reading the comments on the latest videos and people repeatedly comment scam, fake, day game is dead, doesn't work anymore, the whole world is locked up, nobody wants to meet and I'm about to find out. Do in 2020, during a crazy global crisis international pandemic, do they still want to meet? Do they still want to say hi to each other? Do they still want to shake hands? Do they still want to go on real dates, real coffees, meeting, looking eye to eye? We're about to find out. I'm really excited. Let's get into it. Hi, one second. You look awesome. I love your glasses. You're very powerful. Oh yeah? You are? Um, sorry, I didn't hear this because I was listening to some music. Okay, I will repeat. I said I loved your walk because it was powerful. Oh, thank you. And your glasses are very fancy. So you seem like an interesting person. Really? Let's find out. Yeah, it just depends on... What's your name? Alex. Hello. Nice to meet you. What are you doing today? Well, I'm going to uni. I have a class, so... What class? I'm studying German. Germanistic. Do you know what it is? I know German. It's a language. So it is Germanistic. What's the difference? Well... Honestly, it is about literature and history. So kind of interesting, at least for me. Kind of. You must convince me more. But it's like you learn about German language, but not the words. You learn how it developed and the history and stuff like that. From a different perspective, I would say. Why do you like that? Well, I like German. Why? Yeah, this is a little bit surprising because not so many people like German. That's why I'm surprised. Yeah, but I don't know why I like this. So my parents worked in Germany for a period of time and maybe somehow. And where are you from? Where I'm from? Yeah. Austria. Austria? Yeah. I don't believe you. Why not? I don't know. So you speak German? Yeah. That's why I was surprised. Why do you want to learn German? No, I mean, I get it. You have your personal contact if your parents lived in Germany. For me, it's funny because in Austria, people speak like, depending what region, they speak like a dialect. And then for me, thinking about my German that I speak with my parents, it's like almost comedic, you know? Like I really love the humor in it and making jokes. It's almost like, do you know stand-up comedy? What it is? It's almost like we have a very special humor that works really well in stand-up comedy when you use that type of language. And that's funny, but it's almost like not sexual to me. Like not at all, actually. Like it's just funny and quirky, but not sexual, not sexy. Like I love speaking Spanish because it holds, you know, more sex in it. And if you speak like this, it's very slow and I like it. And when a girl is like this, it's sexy. Do you mind if I go to my class? No, you're not allowed. You have to stay forever. We are now together for the rest of the class. Sorry. It's like animals. They're just, you know, like pigeons. What are the animals who stay together forever? I think it's parrots. Dolphins? No, wait. Dolphins fuck around. You know what I mean? At least, so I have two cats, but I know they don't stay together. No, they are very, they are not loyal at all. They just fuck around. Are you a loyal person? Well, I think so. I mean, I was so, so. You never cheated on somebody? No. Me neither, I think. Do you think? No, not at all. But the reason is, I didn't really have a long-term relationship. I had, but it was an open relationship. How old are you? I'm 18. Is it surprising for you? You seemed older, yeah. Not much older, a little older. I mean, what do you think? 22. Oh, really? It's kind of surprising. You seem cool. I want to go on a date with you today, tomorrow, when it's good for you. I think just next week. I leave maybe next week. Budapest is not my hometown. I do not live there. I just go to sleep. I just stay there. From like Monday to Friday, you're here and on the weekends. Okay, I understand. Maybe you have time for a quick coffee on Thursday? Because after next week, I might leave for a project. So I better meet you before. We can talk about it. Do you have WhatsApp? I don't really use it. Is it too private for you? I mean, we can talk on iMessage. Do you have an iPhone too? I have an iPhone, yeah. I always get confused with iMessage because I change my SIM card a lot. But it should work. Yeah, it does work. And I don't like it. Why? It's confusing to me. It's not confusing. Like when I... Because they update it all the time. You know, I'm here, Messenger. Yeah, that's true. Oh, that's the Messenger. But then I go into Facebook. And then what is all this? It wasn't like this the last time. Well, I don't know. I mean, I don't really use Facebook. I just use it because of Messenger, so... That makes sense. Okay, then let's do Messenger. Okay. Sounds good to me. Oh, you search me. That's easier. Because then I see your name straight away. Can you pronounce my name? Yes. Okay. That's kind of good. I say hi. My mom is calling. Okay. That's weird. It means I have to leave, so... Yeah, that's the only reason. I'm gonna be late. You're lucky. Okay. Enjoy your day. Thanks. See you. Bye-bye. Thanks? Thanks for what? Excuse me. Hi. You look very peaceful and focused. And this looks very complicated. Yes, it's mathematics, so yeah. But also you look wonderful today. Thank you very much. Can I distract you for two minutes? Or you're about to go on an exam? I'm about to understand something very complicated. Maybe now I'm in a good way. So now I should keep focusing on this. Because if I lose this thing now, then maybe I'm going to be lost forever. That makes sense. It takes a long time to get... What is it? Repeat it back to me. That's the best way to learn. It's kind of the basic of everything. So if I don't understand this now, then it's going to be terrible. That is a good argument for me to say goodbye. You seem very cool anyway. And I don't want to distract you. Do you have Instagram and we can chat when this is over? Is it going to be a time when this is going to be over? I don't really think so. You know, I'm in the first semester and there's going to be seven. Yeah. Yeah. Well. I don't really know why. I wanted to learn it even in English. So, no, this now it's Hungarian, but there's also an English one, so. So you started learning mathematics in English? Yeah, that's kind of the situation. And also accounting and management, so. Oh my God. And then you are in your first semester now, but you feel like you already regret it? A bit too much. No, I think just the summer was too long and I have to get back to focusing on things more. Okay. So it just seems like a very big challenge and a bit overwhelming. Not like you don't like it. It's just a lot. That's it. Okay. And I hope I'm going to like it anyway, but now it's a lot. I understand. I... No, I was informed. I shouldn't be distracted. You shouldn't. Really. I give you a tip. Because I was studying informatics in Vienna for one year. And I felt the same thing where I felt like it's a lot and it's overwhelming. And, you know, one math homework took me a lot of hours. And I'm the kind of person who wants to do three or four things at once. And then I could only do one thing, which was study that. So I quit that and I started something that was easier and that was fine. So maybe you don't need to force yourself to do something that is against your nature. But it is good to focus on something. You're right. So it depends what kind of person you are. If you want to go really deep in one thing or you want to go a little more deep in three things. So you can answer that for yourself. I think I can't. And that's why I do this now. Because I'm in the part of my life when I should learn more about not just subjects, but about myself too. How old are you? 18. Yeah. So. You don't know yourself at all. That makes sense. We shouldn't talk now. Definitely. I would go text me on Instagram and then I text you in four years when you either graduate or you live in India, maybe in a dance cult. Maybe your life gets totally crazy. I can imagine that too. And if you don't want to chat, you can always block me. That's okay too. But you have a funny humor. What's your Instagram name? It's Alex over the ocean. But you can call me Alex. Is that you? That is me. Okay. Then I've found you. Maybe we're going to talk, but not now. Definitely not. All right. All the best. Bye bye. Keep focusing. This last interaction, the girl was sitting by herself on a bench in a park far away from anybody else. So you obviously want to be aware of all those signals she's already sending without doing anything. She's looking at her book. She's studying. She looks focused. She's not in the sun, enjoying a fresh breeze of air in the park. She's clearly occupied. Should that be a reason to not talk to her at all? No, but we want to be careful. We want to basically apply self-awareness and respect for the situation. So when I walk up, I'm calling that out straight away. I see you're really busy. I look at the paper. I'm like, this looks really complicated. So I make her understand that I understand you're doing something here. You're in your little world. And I'm aware I'm interfering with that a little bit, but you look really beautiful anyway, or you spike my curiosity or whatever I say. And I just want to get to know you. So I'm a bit more apologetic, actually way more apologetic with her and with that situation. I would be with somebody just walking down the street, looking at their phone or whatever. And then it kind of continues the same vibe. The goal is here not to get in and get a conversation going. First, I really need to make her comfortable. I need to make her understand that I'm not a threat, that I won't hang out forever, that I respect her situation and let her come to me slowly. So I shut up for a bit. I let her talk. I made sure I understand what's up. I even said like, yeah, yeah, you should focus, you know, sure, you know, continue this. Don't let me distract you. Yeah, it's really tough, which made her even more comfortable. And then on the second time I asked for a contact exchange for Instagram. She said like, all right, OK, sounds good. Yeah, let's go on. Hi. I just saw you coming up here. You look so cute. Oh, thank you. So I decided to tell you that. Thank you. Wait before you go. Are you in a rush or something or are you just shy? I'm just shy. OK, that's OK. You can relax. I'm not dangerous. What's your name? I'm Alex. Hi. Do you study here? Yes. OK. First year because you look so young. But I should go because I will have a... So cute. OK, that's fine. I'll let you go. Give me your number and I will text you later. I give you my name. Your name. Your legal name. Just a name or no number? I need a number to the name. What am I going to do with the name? Without a number, the name is useless. Wait, I put plus three six. Okay. You hear from me. See ya. Bye bye. Hello. Can I tell you something? Can I tell you something? One thing. Only one thing. Maybe more. I don't know yet. I was looking up here and the way the sun hit you looked really cool. And that's not the only reason I talked to you. You're also very beautiful. But that especially was like... And I was thinking about movies and how much the lighting in movies influences the emotions of people. Thank you very much. You are so nice. Am I? How do you know? Thank you. Are you nice too? Yeah, but I have a boyfriend. That's very nice. How long have you been with your boyfriend? One and a half year. So nice. Thank you. Bye bye. So you guys have seen me do a few normal approaches right now, you know, where you tell the girl, hey, she looks cute, sweet, gorgeous, beautiful, amazing, whatever it is. And you introduce yourself. And some more, you know, out of the ordinary approaches where I basically use the scenery or the moment or the emotion I had when I saw her and put that in an opener. So with this example right here, you know, I'm building pressure before I even say anything. But I'm communicating with my eyes. I'm like, hey, stop for a second. I want to tell you something. And she's like, what? And I'm like, maybe I'm going to tell you more things. Depends. So I'm already flirtatious without even saying the opener. The point is it doesn't matter exactly what you say in the beginning. You know? She's so hot. I have to talk to her. Hello. You just unknowingly interrupted my video because I had to say hi to you. I'm sorry. I was just filming a video and you interrupted it. But it's not your fault because I wanted to say hi. That's why I interrupted it. Because you look really cute. Thank you. What's your name? My name is Alex. Nice to meet you. Sorry. What are you doing today? I'm going home. I just finished my last university. Last? Forever? No, for today. I was like, congratulations. I'm too young for that. How old are you? Ninety. What do you think? I hate this question. Could we just keep it? 27. What kind of video are you? I can't tell you, to be honest. It's very secret. I can tell you something else about me. I don't live in Budapest anymore, but I lived here for a while. So I kind of enjoy coming back. I travel a lot. I want to see the city again. I love the city. Where are you from? I'm from Austria, but I don't live in Austria. Because I don't really like Austrians so much. Why? Do you like Hungarians? It depends on the single person. In general, they can be a bit negative, right? I'm negative. You're negative? Why would you? All of the sunshine and the smile. And me? Yeah, of course. So it's similar. Austrians are a bit like this as well. So I enjoy Latin culture. I mean, now it's kind of weird because I live even more East. I live in Ukraine. But I used to live in Central America as well. I don't know. I enjoy the mix of both. Yeah, Nicaragua. Where do you want to live? Here, I guess. Actually, I have to be somewhere else. Quite far from here in like six minutes. That sounds stressful. Yeah. Okay. So when do we continue this then? I don't know. Give me your number and I'll text you. That's a lot of paper you're carrying around. Yeah. I just bought it from a guy. Beautiful. Do you have time for coffee tomorrow? Tomorrow? Or Thursday? You can choose. Maybe next week? Difficult. I'll text you. What's your name again? Okay. Alright. Budapest. Okay. Hurry up. Now it's five minutes. Bye-bye. It doesn't matter what you say. Of course it matters a bit, you know. But don't try to exactly transcribe the openers me or the other coaches here are doing and replicate exactly the words and feel. It's about the intention we're putting out. It's about me communicating through my being, through my eyes, through my smile, through my voice, through my words as well. Hey, I want to meet you. You're a cute girl. I'm a cool guy. Let's make something happen. That's the overall theme. The exact words don't matter so much. Alright. It's three hours later. We're still in Budapest. It's still 2020. We're still in an international crisis and it was fine. People still want to talk to each other. Girls still want to meet boys. Other boys still want to meet boys. Other girls want to meet whatever. It's fine. People want to connect with each other. That's kind of the energy I felt as well during the session. I didn't really get any negative emotions from girls based on, oh, it's a pandemic, please be away from me. None of that. It was totally fine. So I hope that's motivating you and I hope that's eradicating one more excuse out of your big list of excuses that you maybe have. Now, if you want to skip that list and do something about your social life, your lover life, your love life, your sexual life, book a call with us. It's really easy. You just have to click the link below. You'll get on a call with either me or our other executive coach, Jonathan, and we'll have a chat. We'll talk about how we can help you, where you're at.

We all have our sticking points and it's totally okay to talk to somebody about that and to seek help in that way. So I hope I got you a little bit excited about doing what I'm doing here. You see, it's not flashy. I'm not a crazy guy jumping around in a club. I'm saying hi to girls. I'm maybe giving them a compliment, but overall it's a pretty chill vibe.
