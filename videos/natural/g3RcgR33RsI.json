This concept of directness in its early days was misunderstood as being that you run up to a girl and you say, Hey, you're fucking hot, want to do it? And by do it, I mean sex. I'm not being ambiguous. I'm talking about fucking. That's direct, right? I mean, that's that's very direct. And most people would not advocate doing that. There's been experiments where men have tried something along those lines, and it doesn't really work. So can we just go straight to the sex? Oh, that was sweet. However, if we dial that back a little bit into the rational world, and it looks more like excuse me, wow, you look fucking incredible today in that sequined polka dot dress. I gotta meet you. You look so sexy today. Hey, excuse me. Hi. You just look amazing today. And so that's a direct opener. And my point here being that that's just the start or that's really just a reflection or a fractal of a way of life. If you want to actually be direct. I can anyone can learn like they can force themselves basically as a performance skill or as an acting skill to walk up to somebody and say those words, right? Almost anyone who doesn't have extreme social anxiety could run up and say, excuse me. I saw you. You look fucking sexy today. What's your name? And they will get some results. Like if you just force yourself to do that 30 times, you'll get a variety of results from women and some of them will like it. However, you are not a practitioner of direct game doing this and you are not I would say a direct person. And what I'm going to talk about now is is really what directness means in relationship to your life. My style of seduction is the same as my style of negotiation is the same as my style of presentation is the style is the same as my style of sexuality. It is direct and what do I mean by direct? Okay, it's not some words. We say it's not about your fucking hot or I want sex or give me a raise or whatever, you know, the expression of the directness is. It's about clarity about what I want and not hiding that in relation to others, right? So being direct is the ability to cut the bullshit right to drop the the fluff to you know, get to the point. All right. These are all things. These are all kind of sayings or memes or ideas that we're aware of and we can rattle them off. But there are certain people who live like that in all ways, right? They try to and we don't always succeed. Of course, every person who is direct and honest and clear has also lied and also spun bullshit and also been ambiguous for sure. It's not I'm not talking about this in an ethical sense really or a moral moralizing like I'm a direct and honest good person. And nice guys are liars. Although I think being a nice guy makes you into a liar. It creates situations where you kind of have to lie because the whole strategy is a lie. And I've said that before is clickbait nice guys are liars and and they are in the sense that if you're someone that is not able to say, hey, can you help me or can you lend me this thing or I want that or would you like to go on a date with me or listen? I know we've been colleagues for three years and this is a little out of the blue, but I actually have feelings for you doing it. Do you want to do XYZ? Hi dad. I've got some shit. I need to talk to you about you know, all of these things. These are these are ways. This is a way of living and some people have a tendency or a practice and have learned how to face things head-on through confrontation negotiation through speaking your desires through expressing your needs and how you need to have your needs met. I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse. Most people are not great at this but but some people have studied or practice this and the results are huge in relationship to what that means in your life. What is the consequence of being not direct because when a question comes up like this in a way, this is kind of like an academic question, right? He's talking about how do I be more direct and be more calibrated as if it's like a choice right as if we have the choice to decide. Okay, I choose to follow the school of directness and learn about its qualities and and you know, perhaps become skilled in that art form and then move on to something else. No, I view it as like if I don't learn how to be direct and also how to be calibrated because those things are need to be tied together. Then my life will be shit compared to the me that made choice points and learn skills that allowed me to be more direct. Oh, it is a dirty soggy day in the north of Portugal. How you doing gents? Welcome to 2021 going to be better. Let's hope so. I think everyone's been conditioned to Trump hands a little bit in the YouTube community after watching him for so many years. Well, eventually I'll have Biden hands whatever they are. I think they just go like this. Anyway in the spirit of directness, let's get to the point which is that coming very soon in the middle of March. I will be relaunching my most popular online course ever, which is the lifestyle design Academy. This is not specifically seduction.
