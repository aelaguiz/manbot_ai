They have settled in some sense, but they've settled into an immersion and an enjoyment of that life. You're thinking about this a lot, right? You've got your friends and your girlfriend, I guess is the situation, but you're constantly like, the grass is greener, I should be pushing myself, there's this other world out there, which is true. So my attitude on this and like when to settle, I would look at it more like when to choose to commit to certain things. Settling to me or mediocrity, like these imply that I've given up, that I've been given, you know, there's the Porsche and eventually I just settle for the fucking, shows how much I know about cars, right? The bad car, the bad Porsche, and I just settle for the thing that I didn't really want and then I just put up with that. No, that's my girlfriend. Hey, look at my girlfriend, she's the only one I've got. And you're like, yeah, that's my life, that's my job, that's my girlfriend, that's my shitty stuff, and it's all very average and I'm not happy with it. Do I think that's okay? Well, it has to be okay, doesn't it? Because yes, most people will live in mediocre situations, but there's ways of living, there's arts of living that mean that even if you are working as a wage slave and you've got a girlfriend that's not as hot as the one maybe you wanted or whatever, that you can still live a fulfilling life. And I think what you need to be thinking about is like, if whatever it is that I'm doing at the moment, even if it's not ideal, I should be committing to it, immersing myself into it and drawing as much juice out of it as I can. I've been to the top, right, like I've been to the video clips, I've been in the video clips, you know, the rap videos with the chicks and the boats and the bling and all that kind of stuff. I've lived in that world, I've bounced in and out of it now for some years, and it's awesome. I don't want to tell you that like, I'm like, oh, I don't want you to have to deal with, you know, go there and see the vapid, soulless ends of, you know, hedonism. It is awesome, but it's also as unsatisfying as a normal life. Depending on how you live it, right, because I've seen guys now in these scenes where there's hot models around, there's glamorous lifestyles happening, and they're still very unsatisfied, like still needing the next hit, the next hit to try and fill their kind of gaping soul. And I also know many people, I think of my brother as a good example, who's broke, has always been poor, but lives an exceptionally beautiful life. He walks past a tree and he smells the flowers. He looks at the details. When he has a conversation with someone, he's 100% there with them, and he's really, really connecting with them. When he's cooking, his presence is in the food and imbibed with love. When he's eating, it's a spiritual experience. This is a man, and I know many people like this who, you know, on the outside just don't seem to have succeeded, but are very successful in life in the sense that they're enjoying themselves, they're happy, they're with the people that they want to be with, and they're expressing themselves in ways. They get to express their art or their passion in some way. It doesn't necessarily mean they're living off it or that they're making heaps of money or they're living a wild, jet-setting lifestyle. They have settled in some sense, but they've settled into an immersion and an enjoyment of that life. So what I would say is, and when I think back on the times, like when you've succeeded, there is definitely a nostalgia for the down-and-out times, right? When I look back on the times when it was all very uncertain, like I was always on the edge of bankruptcy or this business could have collapsed at any minute, you know, I was broke, there was a lot of complications going on, but those were fucking great times because I really enjoyed them, and not all of them, but I was there, you know? I was really there at the time."}
