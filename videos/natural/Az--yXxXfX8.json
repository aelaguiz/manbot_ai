A little bit, you're like, it's not gonna work. And then when I approached, I said, it's even crazier now because she's crying on the phone. Still, I did it, and it went great, I think. Good morning, Barcelona workshop, here with Jay-Z. Morning. About to do one of our infamous infill sessions, where we basically send off the students into the abyss, we're listening in, and our goal as coaches is to be listening on the conversation, take notes, and see, personally I always check, did the conversation lead up to its potential, right? Because sometimes, you talk to a girl, and she's just nodding to you, and that's okay, you did everything you could, you overcame kind of the pressure to talk to her, you walked over, you introduced yourself, and she was just like, nah, thanks, and that's okay. Sometimes, girls really wanna talk to you, believe it or not, but they really do, otherwise we wouldn't have a business, which is based on talking to girls. And they really wanna talk to you, and then it's often the guy's kind of thing of rejecting themselves, or cutting it off too early, or only getting the number even when an instant date would have been possible. So that's what I'm looking out for, and basically, how deep do the conversations go? Is there an emotional impact created? Are we following the five principles from James and so on? JC, tell me a little bit, how long you been watching our content before you decided to come in a workshop? I think I've been watching your content for one year, one full year, watching every new video, and watching old videos too. Wow, so you really dig through the videos before you decided to come? Absolutely. I felt like the way of approaching the skill set was very effective and deep. I didn't want to get just a simple toolbox and you go and act. I wanted to have a deeper change. I wasn't sure that's what I wanted, but watching the content, I said, okay, that's what I want. I was tired of going out at night and trying to pick up girls. I didn't feel at ease with that anymore, didn't fit my lifestyle, but at the same time, I thought there was no way around it when I discovered you. So coming into this, what do you want to get out of it? What do you expect? A solid foundation to go from here to get the experience I need to just handle this in the future and so that I can also get better on my own too. So your goal, and our goal, is to give you tools you can apply in the future. It's not to spike your adrenaline and tell you, talk to this girl, do this, being silly, and then you're like, wow, I did crazy stuff that I never did, and then you're like, all right, bye. Yeah, it's an amazing week, but for sure, I'm hoping to turn this into a lifestyle. 100%, that's our goal as well. We really want the guys to change their life after this workshop. Okay, perfect. Then let's go, let's hit it. Yeah, all right. Quick break, if you enjoyed this video and you want to show some love to John, Christophe, and me, please press like on the video. If you wanna overcome your fears and start out on the journey of seduction and approaching, click below on the link and you can book a free discovery call with me, Orion, and we're gonna talk about how is the best possible way we can help you improve your seduction life. Back to the video. You actually look like a French actress. Which one? Her name is Charlotte Gainsbourg. Gainsbourg. Gainsbourg, yeah. You know her? You could be her daughter. Sure, I saw it. Where she played? Nymphomaniac. It's about a girl who's obsessed with sex, basically. That's one of the movies. It's quite a difficult movie to watch. Yeah, you saw it? Yeah, I saw it. Nymphomaniac, Nymphomaniac. Yeah, for me it was too difficult. Yeah. I liked it because it showed our society judges women for loving sex and doesn't really judge men for loving sex. I think it's not about loving sex, it's about addiction. Addiction. It's not healthy. Oh yeah. So she was sick and it was quite sad how she destroyed herself. Addictions are destructive. That's something to take away from the movie for sure. Well, I'm here for a week and... We both have boyfriends. I'm not interested to be with different men. No, all right. But you seem open, so would you like to be friends on Instagram? I think it doesn't make sense. Doesn't make sense? Okay. Anyway, it was cool meeting you. And I love that you've watched that movie. It's a chance because it's not that popular of a movie, I guess. And yeah, I love your vibe. Have a nice day. Thank you for having me. Bye. Ciao. So that was Surfing Chaos for sure. Surfing Chaos? Yeah. Okay. It's my first set of two this week. But usually when they're in a really good mood, I can kind of handle it. And then I was like, okay, is she bitchy or not? And then we found a wonderful topic, Nymphomaniac. It's about a girl who's like obsessed with sex, basically. I don't know how I came up with that, but that was pretty cool. Very interesting how you turned from, you look like this actress who played in that movie, which is about sexuality. And now we talk about sex. It's pretty smart that you, it's not like you ended up there. You led it very consciously. That was kind of slow even. Yeah. Yeah, that's cool. Nice. When somebody comes to sell something, you just wait. I'm from Belgium. Brussels. Do you know Belgium? It's not really changing the fundamentals of the approach. You know what I mean? Like fundamentally you're here because you're attracted to someone. If she gets a phone call, you're still attracted to her. If a friend arrives, you're still attracted to her. If somebody tries to sell you water, she's still a beautiful girl that you're attracted to. Right? It's like, it doesn't change the fundamentals of the approach. Okay. It's fine. If you try to do the Instagram, they're like, it doesn't make sense. You're like, okay. You could reframe her, it doesn't make sense. Because why does it not make sense? What could you say so it switches her mindset of it doesn't make sense to, oh yeah, that makes sense. How could you sell it to her? That's a good one. I can't really sell myself and say, oh yeah, I'm such an awesome, I'm that awesome guy you absolutely want to know. I could. Maybe you could. I could, yeah. That's at the core of it, right? They need to think like, oh, having this guy in my life. Basically sell it in a way that is like, it's good to be social. Why not? I'm a social guy. It's cool to have friends from all different countries. Or you could even say, oh, do you know many guys from Belgium? They're like, no. I'm like, oh, well, now you know one. You might as well have each other as Instagram followers. Don't worry. I accept you have boyfriends. I'm not trying to pick you up, but my goal is to make friends from all different countries. It's not a strong pitch. You're not trying to make their life crazy, but that might, that little, oh, it doesn't make sense because I have a boyfriend, turn her into like, oh, just friends from different countries. Oh yeah, that sounds cool. Excuse me. Are you here? Excuse me. You're a bit shy. Are you here with someone? Yeah? Okay. Have a good day. Shouldn't take it too literally. When I say, ask if she's here with someone, I don't mean you say, hey, are you here with someone? No. More like, hey, you're da da da da. Oh, it seems like you are, you're not alone in the park today, right? Oh, who are you with? Okay, cool, da da da. Like, in a slower way, figuring, you know, what's her logistics? Not like, hey, are you here with someone? What is your logistics? Next time I'll be more clear. She's on the phone. Girl on the bench. Yeah, walk past her. Excuse me. Pause. All right, see how she reacts first. I know you're on the phone, but you look so beautiful. How are you doing? Can you call back? Excuse me. I see you're on the phone, but you look beautiful. Can you call back? That person? Yeah, I can see you are having a bit of an emotional moment. I will sit with you just a moment. You got to tell me what's going on. You look absolutely amazing, by the way. You don't need to hide. It's just a family problem, but thank you. May you welcome. No, but you let yourself go. Just let it, let it flow. No problem. You are here in the sun and you are not with them, obviously. Yeah. Are you from the Philippines? Si. Okay. I've never been there. I was thinking about the Philippines the other day. You should go there. Yeah. You should visit the Philippines. Yeah. I would love to, if I had a good guide, someone sensitive like you. Soon. Yes, soon? Soon, okay. Okay, why not? So are you in Barcelona on your own? Si. San Antonio. San Antonio? Okay. That must be hard, like, they've been separated from the people you love. Yeah, and are you meeting new friends here? No, I'm all alone. All alone. Oh, that's why it's so hard. Yeah. I can only imagine how that feels, really. And you have all these problems that you can't really handle, but don't you think life is beautiful? Yeah, but sometimes it's very disappointing. I get that, okay. You know what? I think we should have a longer conversation, but in a day where you can really be at your own peace and not be distracted, okay? Because I like you as a person. My name is Jean. You are an angel. That's for sure. Do you have WhatsApp? Si. I will type in my name. That would be great. You know what day it is today? You know what day it is today? It's Saturday. Hi. Are you not working? No, I'm studying language. You are studying English? But you don't study Spanish. You speak Spanish quite well, right? I'm studying Castilian and Catalan. Oh yeah, they're much different. And you know that, all right. All right. Wait, I will. Thank you for letting me in your bubble. This is really, really nice of you. Thank you also. Yeah. I want to be a ball of fresh air in your life right now. You might want to keep going with your conversation. Thank you. Have a good day, anyway, okay? Bye. De nada. What happened there? I saw her crying. You approached her and she was already crying? Yeah. Oh, you made her cry. She was actually crying. Yeah. And not happy crying. Yeah. Something sad, so. So you had some emotional phone calls. Yeah. And I made her. Excuse me. I see you're on the phone, but you look beautiful. Can you call back? Which, when I told you, just ask her to cancel the call, you were thinking I'm crazy, right? A little bit. You're like, it's not gonna work. Yeah, and then when I approached, I said, it's even crazier now because she's crying on the phone. Yeah. Still, I did it and it went great, I think. Amazing. Yeah, she said thank you for being there. So, what an interesting kind of insight of they don't have to be in a top happy mood. If you are calibrated and you kind of flow with it, and at the same time, not trying to take advantage of it, of their vulnerability, it can be very powerful, you know? Like, almost like coaching them, not be like, oh, you need to, you know, don't be like the sleazy, oh, cool, she's crying. Now I can be the daddy or something. Obviously, we don't wanna do that. But if you're just like, oh, wow, tell me more, and you're just not even like faced by it, you're just listening, almost like a therapist a little bit, it can be super powerful. I mean, by kind of definition, you are hitting them at a moment where the emotional impact is already high, you know? If you can deal with it, it can be nice, you know? They can appreciate you, you can make them feel better. It's not even then about a date or anything, where it's just like, why not listen to a human for five minutes, give you a little advice, maybe you've been through the same shit, or maybe you are 35 and she's 25 and she doesn't understand life yet as well as you do, and you can tell her, hey, don't worry about it, you know, or something like this. That's young people problems or whatever, right? So it can be very nice. Dan, did you get her number? Yeah, I took her phone and I called myself with her phone. Okay. Which I did yesterday, and that was cool. Alright, cool. Interesting interaction. Film those two. Come on, give me your number. No! I have a boyfriend! Male and female. Excuse me, I can see you are with a big group. No, we are not. We're just the three of you? Yes. Okay. Are you from France or anything? No, no, no. Spain. We are from here, actually. Yeah? Oh, you are from here. You look absolutely gorgeous. Are you some sort of an Instagram model? No? Would you like to be one? Okay, okay. My Spanish isn't that good. You speak great English, by the way. You too. Actually, she speaks better. You speak better? Yeah? You are from Barcelona, really? Yeah, we are from here. Born and raised? Alright, cool. That's cool. You have a nice vibe. I love it. Thank you. So what are these photos for? Are you making her a Twitter profile? No, no, no. Just because she came to visit this weekend. Okay. So we are showing her around. She's from the region, from Catalonia, but another place. No, no, no. She's from Spain, but from other parts of Asia. She's from the south, in open Andalusia. I love Andalusia. I visited Andalusia last year. I did like Malaga, Cordoba, Sevilla. I didn't do Almeria. I just didn't do Grenada also. But I loved it. I rented a car. I went. I've never been there. No? I have no idea. You should. You should visit your own country. Yeah, I know, I know, I know. I mean, I have intention. I haven't done it yet. Yeah, cool. Eventually, same. Would you guess where I'm from? Now, France? Almost. I'm from Belgium. Have you been there? Yeah, Brussels. Brussels? Yeah, I'm from there, actually. So it's cool. If you like beer. Home. It's my home. I don't live there, actually, really. But I live in Brussels. But now I'm here for a workshop. One week. It's really life changing. I love it. Yeah. And how do you know each other? We work together. Okay. And we work with his boyfriend. Yeah, exactly. Okay. More or less. Kind of. He's your boss? No, no, no. He's just an artist. Yeah. But I guess you must be a charming person. I don't know anything about you because obviously there's a, you know, language barrier. Yeah, we agree, yeah. That's something. Okay. But well, take care of her and enjoy your day, anyway. Yeah, thank you. Thank you. Three is a good number to go outside, I think. Ciao. Wait, why didn't you close them? Okay, okay. How? Like, just the one. Hey, I forgot. You guys are super friendly. I closed them all. Yeah, what? I closed them all. You did? No, I should, like, close them all. No, the one you're into. Hey, you're super friendly and you're beautiful. I want to see you again. Doesn't want to speak the least, too, like. Yeah, that's the problem. Do it. All right. Let's have this challenge, all right? Hola, again. I'm not bothering you, like, too much. I just wanted to say, okay, could I ask you if you would like to be, to friend me on Instagram? Okay. It wasn't so hard. God damn it. Like, it almost seems like you don't believe that they like you. But, like, I thought they were going to, you know, code block me because I'm only asking for one person's Instagram, and she has, they mentioned that she had a boyfriend, so she could have just said, hey, she's got a boyfriend, what do you want? So I'm making all these scenarios in my head. Yeah. About what's going to happen. Like, okay, she has a boyfriend, which means you're probably not going to meet her today. For sure. She has a boyfriend. She mentioned it pretty early in the conversation, right? You gave her a compliment. She said she has a boyfriend. Okay, cool. Doesn't mean she cannot be a friend. Doesn't mean she cannot, you know, give you tips about Spain. Doesn't mean she breaks up in six months, and who knows what happens, right? And you're already 98% of the way there. You know, you already came to the workshop, or came to the city, went out, put your pants on, you know, walked out in the city, overcame the fear of getting rejected, talked to them. Why not do the last 2%? Which is like, hey, let's just stay in touch. Let's just be friends. You know, that's why social media is very powerful. It just makes it so easy to stay in touch with people. Like, if you had to get her email, hard, right? Back then. Even if you get her WhatsApp, it's like, who is this guy? Why is he texting me? There's one photo. I remember him. But Instagram, you can tell a story about yourself. That's why I'm such an advocate about it. That still can be strong in a year for her, right? If you just get her number now, yeah, that wouldn't make sense because you had a very small connection. You said you almost didn't talk to her. But Instagram, you don't have to talk to her that much. You can talk to her through your visual storytelling on your Instagram, right? Obviously, you have to have somewhat of a good Instagram, which we get into later today on the workshop. But yeah, it can be very powerful. And if you keep it super friendly, you can close them all. Sure, why not? But that was nice to try and just close one because I didn't think it was going to go well. Yeah. And again, it's like, I keep talking the same thing in this, but it's like, the fundamentals don't change, you know? And that's going to happen a lot. Like, if there's a group of two, three, four girls, the hottest one will talk the least. Always. It's never going to happen that the really hot one, except she's exceptionally extroverted and has a boyfriend and is really like out and about. But usually it is the one who are the most kind of passive because they don't have to talk. Their look talks for them. The other one will jump in and will be engaged. Oh, there's something happening. That's cool. The hot one is like, yeah, I've seen this before. So you have to engage them all, especially if the one that you want to talk to is totally passive, you have to kind of bring her back in, but also not ignore everyone else. For everybody else, you know, watching this or like in your friends, it's like, I was in Barcelona and then I met three sexy chicks from Spain because I walked up and talked to them. They would be like, what? You met three girls? You didn't have to swipe on Tinder forever or register on a website. You just walked up and there you go. There was three new, like Spanish women in your life. Like that is pretty insane. You know, like now we're talking about the details of if you could, you know, a little bit and there and it's like, who cares? Like you walked up to three Spanish girls. They didn't tell you to fuck off. Wow. Pretty cool, right? Like who does that? The way you looked at your dog, it's like you were talking to him with your eyes. Okay. I will stand up a bit. He's very protective. I don't blame him. Where are you from? Ukraine. I'm from Belgium. My name is Jean. I don't know if I can like Jean, Jean. Yeah. I would try to sit again and see how, how he relax, he react. Okay. What's his name? My name. Okay. Miami. Okay. It's a girl. It's like your best friend. No, no. Just your dog. You the boss here, right? Responsible. You like to be in charge? No, she's making it hard on you. Sometimes. Okay. You really talk about her like she's a human being or something like, uh, you know, some mother that will be like all around you. Does she remind you of someone, you know? No. Oh, I'm actually here for workshop. This is an amazing week I'm having now. And I will stay a bit longer because I just love the vibe around here. Don't you think? Yeah. Do you like the, like being in the sun and all with our white skin? Yeah. Yeah. I'm like that myself actually. This is cool. I have to get back to my friend actually because I'm not, I'm busy at the moment, but I'd like to continue this conversation later. Do you have WhatsApp? Okay. Uh, let me type in my name. I will, I will just, I will just send you my, I will, I will check you out. Okay. I hope I pronounced well. Thank you very much. Do you have, this is the Spanish number you have? Okay. How long have you been here? Okay. And so far so good. Yeah. Are you on your own here missing? You're missing your family members maybe? I've seen them recently. Cool. Awesome. Do you learn to speak Spanish? Okay. You don't need that. You're going to move maybe. Life is full of adventures. Maybe you're going to move away from Barcelona. Maybe. Okay. Have a good day. Thank you. I felt better with this. I think she was very responsive because she asked the questions, but yeah. Again, like emotional impact could be higher. Like what does she know about you? Nothing, basically almost nothing. And what do you know about her? She has a dog. Yeah, I know that about her. Yeah. You knew that already. You know what I mean? It's just like, when you say things like the workshop, okay, you turned up the emotion a little bit more now. It's an amazing week for me. That's great. Explain why, you know, always explain the what and the why. Because if I'm like, I'm a software engineer. Okay. Nice. It means you have a job and make some money. That's cool. But I'm a software engineer because I love creating things out of nothing. It makes me feel powerful. I love to put my brain and focus. And then when I write a program and I see other people use it and it improves their life, it makes me feel super happy. Like almost like a God because I created something, you know, like now I'm a dog. Being a software engineer is actually cool. You know, I get it. And it's like, I do this workshop and it makes me feel amazing because I challenged myself. I broke free. I had, I changed limiting beliefs that helped me back for many years. Wow. And then put it on her. Do you have limiting beliefs? When was the last time you learned something crazy about yourself? What was it, you know, or just simply, what do you do? Why? You know, there's not enough in that for that setting. You know, she's, she was very relaxed. Didn't seem bothered, right? Totally open. Why not use that? You know, the potential, like we discussed at the beginning of this, like there was so much potential and you only went to here. Hey, excuse me. You look absolutely gorgeous. You do. No. Why are you laughing? You are embarrassed? Don't be. My name is Jean. What's your name? Julia. Oh, from Amchic. You know what you do in life. I like it. I do. You're very decisive about. Yeah. What do you do in life? I have a scholarship to the university in Italy. Like doing a PhD, something like that. No, it's before the PhD. I do research, but not with a PhD. Okay. And what, in what category? Psychology. Okay. What brought you to psychology? It's difficult. I study language. Okay. And how people use language to shape reality. I'm here for two weeks. I'm having the best week of my life actually, because I'm on a workshop. That's quite amazing. But I'm curious about like why people choose psychology and the way you entered it, like with language. Well, I choose the psychology because I didn't know what to do. So I decided to do psychology like this. I like that you took really your time. I'm that."}
