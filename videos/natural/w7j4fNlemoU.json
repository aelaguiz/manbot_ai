I think ultimately what can start to happen is the, if you're lucky, if you do it really well, the underlying construct of this kind of limited ego self, which is very much caught up in these notions, I need to be something to get something. And often usually, when we really look at it, it boils down to some kind of construct like, I didn't get something, so therefore I need to overcompensate with something else. That's what the ego loves to do. So it's like, I was shit when I was young, so I need to be big and strong and tough now as I'm old. Or I was weak, now I need to be powerful. I was ignorant, now I need to be smart. I wasn't lovable, now I need to be like adorable. So there's like this kind of thing. And we often do see this with guys, for example, it's not that common, but it can be not uncommon that guys will come in and say something like, I wanna have this ability to be like going and like everyone in the party loves me and I can walk down the street and I can just pick any girl I like and she's gonna fall in love with me, which is a really lovely fantasy to the ego in reflection to this kind of wounded, like, oh, I'm fucked and I hate myself and no one's ever gonna love me kind of like belief system. I become Austin Powers suddenly. Yeah, baby. Yeah, it's exactly as if that's the resolution. And in some sense, it makes logical sense to the ego because it is a compensatory allusion to the ugliness of the other allusion. But what is the truth? The truth is actually neither of those things. So the truth is actually letting go of the attachment to both of those ends of the construct and starting to open up, what is the actual like stable neutral reality here, which is not this, not that, it's nothing in particular. We kind of just get to vibe on it and see what's gonna happen. And we can kind of enter it with an intent with the position of like, I wanna try and make something happen. But at the same time, there still has to be an underlying understanding that like, I'm not really like the boss here. There's something else that's going on that I'm participating in. And then it becomes much more of a playful, co-creative kind of engagement as opposed to a kind of egoic, like invested control frame, which has a huge effect because if we really make it simple, bring it back to simple ideas, what it means in practical terms is guys striving to use seduction and pickup and sex and some kind of mechanism, whatever it is, to fix their broken ego, as opposed to the other operating system, which is when you're just like, I'm just gonna fucking have an adventure and not give a fuck because I'm a free dude. And I would just wanna, I love pleasure. I love creating. I love challenge. I love like doing things that are gonna push my limits. So of course I'm gonna go out and see what happens when I do something kooky. And it's a different kind of operating system also from the sense of like, if you can catch it sometimes, it's like it starts coming from the inside out. You can feel the kind of inspiration driving you from the inside out. And that just kind of comes up through the body out. And that's more of a, I guess it's more of an embodied kind of expression as opposed to this kind of other thing of like, I need to like create the thing and then try and jam it in and then tell it to fucking happen in the world. And it's much more of like this clunky, like controlling ego mechanism, as opposed to like, oh, what happens when I just open the doors, dissolve my limitations of what I think I am and invite possibilities whilst I'm still kind of like, I'm consciously here. I'm allowing my ego to give me information, but I'm just not allowing it to be this like emperor of my experience anymore. It's fascinating for us because we spend a lot of time on microphones listening to the first interactions of men approaching women. And we see all like, because I don't know how many guys we've done that with hundreds and hundreds, maybe thousands now. And unlike every other human on the planet who doesn't spy on people picking up girls, most people only get their own personal experience in hearing the stories of their buddy. But yeah, we really get to see the responses that women have unconsciously, just like on a visceral kind of animal or vibe level when men go in with all these different things, right? So we see guys who go in with that, like sometimes they're really good at what they're doing, like running their rap, like doing their thing and like working it. And sometimes it's kind of good. And like the girl might be like charmed or a bit bamboozled by it, but it's like so clearly this guy's doing this thing, this performative thing to this other separate thing. And then she's assessing, does she like it or not? And then you get, sometimes we get those students who just kind of have this lovable vibe and they might go in and be a bit bumbling or say the wrong thing, or their posture is not good or something, but women just melt with them because they don't have so much, they don't have that attachment to like, I have to be this thing, I'm doing this thing to be this thing. And if she sees me as that, then I'm successful and then I've held ground and I've held that mask in place. And if not, and she pokes a hole in it or just thinks it's a mask, then suddenly that shatters my ego or that's a real affront to me personally, because if she thinks that shit or fake, then that's me being shit and fake because I haven't yet reached a position where I can step back and go, oh, that performance is not me. It's not, like I was doing all this performance and maybe I don't need to work as hard. Maybe I could just do way less of a performance and more of a like, okay, just reaching out and then connecting with somebody. But when you're so stuck in that, like I need to do in order to be, it's very difficult to just allow yourself to be all these other possibilities. Yeah, it's a painful feedback loop for sure. And it's instant for, you know, that's where we get to see it over and over again where the guy goes in and the girl's like, no, no, not that, don't wanna deal with that. Whereas many, obviously over the course of the workshop, we see them as they drop their masks and relax and not so invested in being, in her perceiving you as something specific, there's so much of that tension, internal tension is that you're so invested in the other person, in this case, the woman you're attracted to perceiving you as something and so terrified of her seeing through the mask and seeing that there's some other ugliness underneath which you've been hiding. What's up, gentlemen? It's a nice rainy afternoon here in Portugal, thoroughly enjoying the springtime and very excited to be starting our coaching season for the year. Yes, we are coaching live, believe it or not. We've figured out how to do it, how to slip between the cracks and find the best places where things are open and the girls are lonely, bored and horny.
