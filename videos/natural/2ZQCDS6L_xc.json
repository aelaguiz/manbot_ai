Anyone else been told that they did that? Yeah. It's very common almost like so many of our guys do it. You don't do it when you're talking to us. You don't do it when you're talking to your friends. Suddenly you're talking to a hot chick and you say, where are you from? I'm from Germany. You're from Germany. And how long have you been here for? Oh, for a week. For a week. And are you enjoying it? Yeah, I like it very much. You like it very much. And for us listening to it, it's so surreal. Every time I'm like, this sounds so weird. And the girl's like, what is going on? Right? So, instead of doing that, that's what I want to point out because almost everyone does it initially. Instead of doing that, what should you do? Yeah, shut up. Don't do nothing. Because what's happening is you've said something, the girl's replied and you're not instantly sure of what to do. So, you fill in the gap by saying what she just said or laughing. That's another common one to kind of nervously laugh when there's no joke. Again, it's the same thing of like trying to release pressure from the situation and buy yourself some time by filling in the gap with noises. So instead, we want to start to learn to be able to sit within pressure. Pressure and release is the fourth principle and it's the one that creates the engine of seduction. It's where the real sexual tension and energy is built up by allowing pressure to build and release it. If we constantly release pressure from the girl, we put it back on ourselves and we make ourselves look unsure and silly. So, we need to be able to start to sit in that pressure and go, alright, I said something and she doesn't know what to say and she's having to think and I'm not going to release it. I'm just going to let her and then she answers me and then I'm going to wait for a second or two, think about what I want to say next and then I'm going to talk. Alright, this will start to create a different dynamic and flow in your interactions and it will allow space because often, when I shut up for a second or two, the girl keeps talking. I ask a question, so what are you doing here? Travelling. Well, I came here on a tour to start with and now I'm, you know, just that extra second or two of silence, the girl feels pressure and so she tries to resolve it by adding more. Alright, who wants to work less and get more? That's what I do."}
