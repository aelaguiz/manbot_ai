And the answer is absolutely not. You definitely do have amazing resources at your disposal which are in high demand by women. There was one girl I remember, this was just before I'd gotten into seduction. So I was a guy who was working as a massage therapist, playing music in a not famous band, struggling to pay the rent and eating lentils. And I met this girl who was a friend of a friend and she came to me as a massage client. And she was a belly dance teacher, she was really really funny, she was a couple years older than me, I think she was 26 and I was 23. Really interesting, sensual, spiritual person, really kind. And she used to come to me once every week and I'd give her massages for some time. And I got a little crush on her, right, and I mean I got a big crush on her, let's be honest. She was cool, like this chick had a belly dance school, she was in with all the fitzroyalty, all the hipsters and everybody loved her and she was so sexy and earthy and natural and my type at the time. And I told her friend, the friend of the friend, I said I've actually got a bit of a crush on, I can't remember her name, what do you think? And she kindly said to me, listen Jamie, I don't think you should pursue that. I said okay, why? She's got a lot of going on, she's got, you know, she's got a lot of different guys interested in her. And this was in her kind way, because every hot girl's got guys interested in her, this is her kind way of saying don't know if you are what she's looking for. And shortly afterwards she hooked up with this guy who was an acrobat in some kind of like burlesque circus, very cool tattooed guy that was in, that made sense to her, like was in part of her scene and he was obviously attractive but like attractive and fit her idea of what she was looking for. At that time I didn't, I was just, I was a guy that she was friends with that gave nice massages and that was it, right. So the friend gently told me this and I, I took that on board and I realized yes, she was correct. Not that I'm saying you shouldn't go and take moonshot goals, right. That's, that's a different thing but you do need to have a sense of realism about where you are at currently. So what does that mean in practical terms to have a sense of realism? It doesn't mean hide from women until you become awesome. It means sure go about and approach whoever you want and I definitely encourage you to approach women that you perceive to be out of your league, right. You think oh she's too hot for me or maybe she's too cool for me because you need to find out, right, because otherwise you make assumptions and that's where men put themselves in boxes of mediocrity throughout life especially if they settle in their 20s, right, or early to mid-20s. If you shack up with a girl or get married or have children in that age, you're doing that well before your peak probably. So that means that you're probably going to get somebody who is not representative of where you could be at in the future. Now that's not always true. Of course, you may date someone that is beautiful and lovely and then you guys grow together and you become more and more awesome with each other over time, okay. It's not impossible, it certainly happens but I work with men who on the other end of their decisions. So most men that come to me are in their 30s, 40s, some of the 20s, mostly 30s and 40s and they've been through relationships, marriages, they've settled for women that they weren't amazingly attracted to or inspired by and then they've stayed there because they presume they had this thing that okay well I can't overshoot my boundaries, I can't get anything better than this so this is what I should put up with and that's what I highly encourage you not to do that, right. So I'm not saying all right figure out that you're a six, date sixes and that's the end. No, I'm saying you need to be aware that over time with experience, with more women, with more life, with success, with business, with career, whatever as you get better and bigger as a person then you will become more attractive, right. You will have more options and you'll have different types of women available to you that you previously didn't or even if you did it was very difficult to access those types of women, right. So if you enter certain kind of echelons of social worlds and you reach a certain level of ease with yourself where you do feel like you're valuable, that you have a lot to offer, that a woman would be wise to be with you because you have a it's going to be great then naturally you are going to be able to attract a higher caliber of woman. However, going back to our friend in the situation who's in his early 20s and he's thinking all right I'm on this journey, he sees it as a long-term journey knowing that this is a 10 plus year thing particularly if you're in your 20s, not necessarily that you need to go and approach girls 10 a day for 10 years. I'm not saying that seduction should be your obsession for the rest of your life but that you are working on this is a critical decade let's say 25 to 35 and then the next decade after that as well it's critical because that defines how much wealth you will have throughout your life, the social worlds that you're going to inhabit, what country and what position you play in that in that society like all of that stuff is built in your 20s and 30s right and then it's extended upon in your 40s. Okay some people totally reinvent themselves at 50 and totally change their lives cool but for the most part these are the critical decades so therefore you can either let them slide past with shitty jobs and drunken weekends and average girlfriends and then you reach 35 to 40 to 45 and you are not the silver fox sexy older man that younger girls are dreaming about or drooling about you're just some old dude who kind of wasted his important decades. Don't be that. So you see yourself okay one of the long-term payoffs of improving yourself and making your mark on the world is that you will get better women in your life and they will treat you better right so that's the other thing is like you can get an amazing woman but she may not treat you that amazingly if you don't train her to or if she doesn't respect you or hold you in high esteem if she sees that she can get away with all sorts of bratty or manipulative behavior which is certainly something that I experienced in my early relationships not that there was really anything wrong with the girls I'm still friends with some of them I mean there was things wrong with both of us we all come since in both way we were young and dumb but like wasn't that there was anything inherently wrong with the girl it was that I couldn't manage her at that time I didn't know how to handle a woman's moods or outbursts I didn't know what it meant when she was crying about this but she really wanted me to comfort her about that you know I didn't really understand all that so all my relationships had a lot more drama and turmoil and I didn't feel super respected so in your position what can you do overall you work on this long-term goal of improving yourself but in the here and now do what you're doing which is like you hang out with that girl to learn about what it's like try to get involved in social scenes where there are just women in general right so having women around you is a good idea trying to learn about how women are just by cold approaching that's pretty difficult right so it's like running up to any specialist on the street and saying tell me about what you do in five seconds before the person says I'm busy I don't want to talk about this that's a hard way to learn about women it is an integral part of it because it's the way that you'll get to meet the most women and you'll get to do it on your terms and you'll get to go into interactions with a clear intention rather than it just being you know you're next to someone at a university course and you get chatting and things develop over time you are shortcutting that and going straight to the crux of I'm attracted to you I want to see if we can start something so continue to do that and do that with women that you think are really cute and adorable and you could imagine that she would want to hang out with you and then also do it with women we were like oh my god that woman is terrifyingly beautiful from the looks of things or from my brief discussion with her she seems to be of in a social echelon that I'm unfamiliar with or I'm unversed in or I don't know what to do in so then they the assumption that oh shit I'm not good enough for this girl kicks in now this is the point main point of this video is I want to look at the what is it that you actually do have to offer if you're saying okay at this point I don't have these extra bells and whistles of what I think it is that a woman's after does that mean I don't have anything and the answer is absolutely not you definitely do have amazing resources at your disposal which are in high demand by women what are those any ideas do you like do I well look at it like this what's missing from many women's lives what's not missing if you're an attractive female is attention you get all sorts of attention you get validation you get compliments you get wolf whistles you get people trying to start conversations with you all day you get people trying to do stuff for you help you cross the road as if you're an old lady and give you free shit and give you drugs and jobs and all sorts of stuff right so that's not what they're in short in a short supply of you don't want to try and compete on that level because you don't have as much as the club owner or the drug dealer right you don't have that much stuff but what is it that is that is missing in her life what's missing for a lot of people on this planet where there's so many things trying to draw your attention and shiny screens and likes and swipes and all that is a sense of connection is a sense of being heard is being able to come into the present moment and if you're someone who is calm and aware and gives a shit about connecting with people and hearing them and understanding them then you have truly priceless thing to give them because even if a guy is super rich and successful and confident whatever he may be arrogant he may be completely self-absorbed he may just be spoiled all right so he just doesn't have to put in as much effort anymore because he has many options or it might be that he's just really egotistically involved in his in his status right so he's really invested in being cool and successful and so on if you're a beautiful woman who's looking for a relationship sure you may be looking for a guy that's well connected and you can take to parties and has those kind of external bells and whistles but where does it leave you when you go home at night right where does that leave you when you guys are hanging out and we're not hanging out in glamorous situations all the time we're just you know going for a walk to get a cup of coffee the person that you're spending that time with the reason she's going to choose to do that unless she's a total gold digger who's cynically just using men only for status and money okay some women do that but that's a really sad position for a woman to be in because she's saying to herself it's not worth getting emotionally involved with a man because maybe she's had bad experiences or she doesn't care it's like it's better to just get the stuff out of him okay i think that's a pretty depressing position for a woman to be in and if you're the man who's providing that stuff to her it's pretty depressing for you too i don't think anyone's coming out of this very well no one's interested in that that comes to me anyway so the thing is what she's missing if she's not has doesn't have deep connections is this sense of being heard being listened to having a masculine presence that's based around his actual core of who he is as opposed to the what she wears and the bling that he has that says he's that you"}
