So, if I'm, you know, I'm in a pearl, we've got our spanking session going on, you know, I'm objectifying. Fuck it, I love this peach. Give me that. Okay, so that's the, you know, the attitude that would go along with it. Next up, we have biting. Now, this is one I'm going to use, again, rarely, and it can only be done in several specific locations. So, if I'm going to bite a woman, I can bite her on the top of the shoulder, a little into the neck, onto the breast, the inner thigh, and the butt. Another, like, one other one you can do is this chunk of muscle here. Sometimes I get girls to bite that when I'm, like, doing something rough, so I can bite the chunk of the thumb as well, but that's it, right? There's nowhere else that I'm going to bite a woman. Like, you know, I could do a very light implied bite, right? So, there's not actually any pressure, it's just kind of more of, like, just putting the teeth on. Yes, you could put that in other parts of the body, but to actually apply any type of pressure, we need a good chunk of muscle to bite into. So, places that I must not bite is anywhere on the face. I've had many girls do that to me, try and bite me on the cheek or on the lips or whatever. It feels awful. It's not sexy. You think it's sexy because you're being all, like, wild, but it doesn't work, right? So, I'm not going to bite anywhere on the face. Can I bite into the ear a little? A little? It's more like I would, if she didn't have earrings on, then I might nibble on, like, just put one, like, two teeth, like, kind of clamping a little bit into the earlobe, but if she's got earrings, I won't because I can easily get them caught or they can fall off in your mouth, which I've had before as well, right? So, okay, I might put a little nibble there, but nowhere on the face or lips. Unless your girl and you are really into biting each other's lips. I hate it, but, you know, some people might like it. Okay, so anywhere where there's not much skin, right? So, you know, the top of the chest, anywhere that's really tickly, absolutely I would not bite into the side of the body, around the stomach area. No, that's going to feel weird, right? So, the thighs, because, you know, there's lots of meat and fat on thighs. Yes, I could kind of bite them in a way almost anywhere. Like, I would be aware that down the side of the ITB band is much tighter and so I wouldn't be biting her on the side of her leg, but like anywhere that I would be spanking, right? So, as you know, you've got your pocket area here, so I can bite anywhere within this area. And we've got the under butt here, so I can bite anywhere along there as well. I would be avoiding this area because it's much tighter muscle, right? And then the front, same, I probably wouldn't bite much on the front of the leg muscle itself, but on the inner thigh, depending on what position is, then yes, we can bite. To apply a bite to the neck, so I can do this standing position, missionary position. If she's turned around, it's easy as well, I can bite her from behind. So, you know, most positions I can reach in and get her neck. So, the first thing I'm going to do is scoop her hair out of the way, right? Because if I come in and I bite and I get a mouthful of hair, then I'm going to probably end up pulling on her hair, it's not sexy. So, I just scoop the hair out of the way to create the target area. And generally, I'm going to be biting at the top of the trapezius here, so into the muscle. And what I'll do is I want to make my bite wide, so I don't want to come in with like clamping, you know, nipping in or pinching sensation. So, I'm going to open my mouth wide. And I want to think of it like I just feel the teeth, touch the skin and then indent a little, right? Like a couple of millimeters, so that she gets the impression of being bit without necessarily the pain, right? So, the point of biting is not to actually really bite, draw blood or to leave a hickey or create a bruise or anything like that. It's to get a dominant sensation, right? I'm a vampire, I'm a beast, I'm eating her alive, right? And that makes sense in play as opposed to me kind of just like clamping on and biting to create pain, right? So, you know, if we look at it in play a little bit. Like so, that would be enough time to give the impression of the bite, right? Right, so you see I come in, you know, I grasp a hole in the hair maybe or I've scooped her in, so in this dominance I'm going to be kissing down the neck. And then open and just take a clamp. And then off again. And that would be a good length of time for a, you know, for a bite on the neck. It's a little shocking moment. So, if we did it from behind, right? So, again, I would scoop the hair out of the way. So, you know, I'm holding her in. I've got like maybe a dominance going on here. Kissing in the air. For that length of time. And I'm aware that like I apply the bite and then I release the bite. I don't go bite and then pull off, right? Because if I bit and then pulled away, it can kind of rip at the skin. So, it's like the bite comes on. Think of it like you are a vampire, right? You're coming in, you're going clamp, sucking her blood and then opening and releasing again. Okay, so one more time. So, I can also get her to bite me. I like being bitten on the neck and also some other parts of my body. So, I can lead a woman into that. And that's with, of course, any type of touch, right? So, if I bring her into me and she's not putting her arms around me, I can guide her like so. I can direct the type of touch, right? You know, I could get her, set her in motion if I wanted or I could tell her scratch my back, right? So, she could scratch down. So, you can be totally instructive and it's awesome to give girls guides on how it is that you would like them to touch you as well. So, in this case, if I wanted her to bite me on the neck, right? I pull her into me. I present my neck and then I'll say bite my neck. And you see here that I'm actually holding her like I'm holding her in by the base of the skull there. And so, I decide how long I want her to bite me for. And because I quite like a hard bite on the neck, so I might then instruct her in play. Right? So, over here. Bite my neck. Harder. Yes. Right? So, you see she puts on the bite. It's a light bite. I'm holding her by the back of the neck and I tell her harder so she can intensify and then I can decide the length of time. So, that's a good way to instruct the girl on what type of pressure it is that you like. Once again. Bite my neck. Harder. Good girl. I can also get her to bite me on the hand which is an awesome one to do, you know, we're having hard anal or intense BDSM sex from behind and I want her to like have something to bite onto. You think of it like, you know, an old surgeon when they're sawing your leg off and they bite on something. So, what I'll do is I'll say, open your mouth and then I'll put the chunk of meat in there and, you know, her head's now lent against my shoulder. Harder. Harder. Right? So, she can, if we're fucking hard here she can bite intensely and then I let her know when I want her to stop by just tilting my wrist and she'll get the sense of it and let go. Okay? So, that's a cool one here. Here we go. Open your mouth. Bite. Hard. Good girl. From this position here, very easy access to bite on the inner thigh and that's, in terms of the legs, that's primarily where I would be biting, right? So, this chunk along here, from here down to the pussy basically. Right? So, obviously it's great because we can interdisperse it with whatever touches, caresses that we've been doing here. With spanks. Right? With going down on her. And then, there's different ways I can do it. I can go this kind of sleazy, blending on type of touch there. Right? So, it blends in. Or, you know, maybe I'm more aggressive and I can, you know, grab a piece and give me that. Right? So, even though I went on, like, abruptly, I'm very conscious of the amount of pressure there. Right? So, I'm not clamping on and biting as hard as I can. I'm going quickly but then I'm aware that I'm only just digging the teeth into the skin and the top layers of the fat here. I'm not actually digging right into the muscle group because that's going to be painful. Right? So, it can kind of slap on like it's a snake bite. You know, it grips in and then releases for, you know, a different feel. Right? As opposed to the type of touch like that. From girl on all fours position, easy for us to transition into a bite as well. So, if we, you know, had it locked in here and we're doing a spanking, you know, warm-up, foreplay session, I would add in a bite to this not early on. Right? Because it's not a warm-up stroke. Absolutely not. It's a, you know, fairly intense stroke. So, you know, first, of course, I'm doing my warm-up strokes, glancing strokes, warming it up, you know, spank grab, spank grab. Okay. So, then at some point, once she's warmed up, she's turned on, you know, maybe there's some scratching here, pussy touching, you know. So, we've done quite a bit of foreplay. Then at some point, what I'll usually do is I'll take a chunk, right? So, with our grasp, and then I'll come in. So, to lift the piece, then when I bite it, it's elevated. Okay. So, come in. Like so. Okay. So, holding up a chunk. Come here. Same type of bite. Teeth in bed. Hold in one position. I'm not, like, continuing to put more and more pressure. It's just like I find there is slight resistance after the skin and the fat. Hold it for one, two, maybe, and let go. I'm not chewing. I'm not continually biting or anything. It's not going to feel good. Just here. And this is part of our worship. And think of the feel of this, right? So, if I'm, you know, I mean, I've got our spanking session going on. You know, I'm objectifying. Fuck, I love this peach. Give me that. Okay. So, that's the attitude that would go along with it. Because otherwise it doesn't make sense. Otherwise, I'm just spanking away, and then I just come and go. She'd be like, what? Why did you do that? Whereas if it's like, okay, I can't get enough of this spanking, grasping, I have to eat it. Then that will make sense. Good day, gentlemen. Today's video was yet another tiny little clip from the inside of the Master Lover Method course.
