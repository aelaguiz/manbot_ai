The ability to be direct, to cut the bullshit, to be able to say what you mean is the skill that will mean that you... If I don't learn how to be direct and also how to be calibrated, because those things need to be tied together, then my life will be shit compared to the me that made choice points and learned skills that allowed me to be more direct. Just last week I was doing a private workshop in Barcelona with one guy and he was talking to me at the end, we spent five days together and at the end he said, man what you do is incredible because from these few days that we spent together, like I spent days with all sorts of business owners and famous people and I've done, like this is a mover and shaker, a guy who's high up in all sorts of societies, done all sorts of interesting things, very successful, but he was like, these few days will change my life forever because from now on there are certain ways of thinking and doing that I will do completely differently. And I know just from the few days we've been together what the result of that is going to be and how that's going to exponentially stack, it's going to be amazing. And I'm not saying that necessarily just about my information, I'm saying that about finding any piece of true wisdom that is applicable in your life. And wisdom really, like wisdom is not a form of knowledge, it's not a skill set, it's not just a okay cool here's a better way to knock in a nail than this other way. That's a skill set, a technique based around a skill set, based around a craft which has application and if I become a master of it, maybe I can turn that into almost a spiritual quest, but in a way it's just something I could learn it and it would affect my life, or I could not learn it and I could do something else and it would also be okay. This is not one of those things. This is a survival skill, this is a life skill, this is a critical skill in my opinion. The ability to be direct, to cut the bullshit, to be able to say what you mean is the skill that will mean that you marry the person that you want to. Instead of like fuffling around with somebody and half asking and not quite working, you get down on a knee and you say, listen Abigail, I want to make an honest woman out of you. Now I'm not saying go ahead and get married, but that's a decision, right? The decision to cut ties with somebody, to move countries, to go up to a stranger on the street and say, excuse me, I know you're busy right now, but you look fucking amazing, I'd like to meet you. Then the ability to follow that up with clear text messages. The guy that I was working with last week, I looked over his text and the problem he had was he had girls on the go and they were chatting backwards and forwards, but he kept saying things like, hey, yeah, this weekend's looking fun, going to be a cool party. Are you going to be heading out with, what's her name, during the week? Ah, me and some buddies are going to be heading to this location over the weekend. Sort of throwing out hints and insinuations that if I wanted to go and someone said, oh yeah, cool party this weekend, I may have said, awesome, is there a plus one? I'll come. If I really wanted to, if I'm a hot girl with lots of options and some guy's like, hey, I'm doing this, doing this. Oh, so what are you doing this weekend? Without ever actually saying, listen, lady, do you want to come out with me or I want to take you out? Then you miss that chance. And that's the habit of directness. Oh."}
