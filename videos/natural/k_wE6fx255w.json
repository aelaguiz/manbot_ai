I know if you don't have one yet, there's a reason for it. You have resistance. You have resistance to put yourself out there. You have resistance to having photos of you being taken. You have resistance of being the model, right? It's just not you. I understand. But you are making your dating life and in general, your social life harder than it should be. And I get it. You're probably one of those people who value their time. You want to focus. You don't want to be one of those braindead people who just swipe all day and endless scrolling, constantly being distracted, constantly checking their phone. I get it. You don't want to be one of those people and me neither. Definitely not. But if you're not on social media, if you don't understand the principles of social media, if you don't understand the principles of branding, basically because you're branding yourself, you're not branding a product, but you are the product you're missing out and you're just not living in the present world. That's what it is. Now, with that being said, there is a way to do this smartly and efficiently. And there is a way to use the positive sides of social media, which is creating a profile and then using the leverage of it to improve your dating and social life without getting the bad stuff, which is, as I just mentioned, endless scrolling notifications. We can take the good part and design it really well and ignore basically everything else. When I talk about firstly, social media, I don't mean TikTok. I don't mean, um, you know, whatever the latest app is, uh, what was it? Clubhouse and so on. What I basically mean is Instagram, because let's face it. We want to be where people's attention is. You know, many years ago it was Facebook. Okay. So you obviously tried to make a nice Facebook profile. A thousand years ago, there was no online stuff. So you worked on your own appearance. You know, uh, it's not, fashion is not a new stuff at all. Guys have been wearing fetters and eye makeup for thousands of years. You know, that's nothing new. Now the crazy thing is we can use the leverage of Instagram servers of the internet to show our face where a lot of attention is already, right? People have their attention in their phone. Why not use the fact that people already look at their phone in their Instagram and put our face there to get us attention and to improve our life with the right tools. So that being said, it's not about getting famous online on Instagram. It's not about getting a lot of likes, getting a lot of comments, getting a lot of engagement. It's not about accumulating followers as much as possible by using whatever the latest trick to hack the algorithm or using hashtags or whatever is the current thing that apparently gains you followers, right? We don't want to play that game. We're not in that game and we don't want to play that game. What it's also not about is trying to be someone you're not. There is a way to be authentic. You know, a lot of people get overwhelmed because obviously the social media profiles we get kind of recommended the most and we get in front of our eyes. The most out of most curated ones, the ones from the influences, right? Whose whole job is to look good on social media. That's literally how they make a hundred percent of the income, which I understand it can be very like overwhelming. Like, Oh my God, I'm not on a different blue as water beach every week. I'm not jumping out of airplanes. I'm not dating, you know, several women every month. I don't, I don't even want to start. You know, it can be quite overwhelming. It's easy to think that's what's required to have any success on social media. And if you don't have that, it's not for you and you should stop it. That's not true. You can be authentic. You can show yourself and you can learn to show yourself from your good side. You don't need to take photos of every meal you do. You don't need to film yourself doing the same job every day. If you are a person who values their focus and you know, maybe fucking grinds 10 hours a day on something and it's the same boring routine every day. That's cool. That's a good thing. You don't need to travel constantly. You don't need to spend all the time dating girls, right? Everybody who really got somewhere, uh, is there because they put in a lot of very focused time. And the third kind of misconception I want to clear up before I jump more into why it is important is you don't need to have a stress of constantly documenting your life. You know, is having good photos of you important? Yes, for sure. And we're going to talk about it later, but is it important to do it every day to, to, to capture your life, to document everything that's happening? No. Again, I want to be efficient. I love efficiency more than anything. I'm Austrian. You know, we love German mindset, efficiency, getting things done, uh, and using leverage. So it's important to have good photos. It's important to document a little bit, but it's not necessary to do it all the time. Every day. We're just a normal person and we want to portray ourselves good on social media. All right. So three reasons why you need a strong social media profile in 2022. And the three reasons I'm going to call local, social, and global comment. If you get the reference, um, let's start with local. And by local mean the people you meet in your local area can be girls. And I hope because it's a dating channel that you're the kind of guy who wants to create abundance with women and one very effective and field tested and a proven method to get a lot of girls into your life is by approaching them locally in your city, in your town, on the street, in bars, in cafes, in a respectful calibrated manner, which I'm teaching. You want to stay in touch with those girls, right? Like obviously there is one ideal case where you don't need social media, spoiler alert, uh, which is basically if you approach a girl and you hit it off really well and you both are kind of in a phase where you both have time and both not stressed and you can really like lock her in. You create this beautiful connection. You have a long conversation. You can maybe take her on a coffee right there, right? The conversation got so deep that it's kind of like natural for her to respond on WhatsApp. That's great. And that might happen and you should always push for that. But let's be real. Most conversations, if she gives you some attention and engages with you will be in the like free to five to 10 minute range and then getting her WhatsApp and then trying to like constantly engage her and all she has is your number is really hard. Like, you know, what a feeling texting a girl, you just got her number and you're like, Hey, it's me. And she doesn't respond. What do you do then? You wait, you wait a day. Okay. You send a second message and she doesn't respond. Okay. It's basically that. And you're like, Hey, it's me. And she doesn't respond. What do you do then? It's basically that. Like, let's be honest. You cannot triple text. Uh, it looks super needy. No girl wants it. And if she doesn't respond, really, you never really had a chance with that method in the first place. But if you get her social media, if you exchange Instagram, which is first of all easier these days because girls have less resistance getting out their Instagram for whatever reason, you give her the chance to follow you and kind of explore you more, get to know you. Firstly, on your feet. And secondly, over a couple of days with the type of stories you post. And again, you don't need to post all the time, just a little bit. Uh, suddenly she can put a face to the number. She can understand who you are. And when you text her, she doesn't just have this five minute conversation in her mind that by then, let's be honest, it's probably like faded away, but she has this whole character that you build on social media. And the chance you will respond and engage is way, way, way higher. Now, second reason is social. You want to be a social person. You want to build networks. Like now I'm going a bit broader. I'm not talking about women in particular. I'm talking about women, guys, business contacts, family can be different people from different social circles, from different countries, from different continents, from different levels of income and so on. Social media is an amazing way to stay in touch with those people. You would be surprised how many people that have reached out two years prior to then actually doing something with them. Social media is an amazing tool to manifest amazing guys into your life. And obviously if you understand the principles of tribe, tribal signaling, telling an appealing story, keeping people's attention, presenting yourself, well, a communication, the chance that other people want to collaborate with you and they just basically simply said, thank you. Cool. Uh, and they want to hang out with you. Social media, a good Instagram profile helps you massively with that. And understanding how it works, obviously is super, super important. Uh, how to understand how it works. I'm going to get to that in the end of this video as well. Now, the last reason is a bit more niche. Let's say it might not affect you, but I call it global. So we had local, we had social, we had global. If you are the kind of guy who works in media, who is an artist of any type, who is in online marketing, who basically works in the internet in general, who is a teacher, an educator, anybody who is communicating things into the outside is not just, uh, doing internal work. It's good to blast out that message to as many people as possible. You could do that by having local meetups. You could do that by having concerts in your town or by using, again, the fucking leverage of the servers of social media, of Instagram for free. You know, let's acknowledge that it's still for free to use their technology to broadcast for free to millions and millions of people. So if you're the kind of guy who wants to building your own personal brand on an Instagram profile, uh, can be super important for your future career. Now, I know what you're thinking. I don't look good. I'm not a model. Nobody cares. My life is boring. Uh, I, I can never even get any followers because I tried and nobody followed me and so on. List of excuses continues, right? My short answer, it doesn't matter. You, you are basically barking up the wrong tree. You're forgetting the first part of that video where I said, it's about mainly about the local people. I don't care if I have a million followers in a country that I've never been to and not planning to travel to. I much prefer having a hundred followers that live within 10 kilometers of me because those are the people I've met in real life. And then I got them on my Instagram. And at the moment I met them, they didn't care about my Instagram at all. They didn't think, Oh, he's not a model or, Oh, he has a boring life. They don't care about that. They were enjoying the conversation with me and I'm giving them a possibility to, to, to stay in touch with me. And that's basically at that stage, the sole purpose of the good social media profile. Of course, if we get into advanced levels, we talk about creating more leverage. Maybe if we want to date really attractive girls, we even have to use certain techniques and create some jealousy, create some mystery and stuff like that for our photos. And that can be done. And I am happy to explain you how. But at the basic level, it's for you to stay in touch. Now, I mentioned a lot of things like manifesting guys into your life, creating mystery, jealousy, basically having the top 1% type of profiles that attract the top 1% of girls. And I do explain that in a free, longer, three-part series that I have. If you click down, I created this to go a bit deeper into the topics that I'm covering this video. It's totally for free.
