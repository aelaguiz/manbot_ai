How do you give orgasms to girls? There's two main things. One is technical, and one is psychological slash emotional. Now you've probably heard this, the you know, the brain is the biggest sex organ and, and you can't turn a woman's body on unless you turn your mind on that kind of thing. And there's truth to that. I mean, it's not that like, cut and dried, like certainly women can just be physically turned on by a guy, right, or a toy. But or, you know, riding on a motorbike or something. But yes, definitely like to arouse the woman mentally, physically, emotionally, then we need to set in place all the foundations that make a man a good lover, right. So this is where we're looking at leadership, dominance, vocal tonality, the quality of simple touches, right, the way that you draw her into you, the way you touch on the lower back, you know, when you when you do finally undress her as you're running your hand up her thighs, and then you tease and you don't quite touch the pussy, but we just just run your fingers over it. Like, this is building a lot, right. So this is building expectation, this is turning the girl on, both physically and and otherwise, by the use, but because she's settled into a space, ideally, where she feels feminine, excited, like it's not predictable, she doesn't exactly know what's going on, the man is leading, but he's not like micromanaging every single thing. And he's influenced her senses in a whole bunch of ways, right? Like, I mean, you know, you could answer that question, how do I give orgasms to girls, it's like, when you bring girls home, make sure that the lights are low, that there's nice music that it smells good, that you have a glass of wine available, just one. And that when she comes in, you're not weird and fucking awkward, you just say, Hey, come in, welcome, you know, take a seat, take your shoes off, make yourself comfortable. Can I get your glass of wine? Come over here, choose the teas, hand on the lower back, you know, come in close to her as I'm leaning up, up to pick out the tea and breathe in on her neck, but don't quite kiss her, you know, sit down with her, chat for a bit, put my hand on her leg as we're talking, my vocal tonality lowers, I get dreamier in my eyes, I say come over here, she comes closer, I lean in, I kiss her. By that more point, the difference in the way she feels compared to a kiss in a truth or dare competition, it's been kiss, kiss Jeremy, right, will be massive, even if the kisses were exactly the same, right? It's all of that build up expectation, excitement, that gets her pussy wet, right? So that when by the time I've touched a girl's pussy, it would be rare for it not to be soaking wet, right? Because because I've turned her on in these different different ways. Now, sometimes, you know, there's role play involved in that. Or sometimes, you know, I pulled her over to me before we started, I said, you're gonna be a good girl. And she's like, shut up, pussy squirts, because she's like, what does a good girl do? I don't know. Yes, I think so. Right. So like all of these different elements, in terms of role play, in terms of dirty talk, in terms of physical leadership, these all influence her orgasm, right? So then I mean, we get into the bedroom again, for the I mean, I put out a sneak peek on the for the master lover method where I demonstrate how to use vibrators to get girls off. So if you if you haven't seen that video already, sign up for it's free. And that, you know, shows you exactly how to use a vibrator on a g spot on a clitoris. Like that's in terms of like, how do I give a girl an orgasm? Technically, the easiest, simplest way is to get a g spot tool and a vibrator tool as far from Alice or Hitachi rip off like the you know, the big chunky massager ones. And then to put a vibrator in on a g spot and then one vibrator on a clitoris and she'll be done 20 seconds probably like that's technically the easiest way right but like I've also talked to lots of men and women about these kinds of things and women particularly who like would say things about a partner like oh, you know with my boyfriend, like he would always do the same thing. And I was said, well, was it bad? No, it was good. Like, he knew how to make me come and you had to use toys and fingers and made me come but it was always every time he just like did that same thing because he knew the buttons to press and it was kind of boring. Right? So it's like, you know, you can you can give a girl an orgasm. But it can be kind of boring. I mean, you've you've had orgasms that are like average, right? Like, I mean, I've had come with girls where I'm like, I shouldn't have done that because it was a waste of a jizz. It's different, different for men, I guess. But like, yeah, just the functional thing of like, making your orgasm. Yes, that's a great skill. I mean, and you do need to understand female anatomy, you need to know how to rub a clitoris, how to use the how to massage the G spot. And we'll talk about that briefly, I guess, which I mean, all of that's demonstrated in great detail in MLM as well. But like, you know, you've probably all seen this technique, right? This one for making a girl squirt. It's not a secret. It was at some point. It's not a secret. Everyone knows that. But most of the time, it doesn't work. Right? Most guys, they try that and the girl doesn't squirt. Now, it doesn't mean she didn't orgasm, like she doesn't always have to have liquid come out for it to be a pleasurable thing. But for many, for many women, like that's, that's the last thing I would do. Like, that's dessert. That's me finishing her off, like to make her squirt. I'm not doing that when I first finger her because she's not warmed up, loosened up, not psychology in the space where me going aggressively, like fucking ripping her pussy open basically is a hot thing. Whereas 20 minutes, 30 minutes, 40 minutes later, it totally would be. So, you know, my first touch on the pussy is, is just a compress, right? Like over clothes, maybe I run down, I just squeeze, compress, which would be kind of the equivalent of someone just squeezing your hard dick, which would feel good, right? But it wouldn't get you off. Right? So it's that kind of thing. Then I move into broad circles with no no specifics, then I start to zero in on the clitoris, then I start to intensify and I'll then use verbal communication to find the right spot. Because if you don't know a girl well, it's not easy to just intuit the exact point on a clitoris because some girls like if you got the clitoris here, if I come from underneath and I touch on the hood, some girls that'll be way too sensitive, some girls love it. Most girls will be over the hood of the clitoris, right? And then I'll be like, flicking or doing circles where a flick is the standard kind of move that will stimulate the girl, but I communicate it. So I say, you know, as I'm moving from general strokes, general strokes, to more specific strokes, then when I get onto the clitoris, I'll say, is this good pressure on the clit? Or do you need more or less? Right? So I don't just say, is it good? I give her option to improve, right? Is this the right spot? Do you need more or less pressure? So then if she's like, mm, any mm, like anything other than yes, that's right. Yep, that's it. Keep doing that. Shut up. Anything like, mm, that means you're not quite on the right spot. You're almost probably right. So then I'll say, use your hand, show me exactly the right spot. So she puts her hand on top, she moves me a little bit, puts me on the right spot. And then I start circling. I say, okay, how's this pressure anymore? Is this good? She says a little more or that's good. Cool. Now I've got the spot. Now I've got the speed. Now I've got the, the pressure. So in those like two or three sentences of sexy dialogue, Oscar winning sexy dialogue, um, I now know her body better than most men who've ever been with her and ever will be. Cause they don't, cause they don't know how to say those words or they don't care. I don't even know what clitoris is. Right. So that's, you know, that's how I then start to communicate. Same, you know, when I start to penetrate and I call up and I say, is that a good spot? Cause I'm finding the G spot. She's like, oh yes, that's it. Okay. And then I start doing these like upwards, upwards, semicircular. So that's like up and little circle on the top, on the top of the G G spot. So that's what I might be doing him initially to massage and start to stimulate the internal vaginal, uh, orgasmic response. Let's say, right. And I might build that up for awhile. Then I might penetrate and fuck her. Right. And then I might pull out at some point and go down on her and then put my thumb in and go down on her. Right. And then she's really warmed up and then cool. All right. I move into squirting and I build her up and I pop the cork. Right. So yes, the, the upshot of this is yes, there's lots of technical things to understand. And, but you primarily will understand them after you've got basic anatomy knowledge, you need to know outer labia, inner labia, clitoral hood, clitoral glands, you know, where the hole is, where the G spot is. And that's enough. I mean, you can learn about the A spot. You can learn about, um, mapping the inside of a pussy is more kind of more tantrically mapping a girl that's more advanced stuff, but like what the initial stuff, you know, if you know that amount of anatomy, then it's going to, and you know, the, the idea of the technique, which is broad to specific, gentle to heavier pressure, finding the right spot, finding the pressure and then doing, you know, mostly girls will come by you flicking the bean, right. Which is where you've built it up and you found the right spot. And then you're flicking with relatively heavy pressure, like kind of, it should flick over. And then I do that interdispersed with broader strokes sometimes. So it doesn't get overstimulated. You know, that, that will be commonly make a girl come sometimes. And often, like we've been fucking like some girls don't come easily. And we've been fucking for 40 minutes or something. And she's still not getting there. And, and I like have a break and then I sit back and jerk off. And I said, touch yourself, show me how you touch yourself. I might give her a vibrate. I might do it with fingers. That's great. Cause then I see how she masturbates might be different than I was doing it quite often is. And then, you know, I might come around and sit behind her and just put my hand on her hand. So I'm just feeling so I can really get a sense of it. And that's sexy too, right? To be kind of fingering her with her. So there's all these ways that we can start to communicate and get to know a girl very quickly, actually, you know, within minutes or within a night and map out a pussy and figure out what works for it. Right. And in this, cause Johnny Siporno once said, said when I was at a conference, one of Sasha's conference, how did he say, if you've got a move that you use on every girl and it always drives them wild, then every girl's been faking it. Right. So basically the idea is that there's a lot of pride in male sexual ability. And a lot of times men don't want to hear any, any, uh, feedback. And so women just fake it. They just put up with it. Cause like the guy thinks he knows what he's doing and it worked on his last girlfriend, but this girl's different and he's doing his move and she's like, ah, okay. Yeah. All right. You think that's great. And so like, it was a good takeaway that comment, because it's like, it's not, the answer is not learn this cool move and you go and you'll be a master. Yeah. You gotta learn the move, but the artistry comes in the ability to communicate it and adapt it to each individual girl. Then you can become a master of every pussy that you come across.
