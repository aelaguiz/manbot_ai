I am from far away. I live in Jamaica. Oh really? What are you doing here? No, I'm just kidding. Do I look Jamaican? Hey. Hi. Yes? You look great. I had to say hi. Hi. Thank you. What's your name? Alex. Can I see your eyes? Hi. Beautiful. Thank you. What are you doing today? I meet my girlfriend. About five minutes later. So we have five minutes. Yeah. That's enough. I'm going to the tobacco shop now. You're walking there? Yeah, I think there is some map. Okay. I'll walk with you for two minutes because I'm curious about you. Yeah, please. You're Hungarian, right? Yes. Where are you from? I'm originally from Austria. Austria. But I don't live there anymore. Yeah? No, basically no. Where do you live now? I was living in Budapest for a while. Yes. And sort of. Like, I travel half of the year, so I don't really live anywhere. But let's call it base Budapest. Yes. And now my base is in Kyiv, in Ukraine. And what are you doing here? Here right now. Not right now. But in general. I work on different projects. With YouTube content, basically. And helping companies grow on social media. So basically online marketing. And it seems like we're on a red carpet. Say hi. And what are you doing here? Waitress. Waitress. Do you enjoy it? Yeah, I love it. This is a really famous restaurant in Budapest. So our chef is, I think, the best in Hungary. Wow. So I really love it. So you must have been working really hard in other restaurants to get that job in that one, right? Yes. Prove yourself and show that you really... Yes, yes. Wow, that's cool. I love when people... Because, you know, a lot of people say, I'm a waitress, I hate it, da da da. But it kind of... No, I love it. Yeah, I love when people can give everything in any type of job. I appreciate that. That's cool. And is your job effective? Sorry, I'm just checking the tobacco shop. Don't worry, it's all good. Because I don't know where it is. Gosd\u00fa. You go to Gosd\u00fa? Somewhere else. But yeah, never mind. Which one, sir? No, no. Check your phone, that's good. Cool. I'll let you go in a minute. Ah, your friend is coming here? I think so, yes. Is your next goal to move to not the best restaurant in Hungary, but the best in the world? This is not my plan. Do you like living here? I enjoy here. I don't like moving. Why not? I don't know. I'm type of... You're a family person. That's good. Okay, you want to go? I need to go as well. You have a very beautiful present. And I would like to see you again. A ring, wow. Show me. Yeah, I have it now. Cool. Is that an engagement ring? Yes, it is. When is the marriage? In next year it will be. Because it got delayed? Yes, yes, we have to delay it. I hear it in your voice that you're like, oh, next year. Yes, yeah, it wasn't a good situation, but... It doesn't really matter. Yes, what can we do? What matters is that you have a good relationship, so... Yes. Cool. Then enjoy your day. Thank you, thanks. Bye. Nice to meet you, Alex. See you, Alex. So this girl obviously enjoyed my attention, which is fine. You know, she was engaged and still, you know, chatted with me. She obviously knew I'm here to pick her up. And that's okay. You know, some girls just enjoy getting some good vibes from a stranger without consequences. And I understand that and I totally accept that. So I don't have a problem with that. And I still stay really positive when she shows me the finger. I mean, not the middle finger, the ring finger. And that's cool. You know, I'm feeling better talking to her. She feels better talking to me. And that's a beautiful situation. So it doesn't matter at all. Hi, sorry. I just saw you come out here and you kind of had a cute vibe about you. Thank you. So I thought I'd say hi. Okay, thank you. What's your name? My name is... Are you in a hurry? Are you in a rush? Do you have a class or something? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm going to Pazman. You're what? Pazman. Pazman? University. Oh, cool. What do you study? What do you study? Chinese. No. Yes. Why would you do that? Because I like China. I don't know. Have you been to China? Have you been to China before? No, I haven't. But I wanna go. Are you planning to go to China or are you totally fine just learning Chinese without going there? I wanna see the Chinese view. Yeah, yeah. I wanna go to China. Okay, don't be nervous. It's okay. I'm just joking. I've been... Oh my god. I've been to China. Really? Yeah. But not that deep. I was in Shanghai a little bit. I was in Beijing. Was looking for opening a weird company for a project. It's definitely a strange place. And I guess... Do you think about business also when you speak Chinese? Like, so you can work in companies and stuff like this? It's interesting. Is it? Why? I don't know. You have been in Shanghai. Oh, this is interesting, yeah. I guess. It's dangerous to just list places where you go. Like, I've been to there and there. And then you haven't really been there. You know what I mean? Like a lot of people, they just travel just to be able to say the name. What was your favorite place to go? I don't know. I don't know. I have a lot of favorite places. For example, Budapest. I really like Budapest. You're so lucky because you're already here. Yeah. Seems like everything is going well in your life. Why are you so cute? I don't know. You have... Ah, never mind. Sorry, but I'm busy, so I... I must go. Why are you still standing here if you're so busy? Why are you still standing here if you're so busy? I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. I like you and I want to meet you maybe tomorrow or the day after for a drink or a coffee. Sorry, but I have a boyfriend, so... What would he think about that? I think he would be angry if I meet other guys, so sorry. Especially guys like me? Your English is not so good, yes. How long have you been with your boyfriend? How many years or months or days? Day? And how old are you? Cool. So then what we're gonna do is we're just friends on Instagram. That's okay. Okay. Do you have your phone? And when you go to China, I see it on your stories and I write, Ni hao. Oh no, wait. Okay. In China, Instagram does not work, right? Yeah, I know. Alex. Over the ocean. Yeah, first one. Okay. You can go now if you want. Bye. Have a good day. Bye bye. Hi. You look like a picture. Like the bridge and then the background and the sun. I like your hair, it's so nice. I like it. I like it. I like it. I like it. I like it. I like it. I like it. I like it. I like it. I like it. I like it. I like it. I like it. Looks really cool. What's your name? Hi, Alex. I'm just having a little bit of a walk and I saw you and thought might as well say hi. I'm surprised you can just sit in the sun like this. I'm like sweating. It reminds me of my university time. Which is funny because during university, you're kind of like, Oh, I can't wait to be done with university and go into the real life. And then after university, you're like, I was pretty chill. Not back, but you appreciate the things you had that you don't have now anymore. You know, like a bit more freedom in a way. Well, in certain ways. Where are you from? Austria. And are you working here? Yeah. Yeah, I'm working here. I'm on and off. I work in different countries. Usually with my company, I travel a lot, but obviously this year I travel less. But I still travel, so it's okay. What are you doing? I help with online marketing, you know, filming stuff, Instagram, YouTube, stuff like that. I'm interested in marketing, so. What is it about marketing you like? I study marketing, so I... I'll try to see them as a weird thing. Wait, I get too close to... You do study marketing? Yeah. And I, in the future, I want to jump with online marketing. Maybe. But I like it. It's interesting how to... How to save time, but manipulate people to buy something or... Oh my god, are you... No, it's just interesting, I think. I agree. I love it. It's funny to hear it like this. It makes you feel powerful when you can turn someone off. And then people make decisions based on this. It's true. I watched this documentary about social media the other day. And that's kind of what they're doing, you know. They're trying to give you exactly what you want to see in the exact moment. So you spend as much time possible on their platforms. Which is a bit worrying, but I always have the attitude of, you know, things are how they are and everybody should decide for themselves how they're using something. You just have a walk right now? Rest? Me time or something? Me time, I guess, yeah. How long do you stay here? This time I stay a month. But I'm always coming back. And I have friends here and my boss has an apartment here also. You do a lot of beautiful things. Yeah, I love the city. It's absolutely gorgeous, especially when it gets darker. The people, you know, I have this fantasy sometimes to replace all Hungarians with Colombians. And then I wonder how the city would be. But yeah, you could stay, you're cool. Everybody except you. You'd be the only Hungarian in a Colombian city. Can you see the bright side of things? Yeah, yeah. I think life is beautiful and I think I don't have time to see the bad things, so. You think life is too short to spend it with negative thoughts? Yeah. I think so too. That's a good attitude. Because you could see everything positive and you could see everything negative. So might as well, you know, not waste time making yourself desperate. Sure, sometimes you have shitty days and things suck. You can definitely manifest good things into your life and you can manifest bad things into your life. Yeah, right. That's nice. I like it. That's cool. Before you go, explain me what the tattoo means because it looks really cool. Yeah, it's a sun because of the positive side of life. I thought so for some reason. It's giving me energy, so. Very nice, it shines on you. Yeah. Well, you're really friendly. Do you want to go on a coffee one day? Maybe if I have time. I would love to do that when we both have time. Instagram? Sure, you want to add me? Enjoy your day. You too, it was nice to meet you. Bye-bye. Bye. Bye. This girl is relaxed. She's sitting at the river. She's enjoying the last few sunshines of the day. So I'm opening casually with a chill vibe. I'm saying you look like a picture, a bit creative. And I'm also keeping that vibe throughout the conversation. I'm not trying to be super high-energy because it just fits that frame and environment better. Now often, generally in conversations, it's dangerous to get too far into details, right? She's studying here. What is she studying? How many years? What university? Stuff like that. And obviously that's normal. That's small talk. That's chit-chat. And that's okay. That gives the conversation, you know, a certain framework and a certain base. But you want to shift it basically as fast as you can into a personal level. So I'm not asking exactly what type of marketing she wants to study or how many years she's already studying it. Or, you know, what chapter she is doing right now. Although I studied marketing, so I could totally, you know, exchange very logical information on that. No. Instead I ask her, oh, why do you enjoy it? Oh, are you that kind of person? Oh, is it fun for you to manipulate? Oh, is that how you see the world? And so on. And then even when I share things about myself, again, factual, I bring it back to how it made me feel and how I see the world on a broader spectrum. How, you know, what affects my emotions? What are my motivations? What are my triggers? What drives me? What makes me sad? And so on. So I'm always trying to bring the things I'm saying and the thing she's saying to a personal level. Now another little funny moment in this was me sitting down next to her. Before I was just kneeing because I don't like the, you know, setup where I'm looking down on her all the time. So I'm lowering myself and then I'm like, okay, a bit of a weird seat, but I will sit next to her. And then I kind of move into her and make a joke. So like, oh, I'm sliding into you. I touch her a little bit with my hips, but then I'm backing off again. It's just a tiny sign of, you know, again, making sure, yes, I'm a guy. You're a girl. I'm seducing you. This is a romance. I like touching girls. I'm not afraid of it. It's just those tiny messages that I'm sending throughout the conversation to keep it seductive, to keep it, to keep the polarity of man, woman, you know, meeting each other. Otherwise, it's dangerous that it turns into a friendly chat of friends and that's that. So it's those tiny things. It's like, you know, spice and salt that you put on top of your food sometimes that makes it taste really good. You don't have to be the sexual guy all the time, but it's good to throw it in here and there. Hello, excuse me. It's very strange to approach you here, but you have such a cool style. And you're very busy. I thought I'd say hi anyway. What did you buy? All your body needs. What's your name? I'm Alex. Am I supposed to wear a mask in here? I'm not sure because it's kind of close, but kind of far. Now that I look at you, I get paranoid. I think you'll be fine. He's not wearing a mask, but he looks a bit crazy. So maybe, maybe I'm not that crazy. I hope. I don't know. I think until Friday, you won't get fine if you don't wear a mask at those places. After that, I'm not sure. I'm living on the edge. Where are you from? I am from far away. Very far. I live in Jamaica. Oh, really? What are you doing here? No, I'm just kidding. Do I look Jamaican? No, but you never know. Yeah, you never know. No, I'm from Austria. I lived here for a while and now I'm just, I'm always moving around, but I'm here for a project for a while. Oh, so you are not a tourist? No. You wouldn't even be able to cross the borders right now? It's possible. Like I've actually, usually I travel like every two weeks. Like last year it was crazy and this year not as much, like way less, but still you can travel if you're smart about it and if you know the rules and sometimes you have to fake a document or so. Oh. No, it's not that I would, but just as a tip. Yeah, okay. I have school, so I can't really travel anyway. What do you study? Economics here at Corvinus University. Alright. I'm at my master's actually. I'm just studying. Did you do your master's because you didn't know what to do after your bachelor's or you thought I might as well do a master's? Kind of, and also like education is free and you know, you also get a scholarship so like on top of the tuition fee and I have a job, a student job which I wouldn't be able to do if I wasn't doing my master's. You can show me your face first. Yeah, I can actually, beautiful. Okay, so yeah, that's about it and also student life is kind of, so it's good that I enjoy it and I'm not really for the just working stuff yet. You, not yet, you're not ready. No, not yet. That's good. Walking at the university reminds me when I was in uni, I was like, I can't wait to work all the time. Really? Yeah, and now I do work all the time and now I'm like, ah, it was kind of nice. What did you study? I studied marketing and sales. And do you work in that area? Yeah, sort of. I mean, to be honest, I still work in marketing. I have to understand online marketing a lot and you know, yeah, internet stuff and I didn't learn it a lot in school but I just wanted a degree to make my dad happy, I guess. No, it was fine and I had a good time and I could work during the studies. I like doing many things at once. Wow, cool. And because of your work you are at a project here? Yeah, I am. I work for a YouTube channel. Really? Yeah. Your own YouTube channel? No, I help different companies grow more, you know. Is it like a big name? No, no, it's just I help businesses get more clients and get more leads and be more efficient and stuff like that. Is it like advertising? Can I take a picture of you with my phone because it looks so beautiful? No, absolutely not. I will delete it if it's bad but trust me it looks amazing right now. No, actually I'm doing it by this time. Okay, wait, come over here. What was your last question? Do you like to do Facebook ads? Yeah, stuff like that. And those pixel stuff? Yes, the pixel stuff. I've heard about it. Yeah, that's one thing, yeah, basically improving. And I'm very passionate about, and it sounds nerdy, but I like system thinking. Like when I walk, even when I, you know, walk into a restaurant, I'm like, oh, if they would change this and position this here, then my mind is like, wants to improve things all the time. And then I do the same with businesses. So like, I see problems and I like to fix them and I like to save people time, you know. That's cool because usually people have to spend hours, days, and just to think about the ideas. There's people already, right? Yeah, like it's personality types, like different people have different strengths. Do you know the test where it's like 16personalities.com? Have you done that before? I don't know. It's really cool. You answer 100 questions and then you get a type and you can read about it. Out of 16? Out of 16. And obviously they're a bit intertwined, but you can read your strengths, your weaknesses, how you are in relationships. It's really cool. If you ever... I'm gonna look it up. What kind of person are you, like more organized or you live in chaos? Oh, no, I'm more organized, but I'm not that creative. So, for example, for me, it would be more difficult to come up with new ideas. I'm really efficient in doing things that I'm told to do. And I'm a bit lazy in that respect. I would rather just go for something that's already made up rather than just made up by me. I like your honesty. It's good to know. It is what it is. I can build a system and I'm the boss and then I give it to you and you follow it and you work it out. But at least I can do that because there are, for example, I know people who just simply can't stand being told what to do and that can be a problem. That is true. And also if someone doesn't like monotonous things, but there are things in life that are monotonous and you still have to do it. And I'm fine with it. Me too. Yeah, there's people who are like, they are entitled to think they always need to do something new all the time and they shouldn't, but then they're also not creative enough to come up with creative stuff and create projects. I know what you mean. Yeah. I like that you know yourself. It seems like maybe you don't have to do the test. You already know yourself. Beautiful. You have a good energy. Really? I'm not sure if I know what that means, but thanks. Do you feel energy? Like, do you feel I have a good energy? Yeah. Okay, so we are matching energy. Maybe we should call it like that to some degree. I want to see you for a coffee when you're not busy. Okay, so I have a boyfriend. I don't know what are your purposes. I really like meeting new people and I'm really open, but your boyfriend would not like it. I mean, I don't want to be your boyfriend, but yeah, you're sexy and that's why I talked to you. That's cool. Yeah, actually he's the one that I was talking about that he never likes what to do and he's also in online marketing and photography and stuff like that, so we are really different. He's an entrepreneur or has his own business? Kind of. He's at my age, so he's very young. He's in the beginning of his career, I guess. Let's be friends on Instagram. You're very cute. How old are you? 22. You can add me. And then we'll see. You seem very friendly and open, so it's good to know people like that. But I respect you have a boyfriend. Don't worry, I'm not gonna sneakily try to like show. That's a problem with guys, right? They act like friends, but really they want to date you. Did you make that experience in your life? I'm always really naive about that. Oh, the internet doesn't work. Do I have to turn it on? Oh, right. Just turn it on. It's the opposite direction. Oh, that's one of the problems. Yeah, what were you saying? You made that experience before? I'm always really naive, so I don't assume any bad things until it doesn't happen. But don't you have any intuition if a guy is like... Sometimes, yes. I'm really good with being familiar with guys and stuff like that. I have four brothers and no sisters. Damn, you have a whole bodyguard team around you. Yeah, it's really cool. Okay, that's me. I will see your name pop up. Yeah, okay. What's your name again? Well, nice to meet you. Yeah, you too. It's good chatting. You too. Enjoy your day. Bye-bye.
