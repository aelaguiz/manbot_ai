We get very stimulated by certain drugs that our brains can produce. Dopamine being one of the main ones. Now you're all probably familiar, you know, if you were to chart back your search history, if you go back that far and look at what did you first search for maybe when you were a teenage boy, it might be big boobs, blonde or something like that. And then into, okay, what else is out there? All right. And now we're, we're needing more and more extreme acts and more and more repetition or variation again, in order to get that cheap hit. Right? Because now if you were to go back to what it was that you innocently first searched for as a teenage boy, it probably wouldn't do it for you. Right? And so you can see that this can, you know, lead you into more and more extreme, uh, types of porn. And it can eventually, you know, lead you into really deviant stuff that you're not, that you were never really."}
