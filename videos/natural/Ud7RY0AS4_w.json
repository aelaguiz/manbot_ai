So yes, this is day one, we're getting into the fundamentals of kink, of what sex can be aside from just friction and penises going in vaginas, to understand this from a sensual level through to a dominance, through to trance, through to partner engagement, communication. So we're really looking at sexuality as a really broad spectrum of human experience because if you're able to tap into even just some of the more subtle or extreme elements, then you set yourself apart as a very, very rare lover. And that's what we intend to do over the next seven days, turn these guys into sex gods. Alright, so what makes a good spank? Positioning. Basically, if I can feel her hip bone here, place my hand, this is our primary area of spank. We can spank on the thigh, upper thigh, and you will, but it's different, you probably won't do it as hard and that skin can kind of sting more, whereas this area here is your sweet spot. So the way that I'm going to teach you to spank is very, very loose through all the joints because a bad spank comes if I try to use force from my shoulder because I can't feel very much sensitivity, I'm not really aware of what I'm doing and I'm probably going to hit with too much force and it won't be the right type of force. It'll be a pushing force or like a compressing force, which doesn't feel good. So the force that I'm going to use is relaxed and what happens is, ideally, what I want is that impact is spread across the whole surface at once. That's why we get a good spanking sound because it all impacts and spreads in one second. If I'm rigid in my hand, I won't be able to do that unless I get perfect cup shape and go like that, but we're not working with that, we're working with... So for now, don't worry about that so much. What I want you to focus in on is a looseness in the wrist and we can just literally just do this. So we're just letting it drop just to get the sense. Don't worry about the power. I don't want to hear people thudding it down. There's no point until we get our technique correct. So we can just start, create the structure a little bit in my hand, but it's just I'm allowing gravity and correct flexing to make that impact. Okay, does that make sense so far? Now as she bends over, we need to be more careful about, because when she's lying flat, I can spank down here. I mean, I can still, of course, but I need to be very conscious that that's where I'm going to be hitting or under the cup. So under here, down into the thigh, here and here. So there, there and there. So from here, as I'm getting, now I'm getting a swing and the swing, previously we're doing it, we're just allowing gravity to drop. Now I'm getting a swing through my hip. Okay, so good spank? Yeah. Okay, so how much effort is that? It's literally this. Really? Yeah. That's what I did. Okay. So my arm is completely, completely loose. And if I want to increase it, I'm just letting, getting more swing in. All right, so because if guys are doing this, all right, you're using way too much power. It's not going to feel good. It's not going to have the great slap. And I mean, I'll do a bad one. You can, so you can feel the difference. All right. Makes sense. I'm going to show you some more advanced techniques, different types of slaps later, but now we're just going to work with that. Mostly I'm letting it just bounce off, but a cool one to do is the spank grab. All right. Yeah. She's all wet in the vag area. No, I'm not wet, but immediately like kundalini just came out of my throat. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So any questions or like, what happened? It was awesome. Okay. Before we wrap up today, we just want to play out one scene. You're all going to have a role play scene and to keep it simple, we're just going to make it the good old classic teacher and student dynamic. And you can work out whatever narrative happens within that. But basically she's in trouble. She didn't do what she was supposed to do. And then, okay. So when she's like, when, when it's time to punish her, then you can set her in position and this, you can use your voice commands here, set her into position and, and then don't get, because sometimes we see this in the scenes, guys get too excited too early and they're just fucking hammering away at the girl. So remember if we're in our scene, like even if we're in the space and like, come here young lady, you've been very naughty, turn around, hands down, hands down, pop this filth out. You've been a very naughty girl and I'm going to have to give you 10, these don't count by the way, 10 nasty ones. And this is me in my scene, but I'm also, here I am doing my warmups and getting my striking. Okay. So if I'm starting with a new butt and new situation, I need to figure out, okay, it has this shape and has this consistency and you've been very naughty and then I can give her a good one. What's the role play? Do you have any ideas of a storyline? Um, yeah, I caught her having a gangbang with the football team. Uh-huh. What about something a little bit more innocent than that? Which is? Just do it. You caught her trying to look at the boy's dicks in the, in the toilets. So she's just looking through a peephole or something. Okay? Okay. So she's a naughty little girl and you're trying to discipline her because she's obviously very horny and crazy, but you need to teach her to not be such a horny little girl. I caught you looking into the boy's bathroom. They can't be tempted by this little fiery redhead distracting them. They need to focus on their football game. But you can't see what they're using because they're horny all the time. No. Stop. Stop. There's a barrier here. Okay? But I just can't handle it. I can't control myself anymore. This behavior is inappropriate. I'm going to need to handle this situation because what you're doing is completely inappropriate. It's just me or is it getting steamy in here? She really got into the scene and even though, even though we were playing, like it felt really genuine and authentic and juicy and real. And there's definitely, we were playing, but there's some, you know, real kind of fucking feelings and emotions and things going through my body right now. So if you can't tell, I got a big smile on my face. So that was, and it was just a lot of fun to play a scene and play characters and have fun and kind of lose the, lose the like inhibition of what we can or can't do and just fucking go to town and have fun and go crazy. And at the end of it, have a big hug and a smile and you know, everybody's, everybody's good. Everybody had a good time. And we continue on with our merry lives. What's the difference of leading the girl out of that lockage, which is a person initial like, Whoa, what are you talking about? Or I'm didn't like that before. How do you lead her through that? How do you lead her through that without pushing, pushing, pushing is horrible. What's the difference of leading the girl out of that lockage, which is a person initial like, Whoa, what are you talking about? How do you lead her through that without pushing, pushing, pushing is horrible. What's the difference of pushing and leading? If I'm going to introduce basic tools to a girl who hasn't seen this kind of stuff before, usually what I do is we've been, we've been playing, I've done a bit of testing. She likes a little spank and then I'll tell her for the next 10 minutes, I want you to do exactly as you're told. And if there's anything that you don't like, you would just say mercy. Okay. All right. And that's like my truncated version of the whole consent thing. Yeah. I've heard the word twice in my life. Just they don't, they will never say it. So all right. Okay. In that case, come over here, put your knee, this one up, next one up, bend over and arch your back like back, like a cat. Okay. So I've given very clear instructions. We'll be looking more at this in terms of giving orders. And then from out of one of my drawers in my room, I pull this out. And then to the uninitiated, this looks very scary. This looks like an implement of torture. It's actually very soft. So what I do is I pull this out and then often I get a micro nonverbal, I get the, the, this terrified. What's that? Or I get that. Yes, please. And then she just puts her head down. All right. So if I pull this out and I hold it and she looks and goes, Oh yeah, that's that time. So what do you have to do? Look at the eyes? Yes. So, so what I'm looking first and I go, and then I hold this up and I'll say something like, don't be scared. Touch it. It's very soft. All right. And so I get it, touch it. And then I'll, and I'll just do something like this. All right. So I just, and if she's lying down or whatever, it's like, I give her a sense of it. And then I'll just do this. Okay. And then I'll just do this. All right. So I get it, touch it. And then I'll, and I'll just do something like this. All right. So I just, and if she's lying down or whatever, it's like, I give her a sense of, okay, this is, this is a touch and I'm going to start this. It doesn't, it looks nasty, but it's not, and it's not going to hurt, but I'm going to give you a little spanking and you're going to take it and be a good girl. And I'm still, I'm registering. Okay. Now she's at the, uh, okay. I'm going to do, I'm going to accept it. And I just don't know what's happening. So that's when the first hit is really going to be just this. So that's not bad, is it? So you can handle it. Yes. All right. Well, in that case, and then I'll say, like, if I'm going to use some restraints, so this looks innocent, although it's not really, but then I'll say, you know, and I'll take this and I'll say, you know what? I want to, I want to tie you up with this. I'm just going to put it over your head and you relax. I didn't need her to say yes to every single thing, but I'm checking in as I put that over. She's like, oh shit. Well then I'm just going to leave it there. And then let her, you know, chill out, but, and I'm not going to just, well, sometimes I just go straight into, okay, it's going to be very simple. I'm just going to do this and the shock bit is, is where we're going to put things in where she doesn't have time to comply, but I know that I'm going to do it in such a way that it won't, it's just going to go. She's going to be that. She's going to what? Oh yeah. That's done. Okay. And this can be part of the, you know, this can be part of the seduction. It's like here. All right. All right. You want to fight? Yeah. So, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then, you know, then I can give impressions of what this will feel like here. All right. So that's like the pseudo application here of what would be an actual tie. So in this, in a similar situation, you have a girl who's not giving you, um, clarity about it. Yes or no. But you can see that she's kind of tempted. I can't sit there and drill her to like, okay, is it a yes or is it a no? Come on. Let's make a decision. So it's like, yeah, cool. I see that she's like, I'm not sure that's your job to go. All right. Well, help me. Let me help you be sure. Whilst giving you the option to say yes or no. At any point. Uh, the fact that you're cool with it, sometimes it means like a week later, a month later, she'd like send you a text. And she's like, I was thinking about that because her initial reaction is shocked just out of ignorance or because she thinks she's supposed to react that way because good, good girls don't do this. I've created, I've opened you to the potential that this space, you can explore things that previously you might not have, not because you didn't want to necessarily, but because you're worried about the judgment or what that meant about you as a person. So it's like, if we can get a girl, uh, to navigate through a fear to her desire, then she'll often open up into things that she's previously would have never done before. Have you learned a lot of stuff you didn't know about? I've learned about safe vlogging. We're going to test that now to see if it works. James, what's going on? Oh, it's not what it looks like, Adam. Well, we're doing vlogging class today with our custom made beautiful vloggers, which is a powerful tool which creates a very strong psychological impact. It's actually very soft, so even though it sounds like a motherfucker, it's actually lovely. So, have you asked the girls how they feel about it? Really good. Good? I love it, it's my favourite, favourite cat. He's very cute, in good hands. Really, really sexy. Nice. Um, sexy. With somebody you can trust. Yes. Lucky. I'm scared. Is it good? She looks happy. You look too happy. Look at my butt. Oh wow. This is very different. That's hot. Very hot. I knew that. I knew that. Who hasn't experienced a girl, or making a girl squirt? Haven't. Okay. First rule of that game, is once you become very comfortable in speaking about sexuality with the girl, is to ask her one magical question. Do you feel like you need to piss during sex? The vast majority will say yes. That is the squirt. They've been conditioned to repress it. As well as their own embarrassment will stop them from exploring what that is. So if you get a woman who you've been able to ask that question, and she says yes, and she hasn't squirted before, you say, brilliant. That is this. So when we're having sex, if you feel this, tell me. And you just get her to push through. It can even be as simple as getting her to push and release it. Because it doesn't usually need the extra. It does help of course, but a lot of the times the girls won't need that extra fingering aspect to make it come out. So get to know the woman in that way. So I'll do a very quick discussion about squirting. First they're going to flip out. They're going to think it's piss. Obviously you comfort them and say it's not. If she hasn't said yes, I'm feeling like I'm going to piss now. How do you know she's ready to pop? Have you ever noticed the vagina expands? There's also an expansion of this way where it like balloons out. That's a high arousal point. When you've got that going on, make the magic happen. So the magic is this. Two fingers, usually these two, who doesn't know. It's in, you're pushing. It gets quite physical. You have to have a strong movement. It's in and up, like you're coming back. How far out of the fingers? If that's the vagina, it's like that. So it's like a grip. You keep going. You'll see it start to bubble and pops. It's essentially what we're pushing on is the female version of our prostate. Which lines the urethra. The urethra is here and that's the tube of the urethra. All around it is that gland. The scientific breakdown of what's in it, it's only like 2% at most actual urea. Which is the toxins that we expel. 98% of it is just like water and enzymes. She's worried and embarrassed that she's going to piss and it's going to make her look and feel shit. You're going to judge her and stuff. Every time I've taught someone to do it, it's the non-judgement. It's like, I don't care what happens. If you piss, so be it. It's alright. 99% of the time, that's enough. Just one sentence to say, if you piss, it's okay. One thing though, once you turn on the fountain, it doesn't turn off. I've actually had some girls complain that every time they have sex and it's off. Yeah, that's true. I've had girlfriends that you just have to wash the sheets every time you have sex and it's kind of annoying after a while. There is an actual process to get them ready for it if they're not used to it. So full body massage, focused massage and then getting a super horny.
