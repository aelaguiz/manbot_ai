Because I've taught spanking classes a lot, which is quite fun. So we have like six girls lined up, six dudes spanking, and the girls are like, yes, no, left, right. But that's the one thing that I've found guys actually struggle with the most to get correct. Because I've identified eight different types of spanks. But even the most basic, the most basic spank, most men actually are stiff in their hands. So when they're stiff, it's like wood, instead of being having a slap. Sometimes guys get away with it if the girl has a bit of a juicier butt, because you've got more margin for error then. But yeah, it's something that most men are not particularly good at, but it seems like most women like. Yeah, we do. I would say we absolutely do love it. Not too much, not too hard, but you can hit it right."}
