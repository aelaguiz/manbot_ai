Nothing more important. Juan just says, can you quickly restate the six mantras? Yes, okay guys, it's a mantra. My instincts are good. My intentions are good. They are to give, to share, and to receive in pleasure. All the pleasures men and women have together, from simple hellos to amazing conversations, to mind-blowing sex, to love, to babies. My instincts are good. My intentions are good. First two mantras. Sometimes they're misunderstood. Not everybody's picking up when I'm putting down. Maybe her medication's off today. Maybe I was miscalibrated. Maybe her hormones are up. Maybe whatever. My instincts are good. My intentions are good. Sometimes they're misunderstood because I'm not for everyone. So that's all one mantra. I'm not for everyone. Thank God Almighty. Thank all the angels because now I can just be free to be me beyond the disgusting desperate need for other people's approval. My instincts are good. My intentions are good. Sometimes they're misunderstood. I'm not for everyone. The fourth mantra is, I've got a job to do, man. It's my job to take every single risk from hello to will you marry me? From hello to transitioning into a conversation, to the first touch, to setting up a date, to having the date, to saying, hey, will you be my girlfriend? It's my job to initiate that chain of events all the time with every woman for all my life in every situation. Accept it. There's no way out. It's not personal. Number five, it's not personal. It's for you to go up and be attracted to a woman, to talk to a woman, to, I want to fuck a woman, to want to love a woman. It's as personal as a bird flying south for the winter. It's as personal as the wind blowing. That's it. It's as personal. So I say, birds fly south for the winter, the wind blows and boys talk to girls. Get over it. And really who you're telling to get over it is all these little voices in your head. You have like an old man leering at you from a bench saying, this is a bad man. You have your inner feminazi saying, you're not supposed to talk to girls. You have all these characters and you're just, you're reminding him that this isn't personal. This is just nature. And instead of resisting nature, I'm aligning with nature. I'm going to repeat the first five very quickly. My instincts are good. My intentions are good. I'm not for everyone, thank God almighty. I got a job to do, man. It's not personal. In fact, it's the most important job in the world. It's the job of the connector. And every time you approach any woman or anyone, you bring the possibility of two human beings connected. Nothing more important. So there you go. Nice, excellent. Tattoo those on your ass or somewhere, put them somewhere where you can access them daily. Good day, gentlemen, and a happy new year to you wherever you may be. Now, if you'd like to make 2023 the year where you sort out your dating life, then you might want to consider joining myself and the team for our first live seduction workshop coming up from the 4th until the 9th of April in sunny Barcelona, where myself and the TNL team will be taking a brave crew onto the streets to teach them the fine science and art of natural style seduction.
