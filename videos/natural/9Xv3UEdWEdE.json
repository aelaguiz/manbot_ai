You're in your own ideologies You're in your own thought processes all the time. You're not really able to interface with alternative viewpoints or to actually absorb information and stimulus Objectively, this means that it's very hard to apply any other natural game principles How do I apply the right amount of pressure on a girl and know when's the right time to release it? If I'm not reading her signals because it's not like I say apply pressure for six seconds Hold for three seconds and then release pressure for five seconds Every 35 seconds within the conversation don't know and write that write that down, please That's just a silly example. So because in real seduction or real interactions, everything is free form You're dealing with all these unknowns and variables the woman. You don't know her. You don't know how she's going to respond or react She's not a robot. I'm sorry, so you can't press buttons and program her of course these patterns of human behavior and there's all sorts of aspects of You know female sexuality and female nature that tend to be fairly consistent But we're dealing with individuals and we're dealing with all sorts of variations, which we don't have control over How do we navigate through that? Well the old-school pickup Answer to that was to have such an a massive routine stack and all these techniques that you could have something ready for Every scenario now, I don't think that's very realistic and even if it is it sounds like a whole lot of work to me I don't have to memorize 67 Variations on how to say hello. I just want to be able to project my intention and then respond and Calibrate and adjust to the needs of the situation. And how do I do that? I do that through my awareness practice so the truth is that there is a There there is no delineation really between internal and external awareness at the end of the day, it's just awareness It's the it's the permeation of this quality of Experiencing life in a way that has way less filters or masks or Interpretations put on top of it The truth is that none of us get to experience life completely objectively Right because we are limited by our sense organs. Okay, I can see But there's all sorts of frequencies of light that I can't see. All right, I can hear but there's different types of sounds which I am not aware of because my sense organs just don't pick up on certain aspects, of course as You know lights coming into my eyeballs It's getting it's getting filtered and rearranged and then interpreted by my brain and put back together into images Is this actually the reality that I'm experiencing or is it my interpretation of the reality to some extent? We are limited by our sense organs. However There is a massive difference between the way people experience life Right. So on one end of the spectrum, you can have somebody who has an Incredibly rigid mindset that they've let's say they've been brought up with They've taught to believe that the world is this way. It was created by this deity in this many days That you know men and women's natures are fixed and essential that you know Certain races are better or worse than others or that this God is better than that God Or this the teachings of this person or this tradition are Totally sacrosanct and cannot be argued with you know, you have someone with very very extreme viewpoints This means that they cannot be even close to objective, right? Because they already have very very clear attitudes and opinions and judgments about certain things So that if someone comes to them with a counter viewpoint, they shut it shut it down And we see this with all types of sectarianism or all types of isms where people are very very committed to their beliefs All types of isms where people are very very committed to being a something-ist and As a result they negate all other possibilities or the only way they interface with them is by going to war with them to try and prove Their own positions so that they get to feel awesome about being right Which is nice to be right, you know, it's a nice feeling and people will chase that their entire lives But in my opinion what's more important than being right within a small subjective reality is to be able to allow Much more of the actual truth or the objective reality in and to be able to interface negotiate and communicate with it This becomes incredibly important when we're looking at seduction, right? So on the base level when I'm teaching awareness to people, it's firstly about you, right? So I take students out into parks on my workshops and we we go through many of the The techniques which I teach in the martial meditation methods, so these are mindfulness meditations stretching and embodiment Different types of breath control. So all of these did yeah, that's cool, man. You're really funny What happens is when you're first working with these in this level of internal awareness? What this allows you to do is to start to look at yourself Without so many opinions, right? So to be able to turn turn the lens back on yourself and To to inhabit a different type of personality or a different type of perspective because the problem is when I'm inside my brain And I'm thinking thoughts and I'm looking out through those thoughts and it's very hard for me to separate myself from them right, so it's I get the Experience that what it is that I'm thinking and this this narrow viewpoint that I have is my is reality, right? It's my personal reality now that could be fine if you were Incredibly positive and like everything in your mind you interpret as That the world is trying to reward you for being so awesome and I know people like that Liam Liam McCray is an example of that this is a guy who Has a lot of mindsets which objectively We would say are not true But subjectively they assist him right so he believes that when he's interacting with women that they all want to have sex with him or he interprets any Misfortune that happens in his life. All right. So he recently had a situation where he tipped a tub of coconut oil onto the floor of a very expensive Airbnb and As a result he had to pay something like five thousand euros to for them to rip up the floorboards to replace the floorboards So a total disaster, right? It's like just lost five grand because of one two dollar tub of coconut oil, which we all have all around the house It is a it is a hazard in the natural lifestyles households too many Open tubs of coconut oil and this was bound to happen eventually someone was going to get hurt and those floorboards got decimated So most people would complain about that for the rest of their life. I would I'd just be like cool that I'm gonna save that Anytime I feel like having a good complaint. I'll be like, let me tell you a story Back in the too early 20 teens spilt some coconut five thousand dollars, which was a lot of money back in those days Yeah, I would be complaining to my grandchildren about that. Probably for Liam. He's he instantly was like Reinterpreting that as this is this is really good money mindsets because it's like I want to be so rich that it doesn't matter If I like knock over a tub of coconut oil on the hour This was inspiration to him to it's for a good reason to Continue his effective money mindsets and to accrue wealth because knowing that as he goes and makes wins Which he does so often that you're going to take hits along the way and that there's no risk-free life. Cool, man Oh, that's really really fun So on the one hand having delusionally positive mindsets This can be let's say a useful thinking technology however However What I think is more important is to be settling to more of an objective reality space, right? So when I first am teaching meditation, I'm teaching it for the benefit of the the student to start to understand himself better What is it that triggers you what and when I say trigger? I'm not talking about it in some moralistic sense. I'm talking about Do you get activated? All right. So how are your are your emotions volatile? Are there certain things that if a woman says to you or looks at you in a certain way that you crumble or you get really tense and stressed the dreaded approach anxiety Put a fast shout out the dreaded approach anxiety Is not a disease It's not it's not something that some people have and some people don't that some people are just born naturally confident and able to interface with Strangers and other people have this anxiety that kicks in every single time that they have to talk to a particularly an attractive girl Approach anxiety as I've talked about this many times is a learned response and it's something where we are misinterpreting signals All right, so you're getting you're feeling the pressure or and the expectation of needing to Interact or communicate with a girl You're very concerned and worry about her potential judgment what she might think of you What this means about your value as a man right, so so much so many of the times men give the authority to a woman to make a judgment and Essentially decide whether you are fuckable or not or whether you're a worthwhile male or not We that's what you're doing Every time you go up to a girl and you try and approach her and it doesn't go well and you feel this collapse And you feel bad about yourself and your worthiness your sense of manhood and your your you know sexual desirability and so on What you've done is you've given authority to a stranger who doesn't want it to make a snap judgment And then you have internalized that and taken it on board as truth Right, which is kind of silly right because if you went up to somebody on the street and you said hey, man I was just thinking about my tax return this year. I was wondering whether I should do this or this and he's like Yeah, you should do that you wouldn't I don't know or do the opposite You wouldn't be taking advice and teaching taking judgment from a random stranger about a topic that they had no knowledge on So she doesn't know whether you are good in bed whether you're an interesting person whether you have an amazing heart and soul whether you're you know a Demon in the bedroom or whether you've got some mad magic skills or whatever. She doesn't know that all she knows is okay There's a random guy. I'm not interested in dealing with a random man right now or just from the look of him I don't want to deal with this or I've got a boyfriend or I don't talk to guys on the streets And then she blows you off and that's it now when you when you're someone who is fairly balanced internally You can let that roll off you now I'm not saying that I am a hundred percent unaffected by every rejection that I get but if a girl harshly rejects me I'll still feel things right so I will still have Some kind of physical internal reaction the difference is from some some of my students What Just fuck off cocksuckers All right This is stag party central We've had three stag parties come and try and start fights with me Because they're running out of things to do with blow up in sex talks So the difference being that someone who has developed a sense of internal awareness and use meditative tools He's able to Be more calm under more circumstances, right? He's able to Not be a slave to reactive internal reactive behaviors, and what are internal reactive behaviors? frustration anger depression You know extreme embarrassment at situations that you don't have to be embarrassed at Feeling collapsing senses of fear and anxiety Right, so I've often talked about My opinion that the approach anxiety is not really anxiety. It's not a real sense of existential fear obviously humans have fear as part of our makeup for a very good reason because it keeps you alive when there's things you should be afraid of Because you run away from them but The truth is that it is not an existential threat for a girl pretty girl to say go away Yet most men act as if it is they have you know an exaggerated sense of fear I remember really really early on when I was first starting to dabble in teaching I met this guy in a bar in Prague. There's an American fighter pilot. He'd flown combat missions in Afghanistan So he'd risked death Daily for his job and we were chatting We're at a bar and I said, oh, let's go and talk to those girls and he froze like he's tensed grip grip the bar And he's like, oh dude, I can't do that. I was like, what do you mean? We're just gonna talk to those chicks. He's he's like, ah, man, that's really that's really like pushing it I said dude you are in war your job is to be in war where people want to kill you and you have to kill them like it's It's literally Like you were dealing with death on a daily basis and These chicks over there and he's like to be honest. I'd rather fly combat than go and talk to those girls So, you know, that's that's the the level of of absurdity that can happen is in terms of what's the objective risk? Versus the objective reward because we know that the possible objective reward of going and talking to a girl is is that she might Want to be your girlfriend, which could be cool Well, she won't might want to sleep with you or introduce it to her single friends Whereas the worst likely thing that's going to happen Is that she's going to tell you to go away or just kind of sniff in the air and walk on right? So We know like logically if you were a gambling man, you go Okay, that's a pretty good bet to do that compared to what's the the risk? So the reason that I still have a job is that even though I've told people this dozens of times on all sorts of media It still doesn't sink through to a lot of people and so they they seek out training because it's so difficult to make this jump from I get it logically to I need I can go and do it experientially and my job over the last 10 plus years has been to try and figure out ways to convince men to go and do what they want to do anyway. It's ways to trick and move through their resistances and their excuses and the big stories that they've created in their minds to get them to strip all that bullshit away and get it back to what is your instinct? What is your desire? What is your mission in life? Are you a fucking man? Are you alive? Are you going to go and take life by the balls and do something or are you going to sit on the sideline and wait to die? And I put it in those terms and I put it in gentle terms and I try and do it in every possible way and it gets through but it can't be really thought through, right? Logically accepting this and going, yes, this is fucking right, I feel inspired, you know, I want to put all that stuff aside, my fears, my doubts, my limitations and I want to go for what I want. I want to live a life of freedom, I want to live a life of choice, I want to live a life of abundance. Do you? Of course you do. How do you get you? Well, of course, there are steps you have to take, there's work but the shortcuts to the work is understanding how do your resistances work? Of course, there are external challenges and resistances to anything you want to do. The world is not going to instantly adjust to your desires. So it's not like we can change everything but we can certainly change our interpretation of life. This is where we come into an understanding of awareness, so an internal awareness which is where all the meditation techniques come into play, understanding yourself at a much deeper level and then this tipping point or this interface point between the external world. How do those things relate and do that? Let's look at that. The first area I'd like to look at in terms of this interface between internal and external awareness is the sense of separation that you have. Now human beings experience themselves as both separate from other people and the environment around them and under certain circumstances or certain mindsets or certain experiences they experience themselves as connected or part of. So everyone has had experiences of that. You may have been in a crowd at some point where everyone is at a soccer match or at a concert or a speech or something where everyone is in agreement, everyone is enjoying, everyone is sharing in the energy of the band on stage or the inspirational speaker or whatever it is and the sense of I am a discrete separate individual just by myself in this big city doing my thing is changed so that I feel I am part of a group energy and I feel there is a connection between me, there is a common language between me and the other participants. We have a sense of belonging and of course this is a very, very important thing and human beings need some sense of belonging and inclusion to feel good. This is why we form ourselves into tribal units, into sports teams, into political units, into all sorts of different divisions and it is also why we seek out intimacy with our sexual partners and with our friends and with our family because we don't like, as a species we don't like being completely separated from all people or from everything else. We don't like just being by ourselves in our own solipsistic world. There are very few people, hermits or people who go off into retreats who don't want to interface with people and don't have a deep sense of lack or longing if they don't have it. As human beings, as social mammals, as community-based organisms and as spiritual beings in the sense that we are experiencing our life as some kind of narrative which hopefully has some sense of purpose. I am not talking specifically about being religious or about being part of any specific tradition here. I am talking about the experience of being human that is other than just the I get up, I feed, I fuck, I sleep, I fight. All of the other aspects that make us into something that is less animal and more of an evolved consciousness. If on a very extreme level we have someone who is a sociopath or someone who hates people, and doesn't want to have anything to do with them, that's not where most people are going to exist. But when you come to certainly living in big modern cities where I don't know any of these people, they don't know me, we tend to have a sense of separation. It's me and the people I know and then it's all this other stuff, all these other people around and I feel separated from them. And I am. We need to keep that separation in some sense. My father lives in a very small town in Australia. Whenever I go there and you walk up and down the one main street, every person gives you a little nod or says, hey Peter, how's the truffles? He has to interact with every person. There's not many of them. Maybe there's 20 on the street at any given time. But there is no cultural separation because they all know him, he knows them and so you do have to interact with every person. It takes about an hour to get down the main street, which is all right if you do that, go into town once a week. In a big city like this, of course I can't interact with everybody. We deliberately set up separations to navigate. When I go into the coffee shop in the morning, even though I've gone to that same coffee shop every morning for months, I am not that friendly. I have to be honest. I'm really a cunt in the morning, it's true. And I'm not, I have very deliberately, and if they ever watch this, I'm sorry guys, I know you're lovely, but it's like I've deliberately set up a separation because when I go in the morning to get coffee, I don't want to deal with people yet. I'm not in the mood for having a chat. And if I get to know that person who I see every day, then I'm going to have to every day when I walk in waiting for a coffee, you go, hey man, and have a bit of a chat. I don't want to do that. My little bit of misanthropy exhibits itself before coffee time and I keep that division of like, okay, I'm a customer, you're the person serving me, I'm polite, but we're not going to. And then they're like, of course they think I'm a fucking weirdo because they're like, this guy comes in every morning and acts like he's never seen us before. This guy needs to go into a social freedom expert or go and see a dating coach or some social coach just to learn how to do the basics of being friendly to somebody that you've known for months. True. Very sorry. But in that situation, that's not what I do. Now, however, when I'm out and I have had coffee and I'm going out and I'm meeting people, I'm teaching or I'm going meeting girls, I'm very aware that the thing that's going to make this most difficult for me is if I perceive that person to be a completely separated other. That we have no relationship, we have no connection, that that is a discreet separate individual. I'm over here and I'm going to come over and I'm going to try and negotiate something to get into their space, right? To get into, and I don't even know what that space is. I'm not thinking in terms of like, what is she thinking or feeling or what's it like being inside her body or how does it feel if I come up to her really close or block her into the side of a wall or something. I'm not thinking that if I'm unaware, I'm thinking I'm inside myself and I'm going, okay, I feel afraid. I'm going to, I've got to do that stuff. What am I supposed to do? And I come up and I start a conversation with the girl and it's like, I'm several layers away from her because I'm inside my thoughts, I'm feeding my thoughts, I'm getting involved in them and they're not positive, they're negative and I'm calculating and trying to figure out a way to solve this problem of how do I deal with this adversary or this other that's in front of me. And then I want to go from there to, hey, you look really lovely, what's your name? It's like I'm changing four different gears to get there because I have to get out of my thoughts and then come back to here I am and then think about what I'm going to say and put my hand out and shake it and there's all these steps that I have to go through to go from feeling separated, completely away from this person to trying to start to create a connection. And people talk about this all the time in dating advice, creating connections. What does it mean to create a connection? It means to remove the barriers that are in the way of you being connected because human beings have a tendency to connect with each other, not all the time but it is part of what we do. We are able to communicate with strangers, men and women are attracted to each other generally and so it doesn't have to be such a big leap to try and bridge this gap. So this is where we look at the interface of internal external awareness. Instead of me being six layers up into my thinking and my stress and my anxiety and all this, if I am using my internal awareness to relax my physical body, to settle into the present environment, because right now it's like 32 degrees, it's really hot and I can feel the breeze on my skin, obviously I can feel the temperature, I'm in a quieter part of the city now finally, all the stag parties have gone off to lads, lads it up somewhere else. Maybe we should start making compilation videos of lads coming in and trying to do an annoying James Marshall. So there's a certain vibe and I hate to use the word vibe because it's such a cop-out hippie word, isn't it man? You just got to feel the vibe and half the people switch off. So let's not call it vibe but there is an atmosphere. When I'm in the middle of a crowded city, of course there's an atmosphere because there's so much movement, so much thinking, so much jostling, all these people who are not interacting with each other but are like obstacles to each other and so it creates a certain type of crowd tension or excitement or liveliness and then we move into a, let's say you walk into a chilled tea shop and people are sitting there reading their books and sipping tea and quietly working on their computers, of course this has a different atmosphere. The space becomes infused and I don't think that's just hippie nonsense, I think that we infuse spaces with energy. So if you've ever been to a place of great horrors, Auschwitz or some place where awful shit has happened, there is a sense that this place has got some fucking vibration here of all of the pain that's happened. If you're in a crowd that gets hyped up over time, at a concert for example, at first we're all just like people standing here, I came here to see Beyonce. I never went and saw Beyonce. I would totally. If Beyonce wants to give me two tickets to go and see Beyonce, I'll go, why not? But let's say you're at the Beyonce concert and everyone's lined up and they're just there and then Beyonce comes on and does her thing and fucking shakes it and does her badass booty stuff and people get involved. There's an energy that's created individually and then it bounces off each other and everyone's hyped up and next thing you know people are crowd surfing and throwing their panties or their jock straps at Beyonce and it's awesome, right? And then you come away from that experience feeling not just enlivened by the performance that you saw but the whole group energy, the infusion of this energy. That's what you're attempting to do one on one when you meet a girl on the street or wherever is to allow the barriers of separation which are the, I don't know you, I'm scared of you, I'm worried about what you're going to think about me and how you're going to judge me, I'm concerned about my worthiness as a man, she's worried about whether she's in danger or whether this is embarrassing for her or maybe she doesn't know what to say. These things going on in my world, in her world, they're not interfacing and they're causing us to have disruption. So true effective practical meditation techniques allow you to minimize these barriers so that if I'm not up in my head thinking all this nonsense and I'm in the environment, right? So my awareness has gone from being internal to now the surface of my skin and where does my skin and the atmosphere end? Well, I'll just presume it doesn't and then I allow myself to kind of feel out into the environment. Again, does that sound like hippie nonsense? Maybe but try it, see what it's like to imagine or just like permeate through the ground and into the atmosphere and into the other person and allow your senses to move that far. Because even if that's not actually happening on a scientific level, it's a really good attitude to have because it allows for the dissolution of separation. What is it that's so compelling about a man and a woman getting together and fucking each other is that it's this dissolution of the feeling of separateness. It's the going into somebody else or blending with somebody else to have a shared pleasure and shared communion. And where does your body end and hers begin? Is it my hand touching her or is it touch being experienced by my hand and her body? So if I see myself as separate and this extends on from into the seduction. If you're going on a date with a girl, you're back home with her and you're trying to get her into bed, that's an attitude of separation that presumes that she's different from me. She wants, I want something. I need to get her to do this thing. So I need to convince this separate human being to do something so that I can then have a shared pleasure using her body. That's a pretty disgusting way of looking at sex and what kind of pleasure could you get from that even if you do get to have sex with her? As opposed to can we dissolve her fears, my anxieties, allow these things to start to evaporate and just come together as humans touching, as humans looking each other in the eyes without judgment, without projection or if the projection is there, it's a very simple and powerful interactive projection. I project I want you, she projects come get me. I project relax and be safe with me and be in this moment and she projects maybe she has some resistance and she shows that I'm not ready, I'm a bit scared for that and then we have to interact with her current level of stress and so I can learn to negotiate. I negotiate in the sense that I feel you and then I adjust to make you feel better or to make you feel more comfortable so that we two together can feel amazing as this unit that we're combining. This is a way that meditation goes from being something that is a solo practice that is designed for your benefit and solo practice is integral, I do it every day, it's a really important thing. Hello. Yes, brother. Yes, what? You okay? What would you like? Camera. What would you like? Camera. Yes. What language do you speak? Yes. Whereabouts? Doesn't matter. What would you like right now? You came over here from the UK and you got drunk in the street and then you thought you'd go and annoy people. That's amazing. You're the first person that's done that. No, I'm not. No, you're not. Wizz Air ships over a thousand of you guys every day. Sorry. Well, good. You're the first person to apologize. No, I'm sorry. All right. See you, mate. Sorry. Right. And so, as I was saying, this goes from being..."}
