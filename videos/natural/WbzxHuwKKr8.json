It's The Shaman here coming to you from Budapest, beautiful Budapest in the park, representing the natural lifestyles. And I'm going to answer a question today, which is one of the most common questions that I'm sure many of you guys on this channel are curious about. And I'm going to give you my perspective, which hopefully will be interesting, on the answer. So the question is, how do I overcome approach anxiety? I'm still struggling to start conversations after years, years of watching, watching these videos, watching other videos, etc. So thanks for the question, and now let's get into the answer. So the answer of how do I get over approach anxiety, that thing, that big concept, that big scary wall that comes up when you want to go out and you want to talk to girls. Well, it's a great question, and there's quick and nasty answers. There are definitely things that you can do to get motivated fast, to get you moving in a way that will be more productive, and there's the bigger perspective. Now one model that I've used over the years when I've been training guys in terms of these kinds of tools, of building social skills and being more expressive, being more confident, having more choice, is this idea of in a game, out a game, long game, short game. Okay, so if we can imagine that you've got a cross section of in a game and out a game, and you've got the long and the short versions of both of those realities. Now, the situation of trying to approach a girl puts you on the spot. It makes you think, like, what am I going to say? Or how do I show value? Or how do I get her attention? Or how do I be attractive? Or how do I get the results that I really want to get? And in that moment, then you've really just got to fall back on whatever you've got at that moment. Like, what experience have you had? What kinds of references? What's your mood like? How do you look and feel at that time? And all of that will have a big influence on how you're able to respond in the moment. Now, I would say that's the short game, right? And in some ways, taking action, you know, going out there into the world, taking action, saying yes to social interactions is the outer game aspect of the equation. Whereas, you know, the inner game is mindsets, you know, the feelings, the sort of choices that you're making as you are going through the motions of those things. So the immediate reality of approaching a girl is about the short game. What are you thinking? How are you positioning yourself? What kinds of actions can you take? And that means both the inner and the outer aspect. So some tips on that, just quickly while we're here, is think about the positive outcome that you would like to achieve. So obviously, the real reason that you would like to talk to her is because you like her, because there's some attraction. There's something happening in your body and in your mind in the way that you're seeing her and the way that you're feeling that's causing a desire to want to be close to her, to want to find out more, etc. That's really the primary drive that is pushing you to want to take action. But then, of course, there's a kind of a counter drive that comes in, which is the fear and the doubt and the insecurity that perhaps you don't know what to say, or you're going to look like an idiot, or other people are going to watch you doing it and they're going to judge you, or it's going to hurt and it's going to remind you of the experiences that you've had in the past that have been traumatic, etc. So the quick answer to really, how do I get over approach anxiety, is imagine and connect with the outcome that feels the best. Imagine an outcome that gives you motivation and that's going to get you moving. Because if you think about it in terms of when you're making a decision, say for example, I want to do some exercise. Well, the amount of motivation that I have to do that exercise is going to be in contrast to the way that my body feels, the decisions that I've been making, the kinds of history that I've had with exercise. And if I feel good about it, if it looks like something that's going to be a winning action, like it's going to be rewarding, it's going to give me something, and I'm going to feel good about it, then there will be motivation, there will be desire to do it. If I look at something that seems difficult, or is going to be punishing, or it's going to leave me with less than what I started with, then the tendency is to feel less desire, and you really have to push past that. That's where the will comes in, the will to take action, the will to overcome things. But the point to what I'm really trying to say here is that the way that you look at things, the way that you frame things, the way that you understand things is going to have a big effect on your immediate attitude and action. This is not always easy to instantly overcome. You can train yourself to just take deep dives to see what's going to happen. That's a big thing that we do during trainings when we have guys working with us. We take them through a whole series of, let's say, rapid, accelerated experiences that force them to take action, to pull the trigger, and also to be constantly reframing and focusing on the positive meaning and the best outcomes and the most useful learnings that they're getting from those experiences. That, in turn, gives them a whole level of permission and power that they didn't have without having the support, for example, or the assistance of a good coach. If you can manage that yourself, then that's great. The problem is that most people can't manage that themselves initially because it's very difficult to go from zero to feeling like a hero. How do I get over approach anxiety? Well, let's build some frameworks because frameworks can help us to understand the unknown of what's going on. Something I've talked about in the past when I'm training guys is this idea of inner game, outer game, long game, short game. As you probably know, and I'll just quickly go over it, inner game is the inner part of yourself\u2014the thoughts, the feelings, the ways in which you're organizing your representations of experience, mindsets, beliefs, etc. That's your subjective approach and the meaning that you're putting on things. Whereas outer game technically is about action. It's about doing things in the world. It's about being somebody that's doing technical, physical things\u2014standing in front of a woman, saying words, escalating, leading, having an intention to be able to get sexual, for example, and knowing how you can take action on that. So that's inner game, outer game in very broad strokes. Short game means the things that you can do in your immediate reality. So that might be now or the next hour or today or maybe even this week. And then you've got the longer game which is where are you really heading with this? What's the bigger picture here? So six months or 12 months or looking at life in terms of larger chunks of time periods. So if we take this framework of there's inner and there's outer, there's long and there's short in this process of learning to be a social guy, then that can give you some kind of relief, actually. Because when it comes to approaching, it's a pretty simple thing when you really boil it down to its core. It's like if you really think about it, you see somebody that you want to talk to and then there's a desire to want to put yourself in front of them and ideally to be liked, to be received, to be appreciated, to be attractive to this other. The challenge is that we don't necessarily have control over the other. And then oftentimes we're very invested in the ways in which other people see us. So the fear is if I approach this person, if I approach this girl and she doesn't like me, then maybe that means there's something really wrong with me. Or that must mean that the way that I organize myself or the way that I present my personality is flawed or not good enough. So that's usually part of the equation of the real problems that guys are facing when it comes to approach anxiety. It's about self-concept. It's about the way they're seeing themselves and it's also about the levels of technical skills that they have to be able to do things. So if we really break it down, the short game of approaching is to see a positive outcome, to see a positive outcome, to stay connected to the, let's say the desire and the feelings that you would like to achieve as best as possible whilst also understanding and managing other feelings, which could be anxiety, doubts, fears, et cetera, and then taking action. So that's like, that's it. That's approaching in a nutshell, right? See the girl, imagine good things, put yourself in front of her and then say some words. Now, as many of you guys probably know, that might not be satisfactory. There could be other factors going on. And one of the biggest factors is that when you go to approach, you don't necessarily know what's going to happen next. And because guys like to be safe and prepared, then there's a lot of fear around that unknown. There's a lot of fear about what's going to happen next after you step into that role of approaching women. That's where we start to have to look at like the inner game aspect a little bit, which is, you know, what are the mindsets that you're approaching from? And also how are you understanding and managing your own internal reality as you're going about this, this skillset, this, this task, if you will, or this expression of yourself, which is the social expression. So one of the concepts that I often refer to when I'm training guys is this idea of romantic adventurer, spiritual warrior. Now, that's another key framework, let's say, or a key stack of ideas that you can start to play with and use as something to help you to be more inspired about unraveling this mystery or this motivational challenge of how do I approach women. So romantic. Romantic means you have passion, you have desire, you want to connect, you want to appreciate beauty, you want to appreciate women, you want to appreciate connection. So this is all about this idea of like having an emotional purpose or a passionate kind of purpose. Now, I'll also tell you that like generally, it's very hard to be romantic if you don't feel good, or if you're stressed, or if you are distracted, or if you've got other things going on inside your life. So there is a certain level of like need to manage your focus and have a bit of priority on the fact that you would like to be romantic, you would like to be somebody who's putting energy and intention into being, let's say, a lover. So that's what the romantic aspect is all about. Adventurer means that you are able to go out and explore territory, to meet people, to have friends, to face challenges, and to overcome them with a spirit of adventure, with a spirit of exploration, curiosity. Also a very important element, like let's say part of the mindset. So if you have romantic and adventurer together, you can already see how that's a pretty powerful combo of mindsets and attitudes. Spiritual, which could mean a lot of things, right? Spiritual, in my opinion, is about having a position for yourself, understanding what your, let's say, your self is, where your existential kind of position of reality is, and how you can manage that. And the warrior is about strength, fortitude, goal orientation, being able to choose to do things despite the fact that there are difficulties, challenges, unknowns, uncomfortable feelings, etc. So spiritual warrior also then becomes a very powerful combination as well. So if you have romantic adventurer, spiritual warrior as a kind of an ideal package inside your mind, then maybe that'll start to help you to think about what it means to become this kind of expressed version of yourself, this natural seducer or this complete package or whatever it is you want to call it that represents you being able to take permission. To get back to the approaching, in the short game, having a sense of, I'm there because I want to be there. I'm there because I like this girl. I'm there because I like to have adventures. I like to deal with the unknown. I'm there because I want to face my own challenges, my own inadequacies, and I want to be somebody that's doing things, that's taking action. And also that you want to build a better character over time. Because if we really look at it from the long game perspective, then this is about really understanding how you fit into the world, how you fit into the sexual marketplace, what is the sexual marketplace, how you start to relate to women. And also you need to be very careful because there's a huge problem that I see in general is that everybody has an opinion and everybody generalizes that opinion. I'm doing that too to a degree right now, but I want to put a bit of a caveat on that, which is that there are many, many variables in the world. There are many, many possibilities and there are many, many doors that you can open and you can explore that others will tell you don't exist or that are impossible. So just be very careful about the way in which you frame approaching women, etc. into something that becomes this very general idea. Because in actual fact, you might find that there are many situations where it's up to the individuals. So whatever I'm saying here is not 100% truth, it's just the way that I'm trying to explain things in a way that gives you a little bit more freedom and dynamism to make sense of this. Another thing that will help you in the long game when it comes to getting past approach anxiety is recognizing that this is a process. You've got to trust the process. What I mean by that is that it takes time, typically, to build confidence. And what is confidence? Confidence is the ability to look forward through an experience, to look forward into the future, to face your challenge or face your experiences with a sense that it's going to be okay or that you're stronger than the difficulty, you're stronger than the thing that's pushing back or that's stopping you. Now, once again, how do we build confidence? Well, one of the best ways to build confidence is incrementally through stacking experiences. So that's also why if you want to get good at approaching, it's really good to have a set of things that you can do that make you feel social, to help you to warm up, to help you get into state, if you will. Now, yes, we don't want to become state-dependent, but at the same time, the way that we make choices, the way that we make meaning, the way that we understand the world is very much based on the kinds of states that we're experiencing. experiencing as a result of the kinds of focus and representations and physiology that we're experiencing. Well, what even is approach anxiety? Well, that idea of, I really want to approach but I'm feeling stuck or I can't move forward because of some feelings, it's one of the most common things that people feel. You know, feeling social pressure, feeling social anxiety, feeling uncertainty about how they're going to be received, etc. So first of all, I think it's really healthy just to understand that it's really normal. Second thing is that there can be a whole range of things that are actually happening inside of an individual that are affecting them in their ability to be able to approach effectively or to feel good about approaching, etc. Or to deal with their emotions. So it's also very hard for me to say that this is the one thing that you can do that will change everything. But if I could tell you one thing that would change everything, it would be that you need to create an idea or a concept of yourself that is successful, that feels good, that has, let's say, the purpose and the momentum and the power to be able to take the action that you desire. So the quick fix when it comes to approach anxiety is that you've got to see that what you're doing is meaningful. You've got to see and feel. When I say see, I mean you've got a vision and create ideas and representations that what you're doing is useful and meaningful. What becomes really challenging is when we're trying to do something that we want to do but we're up against a lot of resistance, internal representations. That means negative pictures, negative feelings, things that are not supportive to our goal. So if I see a girl and I think, hmm, she's really cute, I'd like to go and talk to her, but then I start playing movies in my head of how embarrassed I'm going to feel or how bad I felt because my last approach was bad or my last ten approaches were bad or if I start feeling how it's going to be a failure for whatever reason because somebody's watching me and they think I'm a loser, then I'm probably going to sabotage myself. I'm not going to be able to take action to do that. So one of the simplest things you can also do is do immediate, let's say, mind control. Be very aware of what are you doing in the moment as you are going about wanting to be social and what kinds of focus are you feeding, what kinds of attention are you cultivating inside of yourself. Now, the reason why we do our job and the reason why we've been in this job for decades is because the actual reality of helping individuals, helping men to be able to have, let's say, a better feeling inside themselves and more choice and to have more of the skills that they need to be able to be successful socially, etc., it's a package. It's many different things. It's not just the one thing. So it is important to be aware that, let's say, the journey of learning to be good at approaching, the journey of learning to be a social man is something that has many different aspects to it that may be involved. Now, as I just mentioned, one of the simplest things that you can do to get immediate results is start to see positive visions, positive outcomes. So when I'm seeing a girl and I want to go and talk to her, am I imagining how good it's going to feel walking away with some success? Whether that means I get something from her or whether that means that I just walk away feeling good that I took action, feeling good that I'm in charge of my own purpose, that's still on the right track. That's creating a positive orientation or a meaningful orientation, an outcome-based focus. And that will give you more momentum. You can even try it right now. Think about something that you would really like to achieve in your life. It doesn't have to be big. And then I want you to think about all the, let's say, the challenges that are around that. So how it's going to be difficult because, you know, whatever. You don't have the time or the resources or the energy or the experience or because you don't feel like it or whatever. And especially if you go into the past and you start thinking about all the reasons why other stuff in your past also tells you why you can't do that now to be able to move forward in the future, you're probably going to feel pretty shitty about doing stuff. You're not going to feel like you want to do that. Now, what about the opposite? What if you think about the thing you would really like to do more of and you start to get connected to the ideas of the positive outcomes? How it's going to help you be stronger, how it's going to help you be more fulfilled, how it's going to help you be more happy, how it's going to help you, you know, be more of the kind of person that you might want to be, for example. And then also think about going back into the past and referring to the things in the past that are good experiences, that might be aligned experiences or positive learnings along the way and see how that affects you. So in a nutshell, the way in which you're organizing information in your head, the way in which you're organizing your thoughts and your feelings and the way in which you're referencing your ideas of the past will have a very big effect on how you define yourself now in the present and also what's possible moving forward in the future in any context. Now, approaching is often a very, let's say, high-pressure situation for guys because there is so much meaning that they place on it. And depending on their situation, for example, a lot of guys who haven't had a lot of social experience or guys who've had negative social experiences, like they've been bullied or they might have had abandonment or they might have been emotionally deprived or whatever happened to them, that makes it very difficult for them to be able to overcome these uncomfortable feelings and the tendencies of using focus in a very negative way as opposed to a constructive way. So the simple thing in the immediate reality of approaching is get clear on what it is that you really would like and how good it's going to look and how good it's going to feel and the reasons why and start to connect, let's say, the values of why you're doing that to the action that you're taking. And the other thing is to just be aware of managing what's coming up inside of you at the same time because it is possible to override negative tendencies for short periods. So it is possible if you feel, oh, I don't know what to say, just to say, fuck it and take action and see what's going to happen anyway. And that might even actually get you pretty far because the other thing is that a lot of guys have a lot of fear about the unknown more than anything. They're just very uncomfortable about facing the unknown. And because women represent the unknown in some ways and because women have this kind of power because of the tendency to give a lot of focus to their sexual value, etc., it means that there's a lot of vulnerability around being exposed to this authority, this evil vagina monster that has this authority over you that can damage you in some way if you are not acceptable. But keep in mind that that's all perception to a degree. Now, I'm not saying that there isn't a consensus, that there isn't a sexual marketplace. I'm not saying that society doesn't have influences. And there are, unfortunately, hierarchies of opinion. People get judged by their height, their age, their race, their hair colour, their face, their jobs, their speech. People are judged on every possible thing. And that's also really normal because that's what mammals do. We sniff each other out, we work it out, we're trying to work out who's who and how does the game work, etc. But one big thing I really want to express about that too is that those things also only have so much power. And there is a potential and a possibility that you can create a belief and create a potential inside yourself that is bigger than, let's say, the gravity or the inertia of the consensus, the pressure of the world around you. And that includes other people's opinions of you. So another really big thing that affects guys when it comes to approach anxiety is the way that they think about themselves in their head, is that they're much more concerned about how other people see them, as opposed to how they are operating in the world. It's also one of the things that I do with my work, like when I'm working one-on-one with clients, when I'm doing inner game work, when we're doing training inside of workshops, I spend quite a lot of time with individuals and the group to really help them to understand that it's about changing your self-concept, your image of yourself, the ways in which you're stacking your reality and your personality. And I also spend a lot of time teaching them about how to develop self-love, self-worth, and how to feel good about themselves in the position they're in. Now, why is that so important? Why does it matter if you love yourself? Why does it matter if you feel worthy if you just want to talk to girls and you just want to get laid? Well, because everything that you do is coming from the way that you feel about yourself, the way that you see yourself, the way that you conduct yourself in the world. So, if you have a tendency to be shrinking and falling away and feeling small and feeling unworthy and letting other people have power over you, then it's going to be very challenging to do this. So part of the thing you need to do is to realize the kind of illusion of the consensus, the illusion of the power of the world over you. And part of that might be starting to realize that you've been giving attention and focus and power to other people's opinions or to other people's versions of who you should be much more than you've been giving yourself permission to be able to go for what you want in life. There is a lot to be said for just choosing to say yes and to go beyond the limits that other people have been putting on you and to start to take action in the direction that you would like to experience. Now part of that is the way that you see yourself, the stories that you tell yourself, the way that you speak to yourself, the visions that you're creating inside your head of the kind of scenarios and outcomes that you're dealing with and how that affects you. And it's really about creating a positive momentum around that. So this brings up the need to understand your inner game a little bit more because if you want to have the external results, if you want to get female attention and you want to have phone numbers and you want to have dates and you want to have sex, etc., then you've got to be coming from a place where it feels good for her to be with you too. And you've got to have the permission to start to do that. So one of the things that I would recommend is start to create visions and pictures and versions of yourself. Start to create stories in your mind, if you will, of being the hero, being the person that overcomes, being the person that has the result. Because if you see yourself as somebody who's getting better at this, if you see yourself as somebody who is attaining experience that's going to get you to the result over time, then it's also going to give you a positive momentum to the things that you're doing. So it's really about how are you managing yourself moment to moment? How are you seeing yourself? What are you doing in the moment? And then, yes, there is the actual reality of doing stuff as well because you have to recognize that getting exposure to people, getting exposure to the actions that are necessary to be successful in being a social guy, is absolutely necessary as well. It's like, you know, if I wanted to learn sales, for example, then I can read all kinds of sales books and have all kinds of inspirational thoughts and watch all kinds of videos on sales and I can write a lot of notes and I can be very excited about it. But if I don't take the action to practice, you know, selling, talking to people, finding out what their needs are, trying to work out if I have something of value that could solve their problems and then practice, you know, interacting with people and doing the sales part of the job, then I might completely miss the point of what's really going on. And that's the same with pickup. Like guys get stuck in this kind of armchair mode of analysis paralysis and thinking about things too much. So definitely taking action, warming up, getting out there, exploring the world, being somebody who's in the world is a good thing too. But I all do know, and this is a big reason why a lot of guys don't do that, is because a lot of guys are afraid or even if they do go out and take action, they kind of like start to run out of steam really quickly. So sure, you can go up and you can say something to a girl and then what? And that's what a lot of guys are afraid of too. Like they don't know what to do after the opener. They don't know how to create a conversation. They don't know how to escalate. They don't know how to create a situation that is a more of an attractive opportunity for her to join you. So that creates a lot of stress. Because yet again it's like you're being told that you need to do this skill that you haven't really developed. Another metaphor might be imagine that I just tell you to jump in a car and drive and you've never driven a car before. It's going to be really uncomfortable. But you've got to start somewhere. The thing is to create an understanding about what it is that you're doing that's meaningful, that has a positive reason to it. And that's the inner game aspect of how you see yourself, what you're doing and how you're creating your version of yourself. So the fastest thing that you can do to get momentum is start to see the positive outcome and start to practice cultivating the kinds of feelings and version of yourself, ideas of yourself to be able to do that. Now there's two things you can also do to help you to do that as well. If you want to become a better version of yourself, you can be motivated by pain or you can be motivated by pleasure. And you can actually do both. It's fine, but just be aware of which one you're using and why. Now pain is often the one that people use because they're coming out of a lot of difficulty. Like they've been lonely for too long or they got bullied or they feel inadequate or something's happened that's driven them down that much. They have so much negativity that they just say, fuck it, I'm going to do something and I'm going to change this and I'm going to blah, blah, blah. So they get motivated to get out of that difficulty. And the truth is that sometimes negative pressure, stuff that we need to get away from is actually the best thing to make us take action. The problem is if I'm just operating from negative pressure, I'm just trying to get away from the thing that I don't like in my life, then it means that I'm only going to be as effective as my problems. I'm only going to be as strong as the problem is pushing me forward. So that's not a very good motivator. So the other way you can flip it is you can have positive motivation. So obviously that's what do you want out of this? What's the good stuff? Obviously you want to have choice, you want to have freedom, you want to have sex, you want to have great girls, you want to have a nice girlfriend, you want to have experiences and adventures, whatever it is. That's the positive stuff. So it can be good to set yourself up to have a little bit of motivation from both sides. A little bit of pain, a little bit of pleasure, and recognize that that can help you to do things. So once you've got a goal, you want to go and approach girls, you're seeing stuff the way that you would like to see it. I'm seeing good outcomes and imagining that I'm getting stronger and more confident and imagining that positive things are happening. And also I'm practicing thinking about reasons why I want to get away from the stuff that sucks and the reasons why I want to move towards the stuff that's good. Now you've got a kind of a package. Now you've got a target, you've got some beliefs, you've got some motivation. That's already pretty good. Now this is where a lot of guys get stuck and this is where some sophistication arises."}
