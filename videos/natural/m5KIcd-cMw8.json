Yeah, I think it's really important, there is a difference between a peak orgasmic experience and an orgasmic state. And we don't talk about that at all because it's not part of porn. \u266a\u266a\u266a Blue Boss says, I noticed I get pretty tired after cumming. Welcome to being a man. And my motivation to give attention to the girl decreases as well. Any tips about this? Well, I'll just put mine in. I don't cum until, well, often I don't cum at all during a session. Maybe I'll cum once, twice a week if I'm busy. But I know, yeah, look, I mean, especially for me, some people they cum and it's different at different ages and within an hour, you're fine. I know if I cum, I'm done for the night. And it's not just sexual, like I could get it up and I have forced myself to get up before, but I don't want to, I have no actual desire. So I might do it just as a service robot. You're going to need to know this at some point in your life because if you're 22 and you cum four times a day and it doesn't matter, at some point it will. And so being able to decide, all right, I'm not going to cum till the end of this thing until she's destroyed and then maybe not even, that's the way I deal with that. Because yeah, like if I came, like the first moment it physically occurred to me that I could cum now, I would be shitting in bed. So like learning to ride it, get up close to the 80%, use your big drawer or use your PC muscles and various techniques you can use to like increase stamina. And like, if I ever get to the point of close to no return with a girl, I grab her by the hips and I say, don't fucking move. And she's like, don't move. And I'll just, I'll bark at her and I'll hold. And then I'll say, now breathe with me, right? And then I'll just breathe and slow myself down or I'll pull it out if I'm really close. And then, you know, use a juice bottle or whatever in between and girls will forgive you that, you know, having your breaks and your pauses and that fits well, but just jizzing quickly all the time is going to be pretty disappointing. Also, the nice thing is you can use other things, your mouth, your fingers. Like there's other ways of continuing pleasure but I have to say this, it's really important. We need breaks guys. We need to actually pause and feel like a lot of women aren't used to that. But if you allow that to happen, you calibrate her nervous system a little differently. So instead of aggressive sexual energy that's moving towards making you come, it calibrates her to chill a bit. So you go into states of relaxed arousal and for me, I prefer that because then the, there's more of a chance that the pleasure is going to intensify. Just let me breathe. Like I come really easily, so I might come a lot, but if you keep getting excited and doing it more and more and more, it's like exhausting. So just give me a break. Let's breathe. Let's have a laugh. Let's like suck my nipple, do something else. Massage my body. There's other things we can do. And then we come back to it and it really extend. Again, if your focus is on coming, it's one thing. If your focus is on just extending pleasure, that's a whole other agenda. And it's a lot more fun for both people. And then usually when you do have the orgasms, they're more intense. So don't be afraid to pause and stop and breathe. And it might be weird and foreign to her if it's the first time, but it's also pretty exceptional. Oh yeah. Like, yeah, because I'll do that. I'll take a girl up to a really peak moment with like quite aggressive sex. And then I'll slow it all down, lie on top of her, get her to breathe with me, just to really feel my cock and just squeeze and relax it with her pussy. Because sometimes you come across a girl who comes like pressing a button. And then you're like, oh, I'm a magician. I'll just keep pressing the button. And it keeps working. Yes, exactly. Anytime. And at the end, she's begging you to stop. You're like, but it's still working. So yeah. Yeah, exactly. I think, because like if we as men were like, I could just jizz and then jizz again and jizz and jizz, I'll just keep doing it. But probably not. You'll probably find it is pretty draining after some time. Yeah. So anyway, so that's the pause is actually very sexy. That relaxed arousal. Again, you want to keep building erotic tension and not just resolve it right away. So that could also help you last longer and keep your interest. The other thing that I found fun, if we're going to do fuck talking while fucking, then I really like, because I cum easily. So I like to be told that I'm not allowed to. Organism denial. Yeah, that I'm not allowed to. And then sometimes I can't help myself and then I get punished. Yes, don't you dare. You hold it. You hold it. It's like, I can't have a joke. Yes, then it's punishment. So that's also a fun way of also pausing. You can play it in that way as well. They don't want you to know this, but they ache for it deeply. And it's, they want you to fuck talk them. Okay, so advice for a sexually inexperienced man to become more in touch, comfortable with the fuck talk side of himself. Is it kind of a chicken and egg thing? You just need to practice. It's going to feel really awkward in the beginning. It just feels awkward. So one of the ways I've helped guys is to do it through voice notes. To send voice notes. Yeah, send some voice notes. And then I've given a little feedback. I'm like, yeah, it was great till this point. And then I, you know, and so that's been really nice to, for practice and it's made them better fuck talkers. And so I don't know if you have some willing females to give open feedback and have some practice because usually women love the attention and you'll gain your confidence really fast, I think. One that's kind of simple, but is just to learn how to sigh. Like we actually did in the last class, we did some sighing every day because it's so interesting when I go, okay guys, breathe in and let out a sigh. And I'll hear this. Oh, really? Yeah, it's usually good. And that's with no women in the room. And I'm just like, dude, maybe that was a problem. No, we did it with women as well. And actually surprising the women, like it took us, I had to get him into like a repetitious kind of mantra, basically all breathing, all sighing together. And after a while, the room just like let go. And then you're hearing it. And I'm like, at the end, I'm like, who's turned on? And everyone was turned on. Yes, and what that does is it translates into your body. So when you're fucking and one of the, there's usually three points of contact that make things very sexy. One is belly to belly. So when you're sighing and breathing that way, and when I can feel the belly like expanding into mine, I find that very arousing, but it's also very comforting. It has an arousal and a comfort. Or your chest, if your chest pressed into the chest of the woman, and you're doing that kind of breathing, it also elicits both arousal and confidence and intimacy. So. And yeah, so you can just start simple, and everyone ready? We're breathing. Oh, let's do a few more. Oh. And then do a high pitch one just for fun. Ooh. Let's just turn, say it off. Oh. With a guy's like, woo hoo hoo. Woo. I mean, I do like to laugh. Laughter's good. And saying things like this. Yes. Fuck yes. That's it. That's it. Again, it's not complicated poetry. You can have a bunch of those phrases. I'm sure I've said yes, fuck yes, many times to girls, but I'm allowing my, it's the expression of pleasure. I think that makes it the fuck talk or turns it into something that's not, that's just word. Cause like, here's a funny example. I told like one of the best rewards you can give to a girl is the sickest, most disgusting, nastiest two words in the English language, which are good girl. Right? So now if you say good girl to a girl at the right moment, it's like a fucking setting a new cough. Right? I had one client who was, he was an accountant and he had a very accountant kind of thing. And he came back and he said, James, I said the good girl line and it didn't seem to work. She just laughed. And I said, how did you say it? And he said, what do you mean? Well, say it to me like this. And I said, well, I was having sex with her. And then I said, good girl. Laughter. Okay. Well, therein lies the problem. So yeah, your delivery, your intent, your intensity, and one cool thing you can do, there's another little tip on this, is you can itemize pieces of her body, objectify the fuck out of it by saying, I do this one where I'll grab a girl by the butt and I'll say, that's good meat. Right? Now that sounds out of context. That sounds like a very rude or like weird thing to say. Or like I've said, like when a girl has amazing tits, I'll like hold them and I'm looking at them like I'm just discovered the, you know, the Ark of the Covenant. And I'll say, these are the kinds of tits that I need to squeeze at least an hour a day. Like that kind of thing where I'm like object, pieces of her body, like I'm a butcher. I'll tell her that there's like, I love the curve of your thighs. Yeah. Or give me those fucking juicy titties or bend over and show me that peach. Or like objectifying items of her body, which for some, it might sound like, at first you could see why that might sound like rude or weird or whatever, but girls love it. Again, because in the context of, she has decided to be your sex object for this period of time. She didn't come to have sex with you to half have sex and half think about other stuff and, you know, what her relationship to you is in the hierarchy of the lot, whatever, any of that, right? She wants to ideally immerse herself 100% into the sexual thing and be your fuck toy, be your sexual object and vice versa. So you come to it from that position and just use those simple things of commands. Come here, do this, turn around, bend over. Like when you're trying to reposition a girl, tell her what to do. Don't be like, cause we had a class where we were repositioning girls recently and the guys were like, you know, kind of like levering like it's an inanimate object. And I'm like, no, you put your hand on her hip and you say, turn over. You know, I guide and I said, turn around. Yeah, stick your ass up, arch your back or anything where I want her to reposition or change or come to do certain things for me. I give those general commands where I'm doing it with sex intensity and then I give her rewards intermittently, there's a really good start. You start throwing that into your sex life with a bunch of, oh yeah, fuck yeah, fuck yeah. Then it's gonna be good. I agree. And I think again, women who are even a little bit healthy sexually do actually love to be objectified. They just don't want you to know that. So I know it's true for me and I don't mind you knowing that but it's something sexy. And again, it's within the context of sexual play would be very different socially out in the world or at work or things like that, it's inappropriate but in the sexual context, it's a whole other realm. And again, the things that are forbidden in the outer world tend to create a lot of arousal in the sexual context. From Calvin, regarding pauses, how long are you talking about? Two breaths, half a minute, two minutes, 10 minutes? Okay, I don't think it's, the length of time is not important. Don't, what you don't, do a pause like the guy said, good girl, right? Which would be to just stop and just be frozen, immobile for some amount of breaths, right? That's not what I mean by a pause. Like think of it more like idling, right? Like if you had a boat or something that engine was still like chugging but it's not going anywhere. So yeah, if I'm pausing with a girl, I still have like a gentle amount of like little bit of hip undulation, right? So this may be a little bit rock. So that means the end of my cock is maybe just doing that gently inside her. So there is still some contact and some movement but I've minimized it to the point where I'm not in danger of coming, right? So I can gain control of my arousal state and I can, and we don't have, we're not distracted by all the moving pieces. So now we can both bring our awareness back into our bodies of intergenic. I would also say a nice pause if you're not pulling out and you're still in is if you breathe deeply with the pelvic floor then what happens is the head of the cock expands and contracts with the breath and that can feel really nice. So there's not a lot of movement but you're using that pelvic floor to push blood through the cock and that creates almost an electrical pulsing inside and it's a really lovely experience and it kind of settles the nervous system as well and builds arousal, so. That's something I often do when I'm first, as you call it, seeping and I call it docking. Like when you first put your cock in for the first time, even if I'm gonna move, maybe, let's say we're having a, it's gonna be a really passionate fuck in the back of the toilet or something. The first stroke, still, I will take that moment, five seconds maybe, to enter and for her body to shift and change around me. And if we have, like, then I might move into hard fucking or I might not but there's always that. And then, so once I've, that first entrance stroke may take me a minute or so and then when I finally push it all the way in, then I flex and then I swell the end of it as well. So she get that, she's getting that sensation of gradually filling it and then the last part of it is expanding and swelling which seems to go down well. Yes. So don't worry about timing the pauses, like you'll feel it. Sometimes it's just a moment and sometimes it is a longer one. Yeah, actually, when we were in the class recently, there was a guy, one of the students who'd done a lot of tantra training. So he was quite good with that stuff but we had one session where all they were doing was they had the girl's blindfold and they were taking them on a sense journey, right? So they were touching them and leading them and so on to, like, immerse them. And I could see with him that he was so in his, like, tantra zone, like he was so in his, like, pace that he didn't notice that she was bored, right? Like, so he was doing, like, a really, like he was, it stopped everything and it was going for really subtle feelings and I could see for a while that she was okay with that but then he was stuck on the pace. Yeah, exactly. He decided that it had to be this pace. So it's like, if you decide that it's two breaths, 10, two minutes, whatever, you'll be wrong, right? You need to be able to, like, have a pause and undulate with the girl and then, you know, after some breaths, you find that she's getting aroused, she starts pushing back, okay, maybe it's time to increase. I think what we're saying here with everything we've shared today is sexual mastery is the art of deeply listening and responding to what's emerging moment to moment. That's really all it is. So just, if you can start trusting yourself more and really allowing yourself to listen with your body, watch for the signals and relax into what you're receiving and following that, I think we all have erotic intelligence. We just think that we need techniques and so we can bring that erotic intelligence online a little bit more through the listening and responding. It's kind of like a good dancer. Instead of, like, being locked into a certain technique and moves, you start listening to each other's bodies and the music and then you dance. Right. A lot of men have adopted a higher pitched voice to make women feel safe, but it's actually a turnoff. This one I think is interesting, the lowered voice as negative or an attack. I think that, Again, you'd have to modulate, but in general, when I ask women, they do really like a masculine voice, especially for sexy time. Maybe just when you're meeting her for the first time, you're like, oh, maybe it might be a little off because they're used to men using high-pitched voices. But in general, women are like, what's going on with the guys? Like, why are they talking to me like I'm a child? Do you remember in your lifetime that being different? Do you remember back to the 80s or anything where people would talk with deeper voices? I think I've always had very masculine men around. And more recently, I've noticed men having these high-pitched voices and finding it actually like a turn-off. It's not even neutral, it actually like shuts down my receptivity to flirting. He likes the idea of fuck-talking just in between all the sex, which is great. That can start really simple, guys. Just like giving girls commands is sexy. Just come over here and say it like, come here. Yeah, exactly. And don't apologize for it. Definitely don't apologize. As a basic rule, don't do this every time. But if you think of it like command, command, reward as a general idea. Because if I'm telling her every single thing she does makes me turned on and sexy, then it'll lose power. If I do what I did and most men do, which is like, don't give the girl any feedback, really. Don't even make any noise. Then she doesn't know that she's doing well. She can't feel activated. So if I just say, come over here, turn around. Fuck your ass looks good in that dress. Like command, command, reward. Then I've made her do something for me or made her invest. All right, I'm like, no, swallow deeper. Fuck, that's so amazing, right? Then I reward her. And it's really good to tell a girl the effect it's having on you. Yes, exactly. If you say, you make my cock so hard or can you feel how hard my cock is? You know, it turns me on so much. You drive me crazy. These are all like things where she's had an effect on me. And that seems to go down very well. Exactly. And that is related to another piece of research of dopamine. So we're often going for dopamine hits, right? In these experiences. What they found is dopamine, you can increase the high, increase the intensity of dopamine if you deny reward. So reward cannot be predictable. So like you just said, but maybe even sometimes it's three commands and a reward versus every time the same thing. So playing it up and really understanding that you do need to reward at some point, but also changing it so it's unexpected creates a much higher peak experience. Yeah, and sometimes I'll add pressure where a girl wouldn't have expected the pressure, right? So like she's sucking my dick and my husband's like, amazing. And I'll be like, open your mouth wider. You can do it, right? So she suddenly has to do more or invest more and she's not sure, is this correct? And then I reward her. Fuck yes, that's the spot. Yeah, that seems to turn them on a lot. Alex says, do you think that any woman can be led to orgasm through clitoral stimulation or kind of lingers by a guy or does it take a certain level of knowing herself? Unless she's numbed her clit with vibrators, I think most women at some point will come through the clitoris because it has 8,000 nerve endings. Or if she's intensely inhibited and has really strong willpower, she can stop it from happening. But if she's remotely a little bit open, it's almost impossible not at some point to have a clitoral orgasm. But you're going to have to play because not always, like for me, my body, I hate direct stimulation. It's so intense. So instead of focusing on the glands, you putting pressure, rolling your fingers side to side or pressure down or tapping is going to be way more effective than trying to focus on the glands because it irritates me. It's like too stimulating. So a lot of people don't know that and they just keep going and going and going and then her system kind of gets almost overstimulated and becomes annoying. And the guy thinks she's having an orgasm and she's like, get off, get off. Exactly. Yeah, so it's kind of like the foreskin of the clitoris basically, right? Like instead of going from underneath directly on the glands, coming over on the hood. Yeah, the hood and even up on the shaft. The shaft has a lot of sensation, like a lot of sensation, and it's never included. People like avoid that for some reason. And by that, you mean it goes further up. If she's lying on her back, you mean as it goes further up. Yes, you can feel it. It's almost like a little rubber band, like feeling under your finger and it rolls away as you press down. Um, you can even run your finger like along either side of it. You can even almost like a penis, like jerk it off a little bit or just roll it or like I said, tap it. There's tapping. I've never heard of that. Because I know most, I mean, a lot of girls will flick the bean, right? But tapping? Tap on the clitoris? On the shaft. I've never done that. It's hot. Okay. Yeah, not for everyone, but try it. Because there's certain things, uh, techniques like, okay, so the girl's giving you a blow job and she like puts the end in the mouth and pops it out once, right? That would be an interesting sensation once in a while. Once. But not every moment. That's not the main move, right? So would you say the tapping is that fit within that occasion? Similar, yes. It's surprising. It's different. Now, when you're doing that, what happens is she may even start to feel the legs of the clitoris. If a woman's very trained, she's going to feel the legs and she's going to feel her whole urethral spongey spot swell and actually have sensation of it. Most women are not that trained. They don't know what's going on. But if you're stimulating the shaft, it's going to create a lot more like electrical current down into the legs and it's very arousing. So I guess the question being like, he's saying like, if the girl's never had an orgasm, can I make her do it? Or will she kind of need to do it by herself? I think both ends. I mean, it's if, uh, don't, don't be discouraged if she doesn't have one. Don't, don't aim for orgasm. Aim for epic pleasure. I think if you can just keep aiming for pleasure, and you, you like follow her pleasure, right? With your tongue, with your mouth, with, with even your presence, you're going to have a way better time than if you're just trying to... I hate when someone tries to make me cum. It's like, I'm not an, uh, like, what's it called? A video game. But if you're going for my pleasure and really following that pleasure and, um, yeah, just seeing what you could do to expand it, then, then we win all the way through. A lot of women, um, go into what I call like an orgasmic state and they don't have a peak orgasmic experience and it's absolutely delicious, but they think something's wrong because they're not peaking. So if you don't care that they don't reach a peak and they're just having ecstatic, um, pleasure, like that's fantastic. Yeah, totally. And I think you can definitely stop a woman from orgasming if you're trying to make her. Like if that becomes the outcome, then she's thinking, she's in a head trying to please you with her pleasure. Yeah. And then she'll fake it or whatever. Yeah. I've had times where I've like, afterwards I've talked to people and said, did you orgasm? She's like, I don't even know. Like she couldn't quite like place it as an orgasm, but she's definitely obviously like aroused and being, um, shaken by it. Yeah. I think it's really important. There is a difference between a peak orgasmic experience and an orgasmic state. And we don't talk about that at all because it's not part of porn, but orgasmic states happen way more frequently than we understand. And because porn always goes for that peak experience or it's often how the male sexual experience works, you move and then you have a peak experience. And so you try and replicate that in a female body. And for a lot of women, that's what they want as well. However, there's plenty who feel like shame because they don't have the peak experience, but they're having intense pleasure. And the orgasms they're having, once they learn about different styles of orgasm, they start to understand, oh no, there's these ripples that are going on. It's just not a clitoral orgasm. It'll be more like a G-spot or cervical orgasm. Yeah. Coming up this Saturday, the 9th of April, I'm relaunching my most popular ever online course, the Lifestyle Design Academy.
