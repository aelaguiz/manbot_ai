I can't remember who wrote it, but it was a cool thing. It said something like, accept, with an A, that you are ugly. Accept that you're a hideous human being when you're going out to approach women. Now, that's not necessarily objectively true. You may not be hideous or you may not be an ugly human being, but the idea behind it was, approach women as if your looks are not going to assist you in any way at all, as if you can't rely on anything visual from the girl, because that mindset means that what I'm attempting to bring to the female is everything else aside from my visual representation. Now, I'm not saying it doesn't matter. Yes, girls discriminate based on looks. Girls are into certain types of dudes, particularly things like style make a massive difference. If you dress well, that is going to have an effect. So I'm not saying be a slob and don't look after yourself and don't work with what you've got. And if a girl gives you a compliment and says you're attractive, we'll take it, that's fine. But again, relying on that means that you have no agency, that you have no control over what's going to happen. You're just basing it on like going, okay, does she find me hot? And is she going to pick me? And if so, awesome. And if not, well, I'm fucked. I'm fucked. "}
