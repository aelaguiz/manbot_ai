All right, well, firstly, I don't know how many of you know Seda, so can you introduce yourself, tell them about who you are and what your specialties and skill sets are? First of all, I know you for how long? We met 10 years ago? I always say 10 years whenever it seems like a long time. Okay, yeah, let's just say 10 years. And so since then, I don't know, there's been multiple books written. I have a PhD in psychology and I specialize in psychosexuality, so that's an interesting new field of work where we're looking at how your psyche is interfacing with your sexuality and the impact of that. I did a TEDx talk on desire, so a lot of my work looks at desire, looks at the dynamics of beliefs, ideas, emotions on sexual function, and a lot of my work has to do much more with women, although I have taught men in the past and I really do love men, and I would like men to understand women better, but also understand how fantastic it is to be a guy, because it is, it's amazing, and how needed it is to have men who are actually empowered and love being men, so. And can you tell us a bit about, like, what's your normal, like, I don't know, daily, but like your normal work when you're, because you're working mainly with women. Yes. What does that look like? Like, what do they come to you for? How do you help them? So I have about eight online courses, so I first filter everyone through those and they're everything from, basically women just wanna know how to use their vagina better, and they wanna have more orgasms and they want to have more pleasure, and they've understood that it can't all be on the guy, so they come to me to kind of learn about their bodies. I also teach professionals, so doctors, other psychotherapists, other professionals that deal with women, how to have those conversations. In general, I think right now, women are really wanting to learn how to dare, like really go for what they want and to explore their desires, so that's the majority of my work right now with women is exploring desire and encouraging them to be a little bit more daring. It's funny you said that. They realize that they couldn't rely just on the men, and I'm just imagining centuries of women just lying there like, are they gonna figure it out? Nope. Try next generation? Nope. All right, I'm gonna have to do this myself. That's why in the Victorian era, the women would go in hysterics to the doctor and he would masturbate her and finally that's how the vibrator was developed. I can imagine that scene, she's coming, she's like, I feel very agitated. There's something not quite right. Get over here, darling. I've got this machine. Spread your legs. Oh, that's much better. Thank you very much. Yeah, I figured. The lineup of women, right? The guy's wrists were so sore, he had to like develop it. Oh no, not a hysterical woman. What would be some of the areas that may be relevant to the guys or maybe of interest that you might wanna talk about? And while we're doing that, you guys can start punching up questions if you've got something specific. Well, one of the things I love is to talk about pleasuring women. I think that there's always more to learn. And nowadays it feels like most of our education is through porn. And so there's a lot of sexual dissatisfaction, even if there's sexual exploration. So that's a really good area of just kind of pushing into, but it requires like letting go of the ego a little bit and going, I actually not sure that I know this that well. I think we're pretty good on this crew of putting our egos aside. And that's great. So then we can ask, you can ask me really graphic questions. You can ask me sensitive questions, even around more like intimacy issues or anything like that, really, because that's, I just pick the whole range, really. What would, I've got a question. What would you say is a common or the most common complaints that women have about men? Or like, because when women are coming to you, is it like, oh, I can't find a man to dah, dah, dah. Or it's like, I can't access this within myself. Like, is there issues that are kind of coming up commonly where women are like, I wish men would do this. I wish they would communicate in this way or I can't get him to do this and so on. To be honest, women don't really want you to know this, but they ache for it deeply. And it's, they want you to f*** talk them. What's missing with all the swiping apps and even I think basic dating is they're not feeling like their mind is being f***ed open. When I ask a young guy to like seduce me, it's pathetic. Like he has no clue. No clue how to even just, he's like, okay, I'm now gonna lick your pussy and then I'm gonna stick it in. And I'm like, oh wow, okay, we need help. So there's a realm of how do you play in the erotic mind of a woman? And it's not the same as kind of reciting what you've seen in a porn. Like that's not really what's arousing to a woman. And then the other piece is around masculinity. So a lot of men have adopted a higher pitched voice to make women feel safe, but it's actually a turnoff. I think that's, is that charitable? Is that conscious? I don't know if it's conscious, but I've noticed it a lot. So when I talk to guys, I'm like, can you drop your voice into your balls? And then all of a sudden they're speaking a little lower and then I feel a charge, a much more of a charge. But I think they're doing it to make me feel safe. Okay. Yeah. So Keith's saying, have you some good examples of f*** talk rather than bad examples? I think you'd have to kind of get to know the lady a little tiny bit, but even just starting to push into her psyche, like just finding out if she's been naughty and even just saying that's like, oh, you've been very naughty, haven't you? And she's like, well, not really. Well, maybe. That starts her a little more playful than like going obvious into sexual acts. Yes. As opposed to it's Wednesday night, which we all know what night that is. Business time. \u266a It's the business time. \u266a \u266a I know what you're trying to say. \u266a \u266a You're trying to say it's time for business. \u266a \u266a It's business time, ooh. \u266a Yeah, like, I just came off teaching, you know, sex class and a big part of what we're teaching is communication and dirty talk, voice commands. Very nice. And at first guys are really scared of that and they think they have to create poetry. Raw is good. I think that might be what you're kind of hinting at there, Kate, because it's like, oh, is there a special way to speak? But you're giving good voice commands and good rewards. Just that is awesome. Punishment reward seems to really work for whatever reason. I don't know why. Even a woman who's trying to position herself as a good girl or whatever, but you're like, oh, I'm going to really punish you. And they're like, why? Because you've just been too much of a good girl or something like this. And then she's like, oh my God, what does that look like? Or denial of things is also women like that. So one of my lovers would deny me. I couldn't see his, he wouldn't show me below the waist for like three weeks. He would just kind of tease me and I would just drive me nuts. And he would talk about it. Like, you want to see it, don't you? I'm like, yeah. He'd like move the camera and then wouldn't let me see it. So things like that build erotic tension. And I think that's, women really love that, so. Yeah, because I think most attractive women don't usually or ever get a chance to want a man, to chase a man, to beg a man, right? So they're like, I've had feedback from girls where I've, the first point of contact for the blow job, I don't just let her stick it in. You know, I tell her to look up at me and tell her you want that. I say, open your mouth wider. So she's like investing or working for it. And then she gets it. That's like a kind of a unique experience for a woman when dudes are trying to shove dicks in, whatever they can. Exactly. Or even just like her mouth's hovering and like, nah, not yet. And then walking away or something like, huh? She stumbles for it. We have to understand that erotic tension is good for everybody. And we're not very good at it. We're a very quick fixer, like resolving the tension very quickly. So playing with what works for you as well. Like if you're turned on, that's really important. If you're trying to turn her on and stay safe, it's not a turn on usually. Yeah, it's like the woman gets activated by the man's activation. They've done a lot of studies on female desire. And I think it's about almost 80% of women won't feel their own desire until they feel desired. And I know for me, it's very clear. Like if I see lust in a man's eye, it's like, I crave that. And I think cause we live a little bit in a me too world where men are very polite and they want to be safe and they want to be this or that. There's almost like a withholding or not allowing that hungry beast look to come forward. And a lot of women complain, they don't feel like the guy is actually genuinely hard for her, genuinely wants her. Yeah, I can relate to that. As a man, you do have to be able to, I mean, like if you have completely unfiltered sexual intent all the time, then you can be creepy or sleazy and you're not reading the responses from girls. But yeah, I know for myself, I go through phases of like censoring it. I mean, now it's, I can switch it on and off. I'm very, I can very clearly feel the difference. That's a gift, but that's also a practice. And you want to be able to do that cause you have to read, you know, obviously like some females don't want anything. And the ones that are complaining to me, which is quite a wide range, like even all the way up to the seventies. You know, it's really- I am proud as look at me like he wants to fuck me anymore. Yeah, so there's a desire to be desired. There's a desire to be teased and to be brought out. And then the other thing that is interesting, I think is very few women want to reveal their actual erotic mind. So if you provide a space where you kind of pull that out of her, like what she really wants. And you're like, nah, that's not nasty enough. I know there's something else in there. And you bring it out and it's not threatening to you to hear it. Like, oh, you want three guys to do that to you. And it's, you don't let that be a threat, but you just play with it. It's very erotic. And half the time she doesn't actually want to act it out. She just wants to explore it erotically. Yeah, that's like, I guess for women, what's holding them back, there often is a fear of judgment or of being thought of as weird. I've had girls who've like wanted what I thought was pretty tame stuff, actually. But she's like, am I normal? Or is this bad? Or am I a freak? Because of she wanted to be spanked or something. I mean, that goes for men and women. We see that whenever we put up something BDSM related on the channel, it goes a little bit viral. It goes outside of our bubble of people who know us. And immediately it's like, this is weird. Why would you hit a woman like this? Just a lot of ignorance. What, you mean like slapping her in the face with your cock? Any of that. Normal stuff you do to say hello. Hello. Yeah, no. Yeah, so being able to trust yourself to lean into those edges and feel your own arousal and feel where your limitation is as well, I think is, because women like to push in that direction of your limitation. They kind of want to know where your edges are. And what's really interesting is how many women love to be called a whore, even though they don't want to be seen as one. Yeah, they don't want to go and sell sex on the street corner, but they do. Okay, this is an interesting one. Cause I, yeah, I'm calling, I call many women whores and I mean it in the nicest possible way. And they seem to respond very well to it. I've got my own ideas, but I'd like to hear yours. Like, what do you, do you have any ideas about why a woman would want to? I think anything transgressive, right? So in society, women are always battling this good girl, bad girl, Madonna whore complex is always like kind of up. So I think when you're, they're facing this moment where it's really sexy and then you're like, you're such a whore. And it's the first time she really hears it. There's a lot of energy that can get released because in the psyche, so the way the psyche works is anything slightly transgressive brings so much more arousal. And sometimes it can be a freaky experience, but a lot of times it's a very positive one. Cause it's charged with like things to do and shame. Yeah, it's forbidden. And also if you're calling her a whore, there's secretly this, oh, I must be a good lay because. Someone will pay for it. Yeah. Yeah, I've asked a lot of probing questions and I'm like, does it turn you on the idea that someone would pay money? And she's like, yes. It's like the idea that she could commodify herself and that kind of makes her even sexier. But it's also the idea that she's willing to do anything. Right. And likes it. And I guess also because of the money exchange, now she's given over her rights and responsibilities, right? So the man now can use her and take her within the context of that play. And so she is only a sex object in a way. Like she can forget all the other stuff about her position and who she is and respect and all that. And now she's purely a sex object. Yeah. And I think, especially if you're in treating someone well and you have this deep respect and trust, then when you bring out that side, it's even a safer space for her to explore the slutty whore. And women want to explore that. They really do. Unless she has serious trauma in some respect. Just a word on this of caution, guys. Like I've found that there's like grading of certain words that have different charges and they'll be different for different women. But usually when I'm introducing like nasty labels, I'll start with the softer ones and then I'll introduce them and just test her response. Cause yeah, sometimes slut or whore or something does trigger someone and she just doesn't like that. Whereas she does like some other things. Most women I've found tend to respond well to all of them within the context of feeling safe and respected anyway. But yeah, if you start with naughty girl, bad girl, dirty little girl, right? Those are your safer ones. And then try bitch, all right? And then slut and then finish with whore. But when I- I love that there's a gradient journey. Oh, you know, I think for all of these. When I was teaching in the classroom last week, I was explaining this to the group and I was saying, look, there's ways that if I say you are my whore, that has a different feel to you're a dirty whore, right? One is it's just like, you're just a street whore and you could be anyone's. One is it's like, for me, you're a whore, which has like a safer and like sexier intimate feel. And now I'm saying that, and I said to the Ukrainian girls, I'm like, so girls, you know, would the difference if I called you my sweet little whore? And I said, you're a dirty whore. And one says, just call me dirty whore. I think when you're confident as a woman and you're really in tune with your sexuality, you don't care and you want it as nasty as possible. Even if like, have you ever had a situation where you could, cause when I do that, I've read myself and I'm like, I don't have any anger or hatred to women. Yes, exactly. And if I did, I would be aware. I think if you're coming from a religious place and you're shaming with the word, it's a very different feel than being aroused and attracted. Have you ever been with a guy where you could tell he kind of means it and it's on the edge and is that hot or not? It was not hot at all. There was a young man this summer actually, who came to pick me up. I was having lunch with a bunch of older Greek men and I was dressed in a bikini and the young guy picked me up and he was livid. And I'm like, well, I wonder why he's angry. I'm like, oh, I think I know. I think he like, assuming I'm a whore and it's a bad thing. So as we sat together, I said, he's like, why are you with those? How are you? And he really couldn't speak. And I said, Do you think I'm a whore?\" He's like, yes, no, yes, no, yeah. And it was so, and I was like, and what's wrong with being a whore? And he's like, ah. So in that context, it was a turn off. And I was like, well, you want me to be a whore for you, but you don't want me to be a whore for them. And so he never got anywhere with me, but he could have. Yeah, it's like that. I've seen that in myself when I was younger and I got much more triggered by women's sexuality, that it's an ugly part of a man. And I mean, I guess women have their version of it. That thing of like, it's a disgusting feeling. It's just like, fucking whore. It's in there and it's, cause it's so weaponized and it is such an aggressive thing. It's like, you know, someone who's not racist put under some pressure, suddenly spitting out the N-word or something. Like, oh, that was in there after all. So yeah, it's something that for guys, like when I've talked about this to you guys for years, and it's not like a switch. I don't just decide no Madonna whore, I have no judgment. Like you do have to investigate that and look to where it's come from. And I think it just comes with, doesn't necessarily come with age, but just seeing more and more of female sexuality when you step back and go, show me what you got. And it's like, you can't, if you were to judge it, you'd have to judge them all. I think then this is really a good bridge to like, what is female sexuality? Because it's been painted a very particular way. And we were talking on our hike, I was like, well, actually, I think that women sometimes want sex way more than men. It's just that we're socially conditioned not to know that or admit that or move in that direction. But all the women that I know who finally like accept that they're sexual beings, they seem to actually have a situation where they want sex more than the men in their life. Because I mean, they don't have the filter of fear anymore. Exactly, and they're quite aroused and they're doing things to arouse themselves more. And I have noticed that that can actually shut down a man because it almost seems to like flip the tables a little bit. I mean, I've had that a number, not many times, I could count them on one hand where a woman's really made a lot of moves. And I liked it because I was like, oh, cool. It means I've got a night off. I don't have to do any work tonight. But yeah, I think for a lot of men, it's a tricky one because you want to, especially if you're not super confident in your masculinity, you want to feel like you conquered or you won. And then if the woman's kind of doing that for you, I think it's an expression of some immaturity, but I think it's hard for a lot of men to accept. The actual sexual power of a woman. Hunger. Yeah. Yeah, and so then the other turn off that sometimes happens is when a woman really is enjoying sex and wants it longer than say 10 minutes. There's been a complaint of like, they get shut down because that's too much time or the guy somehow is threatened by her actual appetite. Yeah, which I guess is kind of threatening if you're like, I can't satisfy her. So therefore she's gonna, you know, it makes you think she's gonna get satisfied somewhere. Well, the truth is though, that you don't have to satisfy her the whole time with your cock. And that's what makes you a skillful lover. You can actually fuck talk her for hours. That'll drive her nuts and make her calm. And you've never not yet touched her. And then when you do touch her, you're touching her with your breath, your eyes, your fingers, your tongue, like many other aspects of your body. So if you're using your cock, even just for 10 minutes by then, it's like, oh my God, because you've really opened up the erotic spectrum. But I think for a lot of people, maybe because porn only shows that part, that that's what sex is. Yeah, and it starts slow and it keeps speeding up until you come. Yeah. Yeah, like that's, like I usually have sex of some type for over an hour, but it's definitely not all penetration. And yeah, if you don't have a good vibrator, you must get one. I've told you guys which one, the Svarcom, Swedish Svarcom, Alice is the type. Yeah, like, I mean, I'll cycle between, I do use a lot of restraint initially, especially for the first kind of penetrative touch. I'll make her really work for that or beg for it. And then yeah, it'll move from penetrative sex to pulling out, using my tongue, using a vibrator, giving her the vibrator so she can, or getting her to show me how she likes to be touched, like getting the woman involved in her own pleasure and giving her permission, which a lot of, you wouldn't relate to this, but you see this pretty commonly. You're fucking a girl and she has her hand here and she's, my hand's down there by the way, and you can see her like wanting to go for the clitoris, but she doesn't because she thinks- She doesn't want to offend you. And I'll be like, please, of course, help me out. Yeah. But then when I see that, I just take her hand, put it down and I say, show me, it turns me on. Yeah. So giving her permission to- Very nice.
