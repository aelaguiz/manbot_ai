Do you see collaborations who complement your weaknesses with their strength, especially in a team? Absolutely yes. Absolutely yes. Part of the X-Men team is that it's in some ways an X-Men team of disabilities. So if you look at our crew, all of us are severely disabled in some way or another. I mean that in a personality sense. I am extremely messy. There is no question. Stefan's just smiling and laughing. Every time you see something in shot or video, it's because Stefan or someone came and fucking dealt with whatever was there before we started filming, which was usually things that shouldn't be there. There's probably a crossbow sitting there before or a juice that I made two weeks ago or something. So I'm extremely messy. I need people around me who are a bit more organized. I am often late unless I have someone there to keep me accountable. So Stefan is now gets me up in the mornings when I need to get up or keeps timers on things so I can make sure I'm on time for shit that I have to be on time for. Liam has a lack of a sense of being able to see aesthetics that is startling. So he will, like setting up a party room or whatever, he will not notice that we've got fluorescent lights on. I'll walk in and I'm like, holy shit, can we get some mood lighting on in here? He's handicapped aesthetically. Anyway, the point is we're not like a crew of supermen. We're a crew of humans who have superpowers or one or two superpowers in certain areas. And then we're shit at many other things and need our asses kicked and need accountability and need coaches and need therapists in all sorts of other areas. So yes, the answer to your question is absolutely. Remember when I was talking in previous weeks, we don't want to have a collaborative group that is all one type of person, right? All engineers, all techies, all like fabulous flamboyant people. Because you've got holes, right? So it's better to have someone who's a big picture thinker, a small picture thinker, a creative, a techie, an introvert, an extrovert, someone who's very forthcoming with their emotions, someone who holds them closer to their chest and so on. I don't need to have like 10 completely different things, but things that complement the group. And you can tell if they complement the group when you take the group out, right? So if I roll with any combination in my group, pretty much any combination, right? Last weekend was me, Virag, Stefan. We can roll together. We can be social together. We can wing each other on dates. We can feed each other. We can leave each other alone when we want to be left alone. We can see when someone's grumpy and needs a bit of space, usually me. Basically everyone leaves me alone until after first or second coffee. So these, you know, and then I can go out and hang out with Liam and Alex and do our thing or John and the creative crew in Budapest, for example, and we will get shit done because we are complementary. So yes, you are absolutely ideally looking for people who have complementary skills, but don't make that the sole or primary selection process. Initially, especially when you're looking for your partner, your wingman, it's most important that you like each other, that you get on, you feel comfortable with each other, but also challenged. Not too comfortable. Comfortable, but like, yeah, I better keep up, right? Like, okay, if I'm going to roll with this guy, then I better be bringing my A game and he better be bringing his as well. When you create a ceramic pot, you manipulate the clay. Yes. I mean, we can use that word to say, okay, I'm altering outcomes that if I didn't do anything, they would be something else, right? And the moment I get involved and start messing with the clay, I can't manipulating it, but I'm making it into something beautiful and functional. What's up, gents?
