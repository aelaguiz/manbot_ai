When you are put into a position where you feel like you don't have control over your reality on some level, it could even just be like a simple thing. You're in a nightclub, you're hanging out with your crew and all of a sudden some alpha dude comes in and throws the whole dynamic off where you're not the dude who's in the center of attention and all of a sudden all the girls are going away from you. So for example, that's a simple example, but your agency has been removed, right? Your power has been removed. So what are you going to do? Well, what the proto-brain does is start looking and scanning for what is the reason that happens and it has to create some plausible answer. For example, two primary answers is either something to do with you or something to do with another. So obviously you're looking for who's to blame, what's the blame on the outside. Well, he's got big muscles or he's tall or he's black or he's this or he's that or whatever it is that you're not, so then it justifies your position. Then you've got something to hate, you've got something to target, you've got something to make sense of why it didn't go right. A society where superficial people come into these clubs and good guys like me don't get a chance and it's all bullshit and money, that kind of thing. Exactly. So there's a need for a position of power in your life, which makes sense because survival is very much related to power. Are you in a position of authority over your reality or not? If you're not, you'd probably want to try to work it out pretty quickly because otherwise you're going to be either uncomfortable at best or dead at worst. So we've got to work it out and this is proto... Very dead at double worst. So this is proto-technology of our consciousness. So the point is it tries to make sense of the world and what that often does is, especially if we're in a position where our agency has been affected by something that is complex or non-local or ongoing, then we start generating a lot of different interpretations of where that power that has been taken away from us has gone and who or what controls that. And once again, go back to the proto-days, it's like, well it must be this spirit or that evil sorcerer or this thing that's happened to me that's caused this problem. So that goes deeply rooted into us and that's been around for hundreds if not millions of years. I don't know, do dogs do that? I don't know if mammals have some level of trying to understand. Paranoia, when the thunder cracks they're like, oh I'm a bad boy. If he took his food away, you know, when he thought he had his food, if he'd be like looking around confused and trying to blame the man for that. Let's see if we can get him to create a religion or a conspiracy theory. I think that you've hit on like a core reason why these theories are addictive to people and why they are so attractive to people. It's because it's really hard to handle the fact that life is chaos. Like that it is, that the interconnectedness of it, which it is all inconnected, but it's way way more complex than you can wrap your head around. And so like when I, when people start talking about how at the at the top there's a cabal and they say it in this way, like cabal like we know. I'm like, yeah dude. Which is interesting because I'm an OG conspiracy theorist. I know you are. I go back to like the, I mean when you say OG, whatever that means, I was looking at conspiracies back when the internet was just chat boards and there was no cabal. There was such a thing as a new world order, you know, and there was inklings of the Illuminati, which goes back to the 60s and probably even back to the 1500s or whatever. The Knights of Malta. But there was, you know, yeah, it's all, that's interesting to see how the proliferation of certain memes and, and, you know, like new ways of expressing the same ideas in popular ways start coming out. And now they, it's like, I think of conspiracy theories as like they're, they're kind of like a Netflix show that's like using up storylines. And as they use them up, they like have to draw back from the past and go, oh, can we just rewrite that whole bit as well? Because we're running out of shit to make conspiracies about."}
