And that's what you're here to do, to speed up those natural processes and then to maintain them. That's why it is social permaculture. One thing I want to note, I've talked about this a bit on videos before, but it is this, why does networking not work? And I would say that networking in general doesn't work very well. Because what does it mean for most people to network? It means to go to a place where there are other people of that thing, a networking brunch, a meetup group, a seminar, a conference, a workshop, right? We turn up and we do the thing that we're all there to do. And if we're friendly and sociable, we'll go and shake some hands. Not now, whatever people do now, bow, like shuffle their masks at each other or whatever the new greeting will be. You know, have a chat, surface level chat, maybe exchange contact details and say, hey, we should do something. And that's about it. That is not networking. That's the start of networking, but it's not real networking. The reason that doesn't work and the reason why a lot of some people I've seen saying, well, you know, I've met lots of people, I've been in lots of scenes, but I don't really feel like my lifestyle is working that well. It's because there is no investment in each other. Even if you're in the same scene, even if you've hung out in the same scene for years. Let's say you go to the local hill, what do you call it? Rockabilly night every Thursday morning at the Scotch and Fiddle. That's a bar I made up. And Scotch and Fiddle, that sounds like a good name for a bar. And you go and you know that guy, hey, it's that dude we love, he'll fucking rockabilly and we're there with our Elvis quiffs and our leather boots and our flanny shirts and our tattoos. And we like each other, we hang out, we have a beer and then we see each other next week. We've done that for four years. That person is still not your friend. Right? You still haven't networked with him. You barely scratched the surface. The difference comes when you meet up with him and you say, hey man, do you want to come for a drive on Saturday? And I'm going to go and check out this whatever. I'm going to go to a market. You want to come? I'm offering. I'm offering to give him my car and take him somewhere. Or I'll make an offer for a collaboration or a trade or one of the actions. That's when things start to start. And then if he rejects that offer, you know pretty much that, okay, it's just an acquaintance. It doesn't mean I hate him or need to delete him from my life. It's just like, cool, that's my drinking buddy at that bar. And what do I get out of him? I feel okay and I feel comfortable being at the bar. And maybe if he's a cool dude, we chat to some girls together and maybe that works too, but that's about it. Okay. That's the extent of that relationship. Cool. We put them in a different category, right? They're essentially in the followers category. Followers that we know and are friendly with. Okay. That's a group. Those people pad my parties. I pad their parties. You know, I invite them. I have invited those kinds of people to things before and I probably will again. Less so these days, but you know, that's cool. Then out of that, that person comes to my party. I'm like, hey man. You son of a bitch. And I talked to him for the rest of the night, but he's got access to my scene or I've got access to his and maybe I'm going to make another connection that I do properly. Okay. So please keep that in mind. So what defines a real crew member, a real tribe member, a real friend is the flow of favors and debts and the balancing of those over time. And it doesn't have to be very much time. Sometimes it can be a very short amount of time, but the debt and the favor is more dangerous. All right. So I said this last week when we were looking at offering, what are we offering? We're offering things that are cheap to give away. And if we lose them, it doesn't matter. A smile, a hello, a bit of advice, a friendly call, sending someone a funny meme or a cool video, right? This is offering stuff, but it costs us nothing except the seconds that it took to do it. And it was pleasant to do anyway. It wasn't a hardship. So I can do that all the time. And I should like do a lot of that, right? When I give the money to Granny Hedge, it's just like makes me feel kind of good and she needs it and that's it. That's the extent of that relationship. You really know the bonds are deeper when you or they ask for a favor that hurts to give them. Really important to note this. It puts you out in some way, right? When someone calls you and asks, Hey man, can you do this thing? You're like, eh, that's asking a lot. What's your answer? And you're like, yeah, okay, I'll do that. I'm a bit irritated or yeah, that's a bit of work. Okay. That costs me more time than I would usually give. But this person, yes, I owe them or I have owed them in the past. I trust them. I have a good real bond with them. So I'll put myself out for them. And then I will expect that at some point sooner or later, I can ask the same or they will just repay it to me without asking. I mean, sometimes I just leave it and I'm like, Hey man, can you do that thing? Can you do this? And then they have to say yes, right? Because if they don't, then I'm like, okay, I see. That's how it works, huh? And okay, maybe they can't say yes because they're like, man, I wish I could, but blah, blah, blah. I can't do this. Okay, fine. But I am aware of that. Like if someone refuses my requests several times after I know I've given them stuff, I will downgrade them. Again, I don't hate them. I'm just looking at human nature. People do what they do. It's like, you can always trust people to do the thing that they usually do. And sometimes they change, but only when they sign up for a course like this or work really hard to change. Most people don't change unless life changes them in an extreme way or very gradually over time or they have a child or they get hit by a car or they lose everything or something just gives them a big wake up call. But usually people stay and operate more or less the way they always have. So it's easy to read people once you see them see the pattern for a year. As an aside, I don't really trust anybody and I don't trust them with things that are really damaging to me for a year. I like to watch someone for four seasons before I decide, okay, yeah, this person I really trust. And sometimes I still fuck it up. I've had people appear to be trustworthy for two years and then fuck me over. But it's better than just immediately assuming that if this is not about thinking that people are untrustworthy or that I'm being cynical about life. It's just that people operate within their self-interest primarily. And they do that in all sorts of funny ways. Some people do it in a really smart reciprocal way. Some people do it in a fearful short term scammy kind of way. Some people do it in a way that actually hurts them by trying to give too much the nice guy and then hoping they're going to get what they want and then trying to get it back in a slimy kind of way. So these strategies will only work if we're able to ask deeper debts, deeper favors, if we are willing to be in debt to somebody on a deeper level and then willing to repay them. So get it out of your head that anyone's going to do anything for you for no reason, out of niceness, out of kindness, out of altruism. Just fuck that off as an idea. I hope that makes sense. Networking doesn't work unless you're in debt to each other. And remembering that organic growth in this sense, in the social sense, only happens in high growth areas with motivated people. So that's why I'd say in college or you're backpacking around Thailand and you're at the party scene and everyone's young and there to party and meet people or at a festival or this group, right? The organic, I mean, in a way, organic growth is happening very fast within this crew because everyone's super motivated to do that one specific thing of connect with people. But that organic growth burns out in every scene. In every scene, it eventually burns out if not cultivated. You see that by the year, the first year of uni, people are all excited going to parties and then they split off into their cliques and then uni gets harder and they have to focus on their studies and then they get a girlfriend and then they come out of uni and they just have their five buddies and they get a job and then it just goes from like knowing a hundred people to down to five and then they pick off or 10 and then they get picked off one by one by their wives or jobs or moving overseas and so on. So we cannot rely on organic growth. We need to stimulate it. We need to fertilize it. And that's what you're here to do to speed up those natural processes and then to maintain them. That's why it is social permaculture, right? It should be regenerative. Whoa. I'm going to push this analogy as far as I can, guys, until you're sick of it. Awesome news for you, which is that if you've been inspired by this video to take a real action to supercharge and multiply the effects of your social life rather than just waiting for this long-term organic growth, which may or may not happen, the Lifestyle Design Academy is here to the rescue. So one year ago, I released this course for the first time. It was a smashing success despite the pandemic, despite many of my clients being locked indoors. They were able to reach out, make all sorts of networks, create leverage and build the social capital so that when they could get out into the world, they were ready to spend it and expand all of their metrics of success and happiness. The relaunch of the LDA is coming up on the 14th of March. Very soon, put that in your calendar. And if you'd like a little sneak peek inside the course, which this was, this clip is just one little tiny fractal of the dozens and dozens of hours of live lectures that I did with the clients from the last one, that gives you a little tiny taste. If you'd like some more, then all you need to do is click the link in the description, put your email in, you'll receive a free introductory video into seductive economics. You will also get invites to invite-only webinars and first access to the LDA when it comes out. So stay tuned for lots more lifestyle design content coming out very soon. See you in the next video."}
