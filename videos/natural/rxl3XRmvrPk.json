Now, I thought because I'm in a good Catholic country, this would be a nice appropriate place to talk about a topic that is in need of dire attention, which is pornography and masturbation and its combination. In a bunch of my videos, I've mentioned in passing that you shouldn't jerk off to porn. And I've been getting a lot of emails lately from guys asking for more clarification on this. You know, they're a little bit confused and saying, what should I never jerk off? If I'm going to jerk off, how do I jerk off? To what and to when and to wit? So I thought I'd better clarify what I'm talking about and give you guys some new ideas. Now firstly, I'm not saying you shouldn't masturbate. You will not go blind. It is not an immoral act. Of course, it's a perfectly natural part of being a sexually virile man of pretty much any age. And unless you're getting as much sex as me, you're going to need to do it. And what I want you guys to have a think about, just as a thought experiment, is that pornography is the sexual equivalent of fast food. Now if you look at the fast food industry, what they've been able to do is trick your body into thinking that it's being fed nutrition, that you're actually eating food. Fast food is not really food at all. What it is, if you look deeper into the process of it, is the use of incredible amounts of fossil fuels in order to grow subsidized corn, which has very little nutritional value, which is then force-fed to animals that are not supposed to eat corn, is mixed with antibiotics, the fat of various other animals, to create huge amounts of meat, which is then ground up with about a thousand other animals and a whole bunch of E. coli and lots of other nasty things. Pumped full of all these chemicals that make it taste like it's lovely food, and then pumped full of the three things that our body, historically and genetically, is favorable to, which is fat, sugar, and salt. Because in our natural environment, when we were out as hunter-gatherers, those things were rare, and when we had a chance to eat fat, when we killed an animal, we gorged ourselves on it. When we found a hive of honey, we gorged ourselves on it, because these things were high in energy and in protein, and we didn't come across them very often. Now, because of fast food, we're able to stuff ourselves with these elements all the time, and our bodies crave it, and we feed ourselves with these incredibly low-quality versions of these building blocks of life, which leads to huge problems with obesity, diabetes, and so on. Everybody knows that if you ate only McDonald's, you will die quite quickly. It's not really food. We all know that feeling, because I eat junk food about as often as I watch porn, which is very rarely, and still too often. Everybody knows that feeling afterwards. It's not a feeling of satisfaction. Your body doesn't feel good. It's simply feeling full. If we look now at pornography, what pornography is, is a mechanism that tricks your mind and your body into thinking that it's getting sex, sort of. At the end of it, you don't feel satisfied, but you feel relieved. Any man who has ever jerked off to porn, which is all men who have access to any kind of screen, know that feeling of looking down at your limp dick with a tissue in the other hand, and this poor, brutalized teenage girl from Russia is still being sodomized aggressively in front of you, and the only feeling you have is of shame and regret. Let's compare that to the feeling of having ejaculated after having amazing sex with a woman that you have a connection with, and these things are very, very different sensations psychologically and physically. What I want to talk about now is problems with pornography. I was brought up in the last generation of men that did not have access to the internet. I remember the first porn that I watched very clearly. It was called The Jade Pussycat, and it starred John Holmes, who was an icon of 1970s pornography, and I swapped it on the schoolyard for some Ninja Turtle playing cards, I think, and it was a VHS tape. It was when I was 15, and myself and a bunch of friends went over to their parents' house when they were away at work, put this thing on, and four horny boys sat around and watched this porn, which is one of the interesting symptoms of being part of this generation is that porn was a group activity because it was so rare. I remember by the time I actually connected to the internet, and I was a very late starter, it was the year 2000, the future. I know that the internet had been around before that, but I'd ignored it. A friend of mine who was a techie bought me a cheap computer, hooked me up to a very slow dial-up connection, and by that night, I'd actually seen more women naked and seen more women being penetrated by me than I had on a screen or in print form, which for any man born post that era is an impossibility. I'd had very little access to pornography by the time I was regularly sexually active. By the end of that night, this balance was changed forever, and I experienced the first symptoms of pornography, which is porn back, which is where I got up after five hours and went, oh, cool, blimey, I feel old. I get a lot of emails from guys complaining that they are essentially impotent. They can't get it up when they're with a real woman. These are guys who are young and virile and healthy. There's nothing wrong with them physically, yet they're having problems getting erections when they get into the bedroom with a woman. Why is this? The reason is simple. It's pornography. I have a friend who knew he had a problem with internet porn when one day he walked into a room, saw a computer that was off, and he got a hard-on. What's happening is, because most men have most of their sexual experience based around pornography and almost universally on a screen, is that the human sexual drive has the ability to fetishize, I don't know if that's a word, but you know what I mean, eroticize anything. People can get turned on by inanimate objects, by feet, by feces, by animals, by all sorts of fucking wacky shit if they have to, or if they have conditioning experience with this when they're young, or various other aspects. For the most part, people are aroused by the opposite sex, young, attractive versions of that. But the thing is with pornography, what happens is you eroticize the entire experience of being in front of a screen. As a man starts to type into his browser, anal, gay, teen, asian, schoolgirl, or whatever it is that does it for him, he's arousing himself, and when these screens, when these pages come up, they are so far removed from actual sexuality between men and women, that again, it's the equivalent of taking a McDonald's hamburger versus a grain-fed steak in Argentina, which I've just experienced, which are polar opposites. They're both apparently 100% beef, but they're very, very different things. What you're doing when you're watching a lot of pornography is a number of things. One of them, and the reason I think why a lot of guys have problems getting up when they're with women, is that you're training your body to be sexually aroused in a position that is not really conducive to actual sex. What I mean is that almost all men, when they're jerking off to internet pornography, are hunched over with their dick in their hand and the old mouse and cock. This is not in the Kama Sutra, gentlemen. They are rapidly moving through women. Very rare now for any of us to sit through the jade pussycat with its 90 minutes long and 45 minutes of sex scenes and 45 minutes of John Holmes moving through Detroit in search of the antique jade pussycat with a funk soundtrack I still remember. Those are the good old days. Hairy pussies, pendulous, real breasts. All about it. Mustaches, guys with huge cocks and no muscles. It was all good. Now guys are flicking through probably a dozen girls every time they're jerking off or more. God knows what with compilations and compilations and jizzolations and all that sort of shit. Very quickly you become desensitized to the sight of one naked woman who does not have a dildo stuck up her asshole and is not being fucking throat fucked by some monstrous Cuban dude or whatever. Your body thinks that in this position is where it should get aroused. So when you're confronted with the situation where you've got a girl lying on her back and you're trying to get in between her legs and you're stretched out or whatever else it is, this is different. Your body doesn't recognize this. It's like, I don't think this is sex so I'm not going to get a hard on. That I believe is probably the primary thing those fucking guys are. The other thing is that when you're jerking off furtively to porn, most of us when we started this did it at our parents' houses. And whether or not you had a lock on your door or whatever, there was a fear and a shame associated with being caught. I think the most horrific thing that any young boy could imagine is to have his mother walk in on him while he was jerking off. And I thankfully made it through my adolescence without this experience and I'm sure many of us have just had it happen. I've walked in on a few of my friends doing it in various times and even though we're the same age, we're open-minded dudes, we know that we're both doing it, the person was mortified. When you're growing up as a teenage boy from about 12 to 14 when you start jerking off, and if you have access to a computer which every single kid does these days, you are jerking off quickly and furtively to ejaculate, to get yourself off so that you can go back to pretending to do your homework. Of course it's also a stress relief and as a young guy, your body is producing huge amounts of semen and it wants to ejaculate often. So which is why when you're of that age, 12 to 18 or whatever, you're jerking off three times a day and it seems fine. If I did that at my age, I would look much older than I already do. So this again leads to a rapid ejaculation. You're training your body to ejaculate quickly. Now I've read some statistics on this and apparently in the generation before this, the average time that a man lasted in bed was about three minutes, which is horrifically bad. There is almost no woman on the planet to whom three minutes is enough to satisfy her. Occasionally it's good to have a quickie in the alley or whatever, but for the most part, women require at least 10-15 minutes of foreplay, 20 minutes of penetration in a correct way to reach orgasm, as well as the fact that she needs to be able to relax her mind, shut off and a man needs to be able to lead her through this process. So what this suggests is that for the most part, women are having a really average time in bed with men. Now the good news is that since that generation, we're talking about the 50s through the 70s, the average time in bed has increased to 5 minutes. So girls have, I don't know if that's even better, it's just a little bit more frustrating as she's still not getting anywhere near to getting off. So most men are really shit in bed. This is a fact, I've talked to many women about this. And when a woman finds a man who is good in bed, and this doesn't just mean hammering away at her for 20-40 minutes. There are a lot of aspects that go into making a good lover and primarily, I'll talk about this in another entry, but let's just say for now, primarily that is understanding, as a female friend of mine said to me once, you cannot fuck every woman the same way. In the same way in seduction that you can't use the same line on every girl and expect it to work, you need to be adaptable, spontaneous, sensitive, and in the moment. Of course there are technical aspects, you need to know how to do a bit of this, a bit of this, a bit of this, all those aspects, but really what makes a good lover is a man who is sensitive to the moment and knows how to lead. So you're not going to get anywhere near to learning these magic skills if you can only last 3-5 minutes and by spending the majority of your sexual experience time, which is your self-pleasuring time, jerking off quickly to the flashing images of like 40 different girls being gaped, this is not good training for sex. Now at the beginning, I said, I'm not asking you to stop masturbating. What I would like you to start thinking about is that your self-pleasure time is training for the main event. You can use this time to, of course, please yourself, for stress relief, for imagination, for fantasy, all of these good aspects, and at the same time you can be increasing your level of sexual sensitivity, you can be increasing your stamina, and you can be preparing yourself to be a great lover. Does that sound like a better option than it becoming something that means that way? When you get a girl home, you can't even get an erection as a 20 to 30 year old man, which is awful. I know a lot of guys now who are my age, early 30s, who now are dependent on Viagra to get it up with a girl. Yet they still get it up in the morning and they get it up when they're jerking off. This is a really fucked up state of affairs. It's as fucked up as having to inject cows with antibiotics and hormones to keep them sort of healthy so that they can grow at massive speeds when they're crammed into concentration camps where no creature should be allowed to live. This is a fucked up situation. If you want to be one of those small group of men who are really good in bed, because the thing is, as I didn't actually complete saying earlier, is if a guy is fantastic in bed, women will forgive all sorts of other faults. They will come back to him for years and years. I have many women in my life who go about their romantic business, having boyfriends and looking for love and all of this stuff, but when they're single they come back to me to get laid, because I'm good in bed. I'm not boasting that I was born as some genetic hero, I've just put a lot of time and effort in focusing to becoming good at this, because it's something that I want to have as a skill in my life. I enjoy it and I want to share it. I enjoy making women come, I enjoy seeing pleasure on their faces. I presume most of you guys, if you're into self-development, into seduction, into growing as a man, you want to become fantastic lovers. You have to be, because otherwise you get a girl into bed, okay, so what, and you fuck her for three to five minutes and then she goes, makes her excuses and leaves, you never see her again. What's the point of putting in the seven hours needed, or whatever it is, to seduce a woman if she's going to let go and tell her friends that you're awful and never want to talk to you again. The other thing about pornography is that, what I've noticed, because I've seen porn since essentially 70s porn through to now, and I've been part of that generation that grew up with looking at Playboy magazines secretly, you know, oh yeah, that was amazing, or I remember I found a porn magazine in the schoolyard once, like someone left it there and I went and I hid it on top of the roof of the school and I would go there once a week, climb up onto the roof and jerk off by myself, you know, that's how rare porn was in those days, through to the age where you have instant access to any kind of fucked up fetish that you want at any time of day. And I've noticed that there has been a big change in what constitutes normal pornography. Now there was always, I presume, really kind of dark or dirty or twisted fantasy kind of erotica out there, okay, people getting chained up and whipped and spanked and fucking shat on and simulatedly raped or whatever else it is. Those things, I presume, always existed for niche markets. But now those things are kind of the primary thing that you see when you search. If you just search for sex, or teen sex, which is what most of us are searching for, why is that? Why are teenage sites so popular? Because when we were teenagers, we didn't get to have sex with any teenagers. That's why. And also genetically we're predisposed to wanting to have sex with young women. But if we do basic search terms, which all men are doing, it doesn't come up with vanilla kind of, you know, that almost naively innocent porn that I was talking about with the jade pussy cat, where you still had ten minute scenes of guys going down on hairy pussies. No man goes down on a vagina at all in modern pornography, because it's perceived, I guess, that the only thing that is of interest is the pleasure of the man, and also the subordination of the women. Pornography is really about sexual abuse and power. It's not about sex, and apologists for pornography will talk about how it's about liberating men and women, and exemplifying sex in an open and free way, and whatever else. It's not. It's clearly not. It's clearly the most blatant use of misogyny and violence towards women that is out there. And it's endemic. It's in the house of almost every single male on the planet, even though it's completely secret and hidden. The porn industry is a massive multi-billion dollar industry, which is churning out from California and Russia, essentially, endless amounts, because men have no end point where they're satisfied with the amount of women that they have in their lives, whether they're digital or real. So what we see is that, nowadays, the average teenage guy is probably consuming, in his porn diet, massive amounts of incredibly violent, abusive, misogynistic images. And he's being trained to believe that all women like to have a massive cock shoved straight up their arse without it being lubricated or prepared in any way, not that I'm saying anal sex is bad. It can be a very beautiful thing, but it's a delicate thing and it requires quite a level of skill and trust. But what young guys are seeing is girls being impaled, anally, almost in every single scene. And for some reason, this new fetish of being gaped, I never ever thought, I mean I was interested in anal sex when I was younger, but it never occurred to me to ram my cock in and out of a girl's arsehole and then spread it open and then hold it there as some kind of trophy. Who invented that? Some fucked up dude in a gonzo porn and then now it's become industry standard. That's what happens in sex now. So guys are being trained that unless you are choking a girl with your cock where her mascara is running down her eyes and she's holding back vomit and being fucking impaled anally, that it's not really that interesting. So we're being desensitized to sexual violence essentially. So again, when you get yourself in a bedroom with a normal looking chick and just having normal vaginal sex and maybe a normal blowjob, boring, and again, your body doesn't really want to respond to this. It would prefer to see all these garish, stylized versions of what sex is, which is why often a lot of guys will just simply prefer to masturbate than to go through that problematic thing of meeting a woman, arousing her, seducing her, working out what she likes, what you like, and having great sex together, which is a very sad state of affairs. So what I'm saying is, I would suggest that you view pornography in the same way you view junk food. If you want to be a man who gets the best out of life, then you can't eat a lot of junk food. You can't. It will just slow you down. It will make you old. It will make you unhealthy. You will not be able to operate at peak performance. You can occasionally duck into McDonald's when you're on a road trip and eat a burger. It's not going to kill you. In the same way, sometimes you're just going to switch it on and you just want to see some dirty porn. Alright, fair enough. But what I would suggest is that you minimize that massively. That's a big macaw over there being fed. That this becomes something that is 10% or less of your personal sexual activity. Now, where does that leave you? Okay, well I'm 22, I'm really horny, am I going to not jerk off except every 10 days? I would suggest not. I would suggest that for a number of reasons, you don't ejaculate very often. These Portuguese dudes are like watching me from up there and they can hear and they understand English and they're like, what is that guy doing? Hard to say. So what's the solution? Yes, you can still masturbate. I am in a good Catholic country and perhaps the option is to, never toucheth of thine own sword, and to reserveth thine seed, for only holieth of omissions, and here endeth the lesson, unless you wisheth to touch of the little boy at the altar. Amen. Yeah, what I would suggest is, firstly, you shouldn't really be ejaculating every day. This may come as a shock to many men, and I have arguments with people all the time. Some people say that, yes, biologically we should be ejaculating all the time because it increases the level of sperm that we build. I don't believe this is so. There have been studies with rats where if they're allowed to fuck as much as they want, they will just fuck themselves to death. The Chinese are adamant about this in terms of their ancient healing methodologies, the Chinese medicine, that your jing, your essential male essence, is contained within your semen. Every time you ejaculate, you deplete that to some extent. All of the sexual alchemy traditions in the world, tantric traditions, Taoist sexual alchemy traditions, they all talk about semen retention. They say you should not be ejaculating. You can orgasm without ejaculating, which is a whole other topic, but a very, very interesting and powerful thing to investigate. What I would say though is, if you are ejaculating all the time, you're not hungry. If you're stuffing yourself with McDonald's all the time, you're not going to be going out to seek out the best food that's out there. If you want to be going out there and meeting women, you need to have your testosterone levels high. You need to be feeling pumped full of male, healthy sexual aggression, because when you look a woman in the eyes and you project your intent, she's got to see that you're serious, that you really do want to fuck her, because that's a powerfully attractive thing to a woman when done well. If you're jerking off constantly and then trying to drag yourself out to meet women when you know you can just go home and knock yourself off quickly, it's not as motivating. Which is why when I take guys on the Euro tour, that is one of the rules. You're not allowed to jerk off for the entire tour. The only time you can ejaculate is with a woman within three feet. I should really adjust that. What I would suggest is that you remove porn from your sexual diet, or minimize it to once a week or something like this. You will find, you will realize when you try to do this, that you are actually addicted to porn. It is an addiction. It has been charted scientifically in many studies that people get addicted to this. And when you try to remove it, you'll see that this is going to be not so easy. But give it a shot, even just for a month. So instead, what I would suggest is the following. Self-pleasure yourself as regularly as you would like. But firstly, do it in a position that simulates sex. So do it standing up, or do it with your legs tucked underneath you. Or in a position where you would be, upright, when you're actually having sex with a woman. Secondly, don't use any visual stimulation. Now at first this may appear to be impossible, and when you try it, because you have conditioned your body to respond specifically to these images on the screen, you may not be able to get an erection. It doesn't matter. Just try it anyway. Use some form of lubrication, moisturizer or oil or whatever. And close your eyes, and focus in on the physical touch. And this is where, when I start talking about this to guys, they start getting all squeamish, like, this is gay, whatever. If you think learning how to be really good with women and a fucking amazing lover is gay, whatever. Focus in on the physical sensation of you touching yourself, and solely that. Because if you take that into the bedroom, that's how you become a really sensitive lover. Guys who are in their head, when they're in the bedroom, thinking, you know, technically I'm going to flip her over, and then I'm going to put her into reverse cowgirl, and then I'm going to grab her by the hair, pull her back and jizzle her over her face, alright, let's execute this series, are not good lovers, no matter how technically competent they are. The ones who are good are the ones who are feeling the sensations in their penis, in their balls, in their entire body, and they're present there with the woman. So this is where it becomes training for you to become a great lover. It also trains you to become aroused by physical touch, not by disassociative fantasies. So you can, of course, let your mind go wild. Encourage your imagination. Create fantasies and stories, and don't just jump straight to, you know, there's a girl being gaped by me. Try to combine some of the lead-up to it, the foreplay, the arousal, seeing the way the woman's responding to you, seeing the interplay between you leading and her submitting and so forth. Because again, this is helping your sexual psychology to become more healthy, to be more rounded, to be more sensual, to be more seductive. What I would suggest, because you're going to need to have some kind of fantasy probably at first, is that eventually you want to scale this back that you're not even thinking about anything. You're not actually projecting a fantasy. You are solely focusing in on the sensations. And take your time with this. Make it something that is building your stamina. So see if you can take 10 minutes before you blow your load. See if you can last 20 minutes. And if you can, don't blow your load. Just bring yourself to almost that peak. And then squeeze your PC muscle, which is the muscle you use to stop yourself urinating. Breathe in. And then, this is a very basic intro to Tantra. Breathe in and think up, from your penis, up. That's the first piece of advice I was given in terms of Tantra and that changed me as a lover completely. Because what that does is it starts to draw that hot, raw, unrefined sexual energy that's wanting to just jizz out the end of your wang and just draws it up your spine and dissipates it into your body. And it's an amazing feeling because what it does is it starts to spread that very strong but raw sexual energy."}
