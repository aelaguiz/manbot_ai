accent no it was not a bad guess right not a bad guess yeah I like your style blue on blue red on red it's like you match that quite well you must go all right well take it easy bye I'm so shy it's the number one thing that holds men back from achieving what they want in life and especially when it comes to getting the women that they want into life it's not a technical skill it's not being amazing a conversation it's not your height your looks your money it's the fear of rejection that's the thing that holds most men back they don't want to have to go up and face the fact that someone is just not going to be interested in you or has other things going on in her life I face this all the time I've been doing this for nearly 10 years in terms of going out and meeting women myself and of course teaching men and as you can see from this latest blowout role this happens to me often not all the time but very often that I go and talk to a girl she's not interested she's got a boyfriend sometimes I'm not interested she's having a bad day all sorts of things that will happen and the girl and I part ways and never see each other again and it's totally fucking fine it doesn't really bother me much at all anymore certainly I went through a period where it shook my self-esteem and I had a lot of self-doubt and I would get reactive very rare for me to get reactive these days but the fact of the matter is if you want to get good at seduction you're going to have to face that there is no foolproof method for avoiding rejection the only way to break through is to break through the mental barriers and the real-world barriers that are actually self-inflicted it's not the world that's holding you back it's you holding you back so if you'd like to join me for the ultimate blowout reel which is a seven-day residential workshop then you have got one more chance to do this for 2017 I'm running my final seven-day full-time residential in New York City the best fucking city in the world when it comes to pretty much everything but certainly when it comes to finding a dense amount of a stupendously gorgeous high self-esteem creative interesting and often hard-ass women so this is one of the one of the more challenging places in the world but one of the most rewarding places in the world if not the most rewarding place in the world to practice your seduction skills so come join me for seven days of blowouts well no it won't just be blowouts there'll be breakthroughs there'll be numbers there'll be dates and there could be some hanky-panky as well this is what happens on our residentials myself Liam and the TNL crew will be taking a small group of men through the ride of their lives working on meditation posture body language seduction skills all of the five principles
