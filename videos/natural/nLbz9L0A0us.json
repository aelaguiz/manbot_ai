Not one of them that I know is six foot four, jacked, looks like a GQ model, none of them. And you know some of them, of my colleagues, skinny, bit fat, bit short, okay looking with a huge nose, not like freaks or anything, but just like average looking men. If you line up all the dudes I knew who've been with over a hundred women, it would be a fairly unimpressive lineup visually. Maybe the cheerleader effect, if we all dressed cool and did our poses, which we often did in our photos, that might affect things. But we're kind of average, generally average, in terms of visual metrics."}
