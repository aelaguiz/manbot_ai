I arrived two days ago and I want to see if it's possible to meet a girl on the street that goes for a drink with me instead of using Tinder. You get a date in a new city within three hours. I'm here for the first time in Warsaw, Poland and I want to test that question and prove it to you guys that it's possible to get a date in your city or in a new city by approaching girls on the street, by communicating with them without relying on Tinder within half a day basically. Now the point of this video is to prove that it's not this hard, difficult, complicated thing to meet a girl in 2022. I know it might seem like that to go to the gym and dress really well and have the perfect Tinder profile. It's not true. What you really have to do is overcome your social anxiety, build strong mindsets and have the confidence to just say hi to a stranger and then go from there. You know obviously there's more technicality to it but I want to show at a very basic level that it's possible to meet girls on the street even if you don't have status, even if you're not prepared, even if you don't say the perfect opener all the time. I want to show that to you guys now. Hello, are you on the phone? Oh, are you Alex? Yes, how do you know me? Because I saw you before. Really, where? In Instagram. In Kyiv or in Instagram? In Kyiv also. Really? Oh cool, have you been at our house? Yeah, I've been. Oh nice. I've been on a trip. I was at this motel, one trip at Mykonos. Wow, great. Okay, nice to meet you again. What are you doing today? I'm today just like walking and sit here like alone for 10 days. You came here alone and you're here for 10 days already? Yeah, same. Okay, I am here one week. One week? Yeah, just walking around and I thought you look familiar but I was not sure so I said hi. You can come to the bar later today with us if you want. Today? Yes. What time? 10, I don't know. In central city? Yeah, in the center. You have my Instagram? Oh, you didn't follow me yet. Okay, see you later. Okay, see you. Bye. So I was just approaching girls on the street and this happened. Yes, it was really strange that I approached a girl, thought she's a stranger and she already knew me from Instagram through the brand I built which basically proves you can level up the ranks and if you watch this video about my seven stages of social hierarchies you will see why I'm on level six and you're probably still on level two. So I'm in Warsaw, Poland. I'm about to talk to girls on the street, total strangers. I was hesitating because I got this huge ball of blood on my neck which, you know, maybe two or three years ago would have made me go, oh, I should not talk to anyone for two weeks until it's gone but to be honest I don't give a shit anymore. It's called social freedom and it's understanding that girls don't care about small details like this. What they care about is that you have the balls to walk up to them, to be charming, to disarm them with a smile and a compliment and then you can have a good conversation. They don't look at all the little details. Is it good to be, you know, well-groomed and have good clothing and so on? Of course, and I'm not saying that. Go to the gym, etc. But the main thing is charm and being able to overcome your social anxiety and actually do it. Excuse me. Hello. Everybody is wearing white, black and you are green. It's cool. Thanks. It's like a city and you are a tree coming outside of the concrete. Thank you, that's nice. What's your name? Okay. My name is Alex. You have to go. You have to go? Yeah. Can I go with you? No, I have to go to the hairdresser. Oh, bye-bye. See you. Hello. Hi. You look very cute, that's what I wanted to say. Thank you. Alex, what's going on? Are you in a rush? Because I need to buy a hoodie. You must be cold. Yes, yes. Oh, wow. I understand. It would be bad of me to let you stand in the cold. Where are you from? From Austria. Okay. Then maybe I walk with you until we're inside and talk, so you're not cold. Okay, thank you. Because I understand. Look how much I'm wearing. Yeah. I thought about this today. You're alone there? In Warsaw or now? Yes, in Warsaw or now? No, I'm with friends. I arrived here actually this week, so... Okay, so you study here or work? I work, I work. Like YouTube, making videos. Okay. And you? I'm studying. I had a major in this year. Yeah. And now I started in university, medical, in Warsaw. You will be a doctor? No, something like a dietitian. Dietitian? Yeah. You know a lot about eating and nutrition? Yeah, health eating, yeah. Okay. I had a diet like keto, so... Keto, yeah? Yeah, yeah. And it's very hard to... Oh my goodness, English is very difficult. I forgive you, considering that I'm just spontaneously tell you, hello, I'm Alex, speak English. It's okay that you are a bit slow. You know where is... Maybe this blue one, it's nice. Yeah, but I need... A zipper. Yes. Okay, I will help you. Yes. What are you doing here alone? I arrived two days ago and I want to see Warsaw, so it's my first time here, so I'm just making friends. Anyway, I will leave you. Yes? Yes. Okay. You're very cute. Thank you so much. You have a boyfriend, right? Yes. That's cool. Yes. Of course. How long you've been together? It's two years. Nice. And what does he do? Is he Polish? Yes. He's studying like me. So how did you meet? In high school. Interesting. I think that's how people met a lot before, but now everybody's online trying to find people on Tinder, no? I tried Tinder, but it's not for me. Okay. I met a guy who was too... No, fake. Yeah. Fake, nice. All right. What was your name? Alex. And I hope you find what you're looking for. Thank you. Bye-bye. See you. You too. Bye. Hello. Sorry. It looks super strange because I was standing there. You look beautiful is what I'm going to say. Thank you. How are you? Okay. I'm coming home from Warsaw and I'm super tired. Yes, you look a bit exhausted without trying to... You look cute, but exhausted. And a bit like, I can't wait to fall into bed and take my shoes and socks off. Exactly. Okay. I understand. What is your work that makes it so exhausting? Pastries. You only make them or you eat pastries? Only make them. Okay. Why you don't eat them? Because I don't want to. I make them and smell them. This is my hobby. I understand. I like it. So you do like it? Yes. Okay. You're confusing me a bit, but it's okay. Maybe we can meet another day because you are a very friendly person. My boyfriend is super angry. If you meet strangers from the street. Yeah. Yes. I understand this. You can be my friend on Instagram. No. Thank you. That's okay. I must go home. I'm sorry. Yes. You should relax. I give you a smile and good energy. Thank you. Have a nice day. Bye-bye. Very interesting style. You look cool. Thank you. What's your name? Alex. Hi. You in a rush? You go shopping? Okay. That sounds not so stressful. Can I talk to you for one minute? Because you're interesting. And I'm enjoying Warsaw for the first time. I don't know this city yet. How long you live here for? Four months. That means you're Ukrainian? Yes. Where did you live in Ukraine? And you're a student there? Yes. Yes. Student and working. What do you study? Management. Okay. In a building. In a building? Managing a building? Yes. Or you study management inside a building? You seem independent that you study, work and then you move country and you continue to do it again. That's cool. How old are you? 29. Which is interesting because in August I will be 30. So maybe it's interesting age to become 30. I want to have a coffee now. Maybe. Are you not so busy? Yeah. Now we can walk, sit down, 10 minutes. I meet a friend in like half an hour at the mall. Only 20 minutes but I go to my shop. Go to my shop. Now you go to work? Yes. I walk with you, we sit down. Okay. Cool. Wait. If you talk so fast, I don't understand you. My English is like zero poziom. So I'm your teacher today. Yes. You get 20 minutes free class. If you want to extend after you can but it will cost something. It's free trial. No. You want tea or coffee here? Okay. Wow, now I see your eyes. Now I see your eyes, they're nice. And what was your name again? Your name? Oh, I forgot. Or did I ask? Yes. Alex. Maybe we didn't know. Oh, hot. How long in Warsaw? Me? I don't know. You don't know? No. I told you I work online. So sometimes I stay in one place one week, two weeks. Sometimes I stay two months, three months. It depends. You're a very independent person. I see it. Yes. It's cool. When was your last boyfriend? In Ukraine. Okay. He's here. You break up or he's ex-boyfriend? Ex-boyfriend. He also very independent like you find people who are like you or you find people who are opposite to you? When you look for a guy you also because you independent and smart and study your boyfriend should also be like this or you want boyfriend who is maybe different to you? Another interest. Learn something new from him and he learned from you. Yeah, I understand. My boyfriend have interesting plans but he love home and home. That's why he ex. I don't know if true but I hear sometimes from girl. Oh, he stay at home, he want to do, he tired, he play PlayStation. Why is this? Maybe because now everybody's social media. And watch porn. Energy go into porn. Not into the world. Give me your WhatsApp number. Nice. Let's say goodbye. So I will text you. Next time we can maybe explore a nice park or go somewhere. Okay. Okay. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Have fun. Bye-bye. Hello. You have very good energy. You walk like this. Really? Yes. Oh, that's cool. Can you stop one second? Sorry. What's your name? I'm Alex. Hi. Hi. Why are you walking like you're the most happy person? I stole it. That's why you're happy. Yeah, that's so cool. I was like... You're fan of the baby. No, but I was like thinking to give it to my cousin because she's like young. And I thought, oh, it's just the face or the artist. That's cool. It's just a poster. Just a poster. Stealing something. It's the act of rebellion. Yeah. It is a good feeling to do something that is not normal to most people. Yeah. And I'm enjoying it and I'm sharing it. Me too. I'm enjoying talking to you, which is maybe also strange for most people. No, it's nice. It's cool. Nice. You're cool. Thank you. I don't have any contact, because I have to go. Oh, you're in a rush. Alright, then give me your WhatsApp. Okay, okay. When are we meeting again? I don't know. I'll probably leave tomorrow. No, where are you going? To Krakow. So we have to meet tonight. That's the only way, right? You have nipple piercings. Don't look at this. Was it painful? Oh yeah, it was super painful. I was like, like this. I once made a video of my three friends, all girls. And they all went together, as like a dare. And it was like, I made a video how they're in the waiting room. And they already hear the first girl. And she was like, wow! And then they were like, no, I don't want to do it now. It's super, I mean, I was like a model for a course, do you know? For what? For a course, like... Course? Like online course? Like, the piercer had the students and he was teaching them how to do it. And I was the... So you had people look at you. I'm brave, yeah. You're a crazy girl. Four girls and the guy, he couldn't grab it. And he was like touching me for 10 minutes. And I was like, I have to go. But you started something. I will text you. And are you free at 8 p.m.? I will text you back. We will see. We take it easy and slow. No rush. OK, bye. Bye. Enjoy. See you. Take care of your poster. So I feel amazing after an interaction like this. You know, she was instantly open and you can just sense, I mean, I hope you sense it in the video, even just how close she was comfortable standing next to me, how there was electricity between us and how she was totally fine being approached, right? Like, this is proof. Although all the things that are in your mind of like girls don't want to be approached, girls are blah, blah, blah. It's rude. It's this. It's that. You know, it's like I did what, seven, eight approaches now. There was zero negative reactions. Maybe people are busy or they need to go, but they still are charmed. And girls like this are like amazed. They love it. They bathe in it. They love the energy. She's like she wants to go, but she wants to stay and wants to say me something more. And she's like on my lips. So, yeah, it just feels good. You know, it's it's an adrenaline rush. And I want you guys to experience it as well. So please do it or come to me and I'll help you doing it. So obviously this is going well today. My challenge I set for myself was to end up on a date within the three or four hours I have. And I think it was the second girl I approached that instantly agreed to have a coffee with me. And then I'm just free flowing. I'm just talking to girls. I'm just being social. Does it always go like this? No. Right. Sometimes you're going to get 10, 15 rejections in a row where girls are just like ding, ding, ding, ding, ding. And that gets you in your head. And then girls feel that and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. But always remember, all you need is one really good one. One girl who likes you, wants to sit down with you, wants to see you again. That will make your week, your month, maybe your year alive. You know, so it really only takes one. Hello. Hi. You look sexy. What do you buy? Ah, it's Victoria's Secret. So it's a secret. OK. You're from Poland. Can I see your eyes? Eyes? Correct. You want to go on a date with me? Coffee, maybe cocktail. Sit. Translate. Do you want to have coffee with me? Yes. Yes? Yes. OK. Do you have WhatsApp? Thank you. Maybe next time. Next time. Next life, yes. Bye. Add me on Instagram. She... You're more confident. Oh, who is this? Music or model? No, YouTuber. YouTuber. Girl or boy? My name is Alex. What's your name? You like shopping? Yes, yes, I like. Cool. Cool, cool. See you soon. Bye bye. All right, that didn't work. Probably a bit too direct and it wasn't very clear of who I even want to go on a date with. Because I just approached two girls and they didn't speak English anyway. So, I mean, there must be someone who's going to go on a date with me from all those people, right? Right? Please, someone. You want to see the most beautiful thing I've ever filmed? Here I am admiring a plastic bag. It's aesthetic, it's beauty, it's lightness. He was at my talk. On the left side. He's on a date, seems like. Oh, that one. All right, only one way to find out, right? Hello. Hi. How are you? Good, thank you. You're collecting money, right? Yes, from Martina. She has Curiosa. OK. Well, that's unfortunate. I saw you and you look amazing in this. Are you not cold? No. You have a warm personality. What's your name? My name, Alex. Nice to meet you. How is your day going? So-so. Why? I'm tired, so. You're tired of talking to so many different people? No, because this is, no, today is hot. Not now, but about two hours ago. OK, so you are exhausted from running around in the heat. Damn, but it's crazy because look, I'm wearing this and this and I'm still not so hot. You must have hot blood. Maybe. Are you a very passionate person? I don't know. OK. Maybe I will find out when we go and meet and have a drink together. I have a boyfriend. OK. He can come also. No, thank you. Cool. All right, then. Good luck. Thank you. Have a nice day. You too. Goodbye. Hello. Hi. Hi. Hello. Sorry. Where are you going? Oh, alone again. Shit, she's hot. Oh, my God. She has long legs. Hello. Excuse me. Why are you smiling? Why you stop me? Because I hope to make you smile. OK. What's your name? OK, I stop you, obviously, because you are very attractive to me. Are you on the way to a date? No, just I go for shopping and then I maybe go to a Zahenta. You know what it is? I have no idea what that is. OK. It's like gallery of art. OK. So first you do the shopping and then you do the art. And you are dressed like very like you're going to an event. I think it was I don't know why I just like that today. So I just like it. Maybe to find me. You have a boyfriend? No, but I have a girlfriend. Oh, yeah. Interesting. For how long? It's like six months. OK. When did you decide to prefer dating girls over guys? I don't know. It's experiment. No, no, no. You know, you're a lesbian or you're bisexual. More bisexual. But it's a monogamous with your girlfriend or you're just trying things out. Just us two. I mean, not us two. You two. Can you add me? Because I don't I actually delete the app. Whoa. Six, six, six, five. OK. Yes. Hey, good. Have a good day. Enjoy. Oh, I did it. Why did I say the person was like, hi, hi. Why are you smiling? Why are you stopping me to make you smile? Just like that as a thing. Hi. You look like you're waiting for someone. Thank you very much. Why thank you? I didn't say anything. No, you look wonderful as well. Are you walking around me like a dance? Oh, are you waiting for someone? Sorry, I don't speak English. I understand. You waiting for a friend. Boy or girl? OK. You will go shopping? No, meet. Drink coffee? Wine. Wine? White or red wine? Sorry, I don't have time. OK, then. Good day. Bye bye. I'm already vibing with one girl. She immediately responded after six minutes and she's asking me if I live in Warsaw. Obviously, I don't, but I have to say it a little bit because otherwise I kill the romance straight away. So I'm going to say we will see. I'm a digital nomad. Hello, madam. Hi. Hello. Stop for a second. This looks heavy, but you're beautiful. What's going on? I'm going home. You had a beautiful day? Yeah, I worked. OK, you don't look surprised at all that a stranger is talking to you on the street. You are, I think, one of the most confident people I meet this week based on the first 10 seconds. Maybe I'm wrong. I arrived in Warsaw two days ago, so I'm wandering around and meeting you. What's your name? But if you're interested, I'm not really because I'm in long term relationships. OK, that's cool. What is long term? Almost two years. Nice. That's pretty long term. All right. Yeah. OK. Have a nice day. You too. Enjoy life. Thank you. Oh, sorry. I interrupt your voice message, but you look so cool. Thank you. What's going on? Where are you heading? Heading to my friends and my boyfriend's. Your boyfriend. Very good. But you have cool style anyway. Thank you. Are you in fashion or design or you just like... No, I just like fashion. Popping out? Yeah, just casually. Why not? How did you meet your boyfriend? Several years ago in a cafe. What is that? In a cafe. OK, cool. Then don't be late and have a good day. All right, cool. I'm meeting my coaching client in 30 minutes. I want to get some food. Successful mission. We went out for like three hours, talked to a lot of girls, obviously had some fun along the way. Some sketches for you guys. I hope you appreciate and enjoy to make the video more entertaining. But the point is that it's obviously totally possible to meet and sit down and have a longer conversation with a stranger in a new city arriving without Instagram, without Tinder. And, you know, all you got to do is try it and get rid of that negative self-talk that I acted out during this video and overcome all that and you can do it. Also, the main thing is obviously give girls a chance, right? Like are the girls I talk to my perfect 10, my perfect girlfriend, my vision of blah, blah, blah? No. You know, I'm meeting strangers. I'm social. I'm talking to people. I'm asking questions. If I'm not interested in a girl after a while, I can always just walk away. So don't get in your head that every time you do an approach, it needs to be a potential wife. You know, you're in a phase probably if you're watching this video where you need to make a lot of experiences, where you need to try things out, where you should get into a zone where you're just having fun doing this. If you from the start already think, oh, this is to find a girlfriend and the one approach needs to be has the potential for that, you won't get very far because you're going to fail and then you're not getting enough practice. And then if you meet the girl you really like, you're just not going to get her attention. You're not going to close. You're not going to end up on a date because you're just lacking practice. So if you're in a phase which is like you're just starting out, you're learning the skills, you're learning different things, you're trying things out, lower your standards a little bit as well. It will lead to way quicker results. And, yeah, you're learning curve will be much better. I made this video for two reasons. First of all, you asked for it in the comments. You know, I wanted to show, hey, actually sitting down with someone is possible. It's not just getting numbers and getting numbers, especially to tell you the following thing. Obviously, in the end, it's about getting dates. You know, getting numbers is not the sport we're doing. The sport we're doing is communicating, ending up on dates, ending up ideally in some form of relationship in the end. Whatever you're looking for when you're going out, get out of the habit of only collecting numbers and basically rating yourself if you've got numbers or not. The first rating is obviously did you try to connect with strangers or not? If you're doing this, this is great. If you had a zero at that, obviously nothing will ever come out of that. The second thing is it's about solid numbers or not even number at all. It's about ending up on dates. So if I can meet a girl and she's free and, you know, she has 20 minutes and I have 20 minutes, let's do it right here. You know, why did I approach her in the first place? It's for me to eventually end up on a date with her. It's eventually to not even date, just sitting down, getting to know each other."}
