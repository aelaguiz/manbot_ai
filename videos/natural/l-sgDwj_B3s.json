No, what is that? Describe what is good dominance to you. When he actually pays attention to your body talking. Like, if he actually goes ahead and listens to you. Kind of like, really like, tries to learn you. And then, make that turn into something dominant. And just like, you know, grab you on the right spots. And just like, pull your hair. Or just like, bite your lips. Just like, I don't know, like turn you around. Again, this is another thing that is actually showing so much dominance. And it's so underrated. We do not like it when a guy is asking you to switch positions. Like, just go ahead and put me into doggy position. Or whatever you want to f**k me in, just do it."}
