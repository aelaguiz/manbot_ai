She's like, oh, yeah, make sure you say good morning and good night. I said, I'm not going to do that. I don't I don't text daily like that's not our relationship. And she was she was like she was shocked. And then I said, you know, like the the where where I fit into your life is where we're lovers. We can hang out sometimes and do our thing. But yeah, I'm not I'm not the guy that's going to be checking in every day. Well, I'm just going to read this one. Hello, gentlemen. Lately, I've finally gotten successful in attracting the right kind of girls into my life and making them into lovers. Right. Yeah. My problem now is that it is very tricky for me to find the fine line between the behavior, between being a lover to them versus behaving like their boyfriend. Even more confusing that to all of them is the line between the two of these is somewhere else. Is there a way to navigate this in an easy way? Or is it kind of a mess when I can never be too sure if my behavior is already too much? Cheers, gents. James, you're a master of this. This navigation. I think I didn't quite understand that bit where you're like an even more confusing. I think what you were saying was even more confusing. You don't know what her line is between boyfriend and lover, maybe something along those lines. So this can this is as confusing as you want to make it. These days, it's not never an issue for me. Back in the back in the earlier days, it was and it came up quite often. And it primarily came up because I was saying one thing and doing the other. Of course, each girl will be different. Some girls are really, really get it really quickly. Some girls just don't want relationships right now in their life. And so it's not an issue. So part of it is the screening process that you're going through. These days, if I meet a nice, sweet, sincere girl who wants a loving relationship and wants to devote herself to one man and be a great feminine partner, I say, get the fuck out of here. Who do you think I am? Because that's what I'm looking for. No, it's like if I come across a girl where it's evident by what she's saying that she's a one man kind of woman right now and she is searching for a boyfriend, then I let her know hard and fast that I will not be that thing. And I have the audacity to do that because I have the ability to find another girl. And also, it's an ethical thing because I don't want to waste months or years of the girl's life who is really looking for something like that right now. It's not fair on her. And it requires me lying with my actions, if not my words. So it is important to demonstrate and to verbalize where you're at. Now, you don't need to do this in the first day. You don't need to do this before you fucked unless you had a long drawn out courtship where the girl is like, you know, like keeping you at bay because she's screening for a boyfriend. In that case, I will let her go as well. But once I've got a girl into bed, if it happened pretty quickly, which it should, you know, within several days, you've got an amnesty for the first. You sleep together, sleep together again. No one knows what's happening at this point. We don't we don't know each other or anything. We're two people rubbing genitals together and figuring out if we like each other. Cool. We do that a couple of times. And then there's there will be signals because sometimes that girl will start texting me every day and saying, good morning, you know, like and then goodnight texts. And I cut that in the I cut that in the bud early. I literally say, hey, listen, I'm not going to. And one girl recently said that to me. She's like, oh, yeah, make sure you say good morning and good night. I said, I'm not going to do that. I don't I don't text daily like that's not our relationship. And she was she was like she was shocked. And then I said, you know, like the where where I fit into your life is where we're lovers. We can hang out sometimes and do our thing. But yeah, I'm not I'm not the guy that's going to be checking in every day. And she wasn't OK with it. And she said, oh, that's not cool. That's not gentlemanly. I said, I understand. That's not it. By by your standards, it's true. It's not gentlemanly, but that's not I'm not going to operate any differently. And she said it's not, you know, and then she left. Cool. Good. We we fucked once. She she she put a card on the table. I put mine clearly not going to work. No harm done. We had we had a couple of good nights together. And that's it. Whereas, you know, other girls, I'm with I sleep with them. And then they don't text me or, you know, I text them and they take three days to answer or they're when I at the end of the day, we slept together or whatever. And I and I send her home and I say, I'll see you soon. And she's not there going, oh, when will I see you? She's like, cool, that's that's that's the kind of girl I want to hang out with at this point in my life, because I'm not trying to monopolize her life. She's not trying to monopolize mine. That that kind of fits right. But you need to be aware of certain behaviors that that that transmit boyfriend vibes, and those are texting every day. And if the girl does it because girls, people will text as much as they want to text, not she's being evil. She's just she wants to text you five times a day. Fair enough. That's what she wants to do. But I will just say what I just something along what I just said. Yeah, I don't text much. I prefer to, you know, we'll hang out in person. You know, I don't want to be on my phone all day. And I also don't want to I don't need to know anything that's going on in your life and you don't need to know mine. It's I mean, it sounds kind of harsh, but it's just it's it's just a fair way to do things. And I and I'm not you know, I don't want to be I'm not going to be the guy going, oh, yeah. Hey, how are you? What did you have for lunch? Fuck off. I don't I don't want to know. There's no aggression. There's no judgment on that. It's just people wanting different things and trying to find an alignment. So I limit contact to and I will only see a girl maximum once a week unless she's really cool, right? Cool as in like we're fuck buddies, right? Sometimes I've got one in Ukraine. We see each other actually a few times a week because we're really into fucking. But she's the one always like we fuck. We hang out, smoke a joint sometimes. And then she says, you better get me a taxi. I love it. Every time she's like she's the one that calls it each time. And it's always the perfect moment to with everything. We've had all the pleasures. We chilled. We had a cuddle. And she's like, you should get me a taxi. Like, God damn it. You get that. That's my kind of girl. Right. So I can see her three times a week because or as many times we want to because there's no dramas. It's not it's not it's not building to any it's not leading anyone astray. But in general, I keep a lover on to once a week ish once every 10 days or so. Maybe we might have a long, dirty weekend or might go on a trip or something. But I'm going to keep it at that. Secondly, I, I personally don't let girls stay overnight. Now, I'm not saying you can never. And I and it's not that I have never occasionally I passed out next to a girl. We just it happened. But for this one reason is just I'm having insomnia and I find it hard to sleep next to a girl. But the other one is it's like sleeping over the night, you know, having a having a long breakfast the next morning, going for a walk. Like these are boyfriendy kinds of things. That's the like it's like smaller versions of a relationship. And and I think it gives the wrong message. So when we when she comes over, we do our thing. I don't, you know, come and say, get out, of course. But it's like, you know, we have sex and we do whatever we are doing afterwards. We hang out with you, which which Rick and Morty or whatever. And then I say, OK, well, I should I should get you a cab. And I always get girls cabs. It's I mean, OK, that I because it puts me in the control and it gets her home safely. Like you can't dump a girl on the street at three in the morning. That's not OK to do. So it's like if I want to get her home, I make sure she gets home safely. So I am being a gentleman. I walk her down and put her in the cab. I'll kiss her. I'll say, I'll see you soon. I never say, oh, let's make another date or when will when will we see each other? It's just like, I'll see you soon. Or if I never want to see her again, I say these horrible, horrible words. Take care. Oh, that's funny. Yikes. I say, you know, I give her a hug. I say, you're wonderful. That was so much fun. Take care. And she gets it usually, right? And I've had girls say that to me, too. You know, it's like, oh, yeah, it was awesome fun. OK, cool. Take care. I'm like, all right, cool. That's it. We're done. Fair enough. See you soon means, yes, I will see you. I will see her again. I want to see her again. But when it is, I don't know. Probably in a week, probably next Tuesday. So those kinds of things are just setting clear, clear tones. The other things that are boyfriendy things is like like walking down the street, holding hands. That's not a sexy thing. That's an intimate thing, right? That's and again, I'm not saying I could never do that. There are girls sometimes I hold hands because we just we're just buddies and sex buddies and it feels nice to hold hands sometimes. And it's clear, right? That's fine. Yeah. But, you know, the kind of public touch that I do with with a lover is, you know, she gets the elevator. I give a little slap on the ass, right? Like, oh, we're sitting at the coffee and I run my hand up her leg. And so, you know, and sure, like, you know, we might talk and I might like, you know, caress her neck or give her a massage or something. It's not all, you know, not all BDSM. It's like there's sensual touch in there, but it's not the like I'm sitting with my girlfriend, you know, wrapped up, cuddled together. I'm not walk. This is my girlfriend. I walk down the street with that sending the wrong messages, even if I've had the talk with her. But then I act do all these things. I see her three times a week. I, you know, I go and I go and see her dance performance. I meet her friends. I meet her parents. I bring her into my social circle. You know, I make plans weeks in advance with her. You're a boyfriend. Well, that's what you that's what you're doing. So, yeah, you need to be really aware of your behavior. And you need to if you want to be clean about it, because you don't need to do any of this shit. You can just go out there and and keep creating mess. But it's going to create mess in your life. And it's going to lead to very angry women and very bad breakups because expectations were not met. So I very rarely get any bad breakups or bad separations. Now it's because it was pretty clear. I said to her, I mean, sometimes I don't need to say to her because my Instagram and the fact I'm surrounded by strumpets and I'm a sex teacher often tends to tends to say it for me. But back when I was, you know, a guy that wasn't known as a sex guy. Yeah, like I had a lot of mess early in my pickup. I picked up heaps of girls. I played whatever game I had to to get them into bed. I, you know, I did whatever I needed to to make it happen. And then so the girls would like fall in love or get get confused and get and then and then that would be a month later. They'd say, oh, so where where are we at? And then I'd say, oh, no, it's nothing serious. We're just casual. And then she'd be angry because I'd been kind of lying to with my actions for a month as opposed to just straight early on first few dates saying, hey, listen, I just want to talk to you. You can go and watch my 21 convention speech, multiple relationship dynamics where I completely plot out the whole speech, how I say it or variations on it of of how do I talk to talk to the girl about this and explain it? And there's lots of variations and ways that you can do it. But it needs to be basically stated like, here's my reality. Here's what I am doing right now. I am a single man. You know, I'm dating or if I'm not dating, I will be I will see other people. I totally understand if this is not cool for you, but I really do want to see you. I like this and this and this about you. It's awesome hanging out with you. I love having sex, chilling, you know, whatever we do together. But I just want you to know that, yeah, I'm I'm not looking for any kind of exclusive thing now or in any time, any time in the future, as far as I can see. And I'll understand if that's not cool with you. But I do want to know where you're at. I don't want to presume because you don't want to tell it. Look, because if you tell a girl, like, listen, just so you know, I'm not going to be your boyfriend. She'll get defensive, of course, because she's been rejected and she's going to. Well, fuck you. I didn't even want to be your girlfriend. But whereas if I stay, here's where my truth is. I'm not sure what your truth is. I really want to hear it. And I'll understand if it's not if that doesn't work for you. But I would like to continue seeing each other that I found worked well, because then sometimes the girls would be a bit shocked. But then they'll be like and sometimes they would be pissed off and go away. And then they text me a week later and say, hey, what are you doing tonight? Because she was like, oh, how dare he? And then she go away and go, well, he didn't do anything wrong, actually. He just he just said where he's at. And actually, he was good in bed and fuck it. I'll fuck him until I get it, until I find a boyfriend. There you go. Yeah, what I like, which, you know, James first gave me this speech and it's basically everything you just said, but I broke it down in my mind like this. There's three options. You look at a website and there's your ninety nine dollar offer. There's the four ninety nine offer and there's the nine ninety nine offer. The ninety nine dollar offer is a one night stand. Right. The four ninety nine is is the most popular. And then the nine ninety nine is the fully committed relationship. And the most popular is. And you said nine ninety nine twice. Yeah. Which one's thing and you get the last one? No. Ninety nine dollars is a one ninety nine. Right. Ninety nine. That's a we're meeting. We're fucking. We're saying we're saying take care at the end. Right. Nine ninety nine. Nine hundred ninety nine. That's like, hey, let's get into a relationship and and go all in for ninety nine. Best value. Most popular is is, hey, I love what we're doing, you know, and I want to keep doing it because you're so fucking awesome. We're so fun and we're connecting. I love hanging out. I love talking with you. I love the sex we're having. And I'm not assuming anything about you or where you're at. But I'm just saying at this point in this moment in time, I'm not ready for a full blown deal. And that means, you know, it's possible that I'll be hanging out with other people and and you definitely can, too. But I'd love for us to continue with this. This thing we're doing. That was the four ninety nine. That's how I synthesize what you told me that day. And I've used. And just to note, just to note, guys, you don't tell the girls about the ninety nine. Yeah, that you know, you don't actually have a web page. You don't pop the web. Just look at this web page. Tell me what I would love to. I would love to see that. We should film a version of that. OK, I got three deals for that on the street sometime. Good day, gentlemen. I've just arrived back in Australia. Twenty eight hours travel. So if I'm looking pretty bleary eyed, that's why. I hope you enjoyed this little snippet from mine and John Keegan's rant about casual and open relationships. And if you'd like to learn how to get into those in the first place by learning to approach women in everyday situations, have scintillating conversations, get them on dates and be really clear and direct about your intentions, then you might want to consider joining us for our live workshops next year. So we've got workshops in Barcelona in April and May and workshops in the States later on in the year. So stay tuned for that. Click the link below for full details. Hopefully we'll see you on one of our live workshops for spring 2023. And now I'm going to go get a cappuccino and a meat pie and see what Australia is all about in the last year. All right, see ya, peace."}
