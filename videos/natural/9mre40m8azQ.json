Giving is a different action. This is my choice to hand something over and then the other person gets to receive it. Taking. Taking is something that I spoke about just before that a lot of men have issue with because it can be associated with abuse, with theft, with violence, with pure selfishness. However, especially in a relationship, if I don't have the intention to take, then the woman doesn't respect me really. She sees that I'm not a man who's able to get what he wants. Remembering that phrase, women love a man who knows what he wants and then the implication is, and can get it. Brackets, and can get what he wants. And what is it that he wants? He wants her, and he wants to conquer the world, and he wants to achieve things, and he wants to be a good father, and he wants to protect people, and he wants to look after his body. I know what I want, and I have ways to go and get it, and I'm going to get it most of the time. And if I don't get it, then I'm not going to fall into a screaming heap. I'm going to work out how do I adjust things to then go and get what I want. That's the kind of man that has integrity and she can rely on and trust over time. That's more likely to be the kind of man she wants to get into a relationship with and stay in a relationship with, right? So you must be able to take. But at the same time, you must be able to allow, allow others to take from you, especially in a relationship. What does a woman need from me and she will need to take it because I'm not always just going to give it. Giving is a different action. This is my choice to hand something over and then the other person gets to receive that. Whereas, if I allow somebody, that's not giving. It's like somebody wants something from me, and I allow them because I respect them, because I love them, because they need that, okay? And this is an interesting analogy of this or way to describe this is with a blowjob. You can give a blowjob, right? So the woman can give me it out of service, or I can take it. You know, I can say, get on your knees and suck my dick. And now I'm taking in the sense that I'm not forcing, but I am expressing my desire in no uncertain terms, and I want to use this person in a positive way as a sexual object. What does she get to experience then? She gets to experience allowing herself to be objectified and to be an object and a vehicle of pleasure, which is also a very validating thing. Of course, if she wants to please me, right? It's very validating because then she gets to experience being desired completely. I'm an animal and I have to take you, right? So to have a well-rounded relationship and to be a well-rounded human being, I think, you need to be able to understand that these intentions shift from very proactive, masculine, passive to very receptive, and you can even say feminine. It's a good thing to, we are not 100% masculine. I have feminine aspects in me. You do too. Learning how to receive information from your senses, to be able to listen, to be able to not always be pushing to get what you want, but to be able to feel the nuance of how this flow of different agendas that people have, particularly in a relationship, move, this will allow you to be far more delicate and far more artistic with the way that you navigate through the world.
