So in this video, I'm going to be doing a little show and tell about sex toys so this is my Home kit you have here. So these tools all here are anal toys so we're gonna be dealing with those separately and we're dealing with the ass and These here are all Pussy tools of some type or another Now You may be looking at that and thinking oh no, I have to go and buy 19 vibrators and dildos in order to satisfy a woman No, just remember. I'm a freak. I've done all the research for you So I can narrow it down to what you absolutely do need and then you can add anything else that you wish if you want to get more freaky so When we're looking at vibrators that are good quality, you always want to make sure that you're buying ones that are not no-name brands from China Primarily because we don't know what they're made of. So This is medical grade silicon. So it's inert. It's completely safe for insertion I have had bad experiences in the past with cheap vibrators that were made of I don't know what and they ended up like kind Of chemical burning the inside of a woman you do not want that experience neither She doesn't want it and you don't want it either. So make sure you get quality It doesn't doesn't mean you have to spend hundreds, but you should get a brand a name brand So if we if I was to like say what I absolutely must have out of all of this, it would be that All right. So this is The svakom a Swedish brand svakom is the brand and this one is called an Alice And this is a ripoff of this more expensive version Which is a Lilo is the brand and the type is called a Soraya, which is cute Now this one's definitely engineered more nicely. It has this loop here So you can it's easy to hold from different well, I turn it on different angles is easy to hold. They're both waterproof Like I wouldn't submerge them in a bath Theoretically you can but I probably wouldn't do that. You can use them in a shower if things are getting wet That's fine Because they've got these little holes that have got a seal in them So that even if some water gets there, apparently it won't mess it up. I haven't broken any with water so far So they seem to be good So, yeah, basically this one was developed from this one They have the same kinds of functions the main advantage of both these designs is this Curve that goes up with this bowl So if I'm inserting this into the woman from she's lying on her back right now inserting it in here What this does is this point here will make contact with the G spot Right where and then this little bullet here, which also vibrates I can just use it to press down on the clitoris and then I can you know go side to side To basically joystick my way to her orgasm, you know, literally if I put that in and you're like this Often that's it. Don't need any other anything else. She's done. So it's a very effective tool There are other directions and things we can use it for which I'll show you as well So the difference with the svarcom and and by the way, I don't get any commissions or anything Although I should so I'm basing this solely on my what works for me not on any commercial interests But the problem with this one I found is actually this this width here. You can see the width is is different All right. This one's much fatter and For a lot of girls, that'll be too hard to get inside that they're too small or maybe I'd use it later But this one is noticeably smaller. It's it's just shaped better more cock like this one has I mean It still works very well on girls if they're big enough, but and you can see the length as well is Longer on the Lilo so this is I found this to be too long for some girls because We have to insert all of that which is about five six inches or 15 18 centimeters ish In order to be able to apply this onto the clitoris whereas this one is about an inch shorter So I find it and the shape of it tends to work better So I do use both some girls have bigger pussies. This one has got like more horsepower You can hear it here and my mic compared to This one Yeah now You'll note that with all of these all vibrators have like 50 different functions. So and I just start pressing a button, right? and Then for example this one Is now doing this pulse Whoa, it's getting angry If you're enjoying this video and you would prefer to see an explicit version of this where I actually Demonstrate the tools and you can stop what you're doing right now Click the link below put your email in and you'll get immediate access to the naughty uncensored Explicit version of this video where I show you how to actually use the tools if you know what I mean, or if not just Stay watching the kiddie version of it. So yeah, all right All the way vibrators these days have a bunch of buttons and 50 different settings, right? When you turn it on it usually is just doing a straight vibration, right so you can hear It's humming away and then I increase it That like that full speed is way way too much for most girls Maybe maybe at the end, but it's usually too overstimulating. So I want to get this Low level hum and then as I'm going with the girl I can just ask her you want more and she says you want it faster or more vibration and then I'll give it like Three clicks right like ramp it up three clicks at a time And then you see if she's like tenses in any kind of way or she pulls away That's it's too much vibration too sensitive. Then I just take it down a couple of clicks, right? But what you don't like so if I just start pressing these random functions, which I never use Right, so in this function only that's vibrating that's not vibrating I press another function and I get this vibrate vibrate vibrate vibrate and do other ones where they go bit bit bit Bit bit all these different kind of syncopated Combinations. These are not good The one where it pulses and goes Gets more intense and then down. Yes those kind of ones where there's a consistency of sensation, right? So it's building and it goes down again. It's pulsing sure That might be cool to use but any of the ones where it's going to Like any of that kind of stuff it just breaks her concentration Right because she's trying, you know She's using the vibrations to build up to an orgasm and if she's building and then it stops and starts and changes speeds and so on Usually it's really distracting. It seems cool because it's you can it's kind of like getting ten different sensations, but it's not really practically functional So I just only pretty much only use the first setting which is vibrate So I just increase the intensity or lower the intensity of vibrations. Don't worry about any of the other settings. They're just gimmicks, basically So if you're so if you're only going to get one vibrator, this one costs about 80 euros. It's well worth it last I mean this one's on its last legs now, but that one's been I've had that for a few years The Lilo is much more expensive. It's 200 and something euros. It is very robust. It's really well made I've had this one for many years and it's still awesome But as I said, if you're only going to get one vibrator get that one because it'll fit everyone this one can be too big Now there are some variations on this You've probably seen the rabbit vibrator The ones that most people buy is this like it's obscenely huge one and there's kind of cheap 20 30 buck one It's the size of a fucking tennis ball can So it's quite unwieldy doesn't look very sexy and usually the top part is way too big So you can look around like this this brand particularly don't worry about it. It's like a specialty brand This is gold-plated. You don't need gold-plated vibrators. I do because I'm a Aesthetic and a freak but you don't need that but if you find one which has It's it's made of proper hospital-grade silicon. It has a similar Curvature with a bulb right so we hit the G spot and then it has instead of this one It has this little rabbit now The point of the rabbit is that I would put the this on either side of the clitoris Right, so if I'm inserting it and then these rabbit ears would go either side of the clitoris and then theoretically the clits in The middle being like hyper vibrated by these little rabbit ears So it can be a cool one It's like it's a good it's a good function but it doesn't have as much versatility as this because this can go in the ass this I can manipulate to like Put on put on to it like a singular point and really get a like a intense Focused vibration this one kind of is a one-trick pony. It has this feature works nicely But I would have that as a secondary vibrator, right? So I have that when I use that sometimes as just something that's a bit different creates different type of sensation Okay, so you can keep in mind to get the rabbit one Maybe as your second or third vibrator All right. So now moving on we're moving into more specialty items. This one here is Based on the famous Hitachi so that the Japanese Hitachi massager Which is like sold as a massage and not a vibrator But it's it's a bigger version of this and it has a cord right it's and it's the most strong vibrator You're gonna get so just you stick it in the wall and you've got full industrial power on it So this is a handheld version of it and there's a number of these different companies have ones this one the the smallest leaker ones You know much more functional than the big chunky one that you have to plug into a get an extension cord for so If we turn this one on Same thing. We don't want to worry about any of the fancy vibrations. It's just vibrating The good thing about this is its power so it has a very strong engine and Primarily its surface area, right? So unlike a tool like this which has a narrow surface area of contact So I might put it, you know on the clear us or use it in between the pussy lips or whatever This one as my friend sir Dominic would say I just jammed the Hitachi on and she's happier than a pig in shit is the way he would describe it Not very romantic, but you get the idea It's just like and we'll demo soon, but you know, you put it on the pussy and it's just working everything It's it's hard to mess this one up. It's just because it's smooth domed I put it, you know, the base pussy here the clitoris is here and I stick it on there Done. I like this. It's a very very effective. I don't need to be I don't need to get it in exactly the right spot I don't need to be doing any fancy strokes with it. Like I might with some of the other ones It's just you put it on it does the job and of course I can hand it to her It's easy for her to hold on to herself. She can find the place. You're not gonna get that inside I mean, it's possible, but I wouldn't I wouldn't try that. It's like, you know, you're only getting the first that much in And then I could you know, I can do these rotations. This one has nice kind of shapes on it So you get a bit of texture? Like so so that's a very powerful and user-friendly vibrator It's not as it doesn't have any as many functions as this right like this one There's so much I can do with the insertion inside outside on the clitoris on the g-spot this in the ass Over-the-pussy, I'll show you all that soon. There's a lot more I can do with this one This is like I use this one usually when a girl has trouble coming Right, so she's we've done I've tried everything else and then I pull out the this the finisher Or it's a good one for a girl to like use on herself who's not used to using toys, right? So you can just play with it. It doesn't she doesn't have to figure out too much She can hold it on it while you while she's sucking you while you're jerking off watching it something like that and then finally We have more specific g-spot tools so you can see here this this one You know curves up and it's covering the general surface area of the g-spot which the size of it is the size of a well, I was gonna say 50 cent piece in Australia, but you know, like Three centimeters four centimeters across is the kind of surface area of the g-spot Now when you get a hooked tool like this and there's all sorts of variations Which this is like the cheaper one often has like a bulb like a long hard stick a little bulb on the end but similar ideas is that this one is We're gonna put it Insert it in and it's right Directed on to the g-spot a small surface area very focused in that in that spot So this one is great for building a girl up for a squirting orgasm or a deep vaginal orgasm, right? So it's not very big so it's easy to get in she can put it on the spot and then she can kind of use that To angle or you can you know create lever creates a little bit of circle to stimulate the the top of the g-spot as well right, so With all of like with all of these Well, let's say, you know, all of these are kind of more specially ones This one's your good very general purpose don't know how to use a vibrator Can't fuck it up kind of one and then these are basically variations on the same theme With the sabacom and the Lilo being my recommended versions That one sabacom if you're gonna get nothing else cheap Extremely durable safe great vibrator and then you've got the rabbit variations if you want to like the all these other variations like You know, you're into toys and the girls you're with are into toys now You should keep in mind that I wouldn't I couldn't say the percentage on it but there's a decent amount of girls who don't like using toys at all and the and I've asked them about it and it's usually because It doesn't feel real right like they want to feel the because nothing is gonna compare even if you have one that's got electric Electricity running through it and it heats or something the sensation of a real cock that's squishy and warm and and responsive You know, it's an alive organ Some girls just don't like using plastic things on them. It just feels I'm really like if I'm with a man I don't want to do it. I don't I don't want to use something else so the way I found that out is Because usually how do I bring a vibrator into the play and guys are often worried like how do I do that? She's gonna think that I've used it on someone else. Yeah, that's fine The only the only main concern will be cleanliness And as I said before when I take a vibrator out occasionally a girl says something like oh Is that clean or did you wash it or something? Mostly not and then I simply say it's it's very clean much cleaner than you or I I've washed it twice, right? So which is what I always do after a girl leaves I wash my toys Then when another girl's coming over all the same girls coming over I wash them again and lay them out on a towel So they're you know air dried so they're safe So usually it's just a matter of I reach into my drawer Or I get up and I go over pull it pull it out pull out a couple of toys and I take it over And then I just do it with certainty and almost Most always the girl is really happy to do it. Very occasionally I had a girl who said, I don't like toys or I'm not into vibrators. Cool, put it down. If a girl doesn't like it, she doesn't like it. Like if it was a longer term partner, then I would probably discuss and say, you know, I'd love to experiment with you and try some new things with toys. You said that wasn't your thing, but it'd be cool if we could play with it and see if there's something that you do like. So, you know, we may introduce them as a relationship goes. But in general, if the girl's like hard no on it, then I don't bother. But the vast majority of girls, I pull it out and I do it with certainty. She's cool with it. So most of the time I pull it out and then I lubricate both surfaces. So wet the pussy, wet the vibrator, either in her mouth, in my mouth, put some saliva on, you might use, you know, you could use lubricant as well. And then we start to play. So let's demonstrate some of these important tools and see exactly how to use them on a real life girl.
