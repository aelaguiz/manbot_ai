I'm trying to be transparent. I'm trying to Get my needs met in a clean and obvious way as opposed to a underhanded covert contract nice guy kind of way And it doesn't always match up, right? So you're trying to do direct things and then internally you have this feeling of like, okay I don't know if I am that guy. I'm not always that baller beast. It's just like, okay I know what I want and I go for it there is a bit of that fake it till you make it which is kind of what you're going at going with and You'll embody it at some points and other points. You'll feel like you're a bit of a fraud and women will notice both those things So having said that I hope that makes you you know Feel a bit better about some of the doubts you may have and the issues that you're going through And it's beautiful that the LDA Especially on the chat that everyone is so raw and vulnerable that people are opening up and a good example is Rory who as you guys know is like really working on his text game and coming up with some really cool stuff and Killing it and then he also put up a maybe a little bit drunken. I don't know Roy. He said maybe a bit drunk but like Put up a very heartfelt audio where he's like admitting that he doesn't always feel like he can match this I'm paraphrasing you. So, please excuse me if I'm not saying it exactly right but that you know you're presenting yourself online as this badass Dom who's going for rough sex and cuddles straight away and knows what he wants and then There's also a part. He's like, can I back that up? And that's it. That's an interesting paradox with With directness, right? So direct as I've said many a time is not a line or an opener or a thing you say It's a way of life. It's a philosophy where where I am trying to be clear. I'm trying to be transparent I'm trying to get my needs met in a clean and obvious way as opposed to a Underhanded covert contract nice guy kind of way and it doesn't always match up, right? So you're trying to do direct things and then internally you have this feeling of like, okay I don't know if I am that guy. I'm not always that baller beast. That's just like, okay I know what I want and I go for it there is a bit of that fake it till you make it which is kind of what you're going at going with and You'll embody it at some points and other points you'll feel like you're a bit of a fraud and women will notice both those things Right, so you may have situations where you you go all-in and you're like, okay I'm this super dom and I know exactly what I want who I am and then you meet the girl and she's looking going Hmm Not sure if I'm not sure if I buy it which is fine too, right? It's that's a big part of how you learn. There's no way to Stay in isolation and prepare yourself Endlessly for the perfect battle you have to go out there and enter the fray make mistakes get smashed around in terms of your ego and your identity and and Feeling like a fool and all those kinds of things and then over time you do step into that Embodiment of directness that embodiment of dominance that embodiment of grounded yet flexible masculinity and it's a process and it doesn't take Eight weeks, right? It's a it's a lifetime process I know I can 100% back up any claims I have about being a dominant male Particularly in the bedroom because I've been working on that dominance like the technical aspects of it through through BDSM increasing my sexual skill set and Coming more and more into my power as I've matured into the person that I am now and I'm not finished But I know I can back that up. Whereas back in the day. I don't know some music many years ago Sure, I would I'd be in those situations where the girls like, ah, he's that guy and then I'm like I'm not really or I can't get it up or how do I tie this knot or Am I am I allowed to spank you? All right, and then okay. Sometimes the girl will be like, ah, this is this is not what I this is not what I bought I didn't this is not exactly the thing that I thought I was signing up for so have patience You you guys are on the right track Vasily says can you make a short speech how you efficiently efficiently? Recover from being morally wounded. I'm not sure if that translates. So well when you say morally wounded Mortally wounded what what exactly do you mean by morally wounded? That's I've never heard that phrasing before doesn't it feel like an eternal battle yet. It is it's a fantasy to think that you're gonna reach some point where it's just like I Am done You know You are never done and we and we're never truly satisfied and and that projection that we have of ourselves All of us have it in our mind of like our perfected self It's a it's it's a good thing to aim for right where we're aiming for and perfection is like What does that mean like perfection only really exists mathematically really it doesn't it doesn't exist as a we are in Completely imperfect human beings. We're not even evolved correctly Our knees are not exactly the way that they should be we have X was it which one do we have the spleen? No, we need the spleen. What's the one the thing that we don't need? There's a bit of our tailbone That's not appendix. Thank you It's like we are not perfect creatures and we never will be so you can fuck that off as an idea It's it's kind of liberating and I gave that up gave up on the idea of being perfect a long time ago and it is it's a really the journey is coming to acceptance and self-love of yourself as a perfectly imperfect wonderful and flawed creature and We actually need the appendix, okay. All right. Well, I'm not a doctor obviously, but you know what I mean, right? This is not this is not the end point of evolution Is it right that we didn't just stop it whatever 200,000 years ago and evolutions like cool perfect machine done The only perfect machines that really exist is like cockroaches and crocodiles and snakes. Those motherfuckers have been around trilobites And they're trilobites have gone on they you know, those things have been around for millions of years and nature's like done that shit works We continue on our personal evolutionary path throughout our life and Like I you know I used to be extremely hardcore Buddhist and I was really gunning for Enlightenment because that was my perception was when I reach this breakthrough that I will be perfect and I'll never have my doubts and worries And self-loathing and any of the internal issues anymore. I'll just be at peace all the time I mean, maybe that's possible. But for me I came to an acceptance of like, okay, man I won't reach that point But I'll be working towards towards that and then that will lead me in better places than if I'm working towards being fucked up Notes cockroaches are perfect. Yeah, if someone finds your LDA notes like what is this?
