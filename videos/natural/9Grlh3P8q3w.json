So it's about her experience first. I know that kind of sounds like a lonely place to be as a dom, but once that happens, she rewards you in ways that you can't even comprehend until you get there. I'd like you first to introduce yourself and tell the crew a bit about who you are and what your experience is because all I know is that I just kind of talk you up every time I mention you and say this guy's crazy and just you wait. So I've been leading to you. So yeah, give us an intro. Who the hell are you? So hello, everyone. I am Sir Dominic, aka Dominic Sloan, aka the sexuality coach for the naturals. I've been a professional dom now for over seven years, a men's coach for at least double that. I've been fascinated with sexuality my whole life, starting from about 17 when I went to my first kink party. So I've been on an odyssey, obviously, very obsessed with kink, but also we lived in tantra, sex magic, sex healing. So there's a whole bunch of sexuality kind of disciplines revolving in my brain. So that's the short version. So I've been working for one of Australia's top BDSM houses and I work with couples. I work primarily with women, do the coaching, do the whole thing. Because when you say, I work with couples and I work in a dungeon, most guys have no idea what that means. So can you talk us through, how does it work if a lady wants to use your services, how would that usually go down and kind of talk us through a little bit about what a session might look like? Yeah, so they hit my website, they get a bit of an understanding of what's on offer. There's a list of services and they reach out to me and they basically discuss what they're looking for. Some are married, some are not. There's a whole range of different reasons why they would come to see me, but primarily they're looking for a one-on-one experience with someone that's safe and that they can trust the experience. So it's everything except full blown sex. So I don't work as an escort, even though I am a sex worker. I don't have sex with them. I do everything except that. So kinks, spanking, flogging, whatever their desires are, I basically shape an experience for them usually at a minimum of an hour, roughly usually between two to three hours. So they're coming to me to experience kink in a professional setting in a dungeon. So what does a dungeon mean? So a dungeon means just a place space that's set up exactly for that experience. So it's full of specific equipment like spanking benches, there's a whole bunch of, I could list equipment for the next two hours, but I won't. So there's a whole, it's all set up and it's themed for that experience. So it's quite a special experience for them because a lot of them, I'd say about 60%, it's their first ever time. So I'd say the vast majority of my role is introducing women and couples. That's a different thing, but introducing people to kink has been pretty much the mainstay of what I do. And when you say you work mostly with women that haven't had experiences before, how are they getting this in their head in the first place? They're taking the jump from some, they've got an idea right through to going into a dungeon with a stranger. What's going on, I guess, psychologically or what's leading women to reach out to you, do you think? Well, there's a bunch of different reasons. It's like, as we'll probably get into, kink and the whole rough sex experience, it's very biologically and instinctually driven. So that usually they've had this deep yearning for as long as they can remember, and they've never had an outlet. So that's one camp of women. The other women, they've either got partners and their partners are not into it. So they're looking for an experience where they're guaranteed that the person that they're having experience with isn't going to mess up their personal lives. So that's another reason. That's another camp. Right. So you mean a woman is with or without her partner knowledge going to you because it's emotionally safe in the sense you're not going to get involved in their relationship and cause drama. You mean like that? Well, that's one of the main concerns. Obviously, the other is hygiene, safety, someone that they can trust, someone who's accountable. It's not just that they've met me on Tinder and they'll never see me again. They can find me. So they feel quite safe in that regard because I've got like 64 pages of content on my website. It's not just something that a guy has set up as a ruse to get free body experiences out of. So one of the other reasons is they don't want to go with a stranger. They want to have their first experience. They want to be safe. They want to know that that person is experienced. So yeah, that's probably the primary reasons for when I do the one-on-one sessions with women. That's usually the main reason.

I would assume that a lot of people in this chat have either never done any kink or if they have, they've kind of just dabbled in a bit of spanking and a bit of kind of impromptu kink. Usually, as we've seen when we run the Sex God Masterclass, there's often a lot of initial mental resistance to the whole idea of it at all because the misconception is often that this is abusive or that like what is the point of this in the first place? Like you remember when we had that client last class who was saying like because he'd signed up for this expensive course and he'd come along because he believed that it was useful and he believed us but his kind of initial question was, why are we doing this? Is this because we do this to the woman and the woman just sort of puts up with it? And like he really couldn't get his head around initially that this was for women, you know, that this was beneficial to them. I've certainly heard clients and people that I've talked to about kink in the past like think that okay, is this something that only people who are, you know, touched up by their uncle are into or people who are really like have just gone so far off the deep end that they just need more and more extreme things because otherwise they can't feel anything anymore. I think there's, you know, there's quite a lot of misconceptions about what is kink and what is the purpose of it in the first place. Do you want to talk a little bit about that? You know, why kink? Why are we even doing this? I'll start with what I believe my definition of kink is. So for me, it's everything that isn't just straight up penetrative sex or oral sex in a vanilla context that is also interesting. So it's anything from, you know, impact, bondage, role plays, there's a whole myriad of experiences that you can have in a sexual context which isn't just vanilla sex. So for me, everything else outside of that is kink in some way. So basically, anything that's not like a British man just sort of wedged between the legs of his wife going, yes, think of England, dear. She's like, is this kink? Oh no, this is not kink. Anything else is. I'm done. If he was wearing a penguin suit, you know, and that was his thing, it probably is, yeah. That sounds hotter, yeah, penguin suit. So the thing that I want to add to the definition of what kink is, is that this is my classic story. I've been at many dinner parties and people go, what do you do? And I say, do you want the real answer or you want the fake answer? And everyone's like, of course, we want the real answer. And I say, well, I beat women for cash. And they asked me to do these things. And then they go, oh my God. And then everyone has a panic attack. And then I do my little survey of like, who here has ever been spanked before during sex and enjoyed it? And you know, all the women's hands go up. And then 10 seconds ago, they were like, they were dissing it. So there's definitely the conception out in the mainstream world or whatever. Yeah. Yeah. There's a conception of what kink is and then what it actually is. And it's anything that's interesting. So the vast majority of people have experienced it, even if they don't identify with it. So I'm pretty sure a lot of the guys here, they'll go, I'm not kinky, but then, you know, we'll examine their sex life and they're doing kink virtually 80% of the time. I think everyone here is certainly kink curious. That's why, you know, that's why we have 73 people on here right now. They're all definitely interested, but I guess what I want to kind of dispel is some of the myths around like being abusive or being, uh, you know, domineering, like, cause... We'll get into that. Definitely. So there is, there is definitely a fine line between what's fun and what's abusive. So the first and foremost point is, is it consensual? And not just consensual, is there informed consent? So informed consent is a concept which did come out of the kink world. Thank you to the kink world, which is kind of bleeding over to the vanilla world. So informed consent means everyone is aware of the risks, what's involved, what are the responsibilities, um, you know, there's clear communication and everyone's on the same page. So as long as you're doing that, that's a very good start to not be domineering and just being ethically dominant. So that's definitely one start. The second, now this is where it gets a little bit of a gray area is what's abusive and what's not, especially when you're playing with force and impact and, you know, pretty hard world violence. Yeah. Well, eroticized aggression. How about that? I don't like the word violence. Yeah. So the way that I frame it, it's eroticized aggression because the dominant is pushing. So there is a fine line. It's very hard to define. It's something that over time I get from a feeling, a felt sense, you know, if it was, if I was to write it on paper, it's very hard. So I would say what is abusive when it comes to the bedroom antics is something that obviously is if the woman feels kind of, you know, I'm, I'm guessing I'm speaking to guys here. So every time I say the woman, it means a submissive. Um, obviously if she's coerced or she's not feeling it and she's doing it out of a place of like to keep the man happy that actually gets along to the size of, along to the side of abusive and as well as anything that's done with a backed by fear or. Threats or whatever. Yeah. Threat. That was the word that I was looking for. So that's the kind of depth, the clear definition of the difference between dominance and domineering is using a threat and the woman is doing it from a place of fear instead of doing it from a place of like joy and of giving and receiving. So the pleasure pain concept, can you talk about this notion of pleasure and pain? I feel like things to know there. So as far as my research has concluded, pleasure and pain are just experiences interpreted by the brain and the pleasure and pain center of the brain are literally cousins. Like they go along the same pathways of the body. So that's why a lot of people find pain pleasurable and see, I don't even want to say pain because it's a very strong word because when we hear pain as a concept, as a word, we all like, oh, it's unpleasant. It's an unpleasant thing you don't want. Yeah. So how about we just change it from instead of pleasure and pain to pleasure and sensation that isn't automatically interpreted as pleasure by the average person. Now, the thing that you touched on before was endorphins. So when you start to spank someone or some, whether it be a girl, you get hit yourself, the skin starts to go red. So that's the body saying there's a trauma here. There's some trauma here. And then that gets interpreted by the brain as being pleasurable for a masochist that would love it completely. Or most girls can handle the heavier sensation that isn't say straight out painful. So the body then goes, okay, there's something here. We need to send blood there because there's a trauma. So we need to send white blood cells down there. So that's why the skin gets red when you're inflicting pain, inverted commas. And that is also a signal to the brain to send endorphins. So endorphins are the chemicals in the brain, which allows us to cope with painful sensations. In a neuroticized fashion, pleasure and pain explodes their brains, something shocking. Most, I'd say 90, 95% of girls that I've played with don't take extreme pain. They don't take canes or anything like that. Most will take spanking and specifically the floggers that I make. They take those quite easily because it's, yes, it's not as pleasurable as say having a feather over their skin, but it's a sensation that turns them on. It makes them come alive. It sends electricity through their nervous system. There's a whole bunch of different reactions that are going on. Mixing it with the pleasure aspect, because they're so close to each other, it kind of sends like an overload to the brain and it ends in orgasm, usually. We're not going to do it anyways. So pain, let's not use that word to say sensation. It's exciting. It's definitely bringing them into that point of stillness that you mentioned before, how there is nothing more in that moment except the sensation. So there is kind of like these little mini moments of enlightenment. Yeah, they're actions. It is a moment of zen or enlightenment in that precise moment. They're focused completely there. Their mind is still. your brain going on, there's no thoughts about if they've left the fucking iron on or you know nothing like that. They're fully in that present moment. If you can skillfully do you know transverse the pleasure and pain dichotomy, you will be one percent of the one percent because the vast majority of men don't know how to do it properly. So let's talk about choking right. So choking is one of the things that a lot of women, extremely a lot of mostly many women like. It's all the rage. Everyone's heard about it on the internets now. So it is something that a lot of women want. It is dangerous of course because you are squeezing someone's neck and you could theoretically fucking damage or kill them. So oh yeah, I'm giving disclaimers here that this is not a choking class that I'm doing right now. When we do sex god masterclass, we do choking classes where the guys practice on each other first then we practice on the women. You feel what it's like to be choked yourself. So this is just for educational, this is just for entertainment purposes what I'm explaining. It's not an official class so please don't go out and think you know exactly everything from what I've said. But the most important thing I would say is that you understand you're never putting pressure on the front of the throat and you may think you're not because sometimes when you're squeezing on the sides you will actually still be applying pressure in the middle of the hand and pushing onto where the Adam's apple is for the men. So that's the most important thing is that we know there should be zero pressure. In fact, I will keep like a millimeter or two space between the skin of my webbing of my hand and the neck just to be sure, right. So that's the first thing because you can crush someone's windpipe and it feels really horrible. I mean try that if you press on the front of your throat a bit it doesn't feel nice at all. So what you're doing is you're actually applying pressure to the blood vessels. The idea is that you're cutting blood to the brain not oxygen because when when you choke someone correctly like I'm actually choking myself now my face will go a bit red as I start to lose blood flow but I can still I can still breathe, right. So I'm not putting pressure on the windpipe in any way I'm starting to compress the arteries and I don't can't remember what they're called so someone can tell me on the sides. So if you see the V shape here what I'm doing is I'm actually applying a clamp not gripping with my fingers because if I do that that's actually not choking at all that's grabbing by the neck muscles and I can do that I can grab someone by the basically the back of the neck here with it with a clamp and that's I can control it like that that's not a choke that's me gripping into the muscle. I definitely don't ever want to be gripping in with the fingertips into the windpipe or into the blood vessels either. So what I'm doing is this is this clamp motion and I need to be really conscious and really aware when I do this that I'm only that I'm putting even pressure on both sides as opposed to one being one which is common if you're not paying attention is you're putting too much pressure on one side and it's uncomfortable on one side and then not support on the other so there is this real sense of like they're both clamping at the same speed and take it lightly at first. You will be surprised once you start if you become decent at choking that you'll get things where girls will grab your hand and fucking push it harder than you think you should go which at first can be pretty scary because you're like fuck she's a delicate thing I'm going to break her but if you do it correctly they can take a good amount of pressure some girls will want you to knock them out I won't go that far I will take it to the point where I see pink her face going pink and her getting a little glazed look in the eyes that's about where I'm going to take it because that's where she's starting to get a bit light-headed from lack of oxygen but I'm not gonna some girls would prefer if I just kept on going until she passed out I think that's too dangerous it's not worth the risk so I just do it to there and then I'll hold it for uh and I will only have done that if I've told her to tap me because a verbal cue might not work because she might be getting a bit difficult to speak so I just say you know I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna choke you now uh or or I don't necessarily say I'm going to choke you I start doing it if I've gotten good responses and then I say tap me if it's too much right and then I'll and then I'll apply the pressure where I can feel that I'm compressing the blood vessels and then I hold it there and I'm usually fucking her at the same time uh or pulling her hair or using a vibrator maybe um because it intensifies the what's going on for a pussy like women many times have said that that's the easiest way for them to come is being fucked or having a vibrator whilst being choked because it gets them out of their head gets them totally into their body there's there's this rush from this light asphyxiation and uh it seems to be awesome for so there's some basics you can do a two-handed one but the two-handed is even more difficult um but yeah so there's some there's some basics please please be careful with this please no pressure on the front please use good communication can be dangerous as a as a general rule of thumb try not to do more than 10 to 12 13 seconds at the most when you're first starting like literally count to 10 and stop irrespective of if this is like your first experiences with it stop there get used to it before you go further in with it um I wouldn't be doing it me personally I don't do it with girls I've just met especially first session maybe first session I'll do something very light and test the reaction more than anything but it's not something I generally go down too often I could actually link a if you guys want a link to a diagram and I can point out the different arteries what they do and stuff if you guys you want that of course they do they're of course they do this is a bunch of techie techie nerds that want to know nerdy stuff we're all sex nerds you've got two points you can do the choke you've got generally aim for the carotid artery so because once that artery goes up towards near the jawbone you'll see that it breaks off into two so if you're only grouping one you don't have the other properly it's you're not going to get the effect they're looking for so it goes down a bit and you'll see where the you're basically trying to get between where it says common um carotid artery and the internal carotid artery you see there's a junction point where they they break out so you're trying to get that one for the maximum effect but please guys don't go more than 10 seconds at the start yeah yeah it's more and you know you'll see a lot of girls go I want to pass out and just just say I personally just say no I don't do that personally I get them to a point I when I start to see their eyes go a bit then I let it go instantly and then the thing is you can let it go count another 10-20 seconds and then you can go again because you're not cutting it you're you're cutting a bit then allowing cutting a bit and allowing so you can you can do it you know quite often if you're not going the full tilt to the point that they're passing out it can be this thing that you do primarily they enjoy it more when they're orgasming so you can do it without that it still feels good but the idea is to you know the most optimal time is around because essentially it's the same as in they start to feel what you feel when you have nitrous oxide or happy gas you know you're cutting oxygen to the blank the brain the brain starts to do its thing and everything starts to become heightened so check out that diagram and please no longer than 10 seconds like really stay safe with this out of every single activity this is the most riskiest one can get you in trouble the other side of it as well for a safety legal standpoint is that it can um leave bruising around the neck right it's very hard to explain bruising yeah it doesn't that's not a good look right you know she goes to the cops and says he tried to choke me and you say but she wanted it they're not going to believe you 90 99 times out of 100 so be extremely careful with that yeah i can't emphasize it enough because i've seen some horror stories i've seen all the when people have died from asphyxiation um and the thing is that what was james was saying is absolutely correct when you're pushing forward you're actually collapsing the esophagus if that happens who knows what she can end up dead you're calling the ambulance straight away um so you know it's something to be very very careful i can't emphasize it enough i think we've done our due diligence now we're gonna put it out into the universe i don't agree on any of it yeah that's that was all just theoretical we've never done it ourselves can you talk a little bit about the art of being a dom what it's really like to be a dominant person i feel like it's not just slapping and choking uh that would make a nice frame for what will be discussed next so yeah that's that's cool so yeah what is the what's the felt sense or the experience like or what's what are the qualities that make a man dominant as opposed to just the technical things of eating so first and foremost bdsm kink is defined by these two words power exchange so i need to define this before we can get to that so obviously you know the people that involve exchange power the sub gives the dom the power to work within the parameters of what she's okay with so the dominant that's where he actually gets the dominant he gets to move within the parameters or the list of the activity she's open to and then the dom gives the sub the power to call the shots to a degree so it is a paradox so first and foremost if you're not doing it from a place of this paradox in my opinion it's not healthy that being said you know really complicated intrinsic very deep ds which is dominant submissive ms master slave relationships they can like push past this line but that's generally not the case with 98 women in the world so we're not going to be discussing any of that today so the really intrinsic stuff we might be able to touch on it as themes but generally we're sticking into the world of ethical ds so what's it like to be an ethical dom you are essentially a giver you're leading and giving at the same time so the paradox is that you're surrendering to the limits and the boundaries that the sub dictates so if you can't handle that kink is not for you in my opinion anyways yes that's that's an important thing isn't it because like i've i've seen that a little bit when i've gone to a couple of play parties and um and when i've talked to girls about their experiences with guys who say they're doms um that often it can be that a man is actually compensated for his lack of confidence or his you know his insecurities and so he learns a few kind of techniques and maybe he you know gets some of the the kit and then starts belting women uh you know in order to make himself feel powerful as opposed to what you're talking about which because i i mean i know you very well and i know you're an extremely empathetic person and i've seen you i've seen you do atrocious things to women in a consensual space uh dom does dom does demonstrations as part of the sex god master class here in this in this house and also i've been to some play parties where i've seen him work and i mean it's truly uh electrifying and terrifying to watch when when you're going for full tilt you know you know in a very good way it like makes you that's your compliment um but then the paradox being that you know i've i've seen you work therapeutically with women as well uh and just with your friends like you're you're certainly someone who's a who's a giving person um and and i'm i think we've we've talked about this before that there are certainly types of doms that are more on the sadistic side that that they're you know it's they get off on the on the deliverance of pain and and kind of selfishly taking and there is a place where that can work too because you can have a masochist who wants that and that would be a more delicate kind of negotiation but okay there are certain dynamics where that that can work but you and i are both uh you describe us as like tops right like or as um well yeah so i'll i'll describe that i'll get to that in one second there is one point i did i forgot to add ethical and healthy dominance is where you're lifting the self-esteem of the submissive so it's it's about her experience first i know that kind of sounds like a lonely place to be as a dom but once that happens she rewards you in ways that you can't even comprehend until you get there so as long as you're aiming to make it something healthy you know whether you're exploring trust or boundaries or even playing with fear it doesn't matter as long as the the intent and it's something that she can feel not just here with words because words are meaningless as long as she can if she can actually feel over the course of the experience of playing with her that she's raised that she's held you know within a non-judgmental space all of the all the positive um healthy conscious relating aspects come into this as long as that is what's at the cornerstone of the experience and that she's kind of i know it sounds weird but left better than when you found up then that's the cornerstone of ethical dominance in the way i like to play specifically the people that don't do that i kind of question them and i think there's a bit of pathology as you've just touched on there's other massive issues going in whether it be insecurities or just you know hating hating on women oh yeah destroy their self-esteem it can be complete there's psychopaths in the world you put a cane or a flogger in his hand and he's and a psychopath's happier than a pig in shit so you know it's it's not where i'd like to play what's up gentlemen that was fucking cool right i was working on this video with the editors over the last few days because i'd forgotten what me and dom had talked about because i tend to because so much stuff happens in my life and i'm watching back going this is fucking deep nasty good shit uh you know"}
