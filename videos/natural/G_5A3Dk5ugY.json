And most importantly, you have... So I am, as I hope you know, dating coach Hayley Quinn, and I'm joined today by one of my other fellow, sort of like somewhat colleagues, somewhat someone I admire within the whole dating and men's lifestyle industry. It's the fantastic James Marshall, founder of The Natural Lifestyles, who I've had a lot of pleasure with working with over the years. Thank you so much for being interviewed today. Hi everybody. I'm James Marshall reporting from Portugal. Good to be here. And this is kind of like the last of the dating coaches. You know, when you like, this corona thing is clearing a lot of fat out of a lot of industries, including the dating coaches. It's like, who will be the last dating coaches standing at the end of this? Yeah. And I think like, I like how that we both had the same idea here, where you've got to camp to a farm in Portugal, and I've gone to one in France. You know, so we could be amongst, there's clearly some commonalities there. We could be amongst goats, chill out and think about stuff. Yes. I was prepping for this for a long time. I've been paranoidly thinking about this or other eventualities. So that was part of the reason why I bought a nice country house. Yeah. And what was funny, you brought up the whole COVID-19 elephant in the room, because what I actually wanted to talk to you about is how people can use their time purposefully right now, because it kind of feels like dating is cancelled, socialising is potentially cancelled. And I think a lot of people will be listening to the messages out there and think, well, I was just on my way off of my sofa to do something about this area of my life, but oh no, look, the universe is clearly telling me that I should just sit here, chill out, get a bit fat, complete that latest series on Netflix. So I guess I wanted to speak to you about, particularly for the guys out there, with not being able to physically meet someone, being a thing at the moment, what can guys do purposefully during this time to make themselves more attractive as a man? Okay. Good question. Well, firstly, I think it's okay that everyone does a bit of Netflixing and chilling the one where you're alone. I think that is okay, because it's interesting to see how online coaching industries are pivoting and a lot of them doing it very, very fast and effectively, right? So you get guys that were business coaches suddenly shifting into, okay, now you must use this time to optimize 100% hustle from home, quickly start an online business, get jacked, be optimized, ready for the next stage in life, which I think is a good sentiment. Like that is good advice, but it's also fairly unrealistic for somebody who is like, let's say of average motivation in general. And then to, because I'm sure you've done this, I've done this at some points in your life where you're like, that's it. I'm gonna go and become, in your case, you know, I'm just gonna do Zook four hours a day and I'm just gonna become the baddestest Zookist that ever existed. And, you know, like people throw themselves in like, okay, I will do all of this stuff. And because humans are lazy and most of us are not super disciplined unless we have a structure enforcing discipline on us, we usually let that drop and slide and we end up back to being our base level lazy selves, whether that's in dating or finances or health or whatever. So what I think is the first thing I would be telling guys to do is to take a stock take of what you currently now are doing, right? Because everyone has habits where you are all in habit patterns right now. You have a daily routine. It may be, it's different than it was three weeks ago, but you have one. And so for tomorrow or when this video comes out, just on a little bit of paper or on your phone, make a note of how do you spend your time and don't try and change it, right? So then you will get a real honest stock take of this is how you use Corona time. And it involves three hours wasted on, and you can just include Netflix, browsing YouTube, any of the rents, looking at screens, looking at us probably. As like, I do three hours of that. I do, you know, I do a bit of this and I did a bit of exercise that day and so on. And you'll get an accurate representation of what you're doing. Now, then what I would do, what I would recommend is fast forward to day one of when lockdown opens up, because it will sooner or later in your country or your city, it'll be a different time from other places, but there will be a time where the government, when the governments say, okay, everyone, you can come out now. And for the first week, people will be tentative and they'll be, you know, keeping away from each other a bit. And then it'll be back to some kind of new normal, at least within that country, that's my prediction. So the borders between countries may still be locked, but within countries, they'll have to open up at some point. So my question to you guys, gents, is what are you gonna do on day one? And I think if you chart, what are you doing right now? Honest appraisal. And then realistically, if you don't change anything between now and then, what are you going to do on day one, right? Because for some men, it will be so obvious. It's like the moment the fucking doors open, I'm out there, I'm gonna run up and go, hi, you're the first woman and I wanna say hi. You know, there's gonna be plenty of guys who take this as a wake up call and go, I'm not wasting much of my time anymore. I'm in any area of my life. And I hope that's what a lot of people take from this. And so they are mentally preparing and maybe they're researching the information they need, but they're really got a much more clear sense of making a vow to themselves. Like there's no more, I'm a bit scared of talking to, maybe I should have put, it's like the net effect of what you did for the last X number of years is proven now. Now's what you got to see, here's your dividend for your effort. And if it's zero, it's gonna stay that way. That's the important thing to think about. If you come out day one and continue doing what you did, you will get the same thing that you got, which you know what it is now, because there's no other distractions or busyness or maybe I'm gonna meet that girl that's half flaking. There's none of that to like distract yourself with. It's like, here's the result, you alone, fuck, what are you gonna do when the doors open? That's what I would be thinking as like a simple way to, let's say signpost, how you can use this time more effectively. Now, then that leads to the question, how do you fill the rest in? We can look at that, but that's my first thoughts. And I'm glad that you said that actually, because I think one of the things I've heard about this time or the sensation that people are having, it's almost like the universe has played a big game of like musical chairs or something with us and the music's just stopped. And what you have is what you have, whether that's financially or romantically. And so, so many people, men and women that I'm speaking to are saying like, oh my gosh, if I'd have known this was gonna happen, I would have been more proactive or I would have actually sought to have some form of a relationship. So I have someone to like ride, bit of a selfish motivation, someone to ride out this period of time with. So I think it is a big wake up call. I also think something else I'm really noticing is that people have, as one of my female friends put it, skin hunger. Like people are starting to really miss that level of interaction and human contact. So I hear what you're saying about imagining people coming out of their hiding and being a little bit tentative at the start and then getting back to normal. But I also think that we could be in for a period of time that's, have you ever seen like mayflies? And what they do? Are these a little fruit flies or something? They're these bugs, right? Like, bear with me through this metaphor. I'm all about like using the natural world as metaphors for dating, go for it. Right, so these mayflies, look it up on YouTube, everybody. They live underground for years as a little larvae by themselves. And then they get 24 hours where they go out and they're allowed out. And then obviously they meet one another and the men die, as is the common narrative. But I could see it kind of being like that, that we could also have some release of this pent up energy that nobody's expressing right now. Like for a British lady, you really did come out and say that Hayley. That's, you know, what I'm trying to say is that when we're allowed out, perhaps I think people would mingle more than they would usually. Yes. In a crazy frenzy, which I mean, I'm obviously hoping that nobody dies as a result of that. And it's just that they just meet one another. Yes. But I think being able to capitalize on that and then also not using this time so you can accelerate when the doors open on the other side. Right. Would be a very wise thing to do. Yes, you are very right. And I think your prediction is correct. And you're accidental proof of this in the sense that you are about to have a baby soon, right? Very soon. Very soon. And I dubbed this generation, the coronials. And yours was just like timing wise, I guess, but there will be, when the doors open, there will be a lot of people getting pregnant, possibly to people they shouldn't get pregnant to. That's, you know, cause there'll be a lot more hormones and less decision-making power. But yes, you were right. People are going to get laid. People are going to go out and fuck and people are going to, they do have skin hunger, which sounds like a zombie thing. Even I have, I've got a cat and I don't really like cats, but now I've been like holding it. I'm like, I'm alone. No, it's all right. I chose to be alone. So let's talk about that then in terms of prepping yourself, like for coming out on the other side. Now there's definitely all the online dating stuff. And I'm actually going to ask you about that in our interview in reverse because you're definitely more skilled and more experienced than I am at that. So I don't think I will cover that so much, but I would be looking at also, cause seduction doesn't, and dating doesn't happen in a vacuum, right? It happens as a part of your life. And so right now, okay, you can't run up to girls on the street or in the bar and go and talk to them. You can't go on dates, all right? So you do have your excuse for that. But what I would also be looking at is doing a stock take as well on your daily life, but looking at your social life, right? So I would literally go and write down every person that you know and break them into categories. And this may seem a bit like, well, why am I putting my mother in a category that seems a bit dystopian? I'm like, yeah, welcome to the dystopian future. No, it's, so it's like, so we put the like grandparents who will be turned into food sources in one category, the next breeding category. There'll be people that are your inner circle, your trusted bros, your family members, one category. There will be the people that you are hanging out with and doing and creating something with. And I always found this group to be a really dynamic group. It's maybe people you don't know that well, they might be reasonably new into your life, but there's a lot of energy surrounding that combination because you're collaborating on something, you're doing a project, putting on a party together. You're just someone who's into this scene that you're really into, whether it's medieval jousting or whatever. And so there can be a lot of energy that happens because the old school people, even though you may love them and you've known them for 20, 30 years or whatever, it's very likely you guys have a routine and maybe you do lots of amazing stuff, but maybe they're just the people that you see for old time's sake out of nostalgia and you do what you always did. Maybe that's, maybe it's playing a game of golf, maybe it's getting totally wasted, whatever, good or bad, it is what it used to be. Whereas this new dynamic, that's where I would say most of the energy exists. And there's another group which is essentially your Facebook friends or your Instagram followers or your peripheral people that if you saw them at a party, you would go and chat to them for 10 minutes, but you're not gonna invite them over, you're not gonna go on a trip with them, you're not gonna collaborate with them on a business. Those people are white noise and we are white noise to other people. And that's something that's important to know is that those people don't count in the sense that, yeah, they count as your followers or maybe they have some broad drifting network effect that you may find someone through that, but that you can't rely on those people and they can't rely on you. So what I would be looking at is, do a stock take and split your people into those three broad categories, family and tight friends, the collaborators or your new friends, and then your Facebook friends I would just be like, no, they don't count because there's nothing you can do for each other except like each other's posts, right? So if that middle bracket, is that my fingers? If that middle one is really light on, that's a problem. And I think a lot of people will realize that, that, oh, actually I have 1000 people on my Facebook, really, how many do you know? Five, really well, and the rest are just like white noise. Because the reason I bring that up is because that middle group and your tight family and friends will be the ones that you can rely on and can build stuff with. And that dynamic second group is more likely to be the ones, the guys that you go out and meet women with, the people that you build a business with, the people that you travel with, the people that you go to a new city and get involved in a new scene with, right? And these are the things that create multipliers of effect. The idea of you doing all of this by yourself is not smart, even if you can do it. I've used the assistance of, and the multiplying effect of all of the people around me and they vice versa with me all throughout my 20s, 30s, and now 40s, so that our network effect is vastly greater than we would have individually. Right, and can you talk, because obviously I hear you and I completely agree that having a good social network is like standing on the shoulders of giants, because whilst I think it's really useful and actually very affirming and good for confidence, to know how to meet people at random, and in fact, sometimes you can use those social skills of being able to approach somebody to add to that middle bracket and that network. Ultimately, what's always gonna be more impactful and more effective is people that you have that some form of shared social relationship or connection with. So could you explain to the guys that are listening some of the reasons how that can have an amazing impact on the dating area of their life? And also, I think something else I want to ask you about, which I remembered from an old conversation we had, is I think that women will have a bigger middle category, typically, than men. Because I think for women, how they approach dating and their whole dating strategy is different for men in that I think they rely a lot on the where, like where do I meet guys, rather than how do I talk to guys. And because they're very much centered on the where, cultivating a really good social circle, being invited to the right places, having enough opportunity and logistics is actually way higher up their dating priority list and is a key part of the way they. go about meeting guys. So maybe you can explain a bit around how for the average guy out there, he might be, disadvantage is a strong word, but I'm going to say a disadvantage compared to his female comparable because she's going to have more going on in that category. And then the value to him in developed category versus just being reliant on approaching. Okay, cool. So yeah, I'd say on average, that's probably true in the sense that often men bunch together in small groups of five, five to 10, but usually more, more around five. And they operate out of that group. And most men only do that once or twice or three times in their life. That group forms one or two or three times. And so, you know, it might be the high school buddies, might be the uni buddies, or it might be the guys that you work with at the office buddies or some variation. Okay. Now that's, I, and I, and you know, that's where I came from. Uh, that was fine for me when I was 19 to 25 because that group of buddies was my band, right? We played music. We weren't famous. Don't get any ideas. Um, but we were the most famous guys in the room where there was some girls, right? Like that's, that's a really important thing. We were the most famous guys in a room where there were some girls. Now, if you're, if you're that, that part of your, your group is your, there's no, there's no girls in the room, whatever the room is, then it doesn't help you with your dating life. So therefore it's, it's actually a liability. Even if they're your best buddies and you can, they're your, you can share your hopes and dreams. Your social circle is a sexual liability. Really important to note because you're spending time in it, right? So it's like, it doesn't matter if you're sure it can be really enriching in some other ways, although it might not be, it might be really bad for you in other ways as well, but it could be enriching. But what the reality is, is unless you just want to be a cold approach wolf, which is the guy that, you know, American psycho lives at home in his one bedroom apartment, goes out, does his mad game, brings a girl back to the lair, does something to her and then repeats that for the rest of his life, which I've met several guys like one, two or three guys I can think of who that worked for them, right? Like that in terms of they were loners, they had good game, uh, they made it work, right? Most of the guys and myself included got good as multiplying effects of men and women around them who were on the same path. And so what I would say is, you know, in terms of like examples, I have definitely hooked up with girls like many times because of my female friends, often as direct referrals, like literally like the girl has been told, yeah, if you want to get laid, go and bang James. And he was, he was a, he was a direct line. It was like a girl was asking a female friend about me and she said, yes, go home with him. He's a good fuck and he'll make sure you get home safe. And that was it, right? And that, that was the two metrics that, that my, my good female friend was like, this is what girls need when they want this right now. Um, and that meant that there was no, like I never, I didn't never approach that girl. I didn't ask for a number. I didn't go on six dates. She was at a party that I was at with my friend. She was recommended and the job was done for me. And I can think of dozens and dozens of experiences in my life and all the guys that I hang out with where something like that happened, right? Where, where the, the network effect meant that the, you had to work way less. Yeah. But I think it's important that you bring that up because I think guys often in terms of the balance of where they focus their skills and their training in the area of dating, I think sometimes they overestimate some areas like, you know, I've got to be the best flirt or I've got to be the most playful guy or I've got to learn how to tease or I've got to have the most amazing conversation versus actually looking at dating in terms of a bigger picture effect, which actually get this, her female friends, her immediate social circle, um, you know, the context in which she lives, her previous experiences are going to have way more waiting and way more importance to her in terms of how she navigates any situation than that one thing that you say. And it's not to say don't work on improving those skills in yourself, but also being, by being able to acknowledge, well, you know, actually have female social relationships are super important to her. That's probably actually going to be by working on developing those relationships and dare I say, yeah, female friendships are actually a good thing for guys to develop. It's not a lame thing for guys to develop. That can actually help men out way more. Of course. It's like, it's one of the questions I ask on my question, my client questionnaire with every client, you know, how many, what are your female friends? Like, do you have female friends and what's the situation? And over, over half will say they have none, right? So, and, and, and many will be like, oh yeah, the friend of my best, you know, the girlfriend of my best friend. It's like, she's not really a friend. You hang out with her when you hang out with your friend because she's there and maybe you like her and you're kind of buddies, but that's not like a friend, right? So, and you know, it's weird when I have to convince people I have to list people the benefits of having a female friend, like I'm selling them a TV. It's like she can help you get laid. You will learn, you will get to feel at ease with women in a non-pressurized environment, you know, like all that kind of stuff. Uh, what are, it's, it's, it's funny cause it's so self-evident to me. It's like, I have a bunch of female friends because I like being, I like having them as friends cause they're good people and I, and yeah, there's a whole lot of benefits that I've hung around pretty girls and all sorts of types of girls in situations where I'm not trying to pick them up and where they can talk to me honestly about their boyfriends and their issues with their love lives. And so I get to be a fly on the wall in one sense, uh, or on their side and get heaps of Intel. Uh, so you can look at it like that. Um, what was I going to say? Ask me another question. So for the guys out there who are listening to this and they're like, okay, I get the idea right now I should be doing like a stock check of my, my life, how I'm spending my time. Also stock check of my social life. If I find, and I think a lot of guys, again, when they do that stock tech take of their social life are going to find that that middle category where you have the potential to exponentially grow in your social life, which has all these awesome benefits in terms of bringing new women into your life. They make, makes dating easier. It, it develops a lot of trust with people very quickly. It helps to accelerate your growth. If the guys are coming up looking a little bit slim in that category, or perhaps that this period of time has been an inflection point where they've thought, man, I need to do something about this right now. What tools could you give them or how would they suggest that you, they would follow up with your methodology and starting to work on that? Yes, that's a good question. Cause I don't want to just leave you with, do your stock take and then cry about it. Uh, what I would say is what we can use this time for is, is rebuilding networks. Uh, and I mean, we're doing this, I'm like, I'm, I'm making an effort because especially cause I have time to get in touch with people like you, with Zan, with other like coaches and people in various fields who I haven't had time cause I've been so busy to sit down with. And you know, me and me and Zan, we've been floating around each other for years and never had a conversation. Now we have, and now we're going to meet each other. So what I would do is check in with people. And what you have to be aware of is how do you, how do you approach people that you don't know so well, right? Like they're not your closest friends that you can just go, Hey man, whatever. Um, be aware that nothing is free and that there are no, there is no, um, what's that word for love? That's, that's the one where the mothers give it to their children. They don't ask anything in return. Unconditional. The Austrian said, unconditional. Have you experienced unconditional Austrian love from your mother? Um, nothing is unconditional except probably the love of the mother to her child. I don't know, but that one looks like that's pretty, pretty tight. Um, the rest of it is always conditional. And so don't expect that because you want something or you want attention or you want to hang out or you want to go to that cool thing that someone has that they will, that they will do it for you just because, right? Like there's, our generations have very weird levels of entitlement in different areas. And some of them is, is this entitlement of like, Oh, if I want something, I'll just, I don't even actually even ask for it properly. I just expect that it's going to come. Uh, so I have a very simple framework that blows out into a very complex kind of mind map, which is the seductive economy. And, and I look at one of the ways of how do I create a bond with someone? Because if I go to a network, networking thing and go, I want to network with, you know, Joe, Jimmy Joe over there because he's higher up in that. And I go over and hand him my card and go networked. It means nothing. The, the most important thing in networking is to be likable. That's the most important thing. People have to want to spend time around you and everyone needs to be aware of that. I know that I do certain things that are very unlikable and I can be very grumpy and I can be like someone that is not fun to hang around with. And I can also be someone that is extra extraordinarily fun and interesting and, and beneficial to be around with. And I'm aware of like when I want to go and make a network, like I'm contacting a whole bunch of business contacts or people that like very, very wealthy clients, one percenters, cause I want to know what's going on. I'm like, all right, can you just give me, fill me in on what's happening on the Illuminati level of things right now? And they're like, Oh, very bad for poor people. Very good for us. Very bad for poor people. Um, anyway, but it's like whenever I make those contacts, I offer something, right? And, and even if it is, you know what the, the thing that I most often offer is listening to somebody, asking them a good clean question about themselves and listening to the answer, right? Like rather than just launching into, Hey, can you help me? Or, or going, Oh, so how are you doing? Fine. Cool. All right. Now I want this thing. So do you have any spare chicks that you could pass over? You know, like that's what I'm looking at is how do I give value in a way that makes someone feel good about themselves? And those were, and, and if you're someone who doesn't have money and riches and, and access to VIP, some things you're like, I don't have anything to offer. Yes, you do. You have your attention, you have your intelligence, you have whatever it is that you know that that person doesn't know but needs, right? And most importantly, you have curiosity and presence within that space with somebody, right? If I'm present, I'm there with the person and I'm curious about them and I'm not, and I don't obviously have some needy agenda, like where I'm just like, Oh, I'm really interested, but I really need that thing. If it's like, cool, I'm curious, I want to know about you and, uh, I'm willing to listen and feed you back what I hear you say, that is so valuable. That's why people pay therapists and coaches and all sorts of other things to have people listen to them. So that's the, I mean this, I could, you know, I could, I am actually launching an entire academy on this subject if they're in the next three weeks, but it will all be based on this, on this core central idea, which is how I operate all the time. I'm always, I'm nepotistic in the sense that I know the best way to get what you want is to make sure the people around you are getting what they want always. And knowing that they will only stick around you conditionally, right? And that goes as a boss, as a spouse, as a whatever that you know, you can't rest on your laurels too long. You can't expect people to just do shit for you for free for no reason, just because you want it, right? You realize that relationships are always reciprocal. We're just trading on all sorts of different currencies, not necessarily money. I like that you brought that up because I have to say like one of my little bugbears out there is when I get a message from someone who I don't know out of the blue being like, I'd really like your advice on either my dating life or my business. How about we meet for coffee next week? You know, I like, I'll buy you a coffee and I'm thinking, I'm like, internally I feel like, wow, but it's like, you know what? I'm about to have a baby. I've got a lot of business stuff going on. I've got a network to maintain anyway. And it's just like, I just wish, you know, maybe I just don't have that spare capacity to be able to do that on those terms. And it almost makes me feel more closed off to that as a social opportunity. You're being very polite about that. Very polite about that, Hayley. I'm a British woman. What can I say? I'm an Aussie man. So my response to that is, I had one, I had one like three days ago, a guy writes to me on Facebook and says, he says, do you think having a monotone voice has a measurable effect in seduction? And I just wrote, are you serious, dude? My business just tanked. The world has ended. And this is the time you decide to ask me a technical question on tonality. Like it's, but the thing is like that kind of attitude, uh, my lawyer's calling me. Whoa, that's interesting. He hasn't called. She hasn't called in two weeks. She just vanished. And now she's calling. Well, Teresa, you'll have to wait now, actually. You'll have to wait. But I agree. So that, I think that attitude is unattractive and unlikely to get you to where you want to be. It's it's, it's good. That's going to, that will fuck your life. That attitude. It will because any, any person that has something, knowledge, money, power, whatever that they earned, uh, and, and he's smart about it. Doesn't just give, pour it down the drain to people who didn't, who just don't even ask for it properly. Who just go like, it doesn't work like that. You have to offer something, even if it is offering like, Hey man, look, I know you're a super, you know, if when someone writes, Hey, I realized you're super busy and you may not have time for this. Uh, but if you, you know, this is a question I thought you might be interested in. And they write a question. Sometimes I'll answer that for sure. Cause I'm like, okay, they've been polite about it. And, or I might not. And then sometimes that person will then hit me up once every month or so in a polite way. And eventually I'll be like, ah, fuck it. Let's do this guy. Right? Cause it's like, that's a good way to be persistent with me. Polite, offer something. Hey man, I'm just, I'm still here. What do you think about that? You know, that's a good way to approach a mentor or someone as opposed to just rocking up and going, feed me. Right. And I like the concept that you were talking about as well, about the power and value of listening. Because I think a lot of the time, not just talking about social stuff, but in dating, again, we over S we overemphasize how do I become like this most alpha person or how do I lead or how do I talk at, or how do I amuse or how do I entertain when in fact equally important as leadership is an ability to listen and respond and make somebody else feel heard and for them to invest in the interaction. And you can't do one thing without the other. Um, so I know you mentioned your lifestyle academy for the guys that are watching this. Do you want to tell them about how they could get involved or learn more about that? Cause I know from anyone I know you are one of the people that has probably the most holistic approach to how to get better in this area of your life. I've also seen your crew and the people you get to hang out with. Uh, one day when I am slightly, uh, more svelte, I will be back and, uh, hanging out with you guys as well. So if people want to participate in that lifestyle where they know this one, the one or the 0.1% of people or they get to travel the world, or they've got this massive social circle of"}
