Today, I'm going to be interviewing my close associate, Alex Leon, and we're going to be diving deep into the agony and the ecstasy of what it means to be a digital nomad in the 21st century. Welcome. All right, so welcome, Alex. You're currently on the other side of the planet in Bali, Indonesia, so tell us what's going on today. How are you? Hey, what's up, guys? Good to be on the podcast again. It's been a while. Yeah, I'm in Bali, like you said. Life is good here. It is rain season, so it does rain a lot, but I escaped the Ukrainian-European winter and I'm trying to basically live a healthy lifestyle here, move a lot, and check out some cool landscapes. Awesome. Well, that's very modest of you. So today, I wanted to talk to you about the digital nomad lifestyle because you and I have spent years experimenting with that, and we've had lots of successes and probably some failures as well we can talk about. We understand the pros and cons of this lifestyle. So firstly, let's talk about what's happening now. So the rest of the world, more or less, is in some form of lockdown. Most people have been told or believe that they can't really even leave their suburb, let alone their country, and yet you somehow managed to get across the planet and enter into the paradise of Bali when the official word was that that wasn't possible. So can you explain a little bit about how you did that? Yeah, sure. Of course. So it's kind of, I mean, two answers, because on the one hand, I did plan to escape Europe for a long time, like basically for a year, like it was very clear in my head already 12 months ago that, okay, I don't want to do another winter in Europe. So I was already planning and scheming, and Bali was on my list. But when I checked, like last time, I think in September, I checked, is Bali a possibility? And it said no, the borders are closed, no foreigners are allowed in. But then one of my Russian model acquaintances was like, no, you just pay money and send guy passport, and he make you business visa, and you can get in. I was like, really? Sounds very easy. It's too easy to be true. And he's like, no, here's a number. I send this guy a message, and he was like, yeah, send your passport, send 5, 10 million whatever, which is 500 bucks, by the way, guys, it's not millions of dollars, 500 bucks. I'm a millionaire here, finally, I made it. So now I'm a businessman doing business here. I was a businessman doing business. Yeah, cool. And what kind of business? Business, business. Production, marketing, you know, like online, media, media. Nice. Very good. Cool. All right. Let's see how this goes. Now this kind of brings up an interesting point, because the fact that you got in, because actually myself and Shay tried to come to Bali as well, and we were two, I don't know, we put our applications in two weeks or three weeks after you did, and we missed the boat, because after some time, they did change the policy so that it wasn't possible at all. So I think this is one of the, brings up one of the, and I mean, we did know, we were just being a bit lazy, and we thought, oh, it'll be fine, but it wasn't. I think this, I think this brings up an important point about lifestyle design and the crossover with social circle and digital nomadism, that neither you or I or anyone we know that's super successful at this kind of lifestyle just did it all themselves, and we're not just relying solely on our own research or solely on our own efforts where we're collaborating. So maybe tell us a bit about, like, how is it that you even have model contacts and people who are on the ground there, like, what was the, what's been the process of you building this social network that's allowed you to have this kind of information? Yeah, totally, I mean, if I wouldn't have the network I have, firstly, Bali wouldn't even be on the list, because, you know, one of the reasons I did come here is because here is a big model and photographer scene, a lot of Russian models come here to basically spend their winter and make beautiful Instagram booty content, so that was driving me, and I am in this world now a little bit, and then I have a network that, as I mentioned, you know, gave me the contact, the business visa, or even the intel, then I have people here on the ground, you know, who researched villas already for me, like, there was one guy, he literally drove to a villa that I was considering booking, you know, and he was like, yeah, no worries, Alex, I'll check it out tomorrow, and then he actually came here, checked it out, yeah, it's cool, you can book it, you know, and he already made friends with the owners and so on, so that makes things not just easier, but, like, possible, the fact to have a network, to have intel, and you this way get the best deals, you get more insights, and you actually have an experience that is not like a tourist, right, like, if I would just come here and be like, top ten places in Bali, and then I go there, and I'm like, okay, cross that off the list, get one photo, it would be... Today's office, today's office, that kind of thing. It would not be very exciting, so yeah. That sounds, like, super glamorous, and I think probably to a lot of people sounds unattainable, and the assumption you might make is that you, Alex, were always a cool influencer guy that was, you know, part of the, yes, you, come on, you were part of the coolest crew, and then you've got these guys overseas going, yo, Alex, why don't you come over... Born with the blue badge. Born with the blue badge, I don't know what that is, that's how not cool I am. So, because, like, I think when you see, like, all of us have seen these lifestyle influences on Instagram or on YouTube or whatever, and it's the, you know, the dude with the drones and the surfing and the tats and the chicks and all the stuff that you actually do, kind of, that you do have and live now, were you always like that? I don't know the answer, but you can explain, like, how did you get from being not that to that? I have no idea, no. I mean, on the one hand, I have no idea, because it is quite crazy how insanely my life changed, but, of course, it was by design, right, like, none of this, none of the things I'm living now, none of the things that come into my life are totally random. I mean, of course, you know, what's that saying? Luck comes to the ones that are prepared, or luck, luck is when preparation meets... Luck? I think, well, probably we won't put that one on Instagram, but I think, I don't remember the phrase, but essentially, it's like luck appears when you're preparing and putting yourself in the right location. Jesus, this is not... Yeah, I think it sounds better in German. We'll put up the German logo on the screen once we figure out what this thing is. Of course, everything that's in my life now that comes to me is kind of designed, you know, it's not just lucky that, you know, oh, cool, Bali, yeah, sounds cool, I'll buy a ticket and fly, and then everything will just happen, and oh, here's a villa, okay, and I have enough money also, like, the whole journey I made from, I mean, if you ask me, have you always been like this? Absolutely not, and I'm trying to think when I was like a total nerd, I guess at like 17, 18. The day before you met us? Yes. I already made the decision at 19 to live for one year in Nicaragua, right, like I was 19 when I did that, and then obviously having the, whatever you call it, balls or courage or insanity to meet you guys and basically put my life path in that direction and be like, okay, I'm going to work for James for the next five years, because those are wacky dudes who seem to have figured out something at least, because everybody else kind of feels like they didn't figure out much, and so a lot of those things, you know, are designed, but what is interesting to me is I was inspired by the lifestyle content that certain people, you know, portray on social media, as I guess my generation is more than others, you know, like, I mean, to name, you know, Jay Alvarez, blue as water kind of thing, maybe. I was like, wow, that's amazing, you know, he's got the chick, he's got the surfboard, he's got the curls, he's got the abs, everything, cool. The more I am kind of in this world, the more I see how obviously it is quite produced, it's not just happening, you know, he didn't just hold the camera in his face for a day and then he had this amazing footage, I see how it's quite staged at times, and how every shot is like very well planned, like, it's a bit of a side tangent, but some videos of like those lifestyle dudes I have watched like 10 times, and every time I watch them, I now appreciate more the production and kind of on the flip side see how it's fake, basically, or at least not just a documentary of the life, but it's actually, yeah, manufactured, it's a production, right, so yeah. I think that's a point we'll get on to soon, which is looking at the, what are the real realities of living this type of lifestyle, because it's not all drone shots and fucking bottle parties, and in order to get there, there is work, there is discipline, there is planning, and you can also go and live in those places and kind of, you probably could produce the content, but still be having a shit time, you know, like there's plenty of people who have gone overseas and tried to set up, and they're just lonely, or they just feel like, what is the point of me actually uprooting myself from where I belong and plonking myself in the middle of nowhere, even if it is on a beautiful island with palm trees and drinking out of coconuts, like that gets old if you don't have any friends, or you've got no real kind of sense of purpose of being there, I think we'll get onto that in a moment, but one of the things that you mentioned was that you really early on started experimenting with this, so when you were 19, you went over to, was it Nicaragua? Yeah, Nicaragua. Nicaragua, Nicaragua. Nicaragua! And same for me, like four decades before that, no, two decades before that, you know, when I first finished high school, when all of my friends were going to university, and all of them went to university, and none of them knew why they were going, like there was no, they were just, it wasn't like they were like, I absolutely want to become a robotics engineer or something, they were just like, oh, if I can guess I'll go to uni, and so all of my friends went and studied, and almost all of them didn't ever end up using their degrees or work in the areas that they were in, they just didn't know what to do, so they did what they were kind of told to do, which was, you know, continue on your education path, which is like, I mean, there is quite a lot of talk in lifestyle entrepreneur circles about how college and everything is completely useless, and I don't think that's true, but it is kind of useless if you don't know why you're going and what you're trying to study. I know you, you know, you can... Forex is the only way now, forex trading is the only way. The only thing, the only way to make money is through Bitcoin and forex. So like, yeah, when I finished high school, I went and worked on an orange farm with my best friend John, one of our coaches, and we saved up a couple of grand, and then we went traveling to Bali back in 1998, I was there, yes, that's right, and then I remember us buying magic mushrooms off some street kids on the beach in Lovina, and we were arguing with them because, like I said, I'm not going to pay you until it works, and then we're sitting there and they don't work, and after an hour, I'm like, it doesn't work, and we're arguing about it, and then they said, all right, we'll give you more, so they gave us a double dose, and then we ate the second dose, and I'm still arguing, and then this guy's face melts off, and I'm like, oh, boy, handing out millions of rupees to him, and then me and John went back to our hotel room and tripped out for three days. Good times. But yeah, like, I think a good thing, if you're a young guy, and you're thinking about, like, your future in terms of, maybe one day I'd like to kind of unplug from my country or my, you know, the status quo, the standard things, and probably a lot of people think that's a very long-term goal, like, you know, maybe after 10 years of working in a normal job, I can save up and da-da-da, but I think if you want to do this lifestyle, it is actually important to do little experiments in it first, like, when I remember back to the early days of when you joined us, well, maybe you can talk about that, like, when you first met us, you reached out and offered to help originally as a cameraman, and you were in Vienna at the time, and you were a student, you had a part-time job, like, tell us about that transition of being essentially a normal student, who was also, I mean, you weren't normal, you were certainly hustling, and you were setting up your initial, like, side projects and trying to start a side business, but, you know, you were a guy living in the country that you'd been born in, what was that first transition point, how did you take those first experimental steps into this more nomadic or global lifestyle? Yeah, sure, I mean, to touch a little bit on what you first said of, you know, often people think, okay, maybe in 10, 20 years, like, whenever you think, whenever a sentence or thought starts with, in 10 years, then I will do it. It's a horrible idea because like maybe you won't like it, you know, like I can't imagine how many people had the fantasy of something and then they kind of worked towards that and then they finally had it and they're like, shit, that's not it, you know, and then like why didn't I try it for two months, 20 years ago, how it is to live, you know, on an island in Thailand. Oh, it's kind of boring, I'm kind of lonely, you know, I actually don't like sand and the sun is too hot and I hate mosquitoes, like maybe, right, like there's plenty of people who it's not for. The flip of that is that maybe you fucking love it and then you realize that you wasted 10 years waiting for it. And the other thing is like there's certain times in your life when it makes sense to do something. I'm really glad that I was a musician when I was 20 to 28, like that was the time when it made sense for me, I was creative in that sense, I didn't care if I was broke. Like all my friends were young and we were all dynamic and trying to work on it. If I decided now, you know, if I'd waited until now to try and start my music dream, that would be a bit cringe, I think, you know, there really is, there's optimal times in your life. You could do a comeback now, like now would be the time for a comeback. I think in order to have a comeback, you needed to have been famous in the first place. Yes, we can fake that, we just, oh yes, the big comeback, the big, like, we'll create a like this, right, okay, so we can photoshop in massive crowds into my old videos, right, and create a whole backstory of how I was massive in Japan back in the 90s. Make note, gentlemen, if you want to see that, put it in the comment, if you want to see our fake documentary of James' return to stardom as a funk disco musician. So alright, so the first thing is like start early, but the other thing is it's like, you don't have to commit to the lifestyle forever, you mentioned, you know, try it for two months. That's essentially what you started doing with us, right, like you didn't immediately quit everything and move to Budapest and work full-time, right, so talk about that kind of transitional testing period to start to see whether it is for you and how you could start to unplug from one place and move into another place. Yeah, totally, and you're 100% right, like for everybody watching this who is quite young, it's such an amazing time, like between 18 and whatever, 24, it's such a perfect time to just do things that might not work at all, you know, that might be a waste of time, that, you know, don't have a clear outcome. It's such a beautiful time because you're in this in-between of, you know, okay, I did my duty as a school kid or, you know, what the years I have to do and okay, soon I will be totally on my own because maybe my parents don't fund me anymore or I have other bigger responsibilities and I have to start paying taxes. Like this in-between phase is such a great time to experiment because the upside is huge, you know, and I will talk about that and the downside is very minimal, you know, the worst case, you know, if you start a little business or if you, you know, try to hustle something is you lose all your money which is, what, two grand and then you live with your parents for a while and you get a normal job for six months and then you can try again. So, yeah, what I did, I mean, basically, I was studying in Vienna which was full-time so I did have to, you know, attend classes 30, 40 hours a week. But there is still a lot of time from like Friday to Sunday, so basically, working for you in the beginning was basically I had to make the decision, okay, do I want to party all weekend like everybody else did, you know, because obviously there is sacrifices or do I take a train to Budapest every weekend and just explore that, you know, because what was important for me back then I was in a phase where I'm like, okay, I'm quite introverted, I'm quite nerdy, right, I'm a bit of a dork and I see how that's not good and how that is kind of a thing that will hold me back forever if I don't kind of attack that, you know, like I had a lot of other good things going for me and it was quite obvious that the seduction slash communication slash being able to be a little more outgoing part is going to make the biggest difference in my future, you know, like doubling down on math skills or logical skills or being extra good at organization, you know, wouldn't have yielded the results. So I was quite for some reason, I guess because of Nicaragua I kind of knew that, right, because I made little experiments there being extra at it and it paid off. So I had that focus and then I was like, okay, how can I make it happen, okay, I'm just going to drive to Budapest on the weekends, work for you, right, and then exchange getting coaching and just being around you guys, you know, is the reward and that's how it started, you know, so it was basically every weekend or every second weekend we just talked, filmed a bunch of YouTube videos. Yeah, which was like it really was thinking outside the box because as you said, like I mean most, who else in your, of your contemporaries except for Dom who was, who also was a maverick thinker and went off to become very successful, it just wasn't even in the conscious like idea or zeitgeist of every other student, right, they wouldn't think like, oh, maybe I'll reach out to a person that, like a potential mentor, someone that I'm interested in meeting, offer them to intern for them and then travel between countries every week and it's, you know, it's a three-hour train ride so it's not, you know, it's not flying across the planet but for most people they wouldn't even consider that like and that outside the box thinking and having the audacity and the humility like which is a good mix, like the audacity to reach out and the humility to offer yourself like, okay, you know, I'm willing to work for free initially or, you know, for coaching and to, to do what's needed and we, you know, we certainly worked you fucking hard in those early days, there was many filming till five in the morning, you were running on very little sleep very often, like you were really pushing yourself but that's, that's part of the advantage of being young and strong is that you can, you can do that, you can burn yourself harder and you, you managed to live in a, in a sense two, two lives at once, you had the, you had the one where you were a student back in Vienna half the week and then you were the one, you were, you were hanging out with this weird crew of pickup artists and doing crazy documentaries the rest of the time. That's a, that's an important one in, in terms of like reaching out to others because I think since, since the four-hour work week came out, right, that I think that's probably when the modern idea of the, of the lifestyle entrepreneur existed. Before that, the, the kind of archetype which I was inspired by, which made me hit the road and travel was more the vagabonding poet, artist, spiritual seeker, which, which I was inspired by a generation of the beat generation, the hippies and those, like my parents' generation who went wandering around India and Asia back when that was still like, like kind of a off-the-beaten-track kind of thing. Um, so I didn't, I wasn't, when I was first traveling, I had no sense of, I wasn't interested trying to start a business or particularly network. I was trying to explore my spirituality and see beautiful places and go, go to places that most people didn't go. But since Tim Ferriss' book came out, I would say there's this, there's the, there is this archetype that's, that exists now of, of the, the, the traveler who leverages currencies, who works remotely, who earns hopefully Western money and then is able to get a better lifestyle in a place which is cheaper and so on. But which is a cool archetype and it's, and it has inspired a whole generation. But the thing that I noticed when reading that, uh, and from then being one of those people and hanging out with a lot of those people is the thing that's missing there is the people skills. It's, it's like, it's the, cause the, the Four Hour Workweek gives you the idea that you do all of that yourself. Like everything is done. It's all completely individualist. You're not collaborating. You're, you're just like, okay, I'm going to set up my business where I just go do that for 10 minutes a day and then it makes money and then I'm going to go and get a tango lesson that I'm going to. So it's, it is hyper individualist, but you didn't do it that way and neither did I really. Um, like why did, why, why did you bother reaching out and trying to get involved in a team as opposed to, you know, trying to do it all yourself? I just knew that I couldn't even figure it out myself. Like no chance. Like I, especially in terms of like seduction and skills with women and, and becoming a better communicator in that regard, I wouldn't have even have known where to start, you know, like I did my little attempts, uh, talking to girls on the street in Vienna and it was rough and kind of depressing. Um, so I knew instantly, okay, what am I gonna, you know, desperately try myself for 10 years or am I going to contact somebody who did it for the last 20 years and teaches it to other people? And there's obviously one of the top people in the world that did, uh, yeah, of course, you know, and then the flip side of that is, okay, why would that person care about me? Um, where, you know, I had to figure out a way to, as you say, be humble in a way to offer myself and, and, uh, you know, with things like every five hours of my time is one hour of your time, which was a pretty good deal actually back then. You wouldn't give that deal to anybody now, I guess. No, no one's getting five to one now, guys. Sorry. Yeah, no, I don't even try. So, you know, I must have hit some sweet spot in your career, I guess, as well, where it was just the right time where my skills came, uh, of use. So yeah, I just didn't, I was very clear. I couldn't figure it out myself basically, you know, um, and I'm, I was always very conscious of my time, even when I was young, you know, I always had the attitude of, you know, every day is valuable. Uh, so yeah, it was quite obvious. Yeah. So this, this brings up a part of the seductive economy framework, which, which I teach in the Lifestyle Design Academy, which is looking at the, the trade of non-financial currencies with, with, uh, people that you wish to collaborate with. And when you're starting out in life or you're, or you're trying to break into a new social scene or into a new business or whatever, um, yeah, it is, it is often extremely difficult to do it all yourself. And as you said, it's like, it's, I mean, why bother trying to do it all yourself when you can leapfrog on, on top of, or collaborate with people who have either taken some of the journey for you or, or who have specific skills that you don't have. And uh, the fact that you offered something that was valuable to me at that time, uh, is the reason, right? It's, it's the reason that, that I, I, I welcomed you on board because I, and I'm not trying to say that I'm, you know, the most important person, but it's like, okay, there's a lot of people interested in working with me or hanging out with me because of my skills and because of my hair. Um, and I, I have to like, sponsored by Notteby, that I have to like, I have to say no or ignore most requests because I can't, I can't deal with everybody. And the people that are going to get through with me and I, and this means with anyone, it's like people that are going to get through to have a chance to join a high value social circle or some kind of dynamic workplace, uh, the people that offer solutions to a problem that, that the boss has, for example, or who make their life easier. And that was something that was evident with you pretty much straight away was that you, you understood that you had to like provide a whole bunch of value and you went well beyond what I even requested, uh, so that it, in a way, There's a side note to, to anybody watching, sorry to interrupt you, but I don't want to, it's like you, because you said it was imminent straight away that I would help you or that I would deliver fine. And that's because you have to like for anybody watching, if you don't, uh, convince or impress the person you're trying to pitch on your first attempt, you, you lost, you know, like if I would have fucked up that first photo shoot, why would you give me a second chance? Like no chance, right? Like if that would have been a waste of your day, then I should fuck off basically. Like, um, and it's, it, it almost, yeah, it's, it's super important for anybody who's watching. Like there's no second chances if you're in that phase of your life because the people you're trying to connect with their time is, and it sounds, you know, crazy, but I get it now. Their time is just 20, 30, 50 times more important in that regard right now, you know, on a, on a financial basis. It's just how it is. Right. Um, yeah, it's not that, not that, not that means that you're a more important human. Yeah, exactly. So that's just on a side note. And, uh, I get it now because, you know, I hire people now I give people a chance and I made the experience also that if person, like the way people act in the first hour or on their first task is usually how they're going to act the whole time. Yes. That's something that's, that we've painfully figured out over many years is that people tend to do what they always do. But, uh, I think you've, you've become, you've become a bit cynical about that of like, uh, I don't think people change. Yeah. People, people, yeah, like it's like, okay, people make mistakes and people have strengths and weaknesses, but typically people follow the same pattern that they have always followed unless they like move heaven and earth to change their habits or they come in and, you know, do hardcore coaching or, or life, maybe life really changes things for them because they suddenly have a baby or they put in a wheelchair or something. But yeah, that's."}
