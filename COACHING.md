# What we want to accomplish in a coaching session

1. Make them want to come back - everything is in service to this
2. Build investment on the side of the client, they should feel like they've put energy in here and want to come back
3. Create credibility so that the client comes back (they likely will strike out with current girl)
4. Feel like they received immediate actionable feedback but it gets better the more they work with us
5. Have clear next steps both on the immediate issue as well as their overall learning
6. Get the sense that there is a lot they can learn, a bigger world of learning than they expected


## How we accomplish these goals

### Notes from Robbie 
1. *Understanding Client's Skill Level and Challenges:*
   - The coach begins by assessing the client's skill level with male-female dynamics.
   - He categorizes clients into archetypes (e.g., total beginner, too much pickup study, new age beliefs).
   - The goal is to understand the client's challenges and goals.

2. *Tailoring Communication Style:*
   - The coach adapts his communication style based on the client's personality and background.
   - He uses locker room banter for a "guys guy" and a more careful approach for someone with different sensibilities.
   - Mirroring and active listening are important to connect with the client.

3. *Sharing Personal Stories and Relatability:*
   - The coach shares personal stories to relate to the client's situation.
   - He expresses how he felt in similar situations to build a connection and provide guidance.

4. *Assessing the Situation with Specific Women:*
   - The coach asks about the client's interactions with specific women to understand the context.
   - Questions include how they met, the perceived league difference, and the woman's career and lifestyle.
   - He assesses the woman's potential motivations and the client's level of investment.

5. *Providing Actionable Advice:*
   - The coach gives specific advice based on the client's situation.
   - He balances immediate problem-solving with long-term guidance.
   - The coach aims to build credibility so clients return for further coaching after experiencing outcomes.

6. *Building Long-Term Client Relationships:*
   - The coach's goal is to establish trust and authority.
   - He anticipates that clients may not always follow advice initially but will return for guidance after experiencing the predicted outcomes.

7. *Understanding the Woman's Background:*
   - The coach tries to understand the woman's background, including her profession, age, and lifestyle.
   - He uses this information to gauge her personality and how it may influence her behavior in the relationship.

8. *Evaluating the Client's Potential for Success:*
   - The coach assesses whether the client's situation with a woman is salvageable or if he needs to help the client move on.
   - He aims to provide insights that are beneficial regardless of the immediate outcome with a specific woman.

In summary, the chatbot should be designed to:
- Assess the client's experience and adapt communication accordingly.
- Share relatable stories or scenarios to build rapport.
- Ask targeted questions to understand the client's situation with women.
- Provide tailored advice that considers the client's and the woman's backgrounds.
- Focus on building credibility for long-term coaching relationships.
- Help clients evaluate their situations realistically and prepare them for various outcomes.
